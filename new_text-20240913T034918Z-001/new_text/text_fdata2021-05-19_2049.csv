tfsa stocks like alimentation couche tard tsx atd a tsx atd b should be on your watch list for 2021 the stock market hit an all time high earlier this year since then the excitement has waned and several growth stocks have declined precipitously meanwhile the economy is reopening and certain sectors of the economy are expecting an explosion of pent up demand with that in mind your tax free savings account tfsa should probably be diverted to stocks that are likely to rebound strongly or be overlooked by other investors here are my top three picks for may 2021 tfsa stock 1 topicus tsx toi has already received some coverage from my fool colleagues unsurprisingly the stock surged higher along with the rest of the tech market from february to april the stock gained 40 in value since then the tech market has tumbled but topicus has retained its gain it s currently trading at 88 just 6 4 off its all time high that s because investors recognize the company s intrinsic value topicus delivered 494 0 million ca 727 million in revenue over the course of 2020 net income was reported at 63 7 million ca 94 million over the same period net income grew by 37 last year so you can assume it may grow by roughly 30 this year that means the current stock price is trading at a forward price to earnings ratio of 28 4 in short topicus is undervalued and is probably one of the best tfsa stocks you can buy right now tfsa stock 2 leon s furniture tsx lnf is yet another overlooked tfsa stock while growth investors were focused on tech stocks and value investors were focused on energy stocks traditional retailers like leon s have fallen under the radar nevertheless the stock is up 67 over the past year and is still trading at a price to earnings ratio of just 9 4 the stock also offers a lucrative 2 9 dividend yield the pandemic has convinced families and homebuyers to seek out more space larger homes and a record high household savings rate could act as a tailwind for furniture retailers like leon s that makes it an undervalued economic rebound play and the perfect tfsa stock for 2021 tfsa stock 3 alimentation couche tard tsx atd a tsx atd b is yet another rebound play couche tard s convenience stores across north america may have already seen a surge in foot traffic domestic travel in the u s has quickly rebounded to pre pandemic levels meanwhile parts of europe and asia are opening up too more travel means more fuel consumption which should trickle down to couche tard s bottom line meanwhile the company has managed to sustain sales and gross margins on its convenience store items however none of that has been priced into the stock yet in fact the stock is trading at the same level it was before the pandemic erupted it trades at just 15 times earnings and the dividend payout ratio is under 10 which makes it an attractively undervalued tfsa stock for 2021 bottom line if you expect an economic rebound in 2021 some of the undervalued tfsa stocks on this list should be on your watchlist
austin is clearly the current darling of the tech industry but it s going to take more than charm vibe and inherent popularity to fulfill the city s potential as a true global tech hub even before name brand tech companies and their superstar executives set their sights on the live music capital of the world with 150 people were moving here every day a trend that has been remarkably consistent over the past decade according to the latest census figures now with the pandemic shifting renewed attention to warm climates outdoor space and room to properly socially distance austin is on track to crack the top 10 most populous cities in the u s within a year s time as new residents contribute to a rapidly growing tax base austin has a profound opportunity to make more of the larger investments needed to support continued growth massive housing demand infrastructure pressure and public transportation are just a few of the areas the city will need to address in a definitive manner if austin is to continue to attract large scale projects and corporate expansions existing well located buildings will also need to be brought up to all new market standards that s easier said than done considering the natural growing pains associated with transitioning from quirky dusty real estate to silicon hills level sophistication from beloved town to global superstar today the physical landscape of silicon hills is proof positive of the massive yet disproportionate changes underway many of austin s older office buildings are only partially occupied yet futuristic new towers are springing up everywhere at previously unheard of scale in what is still a mid sized city austin s first 700 foot towers are now being planned tesla s 1 billion factory under construction in travis county bae systems 150 million austin expansion and the fact that samsung is reportedly considering our fair city as the prospective home to its new 17 billion semiconductor plant are all further evidence of the rapid pace of change here meanwhile multiple reports show record sales in the housing market as well as dangerously low inventory levels and the relative dearth of local suburbs atx has three or four compared with chicago s 60 has prompted major new to town corporations to create their own mixed use campus neighborhoods from apple s billion dollar investment in the northwest to oracle s 40 acre campus just south of downtown austin this in turn has triggered unprecedented levels of residential development almost every lot or outmoded building is fair play and likely is or will be considered as a multifamily mixed use or condominium project in an effort to keep pace yet while these new projects are beyond sophisticated in design many of the existing office and mixed use buildings surrounding them have a decidedly 80s vibe and are badly in need of updating or replacement with the high demand being exerted on all real estate sectors in the austin market it is only a matter of time before even these badly dated albatrosses are brought up to spec but for all of this private investment in real estate in austin there must be a commensurate public sector investment in order to keep pace and to maintain a sense of balance becoming better neighbors and more successful landlords the good news is the city is actively working through new development and infrastructure investment opportunities but it s going to take time for some of these larger projects to take seed let alone bear fruit the city s codenext initiative for example aims to improve transportation and household affordability but it will take several years for the code to come to life physically through design permitting and building and the major transportation bond recently passed to expand train service will take 20 years to build out and it is merely a start highways and major thoroughfares are also being expanded and improved but many argue that these efforts are just not enough to match austin s prodigious rate of growth in the meantime business and community leaders can help austin play the part of a global tech hub by helping existing buildings look the part for inspiration on how to bring older structures a major facelift as part of more inclusive live work play communities consider river park a massive mixed use development underway in southeast austin there the developer is bringing 400 affordable units as well as 10 million square feet of offices shops hotels parks and homes including the redevelopment of many existing residential structures into modern more luxurious class a stock complete with a beautiful walking trail along the river 30 acres of park space and miles of bike trails the development will be integrated into the fabric of the city and eventually be served by austin s new light rail system river east will be a veritable checklist of perks for techies and other modern tenants and will be a truly transformative project that will forever change the complexion of the city south of the river other institutional leaders can borrow from this example with trusted partners an effective repositioning team comprises not only visionary architects to revitalize antiquated buildings but also expert project managers who understand market considerations for example will a simple refresh to the lobby and the addition of amenities achieve project goals or is it time for a full blown rebuilding project these are pivotal questions that must be asked and carefully assessed creating a growth friendly community austin is changing irrevocably one soaring new tower at a time yet just as every good building depends on a solid foundation so does the larger community austin is at an inflection point between mid sized city and world class tech hub those in the development community need to do their part to provide firmer footing to the entire city s growth trajectory touting austin s business friendly credentials was just the beginning by proactively investing in new infrastructure enabling our existing buildings to better play the part and thinking through the complexities of new development we can genuinely walk the walk on the path toward becoming the world s next great tech hub ross anders is vice president and general manager austin for project management advisors inc a national real estate advisory firm providing consulting services

t he u s corporate media usually report on israeli military assaults in occupied palestine as if the united states is an innocent neutral party to the conflict in fact large majorities of americans have told pollsters for decades that they want the united states to be neutral in the israeli palestinian conflict but u s media and politicians betray their own lack of neutrality by blaming palestinians for nearly all the violence and framing flagrantly disproportionate indiscriminate and therefore illegal israeli attacks as a justifiable response to palestinian actions the classic formulation from u s officials and commentators is that israel has the right to defend itself never palestinians have the right to defend themselves even as the israelis massacre hundreds of palestinian civilians destroy thousands of palestinian homes and seize ever more palestinian land the disparity in casualties in israeli assaults on gaza speaks for itself as with the saudi led war on yemen and other serious foreign policy problems biased and distorted news coverage by u s corporate media leaves many americans not knowing what to think many simply give up trying to sort out the rights and wrongs of what is happening and instead blame both sides and then focus their attention closer to home where the problems of society impact them more directly and are easier to understand and do something about behind the fog of war propaganda and commercialized biased media coverage the united states bears an overwhelming share of responsibility for the carnage taking place in palestine so how should americans respond to horrific images of bleeding dying children and homes reduced to rubble in gaza the tragic relevance of this crisis for americans is that behind the fog of war propaganda and commercialized biased media coverage the united states bears an overwhelming share of responsibility for the carnage taking place in palestine u s policy has perpetuated the crisis and atrocities of the israeli occupation by unconditionally supporting israel in three distinct ways militarily diplomatically and politically on the military front since the creation of the israeli state the united states has provided 146 billion in foreign aid nearly all of it military related it currently provides 3 8 billion per year in military aid to israel in addition the united states is the largest seller of weapons to israel whose military arsenal now includes 362 u s built f 16 warplanes and 100 other u s military aircraft including a growing fleet of the new f 35s at least 45 apache attack helicopters 600m 109 howitzers and 64 m270 rocket launchers at this very moment israel is using many of these u s supplied weapons in its devastating bombardment of gaza the u s military alliance with israel also involves joint military exercises and joint production of arrow missiles and other weapons systems the u s and israeli militaries have collaborated on drone technologies tested by the israelis in gaza in 2004 the united states called on israeli forces with experience in the occupied territories to give tactical training to u s special operations forces as they confronted popular resistance to the united states hostile military occupation of iraq the u s military also maintains a 1 8 billion stockpile of weapons at six locations in israel pre positioned for use in future u s wars in the middle east during the israeli assault on gaza in 2014 even as the u s congress suspended some weapons deliveries to israel it approved handing over stocks of 120mm mortar shells and 40mm grenade launcher ammunition from the u s stockpile for israel to use against palestinians in gaza diplomatically the united states has exercised its veto in the un security council 82 times and 44 of those vetoes have been to shield israel from accountability for war crimes or human rights violations in every single case the united states has been the lone vote against the resolution although a few other countries have occasionally abstained it is only the united states privileged position as a veto wielding permanent member of the security council and its willingness to abuse that privilege to shield its ally israel that gives it this unique power to stymie international efforts to hold the israeli government accountable for its actions under international law the result of this unconditional u s diplomatic shielding of israel has been to encourage increasingly barbaric israeli treatment of the palestinians with the united states blocking any accountability in the security council israel has seized ever more palestinian land in the west bank and east jerusalem uprooted more and more palestinians from their homes and responded to the resistance of largely unarmed people with ever increasing violence detentions and restrictions on day to day life thirdly on the political front despite most americans supporting neutrality in the conflict aipac and other pro israel lobbying groups have exercised an extraordinary role in bribing and intimidating u s politicians to provide unconditional support for israel the roles of campaign contributors and lobbyists in the corrupt u s political system make the united states uniquely vulnerable to this kind of influence peddling and intimidation whether it is by monopolistic corporations and industry groups like the military industrial complex and big pharma or well funded interest groups like the nra aipac and in recent years lobbyists for saudi arabia and the united arab emirates u s leaders and politicians must now confront their country s and in many cases their own personal complicity in this catastrophe and act urgently and decisively to reverse u s policy to support full human rights for all palestinians on april 22 just weeks before this latest assault on gaza the overwhelming majority of congresspeople 330 out of 435 signed a letter to the chair and ranking member of the house appropriations committee opposing any reduction or conditioning of us monies to israel the letter represented a show of force from aipac and a repudiation of calls from some progressives in the democratic party to condition or otherwise restrict aid to israel president joe biden who has a long history of supporting israeli crimes responded to the latest massacre by insisting on israel s right to defend itself and inanely hoping that this will be closing down sooner than later his un ambassador also shamefully blocked a call for a ceasefire at the un security council the silence and worse from president biden and most of our representatives in congress at the massacre of civilians and mass destruction of gaza is unconscionable the independent voices speaking out forcefully for palestinians including senator sanders and representatives tlaib omar and ocasio cortez show us what real democracy looks like as do the massive protests that have filled u s streets all over the country us policy must be reversed to reflect international law and the shifting us opinion in favor of palestinian rights every member of congress must be pushed to sign the bill introduced by rep betty mccollum insisting that us funds to israel are not used to support the military detention of palestinian children the unlawful seizure appropriation and destruction of palestinian property and forcible transfer of civilians in the west bank or further annexation of palestinian land in violation of international law congress must also be pressured to quickly enforce the arms export control act and the leahy laws to stop supplying any more u s weapons to israel until it stops using them to attack and kill civilians the united states has played a vital and instrumental role in the decades long catastrophe that has engulfed the people of palestine u s leaders and politicians must now confront their country s and in many cases their own personal complicity in this catastrophe and act urgently and decisively to reverse u s policy to support full human rights for all palestinians

following a revised 19 8 surge in march while building permits ticked up 0 3 in april following a revised 1 7 climb a month earlier on a seasonally adjusted annual basis there were 1 569 million starts in april down from a revised 1 733 million in march permits totaled 1 760 million in april and a revised 1 755 million in april economists polled by ifr markets expected 1 710 million starts and 1 770 million permits rising materials prices lack of land and labor shortages are holding back builders during what is usually the busiest home buying season according to yelena maleyev economist at grant thornton year over year though starts are up 67 3 and permits have increased 60 9 supply chain constraints are exacerbating shortages of homes available for sale she said the silver lining is that lumber prices may have peaked in early may and begun to come down but prices still have a long way to go before reaching pre pandemic levels despite the problems currently facing the housing market maleyev noted that demand remains strong as the peak season for home buyers approaches lack of homes for sale in the most in demand markets is pricing out some buyers she said we could see that ease up by the end of the year as prices start to come down from recent peaks mark vitner senior economist at wells fargo securities noted that weather was also a factor in the latest month particularly in the south despite this past month s declines demand for housing and single family homes in particular remains white hot he said this is particularly true in the south which showed uncharacteristic weakness during the month as the weather was a little wetter than usual this spring throughout much of the south and with lumber labor and appliances in short supply many builders appear to have hit the pause button this past month he also sees supply catching up with demand as the year progresses the backlog of not yet started single family homes has risen 26 since the end of the last year which should provide strong momentum to home building later this year as supply catches up with demand vitner said also the new york region s service sector business activity grew at a

as the country reopens and the economy is recovering in the wake of a historic pandemic fox s purported straight news personalities are jumping on reports of inflation attempting to advance a series of talking points to depict a chronic economic disaster a conclusion that is far too soon to draw as experts largely believe the effect is a temporary step in the recovery itself eric levitz of new york magazine explained that most of the price increases came from either from reopening sectors or from temporary supply constraints in the used car market now that more americans have been vaccinated these sectors have been caught between surging demand and inadequate supply as it will take some additional time to rebuild already there may be signs of the inflation abating as futures prices on lumber are falling from a peak and while the consumer price index rose in april by 4 2 from a year earlier cnbc s jeff cox explained one big reason for the acceleration was base effects at this time a year ago the economy was hit with the worst of the covid pandemic and inflation was unusually low year over year comparisons are going to be distorted for a few months because of the pandemic s impact bloomberg reported over the weekend that the white house is monitoring the situation and top advisers detect a growing political challenge from the spike in inflation even as they see little immediate peril to the economy from price increases that officials expect will last through the rest of the year as for that political controversy fox s hyping of inflation is also a lot like its coverage of the colonial fuel pipeline shutdown in which it attempted to depict a single regional event as an overarching national crisis even after the pipeline was restarted and gas station service was gradually returning to normal the network is now trying to tie the two themes together

it was a simple message scrawled into a basalt rock lying near empty cans of beans and jugs of water that volunteers had left deep in the sonoran desert for undocumented immigrants passing through gracias but to mikal jakubal who as a volunteer with the ajo samaritans had been making weekly trips into the backcountry to stock water drop locations the note was affirmation that the group s efforts were appreciated for the most part we will never hear from the people who use this jakubal said we don t know what it was like getting to this point we don t know what is after this but you have this one little connection across massively different life experiences they found some water and you found a thank you note mark diekmann a volunteer with people helping people in the border zone in arivaca located 11 miles north of the u s mexico border said those moments make his work worthwhile every time you give somebody water they appreciate it every time you give somebody warm clothes diekmann said every time you give them a warm place to be and they know for the moment that they re going to be ok two decades ago when the u s border patrol began to focus on more populated areas in california and texas and general enforcement increased across the southern border migrants began venturing into more remote areas to cross the u s mexico border undetected since then local humanitarian aid groups in southern arizona such as the ajo samaritans and people helping people in arivaca have been working with a core mission to mitigate suffering and death in the harsh desert wilderness of the arizona borderlands even so the bodies of 227 undocumented border crossers were found in the arizona desert in 2020 a record dr gregory hess chief medical examiner with the pima county office of the medical examiner attributes the increase to last year s hot dry summer when i started here in the late 2000s i don t think anybody would have dreamed that we d still be seeing these types of numbers now hess said and absent meaningful efforts to address the factors that drive people to risk their lives crossing miles of unforgiving desert the problem will continue hess and other experts say it is an issue driven by global factors although most of the migrants come from latin american countries people from asia africa and the middle east are represented among those crossing the border you can t even describe what we are doing as a band aid on a gushing wound jakubal said he said a long history of u s policies in latin america have contributed to the reasons migrants are risking their lives to trek for days through harsh terrain in hopes of finding better lives in the u s in other words jakubal said what s going on at the border now is like a symptom on top of a symptom on top of a symptom of the deeper problem a shift in policy doug ruopp a veteran volunteer with the migrant aid group humane borders remembers a time before people started to die at striking rates in the sonoran desert he moved to tucson from new england in the late 1990s to become a bilingual teacher back then the border crossings he heard about were different as a teacher his students talked about family members from mexico planning a weekend visit then one of the kids would say oh no he didn t come this weekend they fixed the fence in that spot so he couldn t get through ruopp said that was 20 years ago he said we hadn t become a military industrial complex along the border yet multiple federal immigration policies were implemented in the mid 90s through a strategy known as prevention through deterrence which redirected migrants to routes in more remote and dangerous parts of the border by concentrating enforcement resources in urban areas with traditional routes disrupted a 1994 border patrol report predicted migrants would be forced over more hostile terrain less suited for crossing and more suited for enforcement it described the terrain as one that could place migrants in mortal danger operation hold the line in 1993 a border patrol strategy that sent agents and enforcement technology to the border between el paso texas and juarez mexico was an immediate success according to customs and border protection s website apprehensions of people who were crossing the border dropped by more than 70 in the el paso corridor according to an office of inspector general report the next year the government enacted a nearly identical policy operation gatekeeper in san diego with similar results both were initiated under former president bill clinton s administration but border crossings did not stop they merely shifted migrants carved routes through expanses of wilderness where they were exposed to extreme temperatures and dangerous terrain thousands of people have died in the process the number of deaths is like a major plane crash happening every year in the same area said mike kreyche who maintains the death mapping initiative for humane borders one airplane crash in an area is traumatic but here it s happening on a regular basis he said after decades of this reality he said the group maps these deaths to get the public to realize just how many people are dying on the border sometimes he said it doesn t feel like there is an end in sight identifying the dead in the 1990s said hess the pima county medical examiner only a handful of remains of people they identified as undocumented border crossers were recovered each year all of the sudden in the year 2000 it went from less than 20 to in the 70s he said in 2002 that number jumped to nearly 150 remains recovered and then it hasn t stopped in 2020 with some of the hottest driest months on record the remains of 227 people were recovered in the arizona borderlands setting a record for remains recovered in a single year according to data compiled by humane borders the found remains of border crossers who die in southern arizona end up at the pima county office of the medical examiner a small red brick building in tucson the office serves as medical examiner for the three counties that make up the border patrol s tucson sector hess said so they all come here staff then work to figure out who the person was and what happened to him or her in the past 21 years since the office has been keeping track of these types of deaths about 65 of the bodies have been identified hess said but the odds of doing it in a timely manner are based on the condition of the remains facial features tattoos scars fingerprints and evidence of surgical procedures for example help examiners piece together a more detailed story of the deceased but as time and the harsh elements render remains into sun bleached bones those clues start to dry up sometimes phones photos ids and other personal property provide clues as to who the person may have been hess said items found along with remains that have yet to be identified now hang in sleeves inside an old gym locker in the medical examiner s office among them a face mask a stash of iraqi dinar and a wallet size image of a child but examiners can t identify someone based on those items alone so they work with nongovernmental organizations and foreign consulates to contact probable family members and make identifications based on dna matches one such organization the colibrí center for human rights which started in 2006 with a small volunteer initiative inside the pima county medical examiner s office has received thousands of missing persons reports and helped identify more than 200 people who died crossing the desert it s a lengthy expensive process said tony banegas the center s executive director the process of analyzing dna samples takes about 12 weeks and costs roughly 2 000 per analysis he said but more than anything it s emotional family members are left searching for closure for those who have disappeared what hurts the most is not knowing not knowing if their loved one is alive or dead somewhere under a tree or in a canyon out in the arizona desert banegas said it s a question thousands of families still have not answered he said the colibrí center so far has more than 3 000 unsolved missing persons cases in its database although it s clear to banegas who has been working to address this issue for nearly two decades first as the honorary consul for honduras and now with the colibrí center that the way to create real change is to address the root causes of migration he called the missing persons and unidentified remains act of 2019 a step in the right direction it is set to open up funding and resources for the colibrí center and other groups that work on the front lines to track and address the high rate of death and suffering on the border i hear a lot of people saying i had no idea that many people are dying banegas said i don t want to hear that anymore continuing a culture of humanitarianism for people living along the border it s a difficult reality to ignore when we say how would you feel if in a park in your community somebody came across a dead body what would you do people are kind of horrified said mimi phillips who lives in ajo an unincorporated community about 40 miles north of the border we come across 15 to 25 bodies every month that have been reduced to bones to skeletons and those are just the ones that are found when phillips moved there nearly two decades ago ajo was a far cry from the vibrant copper mining center it once was remnants of that bygone era a mile wide pit as deep as the empire state building and a 1914 plaza featuring spanish colonial style architecture were still there but after the mines closed in the 1980s phillips said ajo was kind of going to ruin she arrived as part of an effort to revitalize the community through a job with the international sonoran desert alliance a tri cultural community development organization that was working to reenergize ajo soulfully and economically phillips said but as ajo looked forward to rebirth death was occurring in its backyard the millions of acres of desert that straddle the border humanitarian aid has long been ingrained in the fabric of ajo phillips said it was always just something people did when someone came to your door you gave them food and water or if they came to your door and their feet were blistered you helped them she said but as migrant deaths and disappearances increased in the early 2000s ajo residents got more organized in their humanitarian response beginning regular water drops in the desert and attending meetings with the tucson samaritans group which patrols the desert and leaves supplies to aid migrants with that group s support the ajo samaritans were formed in 2012 at the time border patrol presence in the area was limited about 25 agents patrolled more than 7 000 square miles of land around ajo but that changed quickly in 2012 the border patrol opened a new 52 900 square foot facility in why a small town about 12 miles southeast of ajo that provided workspace for hundreds of additional agents the next year the federal government spent 13 million to build housing in ajo meant to attract customs and border protection personnel with that influx in border patrol personnel and infrastructure in the area phillips said humanitarian aid work became a very fearful thing and those fears were exacerbated by interactions with border patrol including the prosecutions of volunteers with the aid group no more deaths and the routine destruction of water jugs and other supplies left for people crossing through the desert four no more deaths volunteers were convicted in january 2019 for leaving food and water for undocumented migrants in a restricted area but their convictions were overturned in 2020 in november 2019 ajo resident and no more deaths volunteer scott warren was acquitted by a federal jury of charges that he illegally aided two undocumented migrants it was his second trial the first had ended in a hung jury to humanitarian aid groups the government s actions send a clear message what we were doing to save lives was considered littering phillips said but the reality is what is litter are they the water bottles or the people who died today many of those anxieties and tensions remain but so does the volunteers commitment to their work at least once a week a core group of volunteers with the ajo samaritans load up trucks with crates full of gallon water bottles and cans of beans and drive out into the desert then they hike to one of their established water drops every observation along the way a ravine with shade a zip up hoodie draped over a paloverde tree a station where all the beans are gone and another where they re untouched is collected as intel the group uses to constantly reevaluate how to maximize its impact everything is documented in extensive log books shared with affiliates who do the same work and share a core set of principles the whole process is like piecing together a little bit of a puzzle said cheryl opalski a part time ajo resident and ajo samaritans volunteer as she knelt over a wooden crate that protects the water jugs from animals and the elements to count how many had been left compared with their last visit i know there is less water and a lot less beans that were here a week and a half ago so that tells me somebody had been through and needed some stuff opalski said the group hiked out to two more stations before heading back to their trucks along the way opalski picked up an empty jug that had her handwriting on it and she tucked it in her backpack at the day s final station as the group gathered around for a lunch break she brought out a marker to write messages of hope on the fresh water jugs buena suerte which means good luck and vaya con dios which means go with god desperation in what s left behind southeast of ajo and 11 miles north of the border is another unincorporated community arivaca it s the third point in what several desert aid volunteers referred to as the ajo arivaca tucson triangle a network of aid organizations supported by larger organizations in tucson tiny arivaca boasts a library a post office a small cantina two gas pumps and fewer than a thousand residents but what it lacks in infrastructure and population it makes up for with a rich cultural history the area long has been home to a wide variety of people from miners and ranchers to hippies and retirees it s not uncommon to find ranchers humanitarian workers and retirees sitting together around the bar in la gitana said mark diekmann a volunteer with the aid organization people helping people in the border zone or php for short when he got to arivaca a two years ago diekmann 70 was on the search for a new home he had developed lung problems and the high altitude of colorado made it difficult to stay in his home for the previous 40 years he set out with his dog buddy and traveled around a bit before landing in southern arizona the desert drew him there he said but the character of the people made him stay for a small town how many people there were with so much compassion blew my mind he recalled diekmann bought some land and a 10 by 10 foot tuff shed he saw on a parade float in phoenix and started to assemble his off the grid paradise in the desert it wasn t long before he became acquainted with another reality in the area scattered throughout the wash near his house were items left behind by border crossers some of the most common items black water bottles and pieces of carpet migrants use as shoes or shoe coverings are peppered among the rock and cactus garden he keeps just feet from his front porch you take a walk and you see the backpacks and camouflage and the shoes that are discarded and fallen apart diekmann said you see the desperation just from what s left behind as he saw it there were two options i can ignore it or i can try to help out he said as a self described old hippie with activist roots he chose the latter he got involved with people helping people an aid organization of locals who provide food water clothing and medical care to people they find on their ranches or near their homes a lot of the people are exhausted they re in rough shape diekmann said they ve spent every penny they have to try to get someplace safe and they finally give up and walk into town and say hey anybody just take me someplace i can t take it anymore after completing some training he started working regularly in the php aid office answering calls about someone needing help providing assistance and educating people who stopped by when he first started they would get a couple of calls a week diekmann said but now we re getting a couple a day the group has begun to focus all its attention on crisis relief he said it s the kind of work you could do all the time if you let yourself diekmann said it s truly an in for a penny in for a pound sort of thing what it would take to stop a little more than an hour into the hiking portion of a recent water drop opalski reflected on what it would be like if she could hike the desert just to enjoy the scenery the best thing for the work that i do would be if i never had to do it again she said i m happy to do this but it is a shame that this is what we have to do to keep people alive it s a sentiment shared among many involved in this type of work a motivating force driven by the feeling that if they weren t doing the work nobody else would be i think many of us would say that if there was an effective governmental organization that was reducing harm and making our desert safe we d be happy to pass that on said john orlowski another veteran volunteer with the ajo samaritans but until that s the case he said volunteers are hoping more governmental organizations and land management agencies will simply engage with them by making such small changes as granting access to federally controlled roads that could make their work much easier and listening to their experiences as the people working and living on the front lines every day orlowski said he thinks back to the search and rescue work he did in yosemite national park when he was younger if there were even three deaths from dehydration in a year it wouldn t be humanitarian aid organizations going in it would be the national park working to figure out what they have to do he said sarah pierce a policy analyst with the migration policy institute a nonprofit think tank said the single biggest policy change that could have an impact is increasing legal pathways to citizenship by improving how asylum claims are processed and making other visa programs more accessible still it s not lost on anyone that lasting change needs to take place at a much deeper level by addressing the root causes of migration and although there s some hope that the biden administration will invest in resources to address those issues diekmann said things change slowly we have to take it one day at a time and these people are here today he said they re here now dying of thirst with cut hands and feet and no food and water and someone needs to be here to help them

as the 2021 wildfire season begins to unfold the memories of past seasons linger in the lungs of people in the communities and landscapes that burned and in the atmosphere where greenhouse gases from wildfires continue to warm our planet wildfires wreaked havoc across the world over the past year in australia bushfires spanning 2019 20 captured public attention as videos of scorched koalas and wallabies made the rounds on the internet fires burned in arizona and colorado during the early waves of covid 19 in siberia boreal forests and tundra fires burned in the far north and as fall arrived washington and oregon began to burn with the consequences felt across the united states and into canada as smoke and covid 19 kept people indoors when it comes to climate wildfires occupy an unusual space they are driven by climate change and they help drive it as this vicious cycle plays out and predictions of extreme future fire seasons continue the need for human intervention to interrupt this cycle has never been more clear greenhouse gas release climate change is raising average global temperatures bringing with it longer droughts with cascading effects for forests and wildfires these impacts are highly place dependent they are determined by the ecology an ecosystem and its history of disturbance like wildfires insect outbreaks or logging across many forest types increasing temperatures and droughts dry out fuels including vegetation like dead trees and fallen branches more quickly and completely priming them to burn read more heat waves wildfire permafrost thaw the north s climate change trifecta in some forests in california and british columbia climate impacts can reduce snowpack and speed up spring snow melt which can lead to even drier vegetation and increase fire risk in ecosystems plagued by drought like areas of the southwestern u s long stretches without rain can kill trees and leave dead wood ready to burn as a driver of climate change wildfires release huge quantities of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere in british columbia extreme fire years in 2017 and 2018 each produced three times more greenhouse gases than all other sectors of the province combined while trees can and do regrow after fire building back carbon takes time which is precisely what we lack in the fight against climate change that s not to say that climate change is the only thing driving massive wildfires nor is greenhouse gas release the only consequence people specifically european colonizers in north america have created and perpetuated conditions that increase the risk of large severe fires we are just one of many species that suffer from the consequences an interrupted fire cycle fire has long played an important role in maintaining the health of many types of forest for example lodgepole pine relies on fire to reproduce by melting the resin that releases its seeds in the early 20th century bans on controlled indigenous burning and policies of fire suppression interrupted the fire cycle with which forests evolved and removed regularly occurring fires from forested areas the exclusion of fire from temperate landscapes has disrupted the mosaics of ecosystems and recently burned areas that had once moderated fire spread and behaviour logging and timber practices like clear cutting and replanting have also modified fire risk by favouring stands of coniferous trees nearly identical in age that can quickly carry and spread fire read more after wildfires logging the forest can harm wildlife for up to a decade as the consequences from 20th century forest management play out people keep modifying fire regimes by unintentionally igniting fires and developing previously wild areas by continuing to burn fossil fuels humans further exacerbate climate change and fire risk independent of forest management how do wildfires alter the carbon sink further complicating the grim picture of wildfires is the growing expectation among governments and policy makers that forests and trees will counterbalance and offset our continued fossil fuel use increasingly severe and large wildfires could derail that plan most forests are carbon sinks meaning they take up more carbon than they release with the amount of carbon taken up varying with age as plants photosynthesize they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and integrate it into their leaves roots and biomass over time this leads to large carbon stocks in forests stored in vegetation and importantly soils in cold high latitude environments even more carbon is stored in permafrost soils read more more frequent fires could dramatically alter boreal forests and emit more carbon fires along with other disturbances release this carbon into the atmosphere reducing the carbon stocks that have built up over time wildfires can also initially reduce a forest s capacity to pull carbon out of the atmosphere also called sink strength severe fires can inhibit forest regrowth and can change the species composition of the forest altogether wildfires increase the amount of carbon leaving forests and can decrease the amount coming in the wildfire season forecast while predicting the intensity of fire seasons isn t foolproof and has its own limitations many regions in canada and the u s face a greater than average risk for fires this summer according to predictions extreme drought is occurring across the western u s and the canadian prairie provinces the effects of which are reflected in the elevated fire risk predicted for those same coastal and southwestern areas despite these projections wildfires aren t an anomaly and for many landscapes they re a critical process that maintains ecosystem health but the wildfires of the past burn differently than the wildfires of the present and now humans and wildlife are at great risk humans however can also intervene to interrupt this cycle with practices like prescribed burning and forest thinning that can increase forest resilience this is an active area of research and many scientists including a team from canada and the u s are working to develop scientifically sound interventions climate change doesn t operate like an on off switch meaning wildfires aren t part of a new normal we are experiencing the effects of climate change but they will neither be consistent nor uniform rather climate change is like a slide and when it comes to wildfires we are quickly spiralling downward author carly phillips researcher in residence pacific institute for climate

new york may 18 2021 prnewswire today prominent investor rights law firm bernstein litowitz berger grossmann llp blb g filed a class action lawsuit for violations of the federal securities laws in the u s district court for the middle district of georgia against danimer scientific inc danimer or the company and certain of its senior executives collectively defendants the complaint expands the class period that was asserted in the previously filed related securities class action pending against danimer captioned rosencrants v danimer scientific inc no 1 21 cv 02708 e d n y which did not sufficiently protect investors interests or encompass the full scope of danimer s fraud regarding the biodegradability of nodax demand for nodax and nodax s average selling price today s class action is brought on behalf of investors in danimer securities between december 30 2020 and may 3 2021 inclusive the class period blb g files class action lawsuit against danimer scientific for making false and misleading statements about nodax blb g filed this action on behalf of its client carlos caballero and the case is captioned caballero v danimer scientific inc no 1 21 cv 00095 lag m d ga the complaint is based on an extensive investigation and a careful evaluation of the merits of this case a copy of the complaint is available on blb g s website by clicking here danimer s alleged fraud headquartered in bainbridge georgia danimer is a manufacturer of plastics known as polyhydroxyalkanoates phas that are derived from living organisms instead of fossil fuels danimer s principal product is nodax the brand name of a purportedly biodegradable pha nodax is made by feeding canola oil to bacteria from which carbon is extracted and turned into plastic danimer became a publicly traded company through the acquisition of its predecessor company by live oak acquisition corp a special purpose acquisition company and began trading on the new york stock exchange on december 30 2020 the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants made false and misleading statements regarding nodax s environmental benefits its viability as a fully biodegradable alternative to conventional plastic the level of demand for nodax and nodax s selling price as a result of defendants misrepresentations shares of danimer common stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the class period the truth began to emerge on march 20 2021 when the wall street journal published an article debunking danimer s claims that nodax breaks down far more quickly than fossil fuel plastics the article reported that according to the same expert who co authored a study touted by danimer as certifying nodax s biodegradability many claims about nodax are exaggerated and misleading according to that expert danimer s broad claims about nodax s biodegradability were not accurate and greenwashing the article also quoted danimer s chief technology officer phil van trump admitting that danimer ceo stephen e croskrey s statements that bacteria in a landfill would consume nodax were not wholly accurate instead van trump admitted that nodax products are unlikely to biodegrade in most modern landfills then on april 22 2021 research firm spruce point capital management spruce point issued a report the april report demonstrating that the company s annual report disclosures regarding the purchase price of its production facility in kentucky the kentucky facility were inconsistent with city records the april report also established that the production capacity buildout of the kentucky facility was only 10 completed as of january 15 2021 throwing into question danimer s class period statements that several components of the first phase of the production capacity buildout were completed at the end of the third quarter of 2020 spruce point s april report also contained findings from a recent research study into the biodegradability of pha that in an anaerobic environment such as a sealed landfill the pha product does not completely biodegrade according to spruce point the study states that bioplastics in a landfill can in fact be worse than traditional plastic as they release methane gas which has a global warming potential that is multiples higher than that of carbon dioxide the april report also revealed that danimer has a history of overstating the size and capacity of its manufacturing facilities with its descriptions of its production rates consistently changing over the years finally on may 4 2021 spruce point issued a follow up report the may report containing information about danimer newly obtained through a freedom of information act request on the kentucky department of environmental protection the may report revealed that danimer s production figures average selling price and financial projections had been wildly overstated the filing of this action does not alter the previously established deadline to seek appointment

francisco kjolseth tribune file photo a home for sale in salt lake city on tuesday april 27 2021 with utah poised to spend millions on affordable housing a top analyst says stagnating incomes are more of a driver in the state s current crisis than a lack of housing utah s housing crisis may be more about shrinking paychecks than a shortage of homes as state lawmakers met tuesday in advance of spending millions of pandemic relief cash to encourage more affordable housing construction and other projects a top analyst told them that a lack of supply isn t the beehive state s most pressing housing issue and urged them to look also at ways of boosting incomes for utah s working families we can t build our way out of this david fields housing economist with the state department of workforce services testified on utah s capitol hill the housing market is more nuanced than the perceived condition of a housing supply constraint when adjusted for inflation median incomes in utah have stayed all but flat since 2002 even as its economy has often thrived and expanded at the same time homes prices and prevailing rents climbed steadily skyward fields said fueled in part by investors speculative buying in utah s residential markets those combined trends have created what he called a growing wedge that is forcing residents to spend ever larger shares of their pay on housing costs and that widening chasm between the cost of available housing and what folks can actually pay is the underlying driver behind utah s current housing predicament said fields not an actual lack of homes and apartments data suggests the shrinking income crunch transcends lines between urban and rural utah fields said with large shares of utahns shelling out 50 or more of their incomes on housing costs defining them as severely cost burdened no matter where you go there is a significant percentage of the population that are having housing insecurities due to housing not being affordable even though there are a lot of vacant units and excess supply he told members of utah house political subdivisions committee fields said that programs such as rental assistance eviction limits more generous unemployment benefits and low income subsidies for child care and medical costs might help make utah s housing picture more equitable he also suggested ways of stabilizing renters who are struggling to keep up and living wage laws that guarantee incomes for workers are adequate to meet basic living costs utah lawmakers have a long history of opposing living wage measures and have declined several times in recent years to consider bills raising the state s minimum wage including one that stalled in february to boost it to 15 an hour from its current level of 7 25 an hour fields message drew instant skepticism tuesday from several members of republican dominated legislature after years of discussion focused on what researchers say is a gap of 50 000 plus affordable homes in the state s existing inventories what you re saying is just not true on the availability of housing stock said rep calvin musselman r west haven and a real estate sales executive he noted that home listings were currently being snatched up within five days of going on the market down from 26 days less than a year ago in 25 years that is beyond anything i ve ever seen ever musselman said the idea that there s this overflow of vacant houses out there it s just nonexistent he also pointed to rock bottom vacancy rates in large apartment complexes across the state there s a waiting list there too the lawmaker said rep matthew gwynn said the state s policies spurring economic growth and job creation and enticing new employers to relocate in utah needed to also guarantee their workers incomes will grow it is the policies we have in place now that are setting this up to be a problem said gwynn r farr west housing advocates in utah long have argued that incomes are not keeping pace with rising housing costs but several also disagreed with fields assertions noting historically tight housing inventories in salt lake city which saw the single largest decline in available homes for sale in december of any large u s city homebuilders meanwhile have launched record levels of housing construction this year in hopes of expanding the housing stock although escalating building costs a lack of land and shortages of construction workers make it difficult to produce affordable homes james wood senior economist with the university of utah s kem c gardner policy institute said utahns at lower incomes are the worst hit by the current housing pinch leaving them one crisis away from homelessness those folks you know every day it s a pitched battle for them with housing insecurity said wood anything happens a medical event auto accident domestic violence you know they re just in big trouble

rep out the windows inside bill gates naked pool parties affairs and friendship with jeffrey epstein after bombshell divorce announcement he seemed like the ultimate computer geek a bespectacled genius who wrote his first software programme aged just 13 now a very different picture of bill gates has emerged after he admitted to having had an affair with an employee 20 years ago and is alleged to have pursued other female staff advertisement 6 inside bill gates naked pool parties affairs and friendship with jeffrey epstein after his bombshell divorce announcement credit getty images getty the 65 year old microsoft founder has also been battered by yet more allegations about his links to paedophile jeffrey epstein there are questions about why he met the now deceased convicted sex offender despite reportedly knowing of his perverted past and the image of the tech guru s marriage to wife melinda which seemed rock solid when they were a 91billion power couple on a mission to save the planet has crashed as they head to the divorce courts sources claim that melinda 56 was angry that her husband had gone to the billionaire financier epstein s new york home and started divorce proceedings once his links to him became public in 2019 since the announcement of his divorce just over a fortnight ago gates s early days have come under scrutiny according to his biographers he enjoyed naked pool parties with strippers and was a womaniser in his youth advertisement journalist james wallace who wrote overdrive bill gates and the race to control cyberspace claimed a lot of those microsoft kids were young guys in pizza stained t shirts working on software code pizza stained t shirts then they would have some pretty wild parties where they would go out and get strippers in seattle and bring them over to gates s home he wasn t a choir boy back then gates co founded microsoft in 1975 aged just 20 with his childhood friend paul allen after dropping out of university he built up the firm into the biggest soft ware company in the world and gates is now worth an estimated 93billion wallace s book described the alleged naked parties at gates s home advertisement he said the computer whizz would visit one of seattle s all nude nightclubs and hire dancers to come to his home and swim naked with his friends in his indoor pool the journalist also alleges that his womanising put a strain on his early courtship of melinda who he started dating in 1987 6 gates having fun with young partygoers in 2010 credit getty he wrote he continued to play the field for a while especially when he was out of town on business when he would frequently hit on female journalists who covered microsoft advertisement melinda was well aware of gates s womanising and their relationship ran hot and cold at one point they broke up for nearly a year the pair eventually wed in 1994 in hawaii and gates is said to have boasted to pals that he had not strayed during their marriage but this week it emerged that he had cheated on melinda in 2000 by seeing one of his employees later the microsoft board investigated his liaisons because dating a member of staff could be considered inappropriate a spokesperson for bill gates confirmed to the sun there was an affair almost 20 years ago which ended amicably bill s decision to transition off the board was in no way related to this matter advertisement hurt their credibility it can be said for certain that gates had flirted with at least one employee prior to that incident because he started dating melinda when she was a young product manager at microsoft the new york times claimed on sunday that it was a pattern of behaviour that would be repeated in the decades to come an anonymous female member of staff at the bill and melinda gates foundation which has handed out almost 40billion in charitable grants since 2000 alleged he had told her in hushed tones i want to see you will you have dinner with me another report alleged gates had asked a microsoft employee out in 2006 after she had delivered a work presentation advertisement the new york times claimed multiple people said that during their marriage mr gates engaged in work related behaviour that they said was inappropriate for a person at the helm of a major publicly traded company 6 gates with paedophile jeffrey epstein who killed himself in 2019 credit handout via new york times 6 another report alleged gates had asked a microsoft employee out in 2006 after she had delivered a work presentation credit ap his spokesperson denied that gates had mistreated staff meanwhile further details about the extent of gates s relationship with epstein have perplexed many observers who wonder why the philanthropist would have anything to do with a convicted sex offender advertisement the two men first got to know each other in january 2011 three years after epstein was convicted of procuring a child for prostitution gates went to the financial adviser s giant 40 room home on new york s upper east side at 8pm and spent several hours there also present was dr eva andersson dubin a former miss sweden and ex girlfriend of epstein along with her 15 year old daughter epstein later bragged about the meeting in emails to a pal seen by the new york times writing bill s great meanwhile gates reportedly informed colleagues that he found the financier s lifestyle kind of intriguing it was the first of a series of meetings between the computer genius and the sex offender including a trip on his private jet advertisement marriage irretrievably broken gates admits that it was an error in judgement to have met the disgraced businessman and his spokesperson says the intriguing comment was a reference to epstein s decor there are allegations denied by microsoft that gates even asked epstein for advice on ending his marriage to melinda feminist melinda was especially angered by his dealings with creepy epstein and is said to have begun speaking to divorce lawyers after an exposé about the friendship was published in 2019 speaking of melinda s decision to divorce another source told people magazine epstein is definitely a sore spot that s a long time for issues to fester she was totally opposed to what she considered shady dealings and some other issues he wanted to pursue in the business area she was not afraid to speak up about it either melinda eventually filed for divorce from her husband of 27 years this month claiming in court paperwork that her marriage was irretrievably broken advertisement they said in a joint statement we no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in this next phase of our lives the pair who have three grown up children are now engaged in discussions with lawyers about the split which is destined to be one of the costliest separations of all time 6 bill pictured while he was in charge of microsoft during the eighties credit getty no reason for the separation has been given despite leaks seemingly from melinda s side suggesting that all the family were furious at gates according to reports in the us it was melinda who brought gates s dealing with epstein to an end in september 2013 she is said to have visited epstein s new york townhouse with her husband and expressed how uncomfortable she was with him cosying up to the sex convict advertisement epstein killed himself in jail in august 2019 weeks after being arrested on a slew of new sex trafficking charges there is no suggestion of wrongdoing on the part of bill gates and he denies attending any epstein parties a spokesperson for gates insisted that he had met epstein because he made claims of being able to bring billions of dollars into philanthropy bill and melinda have drawn up a separation contract and he has already given billions in stocks to his estranged wife an unnamed former employee has claimed the couple lived in separate wings of their 70million washington mansion for the past years 6 bill and melinda have drawn up a separation contract credit getty advertisement another insider suggested that a combo of things had contributed to the gates s divorce including their youngest daughter phoebe turning 18 last year they said nobody is going to want to invite more scrutiny because it ll hurt their credibility but with new focus on gates s friendship with epstein and his relationship with staff the billionaire must be braced for more uncomfortable questions to come
wait how much is that again charles mudede people have been talking about inflation lately and for an obvious reason this month s inflation report by the bureau of labor statistics determined that consumer prices rose 4 2 percent from april of last year and 0 8 percent from the prior month the responses to this report from the mainstream left and from the right as a whole as there is no such thing as the moderate right in such matters have been predictable the leading or most visible left wing economist paul krugman basically sees it as blip that is similar to the 3 8 bump that happened in 2011 as the us began pulling out of a recession that had the massive 2008 crash as its gravity he attributes the current blip to a similar circumstance but this time the conventional economy as opposed to the asset economy homes bonds shares is pulling out of the crash of 2020 the result is the rise of very specific or covid sensitive services and commodities that were repressed during the pandemic krugman mentions used cars people s policy project includes hotels and airline fares the right of course is describing the rise in consumer prices as evidence that the economy is overheating from too much stimulus which is free money in being free the stimulus money is even worse than another inflation fuel cheap money in the form of low interest rates fox news wastes no time beating this very old drum there s so much money out there in the economy that the demand is high and it s outpacing supply and it s starting to push prices up sen john thune r s d told bloomberg on wednesday we need to be a little more cautious and restrained thune is reheating the quantity theory of money qtm if you do not like reheated coffee you will also not like reheated economic theories of this kind qtm which was formalized 100 years ago by the fisher equation basically says this price changes in relation to the supply of money in an economy this is of course pure nonsense because it assumes a value system that is background independent meaning it describes inflation as a technical problem m v p t and not a political one and politics is always a part of a cultural background that structures our class relations meaning you should not ask is this inflation really happening instead you should ask who says inflation is really happening here s why scarcity value is fine for antiques and rare stamps it s awful for necessities like homes we must increase the supply of housing todd gloria toddgloria may 18 2021 this is the mayor of san diego todd gloria though he is a democrat the proud son of a maid and a gardener and a native american filipino latino dutch lgbtq his economic thinking is essentially neoliberal there is really no difference between his theory of scarcity value and the monetarist doctrine of too many dollars chasing too few goods both identify inflation as a background independent technical matter inflation indicates an imbalance that requires a correction in the case of san diego the fix is an increase the supply but what should give us some pause in the san diego context which is by no means isolated but experienced by all major cities and burbs in the us is this the inflation of housing values is not something that economists most of whom are trained in the neoclassical school are really worried about nor does the political right or the market or the business press ever really howl about rising house values but this really is a form of inflation the rise of the price of an airplane ticket is inflation the rise of a house s value is inflation indeed the whole stock market was rapidly inflated during trump s time in office but this overheating had mostly positive political implications trump boasted about it as did the dems when rapid asset value inflation occurred under obama but why are these other forms of inflation considered fine when the one concerning commodity prices is not bruce bartlett of the soap box predictably conservatives are once again warning about inflation this happens every time a democrat takes office even if he merely continues the identical policies of his republican predecessor unfortunately these concerns which always receive wide media attention are costly politically and economically bill clinton was forced to adopt a deficit reduction plan in 1993 that led to the defeat of many democrats in 1994 and the installation of newt gingrich as speaker of the house barack obama was forced to scale back his stimulus plan in 2009 and was browbeaten into deficit reduction in 2011 as with krugman s the problem with this analysis is that it maintains the importance of keeping the prices of commodities stable this is just a given we should not even bother questioning it the sun always rises inflation is always bad but clearly someone or a group decided which inflation is positive and which is negative assets yes apples no when choices are involved then culture is involved and the defining form of capitalist culture is a hierarchical structure that repeatedly collapses into class struggle the reason there s so much noise about commodity prices is they are directly locked into class politics and in a major way we can blame moderate left economists for this they are the ones who by a theory called the philips curve emphasized a generally harmful link between the price of labor and the price of goods the idea was that inflation was fine as long as the economy was growing more and more jobs this was the tradeoff the philips curve however hit a wall in the middle of the 1970s because inflation rose along with slow to no growth this sorry episode got the name stagflation it cost the moderate left power in policy matters and opened the way to the right s monetarist agenda inflation as money supply the right s solution which began under jimmy carter was a sharp increase in interest rates which effectively killed business investment the source of job growth in a capitalist economy the fall in jobs equaled the deflation and eventual stabilization of commodity prices this all happened in the early 1980s it has a name the volcker shock it eviscerated union power even before the decade was over and it made inflation targeting and not full employment the key economic concern for the federal reserve indeed one thing that s noticeable in this round of inflation fever is the absence of much talk about labor which has been confined to discourse around allegedly lazy fast food workers refusing to take open risky low wage jobs union power isn t the problem here it s now all about that free government cheese

item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10 q for further information about the merger 21 table of contents results of operations as of march 31 2021 we had not commenced any operations all activity for the period from january 1 2021 through march 31 2021 relates to our formation and ipo and since the completion of the ipo searching for a target to consummate a business combination we will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a business combination at the earliest we will generate non operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the ipo and placed in the trust account defined below for the period from january 1 2021 through march 31 2021 we had a net loss of 9 085 902 we incurred 2 478 975 of formation and operating costs driven by 2 140 000 of legal fees associated with the merger and 6 609 933 unrealized loss on change in fair value of warrants interest income of 3 006 partially offset these losses liquidity and capital resources as of march 31 2021 we had cash outside our trust account of 739 467 available for working capital needs all remaining cash was held in the trust account and is generally unavailable for our use prior to an initial business combination we intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account excluding deferred underwriting commissions to complete our business combination we may withdraw interest to pay our taxes we estimate our annual franchise tax obligations based on the number of shares of our common stock authorized and outstanding after the completion of the ipo to be 200 000 which is the maximum amount of annual franchise taxes payable by us as a delaware corporation per annum which we may pay from funds from the ipo held outside of the trust account or from interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and released to us for this purpose our annual income tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in the trust account we expect the interest earned on the amount in the trust account will be sufficient to pay our income taxes to the extent that our equity or debt is used in whole or in part as consideration to complete our business combination the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies further our sponsor officers and directors or their respective affiliates may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required the working capital loans if we complete a business combination we would repay the working capital loans out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us otherwise the working capital loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account in the event that a business combination does not close we may use a portion of proceeds held outside the trust account to repay the working capital loans but no proceeds held in the trust account would be used to repay the working capital loans except for the foregoing the terms of such working capital loans if any have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans the working capital loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a business combination or at the lender s discretion up to 1 500 000 of such working capital loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of 1 50 per warrant the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants to date we had no borrowings under the working capital loans we do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business however if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business undertaking in depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our business combination in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended business combination our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required if we complete our business combination we would repay such loaned amounts in the event that our business combination does not close we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment up to 1 500 000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of 1 50 per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants the terms of such loans if any have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans prior to the completion of our business combination we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account 22 table of contents off balance sheet financing arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangement as of march 31

article 3 months old weekly reports may 19 2021 this story features element 25 limited and other companies for more info share analysis e25 manganese the next hot battery metal by tim boreham editor the new criterion move over lithium graphite cobalt and copper manganese is fast emerging as the next battery metal story to titillate investors the back story is similar with manganese usage dominated by china and supply emanating from largely unattractive or unreliable geographies western world car and battery makers are desperate to get their paws on the processed high grade material for eons manganese has been used as a strengthening agent in steel 90 of output is deployed in this way and given the strength of chinese steel making as reflected in record iron ore prices this sector is attractive in itself however investor focus is more on high purity manganese hpm which can be used as a cheaper substitute for cobalt in nickel cobalt manganese ncm battery cathodes at a time of heightened ethical investing awareness most cobalt is sourced from the less than ethical democratic republic of congo and car and battery makers are keen to reduce their reliance on the material manganese largely comes from south africa ghana gabon brazil and eastern europe so these are problematic locales as well a supply of manganese concentrate from a reliable jurisdiction like australia is very much sought after by the market says justin brown ceo of manganese rising star e25 e25 if you re wondering about the name manganese is the 25th element on the periodic table and the fourth most widely used metal in recent weeks the battery maker tesla and vw the world s biggest car maker have committed to cathodes with higher manganese content no cobalt and reduced nickel for mid performance vehicles german chemical giant basf has unveiled plans to bolster investment in battery cathode materials including you guessed it manganese rich stuff that s obviously music to my ears says brown according to industry guesstimates current hpm demand is running at 150 000tpa but is projected to rise to at least one million tonnes per annum by 2040 but these numbers are based on the current chemistry of an ev battery not the higher manganese content which could be four to five times the current levels the growth curve is not just the function of electric vehicle uptake it s compounded by the fact the next generation of battery is going to be high manganese content so you get this growth on growth brown says reflecting the investor interest explorer black canyon bca shares listed on may 5 at a 50 premium to their 20c issue price to raise 5m black canyon has an option to acquire a majority stake in the carawine project an 800sq km landholding in east pilbara manganese country neighbours include the operating woodie woodie mine run by the chinese owned consolidated minerals black canyon has also agreed to acquire zephyr exploration which has dibs on 2200sqkm in the lofty ranges close to e25 s newly commissioned butcherbird project in mid march firebird metals frb debuted strongly having been spun out of firefly resources firebird s gaze is on its oakover project which consists of 360sqkm of manganese rich turf near newman in the east pilbara but e25 can lay claim to being australia s new force in manganese with its self discovered and fully owned butcherbird the country s biggest manganese resource the project has a total resource of 263mt and a proven and probable component on 50 6mt e25 currently is in ramp up of its 20m phase one aimed at output of approximately 340 000 tonnes of concentrate a year over a 40 year mine life the company has locked in a five year take or pay contract with malaysian smelter om materials a subsidiary of the asx listed om holdings omh the pre feasibility study pfs cites a net present value npv of 583m pre tax with an internal rate of return of 387 by spending a further 20m the company plans to increase this output to1 02mt with the npv rising to 1 13bn the company last month completed a 35 5m placement to fund this second stage which as with the first stanza is pitched at the steel market from pfs to commissioning phase one took a mere ten months similarly investors won t have to wait too long with phase two commissioning due in february next year demand from the steelmakers

seattle washington despite damaging allegations suggesting bill gates pursued women who worked for him do not expect changes to his roles at the two iconic institutions he co founded microsoft and his namesake philanthropic foundation critics say the revelations raise accountability concerns though it remains unclear how much the dent to gates reputation might affect the institutions that are so closely associated with him the bill and melinda gates foundation says it is not investigating the allegations in the media as the reported incident involving one of the world s largest most influential nonprofits was made by an anonymous former employee the foundation has never received any formal complaints regarding bill gates the spokesperson noted in a statement to ap when we do receive an allegation of misconduct we take it very seriously conduct an investigation and take deliberate actions appropriate to the situation the new york times and wall street journal over the weekend detailed gates reported behaviour toward women ranging from a full blown affair at microsoft to dismissiveness towards his now estranged wife and foundation co chair melinda french gates as well as asking out women who felt uncomfortable with his advances at both institutions microsoft said the company hired a law firm in late 2019 to conduct an investigation after a microsoft engineer alleged in a letter that she had a sexual relationship with gates over several years gates private office spokesperson called it an affair almost 20 years ago which ended amicably microsoft spokesperson frank x shaw this week declined to answer further questions about what the board concluded and why the investigation was not previously disclosed the company in march 2020 announced gates was leaving the board to dedicate more time to his philanthropic priorities but would continue to serve as a technology adviser to ceo satya nadella and other microsoft leaders gates spokesperson said the investigation did not force him off the board and that he had for years planned to spend more time on his philanthropy the spokesperson referred to a statement issued to the new york times it is extremely disappointing that there have been so many untruths published about the cause the circumstances and the timeline of bill gates divorce on may 3 the gates announced in identical tweets that they had decided to end their marriage of 27 years the allegations against bill gates are a red flag for some of microsoft s shareholders said natasha lamb managing partner of arjuna capital an investment firm that has pushed the company to address pay disparity concerns she said the company allowing him to resign was cowardly of both gates and the board and that the revelations are a real setback for microsoft in their ability to attract and retain diverse talent the case of bill gates is a classic example of money and power clearly hitting on his employees was his move that s how he met his wife it s clear that kind of behaviour continued lamb said this leaves an open question as to how the board and leadership is addressing sexual harassment within the company there was some change following metoo in how the company was dealing with these issues internally but clearly you had this signal of bad behaviour from the top which sets the culture a former microsoft employee who waged a five year legal battle against the company over alleged gender discrimination in pay and promotions said the gates allegations reflect broader problems with the company s culture a lot of their policies around harassment in the workplace were so ineffective at protecting women said katie moussouris a cybersecurity researcher who dropped her lawsuit against microsoft in november i am completely unsurprised moussouris who joined the company in 2007 under then ceo steve ballmer said it was not unusual for engineers to occasionally encounter top corporate executives especially when they were making presentations about their research she said that raises concerns about gates ongoing role as a technical adviser to nadella which means he s going to be sitting in exactly on those types of meetings ongoing she said this does not remove him from encountering other women at microsoft

the pandemic has made us painfully aware of our common vulnerability to disease outbreaks new communicable diseases originating in one part of the world can spread quickly and widely underlining that health is a global concern but this is old news the advent of the concept of global health is well established in both the academic literature and policy discussions reflecting the consensus that we have seen a fundamental change in the nature of the causes and outcomes of ill health in recent decades this change is rooted in the effects of globalisation and seen not only in the spread of communicable diseases but in other developments the globalised pharmaceutical market the emergence of global civil society new international health actors with a global perspective such as the bill and melinda gates foundation and the migration of health professionals these developments combined to create a powerful sense of change such that as long ago as 2008 the uk government declared that health is global covid 19 appears to reinforce this narrative most striking of course is the spread of the disease it has touched almost everyone within 18 months of its appearance the who has identified only 14 countries reporting zero cases 12 of which were pacific islands which had implemented strict travel restrictions reinforcing sea borders the pandemic has also demonstrated the global nature of the marketplace for health products from the often desperate search for ppe in the early months of the pandemic to the development production and supply of vaccines in 2021 it is clear that states cannot rely on national suppliers alone the liberal vision but the global health narrative was always more than simply an analysis of a new reality it was also a call for new ways of working to address both new diseases like covid 19 and existing health inequalities underpinning this was the argument that if health was global then responses needed to be global too and that a consequence of globalisation was that the health of one state or population group was linked to the health of all this liberal vision of global health one which held that the rich had responsibilities to the rest of the world and progress was possible through cooperation was already in trouble prior to covid for all of the stated concerns about inequalities from the g7 and others the global health agenda originated in high income countries and reflected their concerns especially over the spread of disease from other countries as a result proposed responses prioritised their interests including an emphasis upon dealing with the effects of disease through pharmacological solutions rather than addressing the causes which might have been disruptive to their economic interests that is why there were so many calls to decolonise global health before covid emerged unashamed nationalism covid 19 has thrown into sharp relief the current weaknesses of the global health project during the most serious pandemic in living memory the response has been dominated by national concerns and policies in the years leading up to the pandemic the emergence of unashamedly nationalist governments in g7 and g20 states challenged visions of globally shared interests most obviously trump s america first stood in stark contrast to the obama administration s global health security initiative and the bush administration s massive programme for aids relief which helped transform the course of hiv infections in africa during this time optimists pointed to the continued engagement of other countries in global health initiatives and argued that this new nationalism might only be a transitory phase with business as usual returning post trump pessimists suggested that what we have seen is a more fundamental shift in the zeitgeist with the global haves turning away from the humanitarianism and cosmopolitanism of the 2000s the jury may be out as to who is correct but at the very least the consensus of that era over the benefits of globalisation appears much less convincing now global health gone missing in contrast to the 2002 3 sars outbreak and the 2009 10 swine flu pandemic when the who was central to a global response or the 2014 15 west african ebola outbreak when the organisation was widely criticised for not playing a leading role this time around there has been no question that leadership on covid 19 would come from anywhere except national governments stark policy differences between states have appeared over basic issues such as face masks lockdowns and social distancing the who has criticised high income countries for a catastrophic moral failure over allocation of vaccines and questions of safety have been largely addressed at the national level despite clear advice from the who although covax the global vaccine sharing facility had delivered more than 38 million doses to 100 economies in the first quarter of 2021 by mid april it was warning that supplies were tight and additional stocks were unlikely to be available to it beyond those already reserved this was despite accelerating production of vaccines and appeared to be because of prior agreements by manufacturers with usually high income states on supplies for their national needs joe biden s recent announcement of an additional 20 million doses for the rest of the world although welcome is but a drop in the ocean given the billions likely to be needed in india alone the catastrophic increase in covid cases in india was exacerbated by the lack of critical health products from ppe and oxygen to vaccines if there ever was a global health system then it had gone sadly missing when we needed it most covid 19 has demonstrated that in a time of crisis the rich and powerful fell back to national approaches with only secondary concerns for the global health good but since national health outcomes appear still to be inextricably linked to global developments the need to rebuild global health after covid is more pressing than ever author colin mcinnes pro vice chancellor research knowledge exchange and innovation aberystwyth university

santa fe with six weeks to go before cannabis is legal for adults to possess and use in new mexico a patient enrolled in the state s medical cannabis program is challenging rules that limit how much patients can purchase patient jason barker contends that the new mexico department of health and the state regulation and licensing department are discriminating against patients by imposing a different purchase limit for them once adult use is legalized as of june 29 the cannabis regulation act which state lawmakers passed at the end of march allows adults age 21 and older to purchase up to 2 ounces of cannabis commonly known as marijuana 16 grams of cannabis extract and 800 milligrams of edible cannabis at a time once commercial sales are authorized to begin related new mexico s new cannabis control division launches state web page however the law states that the newly formulated cannabis control division organized under the rld has until april 1 2022 to open commercial sales that leaves a window of as much as 10 months between decriminalizing possession and the opening of a regulated marketplace however a regulated marketplace already exists for card holding patients in the state s medical cannabis program which was enacted by a 2007 law however on may 5 the regulating agencies jointly advised medical cannabis producers that enrolled patients will continue to be subject to the program s purchase limits of a cumulative 8 ounces over any 90 day period and that after june 29 any purchases over that amount would be subject to a tax the memo is included as an exhibit in the complaint barker who disclosed in his filing that he suffers from a traumatic brain injury said the limit does not permit him to maintain an adequate supply of medicine dive deeper meet the ex lawmaker tasked with drafting new mexico s pot rules meanwhile adults not enrolled as medical cannabis patients will be able to possess an unlimited amount of cannabis so long as any amount over 2 ounces is stored securely in their home barker s attorney jacob candelaria argued in a news release that the policy establishes an illegal tax on medical patients not provided for in the cannabis regulation act the law is clear all medical cannabis patients may purchase at least two ounces of medical cannabis at any one time tax free beginning on june 29 2021 candelaria wrote candelaria is a new mexico state senator who has represented medical cannabis patients and producers in court plant limits and medical use growth barker s lawsuit also challenges the health department s limits on the number of plants medical cannabis producers may cultivate currently 1 750 medical cannabis producers have argued that the plant count limit does not allow producers to keep pace with growing enrollment in the program which reached 115 732 patients in april growing more than 22 percent over a year ago that total does not include 9 781 reciprocal participants who hold medical cannabis cards issued in other states that means tighter supplies and higher prices for patients producers argue the average price per gram is ridiculously high duke rodriguez ceo of ultra health the state s largest medical cannabis producer said our medical patients are routinely paying from the regulated market 9 to 10 dollars a gram we are sadly driving patients to participating in the black market and take that necessary risk of quality safety and prosecution rodriguez did not address barker s lawsuit barker is seeking a declaratory judgment in the state s 1st judicial district that limits on purchases by enrolled patients and plant stock for producers are arbitrary and capricious and to order regulators to allow purchases that align with the cannabis regulation act s limits on possession effective june 29 in its may 5 communication to producers the health department and rld jointly advised that they would propose new administrative rules including revised plant limits shortly after authority over the medical cannabis program transfers from the health department on june 29 at that point the doh will be responsible only for patient enrollment algernon d ammassa can be reached at 575 541 5451 adammassa lcsun news com or algernonwrites on twitter more cannabis coverage
as the 2021 wildfire season begins to unfold the memories of past seasons linger in the lungs of people in the communities and landscapes that burned and in the atmosphere where greenhouse gases from wildfires continue to warm our planet wildfires wreaked havoc across the world over the past year in australia bushfires spanning 2019 20 captured public attention as videos of scorched koalas and wallabies made the rounds on the internet fires burned in arizona and colorado during the early waves of covid 19 in siberia boreal forests and tundra fires burned in the far north and as fall arrived washington and oregon began to burn with the consequences felt across the united states and into canada as smoke and covid 19 kept people indoors when it comes to climate wildfires occupy an unusual space they are driven by climate change and they help drive it as this vicious cycle plays out and predictions of extreme future fire seasons continue the need for human intervention to interrupt this cycle has never been more clear greenhouse gas release climate change is raising average global temperatures bringing with it longer droughts with cascading effects for forests and wildfires these impacts are highly place dependent they are determined by the ecology an ecosystem and its history of disturbance like wildfires insect outbreaks or logging across many forest types increasing temperatures and droughts dry out fuels including vegetation like dead trees and fallen branches more quickly and completely priming them to burn read more heat waves wildfire permafrost thaw the north s climate change trifecta in some forests in california and british columbia climate impacts can reduce snowpack and speed up spring snow melt which can lead to even drier vegetation and increase fire risk in ecosystems plagued by drought like areas of the southwestern u s long stretches without rain can kill trees and leave dead wood ready to burn as a driver of climate change wildfires release huge quantities of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere in british columbia extreme fire years in 2017 and 2018 each produced three times more greenhouse gases than all other sectors of the province combined while trees can and do regrow after fire building back carbon takes time which is precisely what we lack in the fight against climate change that s not to say that climate change is the only thing driving massive wildfires nor is greenhouse gas release the only consequence people specifically european colonizers in north america have created and perpetuated conditions that increase the risk of large severe fires we are just one of many species that suffer from the consequences an interrupted fire cycle fire has long played an important role in maintaining the health of many types of forest for example lodgepole pine relies on fire to reproduce by melting the resin that releases its seeds in the early 20th century bans on controlled indigenous burning and policies of fire suppression interrupted the fire cycle with which forests evolved and removed regularly occurring fires from forested areas the exclusion of fire from temperate landscapes has disrupted the mosaics of ecosystems and recently burned areas that had once moderated fire spread and behaviour logging and timber practices like clear cutting and replanting have also modified fire risk by favouring stands of coniferous trees nearly identical in age that can quickly carry and spread fire read more after wildfires logging the forest can harm wildlife for up to a decade as the consequences from 20th century forest management play out people keep modifying fire regimes by unintentionally igniting fires and developing previously wild areas by continuing to burn fossil fuels humans further exacerbate climate change and fire risk independent of forest management how do wildfires alter the carbon sink further complicating the grim picture of wildfires is the growing expectation among governments and policy makers that forests and trees will counterbalance and offset our continued fossil fuel use increasingly severe and large wildfires could derail that plan most forests are carbon sinks meaning they take up more carbon than they release with the amount of carbon taken up varying with age as plants photosynthesize they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and integrate it into their leaves roots and biomass over time this leads to large carbon stocks in forests stored in vegetation and importantly soils in cold high latitude environments even more carbon is stored in permafrost soils read more more frequent fires could dramatically alter boreal forests and emit more carbon fires along with other disturbances release this carbon into the atmosphere reducing the carbon stocks that have built up over time wildfires can also initially reduce a forest s capacity to pull carbon out of the atmosphere also called sink strength severe fires can inhibit forest regrowth and can change the species composition of the forest altogether wildfires increase the amount of carbon leaving forests and can decrease the amount coming in the wildfire season forecast while predicting the intensity of fire seasons isn t foolproof and has its own limitations many regions in canada and the u s face a greater than average risk for fires this summer according to predictions extreme drought is occurring across the western u s and the canadian prairie provinces the effects of which are reflected in the elevated fire risk predicted for those same coastal and southwestern areas despite these projections wildfires aren t an anomaly and for many landscapes they re a critical process that maintains ecosystem health but the wildfires of the past burn differently than the wildfires of the present and now humans and wildlife are at great risk humans however can also intervene to interrupt this cycle with practices like prescribed burning and forest thinning that can increase forest resilience this is an active area of research and many scientists including a team from canada and the u s are working to develop scientifically sound interventions climate change doesn t operate like an on off switch meaning wildfires aren t part of a new normal we are experiencing the effects of climate change but they will neither be consistent nor uniform rather climate change is like a slide and when it comes to wildfires we are quickly spiralling downward author carly phillips researcher in residence pacific institute for climate

may 16 2021 recent articles i recently published a longform research piece on inflation and an article on some of the dynamics of market capitalization and asset bubbles this newsletter extends the topic of inflation by analyzing how it is manifesting this year in particular examines why the current situation is more comparable to the 1940s than the 1970s and finishes with some of the investment implications of it this past week the consumer price index came in well above consensus expectations benefiting from low base effects and faster than expected price increases the year over year figures are coming in rather hot at the moment the month over month figures filter out the year ago base effects but are also very heated so let s dive under the hood and see where some of this is coming from and how it is likely to manifest going forward the long term debt cycle unfolds one of my main topics over the past 18 24 months was exploring the long term debt cycle popularized years ago by ray dalio which describes a framework for expecting trend changes in fiscal policy monetary policy and inflation deflation i ll summarize the cycle again for folks who haven t been following my work but then also supply some new charts and tie it into some of the current trends we are seeing as of mid 2021 for those who are familiar with it each normal five to ten year business cycle in modern us history has ended with higher debt as a percentage of gdp and lower interest rates than the previous cycle as many of those short term debt cycles string together debt as a percentage of gdp keeps making higher highs and interest rates keep making lower lows until debts reach untenable levels and interest rates hit zero rates hit zero and private debts hit extremely high levels in 2008 during the global financial crisis and the last time this happened was in the early 1930s in the early phases of the great depression in both instances there was a systemic banking crisis marked in green which led fiscal and monetary policymakers to expand the monetary base and take other measures to recapitalize the banking system what makes the end of a long term debt cycle different than the end of a short term debt cycle is that the later stages of a long term debt cycle both in us history and elsewhere are generally characterized by a significant degree of fiscal dominance and currency devaluation this is because at the end of a long term debt cycle debt levels get so large relative to the size of the economy that it becomes impossible to deleverage them nominally without crashing the economy so instead the denominators are increased the monetary base the broad money supply and nominal gdp with a significant inflation component the mechanism to do this involves large monetized fiscal deficits accompanied by a central bank willing to hold rates well below the prevailing inflation rate for a while which effectively inflates portions of the debt away the alternative to this process is a deflationary economic collapse which is a route that the public and policymakers around the world rarely if ever choose in other words when push comes to shove and the system is pushed to its limits policymakers invariably print the 80 year echo history can t tell us everything but along with analysis of current conditions it can point us in the right direction in terms of fiscal and monetary policy the 2010s were very similar to the 1930s disinflationary private debt bubble deleveraging and the 2020s are shaping up more like the 1940s inflationary fiscal driven wartime finance the previous chart above shows the similarities clearly but this next section elaborates on the details 1930s and 2010s after the debt bubble popped in 1929 the 1930s had a long deflationary private debt bubble deleveraging resulting in sluggish economic growth and rising political populism fiscal stimulus in that decade was large in absolute terms but small compared to the amount of money destroyed from loan losses most of the focus was on recapitalizing the banking system as such the decade was disinflationary one very basic way to measure financial leverage in the financial system is to look at the monetary base as a percentage of total bank loans the lower the ratio is the more leveraged the system is since there is less base money backing up the total amount of bank loans this ratio hit a bottom at 12 right at the start of the great depression approximately 80 years later this process began playing out again as the next long term private debt bubble popped in 2008 and continued deleveraging into the early 2010s interestingly the ratio of the monetary base compared to total bank loans hit as low as 12 5 right before the crisis chart source st louis fed there is more data available for the 2008 event since it s in modern times which allows us to examine the overleveraged bank situation from more angles for example here is a chart of cash levels and treasury security levels as a percentage of total assets for large us banks chart source st louis fed in 2008 large banks had less than 3 cash and 10 treasuries or about 13 combined risk free assets as a percentage of their total assets that s historically very low most of their other assets were loans including a lot of risky loans that went bad when the overvalued housing market declined as banks crumbled under the private debt cycle implosion fiscal and monetary policymakers recapitalized the banking system keeping the majority of the banking system solvent but mostly letting overleveraged homeowners go bust looking at it another way this next chart shows total public and private debt as a ratio of broad money supply m2 in the united states in blue on the left axis i also added the federal funds rate and the monetary base as a percentage of gdp on the right axis chart source st louis fed total debt kept increasing faster than money supply for decades blue line going up with the total debt to money supply ratio reaching over 700 at the peak until the 2008 financial crisis occurred after that implosion the money supply began growing faster than debt blue line going down and 2020 kicked this deleveraging process into high gear with another leg down the ratio is already down to below 450 and heading lower looking at it a third way here is total private debt in dollar terms in the united states in blue on the left axis private debt as a ratio of gdp in red on the right axis and private debt as a ratio of broad money supply in green on the right axis chart source st louis fed when private debt builds for decades up to nearly 300 of gdp and over 600 of broad money supply there s no way to deleverage that monster nominally from 2008 through 2012 the total deleveraging of private debt in absolute terms was only about 3 6 trillion or 8 of the 45 trillion total and then it began heading up again now it s over 55 trillion instead the denominator is what mainly changed debt started growing at a slower pace while broad money started growing faster resulting in a declining ratio of private debt to money supply similarly to the 1930s the government response after the 2008 crisis and into the early part of the 2010s decade had a relatively large fiscal component but it only partially offset the loan losses in the economy rather than stimulate it the decade was generally disinflationary as this debt bubble rolled over for years by the end of the 2010s decade despite recovery in some areas including a big boom in asset prices many aspects of the economy including the industrial sector and overall labor participation rate failed to fully recover from the 2008 debacle my january newsletter called the hindsight depression covered this topic 1940s and 2020s after the 1930s decade of economic stagnation and rising political tensions around the world world war ii broke out in the 1940s this war represented an external catalyst that forced an utterly massive fiscal response from the us federal government and other governments which dwarfed the fiscal stimulus of the 1930s the us built a ton of domestic industrial production sent soldiers overseas and then when they came home eight million of them were given college education or training on government expense along with other benefits such as mortgage assistance excess industrial production was repurposed for domestic use federal budget deficits were so large and so many treasuries were issued to pay for it that the federal reserve had to create a lot of new base money to buy a big chunk of the treasury bonds on the secondary market to keep yields low also known as deficit monetization and yield curve control unlike the disinflationary 1930s this amount of fiscal spending and deficit monetization in the 1940s was highly inflationary money supply and total demand increased faster than supply could keep up with similarly as the 2020s began up private debt was still rather high in the system despite a decade of mild household deleveraging in the 2010s plus with so much wealth concentration tens of millions of people in the us couldn t go more than a month without a paycheck due to a combination of multiple factors the economy began to slow by late 2018 and throughout 2019 when covid 19 came in early 2020 and countries initiated economic shutdowns to slow the virus it caused the highly leveraged global economy to fracture a global economy with this much debt is fragile and can t persist without constant cash flow in response to the pandemic and shutdowns countries everywhere did fiscal stimulus on a scale not seen since world war ii but the us fiscal response in particular was one of the largest as a percentage of gdp dwarfing the fiscal response to the 2008 crisis as a result broad money supply grew at the quickest year over year pace since the 1940s chart source st louis fed at this point the long term debt cycle in the 2020s entered the second phase the public debt bubble portion similar to the 1940s rising wealth concentration and populism along with an external catalyst changed public and policymaker perception about fiscal deficits and the floodgates were opened in many ways the math was inevitable by this point with high debts and low interest rates a number of institutional scale asset managers were predicting years ago that the next recession would involve these sorts of unusually large fiscally driven responses based on how high debt was and how low interest rates were at this point in the long term debt cycle which would make monetary policy on its own relatively ineffective in other words the pandemic was a catalyst and an accelerant but the pieces high debt major wealth concentration and rising populism were already set such a fragile system had no defense against any external shocks and an external shock we had ray dalio co founder of bridgewater the largest hedge fund in the world described in his 2018 book big debt crises the concept of monetary policy 3 which involves blending accommodative monetary policy with fiscally driven cash infusions into the economy potentially up to and including helicopter money he popularized the concept of the long term debt cycle over the past decade then began saying that the late 2010s were in many ways like the late 1930s and by 2019 was making the case that the next recession would likely involve these monetary policy 3 responses not seen since the 1940s similarly blackrock published a paper along with stanley fisher former vice chair of the us federal reserve board of governors in 2019 that also laid out the concept of having to go direct in the next economic downturn the paper describes aggressive use of fiscal stimulus up to and including helicopter money due to the ineffectiveness of monetary policy alone at this stage and then coordinating with monetary policymakers to use financial repression to maintain low interest rates even if there is an inflationary response from the fiscal stimulus hat tip to financial analyst luke gromen for bringing that paper to my attention a few months ago money supply growth and price increases significant increases in consumer prices are generally correlated after a slight lag with a sharp and sustained increase in the broad money supply per capita these charts show the rolling 5 year percent change in broad money supply per capita in blue and the 5 year rolling percent change in the consumer price index in orange the united states the united kingdom japan australia if the broad money supply goes up quickly while commodities and other resources are abundant it doesn t necessarily cause inflation however when sharp growth in the money supply occurs alongside some degree of resource scarcity or supply chain limitations price inflation is quite likely fiscal driven inflation there are two causes for broad money supply to go up so quickly during certain periods of time either 1 banks do a lot of lending which creates deposits and expands the money multiplier or 2 the government runs large fiscal deficits and has the central bank and commercial banking system buy a lot of the debt associated with that spending this chart shows the annual change as a percentage of gdp in broad money supply bank loans and fiscal deficits to see which levers are driving changes in money supply over time the 1940s money supply growth was entirely due to massive fiscal deficits rather than bank lending inversely the 1970s money supply growth was mostly due to high levels of bank lending which was compounded by gradually rising fiscal deficits 1940s vs 1970s monetary policy response the us federal reserve responded very differently to the fiscal driven inflation of the 1940s vs the loan driven inflation of the 1970s this set of charts shows the year over year consumer price index in blue and short term interest rates in red chart source st louis fed in the 1970s public and private debt as a percentage of gdp was low money supply was increasing more so due to bank lending than due to fiscal deficits which means the inflation was mostly in the fed s court to stop thanks to low debt levels throughout the economy the fed was able to raise interest rates all the way up to double digit levels in order to slow bank lending and reduce inflation however they were not very aggressive in doing so until the end of the decade which resulted in inflation running higher and longer than they anticipated during most of the decade on the other hand public debt as a percentage of gdp was very high in the 1940s when the government s debt as a percentage of gdp is over 100 interest rates of even mid single digits would result in monstrous levels of interest relative to gdp and tax receipts resulting in a fiscal spending spiral consumer price inflation was coming in periodic spikes from fiscal spending and changing wage price controls but with high public debt levels the fed held rates low and even capped long term treasury bond rates with quantitative easing and let inflation burn hot and inflate part of the debt away anyone holding physical cash cash in a bank t bills or t bonds lost 30 50 of their purchasing power between 1941 and 1951 2020s policy response with public and private debt levels very high relative to gdp again the 2020s are shaping up directionally similar not necessarily in terms of magnitude to the 1940s in terms of how the fed is likely to respond to bursts of inflation we re in the middle of an inflationary spike while the fed commits itself to holding rates at zero and monetizing us deficits for lack of other alternatives chart source st louis fed with their new policy of average inflation targeting the fed is purposely targeting above 2 inflation levels for a period of time while holding rates at zero for a while in addition because the inflation is fiscally driven rather than loan driven the fed would see little reason to slam on the brakes immediately by raising rates if there is an inflationary spike they re sticking with the narrative that the inflation is transitory due to the fiscal response and supply chain shortages and thus not requiring an immediate policy response plus with such high government debt levels high interest rates are untenable by the end of this year the us government will have around 30 trillion in federal debt and rising for every 1 average interest rate on that debt they would owe over 300 billion in annual interest so policymakers have a strong incentive to keep rates low despite periodic inflationary events that may occur transitory inflation and supply shocks you ll often hear from policymakers or the media that inflation is transitory many types of inflation occur rapidly and then suddenly cool off indeed here s a model of what price inflation might look like this year chart source steno larsen enlund sarwe at nordea however as i described in my recent article on inflation there s a big difference between inflation that is only transitory in rate of change terms and inflation that is truly transitory in absolute terms inflation that is truly transitory in absolute terms would mean that a lot of prices go up due to a temporary supply shock of some sort and then come back down when the supply shock is over on the other hand inflation that is only transitory in rate of change terms would mean that a broad set of prices jump quickly and then stop going up quickly but never actually come back down instead they go through a permanent step wise increase in price levels and reach a new equilibrium at a higher level this first chart here shows the year over year consumer price index change aka price inflation in the 1940s indeed each inflationary spike was transitory however the second chart shows the absolute level of the consumer price index after each inflationary spike prices remained at that permanently higher plateau in other words inflation was transitory in rate of change terms but not absolute terms chart source st louis fed the current inflationary spike that we re seeing in 2021 is being dismissed as being caused by supply shocks but of course all inflationary events involve supply shocks that s one of the inherent catalysts of why inflation happens every time the 1940s had all sorts of war related commodity and labor shortages the 1970s had the oil embargo the 2020s have semiconductor shortages various commodity shortages and shipping constraints external accidental supply shocks on their own eventually result in prices returning to normal when the anomalous supply shock is resolved they involve specific goods services on the other hand rapid increases in the broad money supply that boost demand for goods and services without boosting the supply of goods and services result in supply shocks and cause price inflation as the market adjusts over time this price inflation becomes transitory in rate of change terms but with prices that ultimately settle at a higher level due to more money permanently being in the system this second type of inflation is likely what we re experiencing at this time some specific parabolic price levels will almost certainly come back down pretty far lumber s extreme price behavior for example is due to an acute sawmill bottleneck however many prices are unlikely to revert back to where they were pre 2021 many companies including procter and gamble pg and coca cola ko are raising prices due to higher input costs many commodities such as copper are unlikely to fully retrace their 2020 2021 gains chipotle cmg is unlikely to reverse the shift towards 15 average wages once it implements them these are higher equilibrium levels with a lot more money in the system and as warren buffett said at berkshire hathaway s brk b annual shareholder meeting in early may we are seeing very substantial inflation we are raising prices people are raising prices to us and it s being accepted portfolio updates i have several investment accounts and i provide updates on my asset allocation and investment selections for some of the portfolios in each newsletter issue every six weeks these portfolios include the model portfolio account specifically for this newsletter and my relatively passive indexed retirement account members of my premium research service also have access to three additional model portfolios and my other holdings with more frequent updates i use a free account at personal capital to easily keep track of all my accounts and monitor my net worth m1 finance newsletter portfolio i started this account in september 2018 with 10k of new capital and i put new money in regularly currently i put in 1 000 per month it s one of my smallest accounts but the goal is for the portfolio to be accessible and to show newsletter readers my best representation of where i think value is in the market it s a low turnover multi asset globally diversified portfolio that focuses on liquid investments and is scalable to virtually any size i chose m1 finance because their platform is commission free and allows for a combo of etf and individual stock selection with automatic and or manual rebalancing it makes for a great model portfolio with high flexibility and it s the investment platform i recommend to most people see my disclosure policy here regarding my affiliation with m1 and here s the breakdown of the holdings in those slices changes since the previous issue i made very few changes since the april newsletter since the portfolio has generally been well positioned for this environment i ve been emphasizing gold stocks a bit more recently as they showed signs of bottoming in recent months while trimming some of the high flying commodity producers like nucor steel nue and buying more stocks in the healthcare sector the energy sector looks good going forward as well from a long term perspective m1 finance doesn t have an option to hold bitcoin i hold bitcoin in cold storage primary retirement portfolio my retirement portfolio consists of index funds that automatically rebalance themselves regularly and i rarely make changes here s the allocation today from 2010 through 2016 this account was aggressively positioned with 90 in equities and enjoyed the long bull market starting in 2017 in order to preserve capital i dialed my equity allocation down to 60 40 domestic 20 foreign and increased allocations to short term bonds and cash to 40 this was due to higher stock valuations and being later in the market cycle more generally after equities took a big hit in q1 2020 i shifted some of the bonds back to equities and it is now 71 equities 46 domestic 25 foreign and short term bonds and cash is now down to 29 for my tsp readers this is equivalent to the 2040 lifecycle fund this is an example of a portfolio strategy that takes a rather hands off approach but that still makes a tactical adjustment every few years if needed based on market conditions which reduces volatility and makes the retirement account feel less like a casino than many indices these days this employer based retirement account is limited to a very small number of funds to invest in so my flexibility is limited compared to my other accounts i would for example have more exposure to precious metals commodities and digital assets in that account if it were an option other model portfolios and accounts i have three other real money model portfolios that i share within my premium research service including fortress income portfolio etf only portfolio no limits portfolio plus i have larger personal accounts at fidelity and schwab and i share those within the service as well final thoughts navigating the 2020s in this environment i m generally more bullish on stocks that traditionally fall in the value side of the spectrum energy producers and transporters financial institutions industrial companies gold miners and pharmaceutical companies all look reasonably valued and are benefitting from a pro inflationary environment i like certain growth stocks as well but selectively indeed there has been somewhat of a growth to value rotation similar to the early 2000s this chart is the ratio of the russell 1000 value index to the russell 1000 growth index whenever it s going up it means value is outperforming and whenever it is going down it means growth is outperforming the late 2010s look a lot like the late 1990s in terms of equity sector performance and macro factors both environments had a strengthening dollar low commodity prices and major tech growth sector outperformance when the reversal occurred in the early 2000s it led to over half a decade of a weakening dollar strengthening commodities value equity outperformance and international stock outperformance my base case is to see a similar outcome in the 2020s however i expect the 2020s to be a bumpy ride fluctuating periods of aggressive or nonexistent fiscal policy will likely play the leading role in inflationary spikes and inflationary cool off periods the fed mostly has to keep rates low regardless of what inflation does dismissing it as transitory and supply chain related but they could have periods of time where they briefly try to tighten and slow things down before reverting course and turning dovish again when something breaks so we need to stay on our toes monitor economic indicators in rate of change terms and focus on quality businesses at good valuations two years ago near the end of the past business cycle a number of magazines started to run covers about inflation being a thing of the past here in mid 2021 inflation is becoming a popular theme on magazine covers like most things i expect this will get overplayed for periods of time i d suggest fading headlines and parabolic commodity price spikes lumber prices for example already hit extremely high levels and in recent days have been turning back down that s not a commodity i m particularly bullish on from current elevated levels however i think it s worth keeping an eye on things that haven t truly broken out yet like the energy sector and the gold industry some of these areas have long runways of ahead of them in my view within the past month parts of the world are still undergoing rolling lockdowns and virus case spikes so some aspects of the global economy like the energy market aren t even fully recovered yet best regards

penticton news these 12 b c mines pose risks to salmon caribou water report image credit adobe stock b c s mineral resources are sought after to support the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy but the province s mining rules and regulations some of which date back to the 1800s have left a patchwork of dangerous and polluting mines across the province according to a new report released monday by skeenawild conservation trust and the bc mining law reform network the report highlights 12 operating closed and proposed mines in b c that are either currently polluting or have high potential to do so we agree to environmental harms when we agree to mining but they can be better regulated and we can have measures in place so that communities and watersheds are less at risk nikki skuce director of northern confluence and co founder of the bc mining law reform network said in an interview the dozen mines featured in the report were chosen based on criteria including existing or likely environmental impacts management of contaminants including contaminated waste and inadequate funding for reclamation while the report calls attention to numerous problems with how the province currently oversees the mining industry it also highlights the potential for solutions we hope the report raises awareness and we hope that the government takes action to start implementing some solutions skuce said adding that the province recently committed to ensuring that all proponents of large industrial projects are held financially responsible so taxpayers aren t left on the hook for cleaning up abandoned projects but skuce cautioned that the province needs to do more to reduce environmental impacts and eliminate the violation of indigenous rights given interest to promote themselves as a responsible mining jurisdiction they need to ensure that they are implementing the declaration on the rights of indigenous people when it comes to mining she said the ministry of energy mines and low carbon innovation did not respond to an interview request 1 elk valley coal mines teck s elk valley mining operations in southeast b c recently earned the coal giant a 60 million fine for selenium and calcite contamination of the fording river a tributary of the elk river as the narwhal recently reported the pollution persists and with major expansions to the company s operations planned or underway the problems will likely increase at this point it has gotten so bad that management goal is just to stabilize the level of pollution in downstream waters not even to reduce it adrienne berchtold lead author of the report told the narwhal in an interview in terms of solutions it s kind of a tough one because they are so deep into this problem and it s an expensive fix to try and develop these technologies that don t even exist yet she said adding that at the very least the company should not be permitted to expand its operations until a solution is found teck is also short by more than 500 million in estimated reclamation costs according to the 2019 chief inspector of mines annual report were teck to default in any way on those expenses that massive price tag would fall to the taxpayers berchtold said that s clearly a huge problem that needs to be addressed 2 gibraltar mine in 2019 the province gave permission to gibraltar mine a massive open pit copper mine in central b c to increase its tailings effluent discharge into the fraser river to around 24 million litres daily between november and april a decision bitterly contested by the tsilhqot in nation which is concerned about the impacts to salmon and endangered white sturgeon populations the taseko owned mine has been operating since 1972 and has never undergone environmental assessment according to the report the mine has also expanded its operating size but the province has yet to revise the estimated cost of reclamation on march 22 2021 the company received a non compliance report from the province s environmental protection division for unauthorized discharge of contaminated water berchtold explained the mine s problem is its tailings facility has a surplus of water which it has to discharge somewhere at the very least taseko could build a water treatment plant to at least improve the quality of this excess water they have on site that they have to release somewhere in the receiving environment 3 copper mountain mine like gibraltar the copper mountain mine located just south of the town of princeton never underwent environmental assessment according to the report the mine currently discharges 60 litres per second of treated wastewater into the similkameen river which flows south across the border into critical habitat for steelhead and salmon including endangered chinook salmon populations as well as its treated wastewater discharges the mine is leaking contaminated water at a rate of 54 litres per second or 4 6 million litres per day as the narwhal recently reported the province slapped the company with a 51 000 fine last november for exceeding discharge limits and unauthorized discharges the mine continues to receive non compliance orders including two issued in march the company has a proposed expansion currently under review that if approved would increase the height of its tailings dam to 255 metres over six times the height of the mount polley dam it s an earthen dam and the consequences of it failing are already extreme and obviously with the expansion those risks get astronomical berchtold said the report noted that given the mine s history of environmental impacts and the risks associated with the expansion the province should require an environmental assessment before deciding whether to approve or reject the plan berchtold added that given the mine s abysmal track record of non compliance the province should consider rejecting any expansions we re suggesting that they should consider denying those future authorizations to these companies that have poor records of environmental and social responsibility 4 willow creek brule wolverine mines three coal mines in northeast b c owned by conuma coal resources currently operate in the middle of endangered caribou habitat mining activity in the region has contributed to the decline of the species through habitat loss and fragmentation wolverine mine is poised to expand its operations which will impact saulteau and west moberley first nations recovery plans for the iconic species this is a clear example of situations in which the way the industry is regulated really promotes industrial development at the expense of conservation and first nations interests berchtold said she noted that the usual justification for developing mines doesn t add up here a lot of the time the reason that these mines go ahead is because they re supposed to stimulate the economy create jobs and bring in money she said referring to a recent report by the canadian centre for policy alternatives that used conuma s three coal mines in the peace river region to illustrate how that s not always the case this report shows that they actually don t do that the costs such as possible extinction of caribou really don t outweigh the benefits that are promised because they re over promised 5 mount polley mine mount polley is the poster child for catastrophic mining impacts to the environment in 2014 the mine s tailings dam failed and around 25 million cubic metres of contaminated material spilled into a salmon watershed after the event an independent panel investigated the disaster and made a series of recommendations to the province of which only a handful have been implemented according to a recent analysis by the first nations energy and mining council the mine s owner imperial metals has never been fined for the ecological disaster which continues to impact spawning sockeye salmon populations 6 shasta baker mine when the auditor general released a damning report of the province s failure to adequately monitor and enforce the mining industry it noted that sable resources the former owner of a small gold mine in northwest b c remained in non compliance for months despite repeated warnings issued by inspectors the shasta baker mine now owned by tdg gold went into care and maintenance in 2012 meaning it s not currently operating but nor is it completely closed berchtold said mines in care and maintenance are low priority for the owners they re just sort of on pause berchtold said if they re not making money then the owners aren t really that invested and that s why they ve gone into care and maintenance in the first place is because they re not economically viable the report noted the mine poses significant risks to the surrounding environment and to the plant and animal resources the takla first nation rely on for subsistence and cultural purposes and the extent of those risks and potential pollution is largely unknown they ve got a laundry list of environmental monitoring and management plans and tailings facility management plans that were due to the government that still have not been submitted berchtold said they haven t been performing water quality monitoring they haven t been performing any kind of comprehensive environmental monitoring a 2017 dam inspection and subsequent report recommended that the tailings facility be permanently closed and highlighted risks associated with delaying noting that the site doesn t have a backup plan to prevent the tailings from spilling into the environment in storm events their tailings facility is built with upstream dam construction which is really risky berchtold said explaining the mine is a prime candidate for the province to live up to its goal of reducing the number of high risk tailings facilities by stepping in and ordering the final closure 7 tulsequah chief a little mine in the far northwest corner of b c has been polluting the tulsequah river a tributary of the taku river for over 60 years the tulsequah chief mine has a long history of multiple owners failing to clean up the pollution problems the most recent owner is chieftain metals a company that declared bankruptcy in 2016 the province has started the process to clean up the site and permanently close it but the work is hampered by court proceedings as one of chieftain s creditors west face capital attempts to recoup its losses the province has not said who will pay the estimated 48 million upfront reclamation costs not to mention tens of millions of dollars in water treatment and monitoring costs over the next 100 years and mining critics often cite the mine as perfect example of why the province needs to ensure mining companies are held financially responsible from the outset 8 yellow giant mine on banks island south of prince rupert on gitxaala first nation territory an abandoned gold mine continues to leak contaminants into a wetland which then drains into the surrounding marine environment yellow giant mine was formerly owned by banks island gold a company that declared bankruptcy in 2016 after the province discovered it had been intentionally dumping waste into creeks lakes and wetlands on the island it was a bit of a wild west mentality where they were on this island and no one was really overseeing them berchtold said they didn t receive any inspections for over a year after getting their permits to begin operating and in that time they just broke the rules the project never received an environmental assessment as its intended production did not meet provincial thresholds to trigger that process they ensured that their production threshold was just under the limit that would have triggered environmental assessment she said it s a good example of why environmental assessments should be performed on all mines 9 bell and granisle mines at glencore s closed bell and granisle mines on lake babine in northwest b c the province permits the company to discharge untreated water at one of its discharge sites with copper concentrations that are on average 20 times higher than the provincial guidelines for the protection of aquatic life and nearly 250 times higher than the threshold for negative effects on salmon according to a recent report published by skeenawild and lake babine nation as the narwhal recently reported the lake supports about 90 per cent of all skeena sockeye salmon and the company is not monitoring its impacts on the species 10 anyox mine the true nature of anyox is something of a mystery the long abandoned copper mine located on nisga a territory near stewart operated between 1914 and 1936 the province recently told the narwhal in an emailed statement that the site has known acid rock drainage issues which is toxic to fish and other aquatic life according to the report during its operations the mine and its on site smelter dumped its waste directly into the ocean berchtold said the lack of information about anyox is a problem she encountered with numerous abandoned mines across the province when researching the extent of mining related pollution there were almost a third of them that i couldn t find any information on and anyox is one of them she said there are certainly no publicly available government records about the mine we are just pushing for more transparency and obviously some action 11 ksm mine seabridge gold received an environmental assessment certificate in 2014 for its proposed ksm mine in northwest b c if built the mine would have a tailings facility that would hold 2 3 billion tonnes of covered tailings above two important salmon watersheds the proposed volume of their tailings facilities is just mind bending berchtold said according to the report the potential impacts to the unuk river watershed which is a transboundary river flowing from b c to alaska include elevated selenium berchtold said the transboundary issue puts the downstream communities in an unfair position the people who are going to experience the impacts are barely involved in development and permitting of the project itself she said 12 giant copper mine the so called doughnut hole in southern b c is a pocket of land surrounded by provincial parks the area is home to at risk species including spotted owls grizzly bears and chinook salmon imperial metals the mining company responsible for the mount polley disaster owns mineral tenures on the land and is planning to conduct exploratory work as the narwhal reported in 2019 the plans are being met with fierce opposition on both sides of the border berchtold said given the high profile nature of the opposition she doesn t expect a mine will ever be built but the conflict is an apt illustration of the need for reforms to provincial legislation there aren t any opportunities in the mineral tenure act as it stands right now for mineral tenures to be retired or to expire in some way she said it really makes it clear how industry is prioritized over other land uses like conservation and over first nations rights and title this story was updated at 2 38 p m may 19 2021 to clarify that at risk steelhead and salmon habitat threatened by the copper mountain mine is in the okanagan columbia watershed not the similkameen river itself as previously reported this story was originally published by the narwhal
in the past global investing has not always been something that seemed readily accessible to malaysians expensive transaction fees and high starting capital made investing in foreign markets inconvenient but technological advancements are beginning to bridge the gap between malaysian retail investors and global markets according to focus malaysia malaysians had shown keen interest in global tech stocks on an investment portal with us based semiconductor company advanced micro devices amd a popular stock having recorded a 114 increase in trading in april last year branching out to

weeks before president joe biden boosted proterra with an official tour of its plant the electric battery company hired a pair of obama administration alums to lobby the white house for funding amplifying its already concerning political connections to the biden administration according to disclosure forms filed last friday the politically connected electric bus manufacturer brought on lobbying firm boundary stone partners on april 1 to push the administration for increased funding of clean energy infrastructure projects including the electrification of mass transportation vehicles the two lobbyists registered to proterra pete gould and christine turner both worked in the top echelons of the obama administration gould was associate director of government affairs for the department of transportation and turner held numerous trade related positions throughout the administration including on the white house national security council atop the lobbying firm sits brandon hurlbut who was chief of staff at the department of energy and a top energy adviser to obama at the white house hurlbut additionally co chaired clean energy for biden a group that raised millions of dollars for biden s presidential campaign and is now advocating clean energy spending along with hurlbut both gould and turner made several contributions to biden s campaign according to campaign finance records proterra s political connections to the administration had already raised ethical flags on capitol hill due to the fact that jennifer granholm biden s energy secretary spent years on proterra s board and continues to own up to 5 million in proterra stock the acquisition of the former obama officials shows proterra has even deeper political connections than were previously known the lobbying disclosure form is boundary stone partners first for proterra which joins a number of renewable energy companies already employing the firm to lobby the biden administration it has not yet been disclosed how much proterra is paying boundary stone partners neither responded to requests for comment the disclosure form says gould and turner are lobbying on the topics of unding for transit infrastructure grants provisions related to low or no emission vehicle grant applications clean energy and infrastructure investments surface transportation reauthorization vehicle fleet electrification and manufacturing loan programs lobbying records show gould has lobbied on similar issues for proterra since last december as a lobbyist for a different firm catapult policy strategies which he left to join boundary stone partners just 19 days after the firm was brought on biden and his top economic adviser brian deese toured proterra and pledged that the administration s infrastructure plan would direct money to the company it is more than likely that hurlbut directly engaged with proterra as a member of the obama administration in his official boundary stone partners biography he boasts that he led the obama administration s deployment of 90 billion worth of clean energy grants through the stimulus package proterra says its first electric bus was manufactured in 2009 due to government funds it received from the obama administration the administration s promotion of proterra has sparked conflict of interest concerns from republican senators who have called for investigations into granholm s planned divestment from the company financial disclosures show the former proterra board member still holds up to 5 million in company stock granholm has repeatedly said she is in the process of offloading the shares and that she has recused herself from any issues regarding the company senators have raised questions about how her complete separation is possible given granholm s leadership on the issue of electric batteries biden signed an executive order that placed granholm in charge of identifying risks in the supply chain for high capacity batteries including electric vehicle batteries and policy recommendations to address these risks under granholm the department of energy is slated to dole out millions of dollars to support improvements in domestic manufacturing to build resilient modern electricity infrastructure and address the climate emergency during the 2020 election cycle employees of boundary stone partners gave at least 27 000 to biden s campaign and related entities including the biden victory fund according to fec records the white house did not respond to a request for comment about whether proterra hiring the obama alums played any role in the administration s repeated boosts of the company

for joining us today first of all i would like to provide a brief overview of our first quarter 2021 results i will then discuss our key achievements and notable awards in the quarter before i turn over the call to daniel juergens our cfo who will review our first quarter 2021 financial performance in more detail and provide our outlook for the second quarter of 2021 and the full year as we discussed last quarter we have been focused on our on growing our footprint and revenue in the automotive segment translating new design wins during this quarter extending our visibility and backlog for the following years on top of the automotive business we could convert more design wins into revenue and as a result we are pleased to report that we achieved our first quarter revenue of 41 3 million representing a year over year growth of 60 7 following our plan we continued to diversify our revenue and increase our sales in the automotive and industrial end markets we continue to see a large opportunity in both sectors as the total number of displays with features that we are providing including cameras and the use of glass as a design element that s steadily increasing as we noted on our prior earnings call we increased our spending in critical areas of r d and accelerated hiring to take advantage of the opportunity to engage into new projects with existing and new customers despite the current labor market we have been able to secure critical talent at a much faster rate than initially planned these employees are being matched with the new designing opportunities that we have with our new customers simultaneously we are aggressively ramping our production to meet the increased demand from our customers particularly in the with our automotive clients many of these hires were to support our new manufacturing facility in germany which we anticipate will be completed next quarter as you know there s a global shortage in the semiconductors in markets and other critical components the combination of higher input costs which could not be immediately offset and passed on to our customers and our increased hiring better dampening effect on our ebitda for the current quarter as a result ebitda remained flat compared to the prior year period at eur 1 3 million we consider this impact to be short term in nature and we are hopeful that the component shortage will ease over the next few quarters additionally to minimize the financial impact we have taken initiatives to pass corresponding cost increases to our customers now i d like to turn to some of our key achievements and awards in the first quarter the total unit shipments which include display sensors and cameras rose 35 over the prior year period we had another design win with the u s electric vehicle manufacturer for surround view camera system we had multiple design wins in the industrial and consumer sector including four awards in the commercial segment alone the commercial segment covers notebooks and tablets used for outdoors outdoor applications like in the military field our partnership with corning continues to proceed well we reached all our milestones last year and it looks like we will overachieve our expectations this year as well so overall the cooperation has led to rapid adoption of the cold form technology bringing us into a leadership position as of today we have five design wins for our cold form technology including one new design win that we secured in the first quarter with a chinese automaker for dual display module for high end ev vehicles all our cold form design wins have included special cover lens shapes as well as multiple displays behind the cover glass following the overall trend of integrating dashboard electronics behind one piece of glass instead of individual displays in the corporate we have a strong track record in the ev market with nearly 10 ev customers with some customers we have design wins with multiple models this is in europe as well as in asia and in the u s we believe our strategic shift to focus on the automotive market especially e vehicles and the industrial market has proved to be very successful so far we will continue pursuing these opportunities and will push for higher system level awards with our increased investments in r d capacity we are well positioned to take advantage of and encouraged by the anticipated growth in the ev market which is predicted to grow 50 to 70 annually in summary we are reiterating our full year guidance for at least 20 year over year revenue growth we believe that the overall market opportunity represents an even higher potential looking ahead we will continue to execute on our strategy of increasing our sales in auto and industrial markets leveraging our sensor and camera capabilities to deliver system solutions while expanding the number and size of our projects within our existing customer base we will also evaluate m a opportunities that would complement our current technology portfolio or add capacity we continue to believe that the quality of our growing pipeline combined with a good visibility from increased auto industrial projects positions us well for continued growth in 2021 and beyond with that i will now turn over to daniel juergens to discuss our financial results and outlook in more detail daniel daniel juergens chief financial officer thank you juergen and good morning everyone i m daniel juergens cfo of via optronics i ll start by reviewing our financial and operation performance for the first quarter and then provide our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2021 as expected q1 showed a slightly lower revenue as q4 as every year reflecting the seasonality of the consumer business however total revenue in the first quarter of 2021 was 41 3 million up 60 7 from 25 7 million in the first quarter of 2020 which was driven by increased sales across business even considering the impact of covid during q1 last year this would still remain a significant growth total display solutions revenues was 35 6 million in the first quarter of 21 up 71 2 from 20 8 million in the first quarter of 2020 growth was driven by increasing demand in all end markets particularly in consumer display solutions revenue represented approximately 86 of total revenues in the first quarter compared to 81 in q1 of 2020 within our display solutions segment revenue from our automotive customers grew 131 year over year in the first quarter and accounted for 29 of revenues compared to 21 in the first quarter 2020 revenue related to the industrial and specialized applications end market grew 15 year over year and accounted for 41 of revenue compared to 61 of the revenue in the first quarter of 2020 revenue related to our consumer end market increased 188 year over year and represented 30 of revenue compared to 17 of revenue in the first quarter of 2020 total sensor technology revenue was 5 7 million in the first quarter of 2021 up 16 3 from 4 9 million in q1 of last year sensor technology revenue represented approximately 14 of total revenue compared to 19 in q1 of 2020 total company gross profit margin for the first quarter of 2021 was 11 4 compared to 17 1 in the first quarter of 2020 our display solutions gross profit margin was 9 8 in q1 2021 compared to 19 2 in q1 2020 the decrease in our gross margin was driven by increased hiring for our new plant in germany in advance of an anticipated ramp in production and mix shifted toward lower margin products in the quarter led by strong growth in our consumer end markets and a strategic decision we made last year to reduce licensing our technology to protect our strong market position our sensor technology gross margin was 21 1 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 8 2 in the first quarter of prior year the increased gross profit margin was due to increased revenue in q1 2021 compared to q1 2020 while fixed costs remained flat year over year turning to expenses total operating expenses excluding offset from other operating income in q1 were 9 5 million or 23 of total revenue which compares to 5 4 million or 21 of the total revenue in the first quarter of 2020 the increase was driven primarily by increased spending in the research and development and our general administration expenses for the quarter we have increased our g a spend as we prepare for further growth that we are expecting especially in the even more complex environment of the automotive industry we are continuing to further strengthen our organization to meet these growth opportunities our expectations research and development expenses were 1 million or 2 4 of total revenue in q1 2021 which compares to 600 000 or 2 3 of total revenue in the first quarter of 2020 looking ahead we expect continued investments in r d as we opportunistically add talent to support the development of more complex solutions ebitda in the first quarter of 2021 was 1 3 million essentially flat with 1 3 million in the first quarter of 2020 we recorded a net loss in the first quarter of 2021 of 1 1 million which compares to a net loss of 4 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 based on a weighted average share count of 4 53 million shares in the first quarter of 2021 this translates to a base diluted net loss of eur 0 24 per share in the first quarter of 2021 compared to net loss of eur 0 92 per share in q4 of 2020 turning to the balance sheet we ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 74 4 million and total debt of 26 8 million turning to our outlook for the second quarter of 2021 we expect total revenue of 44 million to 46 million for full year 2021 we continue to expect revenue growth of at least 20 compared to 2020 these projections reflect continued uncertainties related to the ongoing impact of covid 19 as well as increased cost of raw materials and component in part constraints which may affect our customer and potentially impact our revenues overall we are pleased with our strong start to the year as demonstrated by the significant growth in revenue we are focused on the large market opportunity ahead of us particularly in the auto and industrial markets which also require further investments in r d and production this concludes my prepared remarks i will now turn the call back to the operator to open up the line for questions thank you operator questions answers operator the first question comes from the line of anthony stoss with craig hallum please go ahead anthony stoss craig hallum capital group llc analyst good morning guys i have several questions juergen for starters the plant now being scheduled to open in q3 i think that was versus q2 so maybe one quarter later maybe you can update us first off on the status with your north american ev maker if you commenced volume shipments or if you re still at the prototype level and then for daniel can you help us understand a little bit better the gross margin i understand you re hiring more people related to the plant opening in q3 what do you expect gross margin to be for the june quarter and any thoughts on where gross margin should maybe exit calendar 2021 then i had a couple of follow ups after that juergen eichner chief executive officer yes let me start with the q3 so there s a delay in our factory readiness this basically is caused by the equipment manufacturer that we have however we have we can overcome that by producing more units in china so it doesn t affect the overall annual quantity but it delays the start of production in germany so business wise it s not it will not impact the overall revenue however it will delay the production here and that s basically why i indicated the q3 anthony stoss craig hallum capital group llc analyst could you go ahead daniel i ll follow up i ll come back daniel juergens chief financial officer ok so thanks for the question it s a good question if you look on the development of the gross margin in q1 this year we had some impact on the margin coming from several items one is that we have been reduced one time revenues from the reimbursement of nre costs we had a change in the revenue mix this is the biggest impact on the gross margin and we have seen lower licensing revenues than we had in the previous year in 2020 this has strategic reasons we want to protect our ip and therewith we are reducing our very high margin licensing revenues but this is a strategic decision i think it is very helpful in the future even if it costs us some margin points currently and last but not least what was impacting the current quarter was the increase in material costs due to the shortages of course in semiconductor and things like that but also in all other areas everything is getting much more expensive than before and you are always not in the position to fully shift all these costs to the customers that quickly and this will come during the second and third quarter and last but not least the freight costs increased significantly also to the high end of the customers and the shortage of materials we have been seeing higher air freight rates that also have been affecting our gross margin coming to the question our q2 looking i think from today s perspective q2 is getting a little better but not coming back to the ratio we have seen in q4 for example but we hope that with the change in our revenue mix during the rest of the year what we plan we will get back to the high gross margin that we have seen in q4 2020 for example but as we said in the earnings call for the full year 2020 we will give on the earnings and on the gross margin ebitda in the call of the second quarter does it answer your question anthony stoss craig hallum capital group llc analyst yes yes that s helpful thank you and then just circling back here again to my question your comment about having some equipment technical issues maybe for the plants in germany is that have you produced with your relationship with corning anything on the cold form side yet and maybe help us understand the nature of the technical issues and how easy they are to be ironed out and whether or not this holds back some of the design wins you re hoping to have related to cold form juergen eichner chief executive officer no it doesn t hold up any design wins we have cold form i mean i don t know whether we have mentioned that before but i think we are the only company in the world having cold form products already in production in mass production so that doesn t impact us the technical difficulties are more related to we had to bring the equipment over from china the chinese manufacturer has actually has to adjust it to the european standard so they had some well let s say difficulties to adjust so they have to do right now some rewiring and things like that so it s not i mean it s i m not so happy about that because we wanted to ramp up earlier but luckily it doesn t impact us not in our overall capacity nor does it impact us in any way in terms of acquiring new projects or something anthony stoss craig hallum capital group llc analyst ok that sounds good and then my last question related to your comments in your prepared remarks talking about with the north american ev maker new surround camera system win can you give us a sense of when you might start producing for that and is it for one socket or multiple sockets in the vehicles juergen eichner chief executive officer so this one is for so it s so we have the surround view is basically for cameras right and this is for one vehicle right now and we so this is we expect so according to the customer they want to start production end of the year which sounds a bit early to me but we will be happy if we if that works out so it s a very short design cycle it will be good if it works out this year but i m not planning for it anthony stoss craig hallum capital group llc analyst got it perfect thanks guys best of luck juergen eichner chief executive officer maybe one word also to the semiconductor shortage if you would have asked me three months ago i would have said we have not been impacted so right now we have been impacted with mainly with cost increases and it takes just a while to basically negotiate with the customer to adjust the price so and this is you this is why daniel said it takes a little while so it s not that the customers don t want it of course nobody wants higher cost but it s not that they are not willing to adjust anthony stoss craig hallum capital group llc analyst thank you operator the next question comes from the line of andrew buscaglia with berenberg please go ahead andrew buscaglia berenberg capital markets analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question can you talk about a little bit more about some of the customer wins how many of these are new relative to last quarter i believe you said in ev there s 10 customers you have wins on numerous models can you kind of update us what s changed versus last quarter like maybe you can in order of magnitude what are the size of these new wins are they big projects or small and medium anything you can any color you can give us would be great juergen eichner chief executive officer so all of these wins are i would say significant camera opportunities are usually a little bit less but whenever you talk about cold form it s usually a significant design win if you look over the last so in average i would say since last year you can say in average you have one design win group per quarter roughly in this market this is what we see doesn t say that it has to be one for the quarter but this is what we re currently seeing as the rate most important is for me that these design wins are also with new customers and they have more projects and this is an incubation project for us so it s a design win yes but it s also an incubation project to this customer and to get more business for example the one in china this is right now where we are in the high end car if that is successful then we would get the mid range as well the mid range is a significant higher quantity so these are all for us they are nice projects but they are also door openers andrew buscaglia berenberg capital markets analyst ok and for the most part you expect production on these to begin before year end juergen eichner chief executive officer that on to be honest on this one on the recent one the recent cold form i think it s next year i need to check that but i think it s next year andrew buscaglia berenberg capital markets analyst yes go ahead sorry no go ahead sorry juergen eichner chief executive officer the other one that i mentioned so starting to be high end going into the mid end this will follow shortly after so that s probably be also on next year andrew buscaglia berenberg capital markets analyst ok so you got your 2021 guidance isn t contingent upon these reaching production yet juergen eichner chief executive officer no no they have not been included in the 2021 guidance yet to that extent andrew buscaglia berenberg capital markets analyst ok got it can you talk about is there in terms of you guys touched on m a that s an area you d like to allocate some capital to has anything changed versus last quarter in terms of your outlook there or now that the pandemic is kind of relieving juergen eichner chief executive officer no the only thing which has changed is that we wanted to close it this quarter and sorry last quarter and now we are closing in this quarter so you will hear about it in the next earnings call we are very close to closing it andrew buscaglia berenberg capital markets analyst ok and can you comment on the kind of the nature of the of the potential acquisition is it small large or anything you can indicate juergen eichner chief executive officer it s a smaller acquisition it s basically we are looking more into basically how should i say that to have a systems integration company so as the products that we are bringing in the displays the cameras and so on and so forth they have to interact with the automotive electronic system so you have to have interfaces you have to provide software you have to provide user interfaces and also upfront you might be required to integrate part of what you have not the final products but part of what you have in the car to test it in the car so and this is the kind of company we are acquiring and it s a well established company especially here in south of germany with some carmakers there which may give you an idea andrew buscaglia berenberg capital markets analyst ok and lastly i just want to clarify with the large ev u s ev project that you we thought would have commenced by now it sounds like that s more q3 that s more on that ev maker i was a bit confused about the nature of the delays is it the ev maker that kind of delaying things or is it more around on your end juergen eichner chief executive officer there were delays in the ev maker because the i don t know if you read the news you probably know that there were some other parts of the car not ready so they were missing parts so they re actually delayed a little bit and the what we are seeing right now is really it s really the it s the integration part of the equipment so the overall and we also see a lot of changes in the we have seen a lot of changes in the development process we still see changes going on actually to be honest we are already working on the next design with them already so this is not to get fully in production but we re already working on the next generation we ve been asked to provide already samples and demos for two other lines that they have so this is actually pretty very well progressing it absorbs a lot a lot of people and manpower and this is why we are continuously hiring faste faster than expected luckily right now we get people it was a lot i don t know why but it was a lot harder last year this year it seems easier i don t know why andrew buscaglia berenberg capital markets analyst ok interesting yes so presumably it is all temporary yes the delays are temporary it seems like the long term outlook this customer is still very strong and nothing has changed the fact that if anything things are changing for the better long term juergen eichner chief executive officer no it s all good and it s actually what s happening right now we re getting at the beginning was discussions about new models and now we are talking about the model so we know what models they are we are providing samples i mentioned initially that we see a lot of demand in oled so this is also related to that it s at the end of the day the opportunity becomes bigger and bigger and actually to be honest also very exciting right now because it s a different kind of i mean oleds are not that common in the car and this is something which will obtain

the united states has generated more heat trapping carbon pollution than any other nation but it has not felt the impact of climate change in equal measure poorer countries in warmer latitudes are enduring the most devastating droughts heatwaves and violent storms and seeing more poverty disease and mass migration as a result by doing so much to fuel climate change the united states has incurred a massive debt to the developing world and there is no easy way to pay down the balance president biden is trying but in a country that is largely opposed to more foreign assistance he faces significant hurdles to ramping up aid he recently promised to spend 5 7 billion a year to help developing countries cope with climate change but that sum is far from sufficient as critics were quick to point out the white house however is also exploring other less direct means of providing relief among them a major change to immigration policy that could give a measurable boost to countries hard hit by climate disasters biden recently directed his national security adviser to study ways to resettle people displaced by climate change while democrats in congress introduced a bill that would create a pathway for climate migrants to make a new home in the united states such protections would not only benefit the migrants themselves but also the countries they left behind by relocating to wealthier countries in cooler regions migrants have the opportunity to make more money and to send a portion of their paycheck to family back home research shows that through remittances they can help people in developing countries better navigate the fallout from climate disasters for a 2018 study researchers at the university of ghana asked locals how they were using remittances to cope with climate change fishers facing diminishing fish stocks used remittances to buy new nets and repair canoes while growers coping with less predictable rainfall built water tanks and purchased fertiliser one man used the money his nephew sent him to buy a cell phone so he could get weather updates and know when to plant his crops another used money his son sent him to make small loans to cashew farmers allowing him to help local growers while turning a small profit the findings authors wrote should provoke a new global debate on climate refugees by making regular cash transfers climate migrants can provide relatives with a basic income allowing them to pay for food shelter and medical care even in the midst of a disaster or an economic downturn migrants can also directly fund projects to guard against climate change such as new wells to help farmers cope with droughts or levees to protect against floods a recent study from princeton university modelled future migration in a world with more open borders and a world with closed borders to compare the movement of people and the flow of remittances predictably they found that in a world with more open borders more people would migrate from africa asia central america and the pacific to europe and the united states to escape climate change the effect of the resulting remittances would be profound while climate change is expected to stunt gdp in developing countries allowing people to move more freely around the world would soften the blow the study determined that more open borders could boost gdp per capita in central america and southeast asia by more than 2 per cent as migrants wire money home of course remittances are far from a perfect or even sufficient means of helping poorer countries cope with climate disasters so long as climate migrants are sending money home they will have to work harder to build wealth in their adoptive countries they will in effect continue to bear the burden of climate change but given that climate migration is inevitable and already underway remittances are just one more reason to allow people uprooted by disasters to immigrate to the united states by 2050 climate change could dislocate as many as 3 9 million people in mexico and central america in a new white paper on migration from central america experts from harvard law school yale law school and the university network for human rights call on lawmakers to create a temporary visa for people displaced by climate change and that visa could offer a pathway to a green card or citizenship biden could champion this model politically such a move would be difficult on few other issues are democrats and republicans more divided than on climate change and immigration republicans are highly sceptical to put it mildly of both making it easier for climate migrants to move to the united states would likely spark harsh republican opposition and in an era of negative partisanship democrats success in the 2022 midterm elections may depend less on mobilising friendly voters than on not giving republicans a reason to head to the polls at the same time biden has promised to take a government wide approach to the climate crisis that means using every available lever of power to tackle the issue including updating immigration policy crucially by offering refuge to climate migrants he would be able to reassert us leadership on a key issue a un panel ruled last year that countries cannot deport refugees who are facing immediate threats from climate change in their home country but the ruling is nonbinding and it s not clear who should be counted as a climate refugee the question is so thorny that currently no country offers formal protections to people displaced by climate change the united states could be the first creating a model for other wealthy nations to follow doing so would likely be administratively challenging and politically costly but it would also go some way to settling america s climate debt this story was published with permission from nexus media
