the tumultuous saga of elon musk s on again off again purchase of twitter took a turn toward a conclusion tuesday after the mercurial tesla ceo proposed to buy the company at the originally agreed on price of 44 billion musk made the proposal in a letter to twitter that the company disclosed in a filing tuesday with the u s securities and exchange commission it came less than two weeks before a trial between the two parties was scheduled to start in delaware in a statement twitter said it intends to close the transaction at 54 20 per share after receiving the letter from musk trading in twitter s stock which had been halted for much of the day pending release of the news resumed late tuesday and soared 22 to close at 52 musk s proposal is the latest twist in a high profile saga involving the world s richest man and one of the most influential social media platforms much of the drama has played out on twitter itself with musk who has more than 100 million followers lamenting that the company was failing to live up to its potential as a platform for free speech a letter from musk s lawyer dated monday and disclosed by twitter in a securities filing said musk would close the merger signed in april provided that the delaware chancery court enter an immediate stay of twitter s lawsuit against him and adjourn the trial scheduled to start october 17 by completing the deal musk essentially gave twitter what it was seeking from the court specific performance of the contract with musk meaning he would have to go through with the purchase at the original price the contract musk signed also has a 1 billion breakup fee eric talley a law professor at columbia university said he s not surprised by musk s turnaround especially ahead of a scheduled deposition of musk by twitter attorneys starting thursday that was not going to be pleasant on the legal merits his case didn t look that strong talley said it kind of seemed like a pretty simple buyer s remorse case file tesla ceo elon musk speaks before unveiling the model y at the company s design studio in hawthorne california march 14 2019 if musk were to lose the trial the judge could not only force him to close the deal but also impose interest payments that would have increased its cost talley said what did surprise talley is that musk doesn t appear to be trying to renegotiate the deal even a modest price reduction might have given musk a moral victory and the ability to say he got something out of the protracted dispute talley said neither twitter nor attorneys for musk responded to requests for comment tuesday musk has been trying to back out of the deal for several months after signing on to buy the san francisco company in april shareholders have already approved the sale and legal experts say musk faced a huge challenge to defend against twitter s lawsuit which was filed in july musk claimed that twitter undercounted the number of fake accounts on its platform and twitter sued when musk announced the deal was off musk s argument largely rested on the allegation that twitter misrepresented how it measures the magnitude of spam bot accounts that are useless to advertisers most legal experts believe he faced an uphill battle to convince chancellor kathaleen st jude mccormick the court s head judge that something changed since the april merger agreement that justifies terminating the deal legal experts said musk may have anticipated that he would lose things haven t been going well for him in court recently with the judge ruling more frequently in twitter s favor on evidentiary matters said ann lipton an associate law professor at tulane university the judge denied several of musk s discovery requests lipton said it s also possible that musk s co investors in the deal were starting to get nervous about how the case was proceeding she said musk s main argument for terminating the deal that twitter was misrepresenting how it measured its spam bot problem also didn t appear to be going well as twitter had been working to pick apart musk s attempts to get third party data scientists to bolster his concerns mysteriously neither musk nor twitter ceo parag agrawal have written anything about the deal on twitter if the deal does go through musk may be stuck with a company he damaged with repeated statements denouncing fake accounts susannah streeter senior markets analyst for hargreaves lansdown in the united kingdom wrote in an investor note this is an important metric considered to be key for future revenue streams via paid advertising or for subscriptions on the site and his relentless scrutiny of twitter s figures over the last few months is likely to prompt questions from potential advertising partners she wrote
an amicus brief filed with the oklahoma supreme court by liberty counsel on behalf of hispanic and african american groups representing millions of minority americans offers the blunt truth about the racist roots of abortion advocacy advertisement the title of the brief tells the story abortion advocacy rests on the eugenics movement which is rooted in social darwinism and the elimination of undesirable populations the occasion for the brief by the florida based public interest law firm that specializes in first amendment religious freedom litigation is a challenge in state court by a pro abortion group of a measure adopted earlier this year by the oklahoma state legislature and signed into law by republican gov kevin stitt according to a statement issued by liberty counsel in announcing its filing the new law made oklahoma the first state in the nation to move to protect the unborn following the supreme court s landmark dobbs decision the oklahoma law does so by prohibiting abortions from fertilization and allowing private citizens to sue those who help women terminate their pregnancies the law which passed the house 73 16 and the senate 35 10 took effect immediately and bans all abortions except when necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman in a medical emergency or if the pregnancy is the result of rape sexual assault or incest that has been reported to law enforcement even in a deeply red state like oklahoma the pro abortion movement is lavishly funded routinely covered sympathetically by the news media and continually boosted by the academic community advertisement related democrats hang their hat on abortion going into midterms homestretch consequently stitt s signature had barely dried before the new law was challenged in court by the group oklahoma call for reproductive justice and others liberty counsel represents the frederick douglass foundation and the national hispanic christian leadership conference the case cite is oklahoma call for reproductive justice et al v john o connor in his official capacity as oklahoma attorney general et al the liberty counsel brief captures the horrendous fact at the heart of the pro abortion movement s history in america modern abortion advocacy arose out of the birth control movement which was developed alongside the american eugenics movement box planned parenthood of indiana kentucky inc 139 s ct 1780 1783 2019 thomas j concurring coined in the 1880s by a british scientist who was a cousin of charles darwin eugenics is the science of improving stock through all influences that tend in however remote a degree to give to the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable than they otherwise would have id at 1784 thomas l concurring internal quotation marks omitted put simply the sinister goal of the eugenics movement was to eliminate unfit and undesirable people those with mental and physical disabilities as well as certain races advertisement the brief notes the widespread support given to the eugenics movement by progressives on the left among others by the 1920s the eugenics movement was immensely popular among progressives professionals academics and the medical community many leading figures of the day including theodore roosevelt and john d rockefeller were fervent eugenicists putting their money their power their time and their research behind the effort margaret sanger planned parenthood s founder was one of the most outspoken members of the american eugenics movement arguing that eugenics was the most adequate and thorough avenue to the solution of racial political and social problems she accordingly praised sterilization as the remedy to the problem of an increasing rate of morons dozens of states passed forced sterilization laws inspired by the eugenics movement and designed to in sanger s words encourage the gradual suppression elimination and eventual extinction of defective stocks those human weeds which threaten the blooming of the finest flowers of american civilization given these historical realities it s no surprise that planned parenthood officials in recent days have sought to separate themselves from their founder s genocidal views but the reality that eugenics remains embedded in the abortion group s very physical structure to this very day as seen in data cited by the liberty counsel brief advertisement according to the centers for disease control s most recent data black women accounted for 33 6 percent of all reported abortions in 2018 even though they make up 13 percent of women in the united states black women also had the highest abortion rate 21 2 abortions per 1 000 women and ratio 335 abortions per 1 000 live births further abortion induced deaths of the unborn in the black community are 69 times higher than hiv deaths 31 times higher than homicides 3 6 times higher than cancer related deaths and 3 5 times higher than deaths caused by heart disease you want to talk about structural racism in the united states a map of planned parenthood s clinic locations looks like exhibit a the racial disparity in abortions is largely intentional a study based on 2010 census data shows that nearly eight out of ten planned parenthood abortion clinics are within walking distance of predominantly black or hispanic neighborhoods more specifically planned parenthood intentionally located 86 percent of its abortion facilities in or near minority neighborhoods in the 25 u s counties with the most abortions these 25 counties contain 19 percent of the u s population including 28 percent of the black population and 37 percent of the hispanic latino population in 12 of these counties blacks and hispanics latinos are more than 50 percent of the population advertisement given such data it s impossible to avoid the conclusion that what sanger wrote privately in a 1939 letter to a friend remains true today of planned parenthood the most successful educational approach to the negro is through a religious appeal we do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it occurs to any of their more rebellious members emphasis added

rising inflation and looming recessions are squeezing household finances but businesses also worry about an economic downturn this is not just because of higher bills but also because consumers spend less and finance from banks and investors dries up when the economy worsens even strong industries such as technology feel these effects with the standard poor s 500 stock market index down 17 in the

by david shepardson washington reuters a trade group representing major u s airlines rebuffed a request by 70 u s lawmakers to voluntarily extend a expired prohibition on stock buybacks that was a condition of u s government covid 19 payroll assistance representative peter defazio a democrat who chairs the house transportation and infrastructure committee led a group of 70 lawmakers last week urging airlines to refrain from initiating stock buybacks at least until air carriers are able to publish and fulfill schedules that meet demand staff flights and key personnel positions appropriately and return service to every community congress approved 54 billion in three rounds covering much of u s airline payroll costs for 18 months through the end of september 2021 the ban on stock buybacks expired on friday defazio s letter which was first reported by reuters was also signed by democratic representatives including aviation subcommittee chair rick larsen alexandria ocasio cortez david cicilline eleanor holmes norton jerrold nadler carolyn maloney rosa delauro and debbie dingell aviation unions launched a campaign in august to pressure airlines against stock buybacks it came as major carriers are negotiating new contracts with pilots who are seeking higher pay and improvements in schedules airlines for america a group representing major u s airlines including american airlines delta air lines united airlines southwest airlines and others told lawmakers in a previously unreported letter dated friday seen by reuters that airlines willingly agreed to the intentionally temporary restrictions of the payroll support program to protect jobs and preserve their workforces amid the unprecedented global health crisis the letter did not endorse the lawmakers call to refrain from share buybacks but said u s airlines are focused on prioritizing aviation safety and investing in people the employees who are the backbone of this industry and our customers who we serve every day american airlines received 12 6 billion delta air lines 11 9 billion united airlines 10 9 billion and southwest airlines 7 2 billion out of 54 billion airlines must repay 14 billion or 26 2 of the funding delta said in a statement its top financial priority is restoring its financial foundation by generating sustained and meaningful profitability and cash flow to support debt reduction and reinvestment in the business last month the chairs of two other congressional committees sought a federal probe into whether airlines used payroll funds to fund pilot buyouts and early retirements reporting by david shepardson editing by david gregorio
yesterday we explained that good news is bad news financial markets on tuesday confirmed the corollary bad news is good news the bad news was delivered from the august job openings and labor turnover survey or jolts this showed that job openings fell by 1 1 million to 10 1 million that is the largest ever one month drop excluding april of 2020 when openings shrank by 1 2 million it s worth pausing here to note that the economy just experienced a contraction in job vacancies similar to what we saw when much of the economy was locked down in an attempt to stem the spread of covid it s not quite as bad because the economy lost nearly that many job openings in march of 2020 also last month we actually added job openings the stock market thrilled to the signal that the labor market was cooling down investors see the decline in job openings as an indicator that the federal reserve s tightening has begun to work draining some inflationary pressure and perhaps allowing the fed to slow the pace of hikes or stop raising rates at a lower level a gentler path for interest rates means lower discount rates for future cash flows which means stocks move high the trouble is that this is just one month of data and it is two months old it may be the beginning of a trend downward in openings but that remains to be seen what s more even with the historically large decline job openings remain incredibly high here s a chart of the absolute number of openings since the turn of the century it nicely brings home just how strikingly high job openings are right now the 1 1 million decline in vacancies should also be looked at in the context of the total number of vacancies when we lost 1 2 million in 2020 that was 20 percent of job openings now it is just 10 percent that s a large decline but not record shattering we ve seen that kind of decline both in and out of recessions in the past similarly while the ratio of vacancies to unemployed people dropped to 1 7 to one from nearly two to one it is still very high as jason furman explained in a tweet the labor market has gone from being very very tight to very tight at 1 7 there s likely still enough upward pressure on wages to keep the federal reserve concerned enough not to veer from the path of 75 basis point hikes at the november meeting there was also no progress on the quits the total number of quits actually increased slightly and the quits rate the share of workers voluntarily leaving their job remained at 2 7 percent the quits rate is believed to be a key driver of wage inflation since job leavers see bigger wage gains as well employers are likely to raise wages of existing workers to prevent them from quitting prior to the pandemic we had never in this century seen a quits rate above 2 4 percent in the accommodation and food service sector the quits rate actually went up to 6 5 percent matching the all time high hit in july of 2021 this suggests there s still a lot of wage hike pressure in the services sector there is some genuinely good news on the horizon we may be headed into a baby boom consumer sales analysts at bank of america report that sales trends for pregnancy tests accelerated meaningfully beginning in may of 2020 and since june of 2020 unit sales growth has averaged 11 percent year over year that s a big acceleration from the prepandemic growth of around two percent on a three year basis pregnancy test unit sales have tracked near or over 20 percent since march 2021 with may at 32 percent compared with a year ago and july up 33 percent historically a tight labor market leads to an increase in births
billionaire elon musk is willing to move forward with the original 44 billion takeover of twitter according to a report by bloomberg musk has been involved in a lawsuit to get out of the deal accusing twitter of misleading him about the true number of bots on the platform a person with knowledge of the negotiations told bloomberg that musk sent a letter to twitter saying he wanted to end the litigation and move forward with the deal at the originally agreed upon price of 54 20 per share twitter s board of directors received the letter on monday night october 3 and is considering whether to accept another person involved in the negotiations told the washington post however twitter s executives don t trust musk and are concerned the offer may just be another legal ploy in the ongoing litigation trading of twitter s stock had to be halted twice after the news began to circulate in mid afternoon trading twitter s stock was trading at 47 93 a nearly 13 increase
consumer alert elon musk is on the verge of buying the social media network twitter but how will that affect users joining us live this morning with more information is jed jeslin he is the executive director of planet good morning thanks for joining us good morning how are you good morning so what impact do we think this wlil have on the social media site i think there could be a lot of impact and interestingly you know twitter launched in 2006 and only6 1 years later it s being sold for 44 billion dollar so obviously there are a lot of usersnd a regardless of anyone s individual opinion about twitter the fact isha tt it s becoming huge elyffective communication tool all over the world talking about important stoesri and sometimes trivial things big picture elon musk goals i that he wants to promote free and transparenspt eech so that s kind of main message soar f and whyre a some people thinking that s a bad thing i think some people are thinking they might be charged fees number one jen also user authentication is going to become a big deal and content moderation is a big topic across social media and like i said he is promoting free speech he says but that means could mean lifting bands it could mean changing the way that people are able to speak and it also means openingp u the algorithm he says which mea mnsaking it possible foreo pple to see how things are being moderedat and if they are and and you know truthfully there s arguments on both sides buthe t argument for that is maybe that s not such a bad thing yeah i tnkhi thats i an argument but the maybe one of the problems is that most usersre a probably not really even understandgin of an algorithm is so how do they really know what out there is true and what out there is not so let s talk question i didn even know until two minutes ago how to see my latest tweets until ien wt ahead and followed elon musk ande h actually had the directions posted right there how to do that so i feel like my brain just grew i just learned something new morning so wtha has been really the response to all of this been well really a firestorm obviously the reason you and i are talking about its i because it it conjures opinions and provokes opinions i think one of the big things that people think about now is that there s been a huge explosion of information and news all over the world and there s been a plunge in accuracy and accountability so people and brasnd are wondering how this is going to affect them and what they nca maybe believe and not believe boys in that theru tth there was a fake story that ran on reddit this week and some reputable news ageiencs ran with it so you do have to be very careful with the information that sut o there for sure so wtha what are your predictions moving forward on this becseau this isn t a complete done deal yet nd a there has been some some stalling in this takeover predictions are there will be continued news and it s really interesting that elon musk is sharing kind of provocative information almost daily sometimes hourly and he s sharing it through twitter so he has made some sort of critical statements about the platform which maybe they ll drive interest in the story maybe they ll dveri the ultimate price down who knows but i think people need to be watching this but also understanding that there s going to be a lot day to day that happens all right jed thanks so much for joining us this morning relyal appreciate it advertisement elon musk offers to end legal fight pay 44b to buy twitter share copy link copy video above how elon musk s takeover of twitter will affect userselon musk is abandoning his legal battle to back out of buying twitter by offering to go through with his original 44 billion bid for the social media platform the mercurial tesla ceo made the offer in a letter to twitter which the company disclosed in a filing tuesday with the u s securities and exchange commission the offer comes just two weeks before twitter s lawsuit seeking to force musk to go through with the deal goes to trial in delaware chancery court in a statement twitter said it intends to close the transaction at 54 20 per share after receiving the letter from musk musk s proposal is the latest twist in a high profile saga involving the world s richest man and one of the most influential social media platforms much of the drama has played out on twitter itself with musk who has more than 100 million followers lamenting that the company was failing to live up to its potential as a platform for free speech a letter from musk s lawyer dated monday and disclosed by twitter in a securities filing said musk would close the merger signed in april provided that the delaware chancery court enter an immediate stay of twitter s lawsuit against him and adjourn the trial scheduled to begin in two weeks by completing the deal musk essentially gave twitter what it was seeking from the court specific performance of the contract with musk meaning he would have to go through with the purchase at the original price the contract musk signed also has a 1 billion breakup fee eric talley a law professor at columbia university said he s not surprised by musk s turnaround especially ahead of a scheduled deposition of musk by twitter attorneys starting thursday that was not going to be pleasant on the legal merits his case didn t look that strong talley said it kind of seemed like a pretty simple buyer s remorse case if musk were to lose the trial the judge could not only force him to close the deal but also impose interest payments that would have increased its cost talley said what did surprise talley is that musk doesn t appear to be trying to renegotiate the deal even a modest price reduction might have given musk a moral victory and the ability to say he got something out of the protracted dispute talley said news of the renewed offer caused trading of twitter stock to be halted for much of tuesday afternoon on the new york stock exchange for news pending after it jumped nearly 13 to 47 93 that s still well below musk s original offer trading halts are how stock exchanges give investors a forced timeout when trading for a stock gets too chaotic or when a company is about to offer market moving news neither twitter nor attorneys for musk responded to requests for comment tuesday afternoon musk has been trying to back out of the deal for several months after signing on to buy the san francisco company in april shareholders have already approved the sale and legal experts say musk faced a huge challenge to defend against twitter s lawsuit which was filed in july musk claimed that twitter under counted the number of fake accounts on its platform and twitter sued when musk announced the deal was off musk s argument largely rested on the allegation that twitter misrepresented how it measures the magnitude of spam bot accounts that are useless to advertisers most legal experts believe he faced an uphill battle to convince chancellor kathaleen st jude mccormick the court s head judge that something changed since the april merger agreement that justifies terminating the deal legal experts said musk may have anticipated that he would lose things haven t been going well for him in court recently with the judge ruling more frequently in twitter s favor on evidentiary matters said ann lipton an associate law professor at tulane university the judge s denied several of musk s discovery requests lipton said it s also possible that musk s co investors in the deal were starting to get nervous about how the case was proceeding she said musk s main argument for terminating the deal that twitter was misrepresenting how it measured its spam bot problem also didn t appear to be going well as twitter had been working to pick apart musk s attempts to get third party data scientists to bolster his concerns twitter now has options in the case and doesn t necessarily have to accept a new offer from musk said robert anderson a law professor at pepperdine university twitter could still be concerned that the same thing might happen again without some additional security anderson said they re going to want some assurance that the deal is going to happen right away columbia s talley said he would insist on musk putting money into an escrow account until the deal is completed such an account could hold cash and or twitter shares as a good faith demonstration by musk talley suggested mysteriously neither musk nor twitter ceo parag agrawal have written anything about the deal on twitter where many developments in the dispute have been aired many of musk s tweets in the past 24 hours have been about a divisive proposal to end russia s invasion of ukraine drawing the ire of ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy musk argued in a tweet monday that to reach peace russia should be allowed to keep the crimea peninsula that it seized in 2014 he also said ukraine should adopt a neutral status dropping a bid to join nato following russia s partial mobilization of reservists if the deal does go through musk may be stuck with a company he damaged with repeated statements denoucing fake accounts susannah streeter senior markets analyst for hargreaves lansdown in the united kingdom wrote in an investor note this is an important metric considered to be key for future revenue streams via paid advertising or for subscriptions on the site and his relentless scrutiny of twitter s figures over the last few months is likely to prompt questions from potential advertising partners she wrote if musk were to lose among the remedies that would favor twitter is a court order to go through with the deal the chancery court last year forced private equity firm kohlberg co to go through with its 550 million buyout of decopac a company based in minnesota that calls itself the world s largest supplier of cake decorating supplies to professional decorators and bakeries the case was emblematic of the court s common though not uniform resolution of enforcing contractual obligations on buyers other options include musk being forced to pay the breakup fee each side agreed to if deemed responsible for the deal falling through or he might have to pay off a larger amount without actually buying the company for 44 billion
so a man who says the last election was rigged and who also doesn t believe republicans can lose the state could well end up in charge of running elections it s not hard to see where this could go if finchem and other candidates like him around the country change the voting system in ways that make it almost impossible for their side to lose then come 2024 democrats with some reason won t trust the results either they will say they were robbed of victory it won t be many voting cycles before no one trusts election results here

the market is up but there s some energy specific news to keep an eye on what happened the market has shrugged off any worries about inflation or an economic slowdown today the s p 500 is up 2 6 as of this writing and the nasdaq composite is up 2 9 not surprisingly highly volatile renewable energy stocks have been rising with them sunrun run 8 16 jumped as much as 10 in trading today bloom energy be 4 66 was up 6 4 and lordstown motors ride 1 16 gained 7 1 at 2 50 p m et shares were up 6 7 4 4 and 4 1 respectively so what there are a number of factors impacting the energy industry specifically today one is the increase in oil prices which has seen west texas intermediate crude jump 3 5 to 86 47 brent crude increase 3 3 to 91 82 and natural gas spike 5 8 to 6 85 per million british thermal units a unit of measurement for natural gas in the u s in europe natural prices fell as much as 10 which could ease some of the economic impact of energy disruptions caused by russia s invasion of ukraine the institute for supply management said on monday that its manufacturing purchasing managers index was just 50 9 the lowest level since may 2020 and down from 52 8 in august a reading above 50 indicates that manufacturing is expanding but growth appears to be slowing and that s cause for concern for the economy job openings also fell in august by 1 1 million jobs to 10 05 million indicating that companies are pulling back on their hiring as interest rates rise and the economy slows you would think that high oil prices poor manufacturing indicators and fewer jobs are bad for the economy and that would be right but the market is thinking about interest rates the federal reserve has been aggressively raising rates to combat inflation and investors have expected rate increases to continue into 2023 but a slowing economy may cause central banks around the world to reconsider higher rates which is why investors are buying riskier assets like stocks today now what renewable energy stocks are up big today for two main reasons one is oil is a competitor for wind solar and electric vehicles so it s natural for renewable energy stocks to rise when oil is up the bigger impact though would be interest rates lower interest rates help renewable energy projects because they make the long term cash flows more valuable in today s dollars which i cover here high rates are a headwind so any end in sight to higher rates would be good news what s important to keep in mind today is that nothing has fundamentally changed about the renewable energy market long term there are still tailwinds from falling costs and subsidies that boost demand but companies face a challenging competitive environment it s that competitive picture that could limit returns for renewable energy stocks but for today they re up because economic news was bad which may not seem logical until you realize short term stock prices are driven by interest rate speculation right now

by david randall new york reuters investors suffering through a bruising year for markets are hoping that recent signs of wobbling economic growth will force the federal reserve and other global central banks to take their foot off the gas in the fight against inflation sparking sharp rebounds in stocks and bonds the s p 500 is up 5 over the last two days following a brutal september in which it fell 9 3 alongside declines in other global equity benchmarks yields on u s treasuries which move inversely to prices have plummeted by nearly 35 basis points in october from multi year highs hit last month the moves come as investors reprice expectations of how high the fed will raise rates in its battle to crush inflation amid recent signs that growth in the u s may finally be slowing investors in the futures markets now expect the fed fund rate to peak at 4 5 next year compared to the expected peak of about 4 7 they were pricing in last week the markets are sniffing out a blink by the fed said jim paulsen chief investment strategist at the leuthold group if they pause here not only does the rate pressure suddenly drop but maybe you end up with a mid cycle slowdown rather than a recession markets have rallied on the hopes of a fed pivot several times this year only to reverse and crumble to fresh lows making investors wary of the current bounce this time around a series of weaker than expected data on manufacturing and job openings in the united states are among the factors fueling hopes that weakening growth will push the fed to slow its market punishing rate hikes some investors have also taken tuesday s smaller than expected rate increase from australia s central bank and a decision by the uk s new government to scrap planned tax cuts as signs that governments and monetary authorities are being increasingly responsive to signs of weakening growth and market instability others however are skeptical of the moves mark haefele chief investment officer at ubs global wealth management attributed the stock rebound to oversold conditions in the s p 500 exacerbated by month end rebalancing by money managers at the end of september that drove stocks lower with sentiment toward equities already very weak periodic rebounds are to be expected but markets are likely to stay volatile in the near term driven primarily by expectations around inflation and policy rates he wrote in a tuesday report analysts at bofa global research on tuesday pointed out that retail traders have shown few signs of capitulation one signal they say would represent a potential market bottom meanwhile the cboe volatility index known as wall street s fear gauge has not climbed to levels that have marked past turning points in past sell offs it s not clear to me that you ve seen panic yet said ashwin alankar head of global asset allocation at janus henderson investors until you see panic it s not the best time to start adding risk to a portfolio at a rapid clip the signs of softening in the labor market shown by jolts data meanwhile may not be enough for the fed to feel comfortable pausing in its pace of rate hikes analysts at capital economics wrote on tuesday while the data won t prevent further aggressive interest rate hikes in the near term it supports our view that inflation will drop back more quickly than fed officials expect they wrote reporting by david randall additional reporting by davide barbuscia editing by ira iosebashvili
musk says he wants twitter again and will pay 44b price seth wenig ap elon musk wants twitter again and twitter is game the billionaire tesla ceo has proposed to buy the company at the originally agreed on price of 44 billion bringing the tumultuous monthslong saga another step closer to a conclusion musk made the surprising turnaround not on twitter as has been his custom but in a letter to twitter that the company disclosed in a filing tuesday with the u s securities and exchange commission it came less than two weeks before a trial between the two parties over musk s attempt to back out of the deal is scheduled to start in delaware musk also faced a scheduled deposition by twitter attorneys starting thursday in response twitter said it intends to close the transaction at 54 20 per share after receiving the letter from musk but the company stopped short of saying it s dropping its lawsuit against the billionaire tesla ceo experts said that makes sense given the contentious relationship and lack of trust between the two parties i don t think twitter will give up its trial date on just musk s word it s going to need more certainty about closing said andrew jennings professor at brooklyn law school noting that the company may also be worried about musk s proposal being a delay tactic after all he s already tried to unsuccessfully postpone the trial twice trading in twitter s stock which had been halted for much of the day pending release of the news resumed trading late tuesday and soared 22 to close at 52 but even if the deal now goes through without a hitch it s too soon to call a victory for twitter said jasmine enberg an analyst with insider intelligence the deal will solve some of the short term uncertainty at the company but twitter is essentially in the same place it was in april she said there is still plenty of uncertainty around what musk intends to do with twitter as well as the future of a company with a leader who has wavered in his commitment to buying it and if we ve learned anything from this saga it s that musk is unpredictable and that it isn t over yet musk s proposal is the latest twist in a high profile saga involving the world s richest man and one of the most influential social media platforms much of the drama has played out on twitter itself with musk who has more than 100 million followers lamenting that the company was failing to live up to its potential as a platform for free speech and had too many bots while some logistical and legal hurdles remain musk could be in charge of twitter in a matter of days however long it takes him and his co investors to line up the cash said ann lipton an associate law professor at tulane university a letter from musk s lawyer dated monday and disclosed by twitter in a securities filing said musk would close the merger signed in april provided that the delaware chancery court enter an immediate stay of twitter s lawsuit against him and adjourn the trial scheduled to start oct 17 attorneys for musk did not respond to requests for comment tuesday musk has been trying to back out of the deal for several months after signing on to buy the san francisco company in april shareholders have already approved the sale and legal experts say musk faced a huge challenge to defend against twitter s lawsuit which was filed in july eric talley a law professor at columbia university said he s not surprised by musk s turnaround on the legal merits his case didn t look that strong talley said it kind of seemed like a pretty simple buyer s remorse case musk claimed that twitter under counted the number of fake accounts on its platform and twitter sued when musk announced the deal was off musk s argument largely rested on the allegation that twitter misrepresented how it measures the magnitude of spam bot accounts that are useless to advertisers most legal experts believe he faced an uphill battle to convince chancellor kathaleen st jude mccormick the court s head judge that something changed since the april merger agreement that justifies terminating the deal musk remained mum about the turn of events on twitter until late tuesday afternoon when he tweeted that buying twitter is an accelerant to creating x the everything app without further explanation ____ associated press writer marcy gordon in washington d c contributed to this report back to top

in the press finding the top financial advisor in the united states means choosing between thousands of options whether you re looking for help with retirement wealth management or tax planning the u s is home to thousands of advisors that can meet your specific needs based on the methodology outlined below smartasset identified these financial advisor firms as among the top 5 financial advisor firms in the u s rank financial advisor assets managed 1 714 587 898 072 2 173 418 270 044 3 46 803 858 104 4 94 617 046 882 5 19 851 537 239 methodology to find the top financial advisors in the u s we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure firms with a fee only as opposed to fee based compensation structure are ranked higher these stats are updated annually and accurate as of may 25 2023 this list may include firms that have a business relationship with smartasset in which smartasset is compensated for lead referrals such relationships have no impact on our rankings and firms are included and ranked based strictly on the above criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please carefully review the methodologies employed in the vanguard whitepaper to receive a copy of the whitepaper please contact compliance smartasset com the value of professional investment advice is only

elon musk proposes going ahead with deal to buy twitter elon musk photo ted youtube mgn cbs news trading in shares of twitter was halted after the stock spiked on reports that elon musk would proceed with his 44 billion deal to buy the company after months of legal battles for a second time musk offered to buy the san francisco company for 54 20 a share according to a regulatory filing today earlier tuesday bloomberg news had reported that musk made the proposal in a letter to twitter according to people familiar with the negotiations a spokesperson for twitter told cbs news on tuesday we received the letter from the musk parties which they have filed with the sec the intention of the company is to close the transaction at 54 20 per share twitter shares jumped nearly 13 to 47 95 before trading stopped after it resumed the stock continued climbing and closed at 52 up 22 on the day the regulatory filing confirmed that musk made the proposal in a letter to twitter on monday notifying the social media company that he intends to proceed with the deal according to the original terms of the purchase musk had been trying to back out of the deal for several months agreeing to buy twitter in april shareholders have already approved the sale in pushing to abandon to the transaction musk claimed that twitter under counted the number of fake accounts on its platform and twitter sued him after he announced in july that he was withdrawing his offer this is a clear sign that musk recognized heading into delaware court that the chances of winning vs twitter board was highly unlikely and this 44 billion deal was going to be completed one way or another said dan ives an analyst at wedbush securities lawyers for musk didn t respond to messages seeking comment on tuesday the trial seeking to compel musk to buy twitter is set to start in delaware chancery court on oct 17 avoiding a trial will save a massive legal headache ives added musk s argument for walking away from the deal has largely rested on the allegation that twitter misrepresented how it measures the magnitude of spam bot accounts that are useless to advertisers but most legal experts believed he faced an uphill battle in convincing chancellor kathaleen st jude mccormick the court s head judge that something changed since the april merger agreement that justifies terminating the deal legal experts generally have said that twitter had the upper hand in the lawsuit which twitter filed in july twitter is seeking specific performance of the contract with musk which means he would have to go through with the purchase at the original price the contract musk signed also has a 1 billion breakup fee among the remedies that would favor twitter is a court order to go through with the deal the chancery court last year forced private equity firm kohlberg co to go through with its 550 million buyout of decopac a company based in minnesota that calls itself the world s largest supplier of cake decorating supplies to professional decorators and bakeries the case was emblematic of the court s common though not uniform resolution of enforcing contractual obligations on buyers other options include musk being forced to pay the breakup fee each side agreed to if deemed responsible for the deal falling through or he might have to pay off a larger amount without actually buying the company for 44 billion legal experts have said that delaware courts have been picky about interpreting what counts as a valid reason for backing off of a deal the gap between what musk knew about twitter when he made the offer in april and the state of the company today had to be huge and there s little evidence of that one lawyer said

7086 46 177 70 2 57 dax30 12670 48 461 00 3 78 by greg peel double whammy the board is committed to returning inflation to the 2 3 per cent range over time today s increase in interest rates will help achieve this goal and further increases are likely to be required over the period ahead the cash rate has been increased substantially in a short period of time reflecting this the board decided to increase the cash rate by 25 basis points this month as it assesses the outlook for inflation and economic growth in australia the asx200 was already up 160 points ahead of yesterday s rba announcement following a wall street bounce that was expected any time and triggered by the uk government s policy flip then at 2 30pm philip lowe dropped his bombshell a rate hike of 50 points was widely expected the rba had considered hiking only 25 points at the september meeting but settled on 50 that made a 25 hike in october a strong chance until the latest us inflation data hit and the fed went another 75 and the aussie dollar was trashed but the board is concerned about two factors it appears one source of uncertainty is the outlook for the global economy which has deteriorated recently another is how household spending in australia responds to the tighter financial conditions higher inflation and higher interest rates are putting pressure on household budgets with the full effects of higher interest rates yet to be felt in mortgage payments consumer confidence has also fallen and housing prices are declining after the earlier large increases the rba is clearly worried about hiking too far too fast in the current domestic and global environment could lead to a more dramatic economic slowdown than intended in the battle against inflation and that it takes time for the impact of rate hikes to flow through the economy not yet time to pause and reflect but just to slow down economists nevertheless believe a slower pace of hikes will only extend the duration of hikes until the actual pause comes next year the aussie ten year bond yield fell 17 points to 3 72 and the two year fell 32 points to 3 13 the aussie dollar also dropped around half a cent but given a fall in the us dollar overnight is down only a net 0 2 this morning on the stock market it was a simple case of buy everything and that started before the rba announcement post announcement standing out were the banks 4 2 but all of energy materials and real estate posted gains in excess of 4 and technology closer to 5 consumer discretionary rose 3 6 the defensives were the laggards managing only 2 3 gains the asx200 top five gainers and the asx200 top twenty were all once again dominated by miners with lithium miners leading the charge the asx200 top five loser list contained all of one stock the lottery corp tlc plunged 0 2 the asx300 top twenty losers list contained three stocks and we ll be at it again today with wall street posting an even bigger rally last night on top of monday night our futures are up another 107 points this morning aussie aussie aussie while elon musk s sudden decision to throw in the towel and just buy twitter at his original offer price rather dominated chatter on wall street last night much attention was also given to the rba s decision to slow the pace for this is exactly what wall street has been expecting hoping the fed will do the rba gave wall street more confidence to fight the fed stock indices opened higher last night in a follow through from monday night and just kept going up while the july rebound rally was dismissed to a large extent as little more than a short squeeze that drove momentum this time so far there is greater faith even though short covering is clearly playing its part the bank of england s forced intervention into the uk bond market the un pleading with central banks not to keep hiking and exacerbate further inequality across the globe and now the rba s bold decision to be the first major central bank to deliver a lower rate hike are all putting pressure on the fed wall street is assuming to also slow down as to whether it will in the face of the last cpi pce data is not assured the next fed meeting is not until early november another fillip for wall street last night was data showing the second largest monthly drop in recorded history for job openings with august openings falling to 10 1m from 11 2m in july layoffs also rose to the highest level in eighteen months although remain low by historical standards another driver among the many was a speech by the new york fed president who ranks third behind the fed chair and vice chair of key fed officials in which he suggested cooling global demand and steady improvements in supply should result in falling rates of inflation for goods over the next year these factors should contribute to inflation declining to about 3 next year he said all fodder for a relief rally but is this just another july style head fake many believe so the next critical data point will be friday night s september jobs numbers thereafter the september quarter earnings season will be the true time of reckoning with the potential to upset any true rally

totaled 438 million and non gaap gross margins came in at 24 6 these results combined with strong operating discipline and our share repurchase program resulted in non gaap earnings of 0 80 per share which exceeded the upper end of our guidance range let me turn to a brief review of each of our businesses starting with ips revenue came in at a record 145 million for the fourth quarter up 52 sequentially and up 48 from the year ago quarter new project rollouts were a major contributor to our revenue growth in the quarter despite the increased hardware shipments from these new installations service revenues were up 11 in q4 when compared to q4 of fiscal year 21 on a year over year basis services grew 59 in fiscal year 2022 when compared to fy 21 services continues to be an exciting growth area for ips after designing and implementing an hpc solution ips offers additional value added services to meet our customers individualized needs including system management development and operations or devops and hpc ai optimization these offerings demonstrate the differentiated value proposition we offer to our customers what s more a large portion of our services revenues for penguin are based on longer term multi year engagements that deliver more predictable revenue and higher margins the market has taken note of ips s success and we continue to garner industry recognition this past quarter scientific computing world highlighted penguin computing s cloud technology practice as part of a feature on cloud technologies available to researchers that use hpc heading into our first half of the year we see continued strong demand across our ips customer base as we have mentioned on prior calls ips has traditionally been a somewhat lumpy business and as a result we will continue to monitor customer demand signals as we look further out into q1 and into q2 with the addition of stratus ips is equipped with advanced high availability and fault tolerant capabilities that will expand our future ips offerings and allow us to more comprehensively address our customers needs now turning to our led solutions group cree led faced strong headwinds in china with covid related policies contributing to supply chain constraints and impacting demand revenue totaled 83 million in the fourth quarter our business continues to be soft in china and we are also seeing demand weakness in the us and europe as such we expect to see a sequential decrease in the led business in q1 the key target markets for our led business remains specialty high value applications such as entertainment and horticulture premium video applications such as fine pitch outdoor lighting designs and high performance general lighting applications such as architectural and street lighting cree remains a technology and brand leader in the high performance led space and we are confident in the long term operating performance of the led business as macro headwinds subside in our memory solutions group operating under the smart modular brand revenue came in at 210 million we saw a strong demand for our core specialty memory offerings such as ddr3 ddr4 and flash memory products from oem customers in networking telecom enterprise computing and storage segments in the networking and storage markets we are seeing an increased level of activity for our pcie nvme ssd products in particular design ins are increasing for our sata ssds we are also seeing strong design activity for specialty dram products spanning legacy technologies such as ddr3 and ddr4 to newer technologies such as ddr5 and compute express link commonly referred to as cxl additionally on the ddr5 front we are seeing strong customer interest for specialty form factors the strength of specialty memory partially offset continued headwinds in brazil the brazilian smartphone and pc consumer markets were weaker in the fourth quarter as anticipated and communicated on our last call that said we remained disciplined in our approach to introducing new products that meet the market demand such as umcps ddr5 modules and gen 4 ssds while managing our operating expenses and capital expenditures in order to continue generating positive free cash flows from our brazil operations longer term market trends remains favorable to our memory business overall with data center proliferation supporting ai and machine learning application growth industry migration to ddr5 and an increasing ssd attach rate in our brazil business all providing us with the foundation for longer term growth as we capitalize on core competencies of engineering manufacturing and service to develop differentiated solutions for our valued customers now i d like to take a step back and share some

very proud to announce sgh s commitment to achieving net zero scope one and two emissions by 2030 you can read about this commitment as well as other environmental social and governance efforts in our second annual esg report which will be available on our website in the coming weeks and now i ll hand it over to ken for a more detailed review of our q4 financial performance and our guidance for next quarter ken ken rizvi thanks mark i will focus my remarks on our non gaap results which are reconciled to gaap in our earnings release tables now let me turn to our results for our fiscal 2022 full year and fourth quarter results as mark shared earlier we had another strong year performance overall revenues for fiscal 2022 were up 21 to a record 1 82 billion driven by strong execution across all of our businesses intelligent platform solutions grew by 28 on a year over year basis to a record 441 million this is on top of the 30 sequential growth in the previous fiscal year memory solutions grew by approximately 5 on a year over year basis to 975 million driven by strong growth in our specialty memory business and led solutions contributed approximately 403 million in sales during our fiscal 2022 our first full year results with this business non gaap gross margin in fiscal 2022 was up approximately 370 basis points to 25 9 from 22 2 in the prior year driven by margin improvements across all three of our segments for fiscal 2022 non gaap diluted earnings per share were a record 3 62 up from 2 61 in fiscal 2021 and adjusted ebitda was a record 263 million up from 188 million in fiscal 2021 in addition we exited the year with a strong balance sheet including year end cash balance of 363 million as well as prudent leverage now let me turn to our fourth quarter results despite the macroeconomic headwinds we reported a strong quarter results helped by the diversification of our business and the strength of our ips segments net sales were 438 million non gaap gross margin came in at 24 6 at the midpoint of our guidance range and non gaap diluted earnings per share were 0 80 for the fourth quarter above the high end of our guidance range our earnings per share were higher than the midpoint of our guidance in part due to better operating expense management lower taxes and lower shares helped by our share repurchases during the quarter fourth quarter revenue by business unit was as follows ips at 145 million in sales led at 83 million in sales and memory at 210 million in sales this translates into a sales mix of 33 for ips 19 for led and 48 for memory non gaap gross margin for sgh in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 24 6 down from 26 4 in the year ago quarter primarily driven by lower sales from led non gaap operating expenses for the fourth quarter were 61 1 million up from 57 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 operating expenses were up primarily due to the continued investments in our businesses as well as a reduction from financial credits in brazil operating expenses benefited in the fourth quarter of 2022 from 2 million in financial credits in brazil which was down from 3 3 million in the third quarter and 7 8 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 this credit is expected to provide approximately 2 million of benefit in our first quarter of fiscal 2023 non gaap diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2022 was 0 80 per share compared with 1 08 per share in the year ago quarter and adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter was 56 million or 13 of sales compared to 76 million or 16 of sales in the year ago quarter and now turning to working capital our net accounts receivable totaled 410 million compared with 357 million last quarter days sales outstanding came in at 47 days up 16 days from the last quarter primarily due to the timing of ips shipments and inventory totaled 323 million at the end of the fourth quarter down from 365 million at the end of the prior quarter this decline was primarily driven by lower inventory for ips we would expect an increase in inventories in the first quarter due to the timing of builds to support second quarter ips revenues inventory turns were 8 5 times in the fourth quarter versus 10 1 times in the prior quarter and consistent with past practice accounts receivable days sales outstanding and inventory turnover are calculated on a gross sales and cost of goods sold basis which were 789 million and 685 million respectively for the fourth quarter as a reminder the difference between gross revenue and net sales is related to our logistics services business which is accounted for on an agent basis meaning that we only recognize the net profit on logistics services as net sales cash and equivalents totaled 363 million at the end of the fourth quarter compared with 387 million at the end of the prior quarter fourth quarter cash flow from operations totaled 20 9 million compared with 36 7 million in the prior quarter in the fourth quarter we repurchased 2 2 million shares spending approximately 40 million during the quarter under our 75 million share repurchase authorization and for those of the attracting capital expenditures and depreciation capital expenditures were 8 9 million in the fourth quarter and depreciation was 10 8 million for 2022 we spent approximately 38 million in capital expenditures our overall capital allocation strategy is as follows first and foremost we will continue to invest in our business as we see significant opportunities for further organic growth in each of our three business segments while maintaining a strong balance sheet and prudent leverage second we will continue to review and seek acquisition opportunities such as stratus for further scale and diversification in a disciplined manner third capital return via share repurchases provides us flexibility to return capital in an opportunistic and price sensitive manner for 2023 an additional focus area will be to use excess cash flow to retire debt prior to turning to our first quarter guidance let me update you on our recently closed acquisition of stratus a global provider of high availability fault tolerant solutions for the data center and at the edge the acquisition expands our capabilities and aligns with our growth and diversification strategy we closed the acquisition in the beginning of our fiscal 2023 for 225 million and will incorporate the results from the first quarter of fiscal 2023 from a financial standpoint stratus fits well within our acquisition framework and it is expected to add more than 150 million of annual revenues improves our overall non gaap gross margins and is immediately accretive to our non gaap eps in conjunction with the acquisition we also expanded our existing term loan credit facilities by 300 million we used the net proceeds to retire the 101 8 million outstanding under the cree earn out notes and along with cash on hand paid for the 225 million purchase of stratus the term loan a facility bears an interest of sofr plus 2 based on the total leverage grid with this larger facility and inclusive of our convertible notes we would expect our total net interest to be approximately 8 million a quarter based on current sofr rates now let me turn to our first quarter 2023 guidance we expect that net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 will range from approximately 425 million to 475 million or approximately 450 million at the midpoint our guidance incorporates the continued strong demand in our ips business including approximately 35 million to 40 million of revenue expected from stratus but is offset by macroeconomic headwinds impacting our led business and our memory business in brazil our gaap gross margin for the first quarter is expected to be approximately 24 5 to 26 5 non gaap gross margin for the first quarter is expected to be approximately 25 5 to 27 5 up sequentially primarily due to the incorporation of stratus our non gaap operating expenses for the first quarter are expected to be approximately 75 million plus or minus 3 million and up approximately 14 million sequentially primarily due to the incorporation of stratus gaap diluted earnings per share for the first quarter is expected to be approximately 0 14 plus or minus 0 15 on a non gaap basis excluding share based compensation expense intangible asset amortization expense debt discount and other adjustments we expect diluted earnings per share will be approximately 0 60 plus or minus 0 15 our gaap and non gaap diluted share count for the first quarter is expected to be approximately 51 million shares based on our current stock price cash capital expenditures for the first quarter are expected to be in the range of 12 million to 15 million and approximately 50 million to 60 million for fiscal 2023 in part due to the migration of cree into its own facility our outlook incorporates the effects of the company s recent acquisition of stratus however we have not completed our purchase accounting and assessment of the fair value of the assets and liabilities and therefore gaap outlook does not reflect this impact in addition i wanted to share an expected change to our upcoming reporting which will result in an expected 2 million per quarter benefit for fiscal 2023 and this is incorporated into our guidance we periodically evaluate planned technology transitions capital spending and re use rates for our assets in september 2022 we completed a preliminary assessment of our manufacturing equipment and based on that assessment we anticipate increasing the estimated useful lives of such equipment from five to eight years beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 our forecast for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 is based on the current environment which contemplates the global macroeconomic headwinds and continued supply chain constraints please refer to the non gaap financial information section and reconciliation of gaap to non gaap measures table in our earnings release for further details now let me turn it over to mark for a few remarks prior to q a mark adams thanks ken as we enter fiscal year 2023 i remain excited about the long term future at sgh we are well positioned to excel in our key focus areas of ai machine learning data analytics hpc data center cloud and advanced lighting solutions our commitment to strong execution combined with our capital light model give me confidence that we will be able to navigate the broader market headwinds that most if not all companies are facing in the short term we will manage our spending appropriately maximizing free cash flow generation the secular demands for our differentiated solutions continue to grow and we remain committed to developing innovative solutions for our customers and creating long term value for our shareholders operator we are now ready for q a question and answer session operator thank you sir our first question comes from the line of brian chin with stifel your line is now open brian chin hi there good afternoon thanks for letting us ask the question and congratulations on this quarter results in this tough environment maybe since i m bang leadoff first question i guess i m obliged to ask sort of in your november quarter guidance is sort of the implicit guide by segments sort of maybe like a mid single digit decline in memory maybe flat to down ips prior to the acquisition and then led down kind of 10 is that sort of the right apples to apples way to think about mark adams yeah so brian thanks for the question and thanks for your comments i would say if we look at q1 and implicit in our guide is actually we re expecting to see a bit more decline in our led business and that s a result of the current macro headwinds we re seeing in china and also a little bit slower demand here in the us and in europe in addition i would say for the led business our expectation is that the distributors will be burning through some inventory so our sell in will be lower than the sell through at this season and that s part of the reason for the decline so i would actually anticipate that business being down potentially 20 or a bit more sequentially from q4 and then you can gauge what the other businesses are doing brian chin got it got it so i guess maybe that s the place to follow up since you acquired this out of cree this has been probably this has been the first dip you ve seen in terms of revenue in that business where is the breakeven revenue on a quarterly or annualized basis for the led business and as maybe you re kind of touching it in the november quarter i guess to that end i mean you re trying to clean up the inventory i guess that maybe you had accumulated in the channel there in how many quarters do you expect that to take place and do you have any visibility in terms of when the sell through the shipment can match sort of sell out and whether the sell out process is stabilizing mark adams yeah so maybe a couple of questions in there brian so let me see if i ve addressed i can address them all so i d say first and foremost if you looked at the disti inventory i wouldn t say it s as much of a build up of inventory that occurred but what we are seeing with some of our disti customers is they are trying to lean on the working capital and lean out their inventories given the inventories given the macro uncertainty and question number two and so when is that going to clear up it s a little uncertain given the visibility we have but i would expect based on today and today s environment as we move through q2 and into q3 we should be clear that the shipments in should start to equal the shipments out but early to tell that for certain and obviously we ll provide you more color as we move through the quarters if we looked from an overall profitability standpoint you are correct as we look at q1 that businesses is close to breakeven on an op income basis although if you include that they are still profitable to us and that s where we ll look to see how we can optimize some of the expenses there to make sure that in the near term we generate positive cash flow and then as that business recovers because this is very much macro driven versus any specific product concern so as the macro returns hopefully as we move into the back half of this fiscal year and fiscal 24 then it should start to return to a more profitable state for the led business brian chin got it let s get away from this topic and before i hop off just on stratus given the closing of the deal is it fair to say that there is between the two companies there is a low degree of customer overlap and a high degree of vertical market overlap and also given the earlier close of that acquisition and the necessary integration process how long six months 12 months do you foresee before we start to see sort of a positive impact in terms of cross selling synergies mark adams hey brian this is mark i think you sized that correctly not a lot of overlapping existing customers today which we think is a strength and potential revenue synergies out into the future some overlap in terms of the vertical markets that we address and you think about what s interesting right now is that the data center business for ips is driving a lot of the growth and with stratus it s actually edge that s driving a lot of the growth so not a lot of overlap there in terms of revenues going away so we think from a model standpoint it s pretty good relative to impact on the business and potential upsides for revenue synergies and some of the cost opportunities we have we stated in our last call and are sticking to it we re thinking somewhere in the 12 month to 18 month range we may see some small wins in the short term but we think a majority of the impact will be outweighed 12 to 18 months from the time of close or out in the middle of our fiscal year 24 brian chin okay great thanks mark thanks ken ken rizvi thanks brian operator thank you for your question sir our next question comes from the line of tom o malley with barclays your line is now open thomas o malley hey good afternoon guys and thanks for taking the question i just had a just a follow up on the gross margin profile in the august quarter i think you had called out previously that there may be lower software contribution in the quarter which may have been muting the ips gross margins but can you just walk through the puts and takes on each of the segment s margin contribution in the quarter just because you saw a strong ips which should help your mix but you saw gross margins down any color on gross margins by segment would be helpful on august ken rizvi happy to talk through that at a high level so if we looked at the overall memory business if we look sequentially the margins were reasonably flat i would say ips as we ve talked about given the growth from q3 to q4 we outlined on our last call that we will be more hardware centric and therefore the margin percent is down a bit from q3 levels for ips and then for led given the reduction in sales from q3 to q4 and some of the fixed costs on the back end the margins are down in that business so those are the puts and takes which drove the margins to that 24 6 level in q4 thomas o malley okay and then i just wanted to revisit a prior question you gave the vector for the led business in the november quarter from an organic perspective is the ips business up in the november quarter ken rizvi yeah so i would expect that ips business be organically so that s excluding the stratus business should be flat to up a bit here into our q1 from q4 and then you can see what the memory business is kind of flattish flat to down a little bit but flattish in q1 as well thomas o malley okay that s helpful and then just one more let me sneak in really quick you did the led acquisition i think early on you guys had talked about 350 million to 400 million a year those in effort improve the gross margin structure and the operating structure of the business clearly there is a headwind in china but outside of just the implications that you re seeing from an inventory perspective in china is there a change in customer behavior as a results to a competitive perspective are you seeing customers going to different direction or is it really just market weakness given what you re seeing from a covid and supply chain issue in that region mark adams hey tom it s mark adams it s really the latter to what you talked to relative to the demand profile as you might be aware if you ve looked at or seen some of the industry structural activity across the board let s start with consumer devices leds in that world are getting impacted by mobile phone decline globally certainly in terms of construction build and the likes it s also down and there was a major competitor who announced a restructuring in the quarter just a lot going on and i think cree is actually very well positioned for scale and continued growth as we kind of dance around the bottom here in the market i think really good gross margin profile in the business this type of exercise will get us more efficient as we prepare to go back up and i m pretty confident in this business given what s going on with the rest of the market ken rizvi yeah tom just to highlight as well when we look at that business right now what we re seeing is that distributors are burning through some inventory and trying to lean out given the macro uncertainty so the end demand is higher than the revenues we re guiding to for led in q1 obviously in this type of environment that visibility is a bit uncertain as we look out into q2 q3 but if we look at history these periods in terms of inventory burns usually lasts one to three quarters or so so as we look into q2 or into q3 we would hope that this is behind us and our sell in will start to match our sell out thomas o malley thank you operator thank you for your question sir our next question comes from the line of raji gill with needham company your line is now open raji gill thank you and thanks for taking my questions i appreciate it again just a follow up on the guide for november specifically around the gross margin so just wanted to get a sense of what the gross margin organically ex the stratus is trending quarter over quarter and how do we think about the inputs the puts and takes there by the different sub segments ken rizvi yeah so maybe i ll give it to you raji in aggregate so what we said historically is that the stratus acquisition adds north of 150 basis points on an annual basis to our gross margins on a non gaap basis and so given where sales levels are for q1 it s probably closer to that 200 basis points or even a little bit more there but in that 200 basis points range here in q1 given the current sales levels so that you can subtract the 200 basis points to get to where the base business is and it will be similar as i outlined earlier to brian if we looked at the segments i would expect the only change as we look at the segments or the primary change would be led gross margins are expected to be down a little bit here from q4 to q1 just because of the fixed cost nature of the back end and the lower sales volume raji gill got it appreciate that and then just on the november guide with respect to the revenue so led is down 20 plus sequentially and then you indicated that ips ex the stratus will be kind of flat to up it implies memory overall memory will be down something in the order of about 4 or so 4 to 5 and so the question i have is if we kind of split that between specialty memory and brazil memory one if you could elaborate some of the trends that are going out within each of those segments should we expect kind of brazil to continue to be under pressure given the economy there are we seeing any kind of any impact on specialty memory with respect to the overall drop in memory pricings any clarity on those specific segments mark adams hey raji it s mark let me take the first part of that and i ll let ken piggyback relative to the memory market itself as we guided on our last call brazil had some pretty strong headwinds in the consumer facing mobile phones and notebook desktop notebook market and that played out as we had suggested and thought on our last call now what i would say also as we talked about a specific customer purchasing dynamic in a quarter as well and what we re starting to see is kind of a bottom there and a bounce from the bottom we think it s probably stronger slightly stronger maybe q1 on brazil and on the enterprise side a bit of memory the specialty memory business it s been pretty stable quarter over quarter i ll let ken give you the particulars but the demand profile is pretty good now obviously you can analyze the announcements from the memory guys in the market a lot of fluctuation in memory pricing we don t tend to get hit very hard on the margin side of the memory pricing because our products are priced on a kind of service level model if you will but i would also suggest that units can offset some revenue but i think especially be kind of flattish in the quarter let ken jump in and give you kind of more particulars ken rizvi yeah so i would say raji if we looked at that business overall we had a range in our guidance as you know but it can be flat to down at that mid point level down a little bit at the mid point level and as mark mentioned i think if we look at the brazil business it did come down here in q4 it s kind of bouncing at those levels here and i think the hope is as we move into q2 and beyond we start to see a recovery in demand and then in the specialty business as mark highlighted that s been essentially on a very similar level as we look back to q4 versus q1 raji gill very helpful and just last question ken if i can on the opex so the opex sort of going up i think mentioned 14 million sequentially which includes stratus so is that kind of the opex run rate on a go forward basis 75 million odd a quarter or should we expect synergies on the opex side any clarity there would be helpful thanks so much ken rizvi yeah and so as mark mentioned i would assume that for modeling purpose that s it that s the run rate of the business because we are incorporating stratus as mark mentioned as we look at the combined business in all of the businesses one of the areas that we re looking at is making sure we re prudent on the cost structure in our overall cost but from a modeling purpose i think that s fair to model in that range as you move through the year raji gill thank you operator thank you for your question our next question comes from the line of sidney ho with deutsche bank your line is now open sidney ho thanks for taking my question my first question is on the ips side i think last quarter you talked about demand trends into the first half of 23 it looks pretty good and then your backlog was close to 500 million which is three to four times your quarterly run rate can you give us an update on how much visibility do you have now are you seeing any kind of demand driven push out or cancellations and maybe directionally how the backlog has done i guess excluding stratus mark adams sure sidney this is mark let just talk to the first part of that which is the demand trend for our first half of the year i would say that nothing has changed since we last talked in on the earnings call in q3 the backlog remains very strong and the implicit guide in q1 may suggest that it s still very strong for us so january is still very bullish on ips now can we see out into q2 and can something push in q2 sure we haven t seen that yet but i would also say that my belief is that the type of systems that we re implementing with our customers are very strategic in nature and our belief is that over time these systems are not about short term cost cutting activities in these larger enterprises we serve so i m of the belief that people will invest through the cycle and these are the type of systems that we re installing these ai machine learning systems for tomorrow s enterprise so to speak so we re optimistic that will play out that way we haven t seen an ounce of any reduction in orders or backlog relative to the front half of our year and i just can t call q3 and beyond at this point sidney ho okay that s helpful maybe staying with the ips if you look at the services if my math is right i understand it s up 11 year over year up like 59 for the full year but it is down quite a bit from the q3 level and if my math is right it s somewhere in the 15 range of ips services for the quarter just curious of why that in absolute dollar that number can actually go down so it s in other words is fiscal q3 more like an anomaly where fiscal 4q is kind of right the right run rate going forward mark adams yeah so it s a good question sidney so when we talked about last quarter we did say there were some quarter specific implementation and other services that occurred in quarter and this time it s just the nature of the overall business there is some lumpiness and variability quarter to quarter and so we tried to outline that on our last call that we had some items that were specific to that quarter in terms of implementation and other specific services that we generated with our customers if you look at this quarter meaning q4 we talked about kind of low 20s type of services and i think what is important in that number however is that there is a larger portion of those services that are based on longer term engagements so we have visibility as we look out 12 months on a quarterly basis we have visibility and i think that s where i know thierry and the penguin team and the ips team are driving is to have further engagement better visibility more long term visibility and that complements very much with what stratus is doing with their services business so i think as we look into 2023 we re going to have a very good services year especially inclusive of the stratus business my guess is that services component for the both businesses on a combined basis should be well north of 150 million which is goodness in terms of visibility goodness in terms of margin and goodness in terms of cash flow of the overall business sidney ho okay that s super helpful if i can squeeze in one more just a housekeeping one given how the specialty memory versus brazil memory they have different trends over the last couple of quarters what portion of the memory solutions business is now coming from specialty memory and that s it for me thanks mark adams yeah we didn t break that out specifically but if i look at the specialty business it is much larger than the brazil business today if i looked at both q4 and i looked at what we re expecting here in q1 so overall we talked about that business doing about 210 million in q4 and if you looked at what it did in q3 call it 266 million the vast majority of that delta from q3 to q4 was around the brazil business the specialty business did come down a little bit but now it s kind of flattening out at that level so brazil has been the largest headwind in the memory side sidney ho great thank you operator thanks for your question our next question comes from the line of kevin cassidy from rosenblatt securities your line is now open kevin cassidy yeah thanks for taking my question my question is more around the a number of rfqs you re getting for the ips business has there been a change since all this discussion around the recession coming or maybe here already are you seeing any companies pulling back on their capex or any even comments around both private and public side as far as new rfqs coming up mark adams hey kevin this is mark at this point we have not seen anything noticeable in terms of the activity the funnel building at ips actually i would say that we re seeing more opportunities remember by the way these cycles are six to 12 months at a minimum in terms of replying in our q2 getting a commitment in some cases and so it s not surprising that we haven t seen that actually our funnel continues to grow and we re also as i talked about on prior calls we re not in the hardware only business at ips and so we re pretty selective in terms of the type of opportunities we want to bid on because we want to make sure we re getting paid for the value we create in the services in the overall integration of hardware software and services it s something that we re just going to stay disciplined to so even in that sense we still are seeing a lot of and healthy funnel building activities and i would say the commercial side has been relatively strong and then at the federal side we just haven t seen anything pulled back because actually when you think about the federal piece of the business commitments on this year kind of pretty much locked up and shipments are already scheduled in that part of the business and so next year people are business as usual they don t know what the next year s spending will or will not be so the federal side is still very active as well kevin cassidy okay great thanks for that explanation and how about the supply chain for ips a few quarters ago there was all types of bottlenecks can you give some comments on what you re seeing in the supply chain mark adams yeah i think we re not out of the woods yet on the supply chain now what we re just doing is and i think i ve talked about this on a prior call we are seeing sectors and the supply chain that are demand driven recovery which is not exactly what we want i e memory and yet there is other parts of the ecosystem other technologies that we integrate and manufacture our systems with that are still tight so it s a bit of a hybrid or a mix where some industries have loosened up a bit and some have not and we re still day to day and of course it s going to like the least common denominator we needed all the kind of line up and so our teams are working diligently to make sure we re able to navigate that and our guide implies that but still not out of the woods yet in the supply chain kevin cassidy okay thank you end of q a operator thank you for your question and with that we have exhausted all questions in the queue so now i would like to pass the conference over to mark adams ceo for any closing remarks mark adams thank you operator and thank you all again for joining today after a record fiscal year 2022 we are excited about our future at sgh with a mindful eye on the current market headwinds we remain vigilant in how we operate the company to balance our investment for long term success while being prudent in our spending in the near term operator and with that we will conclude today s sgh fourth quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call thank you for your participation you may now disconnect your line

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure

criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

other employees recommended that the piston ring design be changed gm made other ineffective engine design changes in 2011 but the oil consumption issues persisted until gm finally discontinued

michael gonzalez getty images spacex and t mobile hold joint event in texas new york tesla ceo elon musk proposed the completion of a deal to acquire twitter on tuesday reversing a monthslong effort to terminate the agreement musk the richest person in the world according to forbes put forward a proposal to twitter that would complete the deal at musk s original offer price of 54 20 a share at a total cost of roughly 44 billion a person familiar with the proposal told abc news in a statement twitter said it plans to agree to a deal at the price proposed by musk we received the letter from the musk parties which they have filed with the sec the company said on tuesday the intention of the company is to close the transaction at 54 20 per share twitter filed a lawsuit against musk in july over his effort to terminate an acquisition agreement that trial is set to begin in less than two weeks musk reached an acquisition deal with twitter in april but over the ensuing weeks he raised concerns over spam accounts on the platform claiming twitter had not provided him with an accurate estimate of their number twitter rebuked that claim saying it had provided musk with information in accordance with conditions set out in the acquisition deal this is a clear sign that musk recognized heading into delaware court that the chances of winning vs the twitter board was highly unlikely and this 44 billion deal was going to be completed one way or another dan ives a managing director of equity research at wedbush an investment firm told abc news tuesday in an email the move from musk marks the latest reversal of course in a saga that started in january when the billionaire first invested in twitter by march musk had become the largest stakeholder in twitter and the following month the social media company announced that musk would join its board days later however musk said he had decided against joining the board in april musk offered to buy twitter at 54 20 per share valuing the company at about 44 billion the offer amounted to a 38 premium above where the price stood a day before musk s investment in twitter became public roughly 10 days later twitter accepted musk s offer one month later however musk said he had put the deal temporarily on hold citing concern over what he said was the prevalence of bot and spam accounts on the platform roughly two hours later musk said he was still committed to the deal eventually musk moved to terminate the deal in july soon after twitter sued musk in chancery court in delaware to force him to complete the deal a scheduling decision made by the court in july to hold the trial over five days in october appeared to align more closely with a timeline requested by twitter which had sought a four day trial in september musk asked the court to set a trial date no earlier than mid february 2023 now according to the deal the court case is off if the two sides reach a deal twitter stock closed tuesday at 52 01 up 22 for the day copyright 2022 abc audio all rights reserved
consumer alert elon musk is on the verge of buying the social media network twitter but how will that affect users joining us live this morning with more information is jed jeslin he is the executive director of planet good morning thanks for joining us good morning how are you good morning so what impact do we think this wlil have on the social media site i think there could be a lot of impact and interestingly you know twitter launched in 2006 and only6 1 years later it s being sold for 44 billion dollar so obviously there are a lot of usersnd a regardless of anyone s individual opinion about twitter the fact isha tt it s becoming huge elyffective communication tool all over the world talking about important stoesri and sometimes trivial things big picture elon musk goals i that he wants to promote free and transparenspt eech so that s kind of main message soar f and whyre a some people thinking that s a bad thing i think some people are thinking they might be charged fees number one jen also user authentication is going to become a big deal and content moderation is a big topic across social media and like i said he is promoting free speech he says but that means could mean lifting bands it could mean changing the way that people are able to speak and it also means openingp u the algorithm he says which mea mnsaking it possible foreo pple to see how things are being moderedat and if they are and and you know truthfully there s arguments on both sides buthe t argument for that is maybe that s not such a bad thing yeah i tnkhi thats i an argument but the maybe one of the problems is that most usersre a probably not really even understandgin of an algorithm is so how do they really know what out there is true and what out there is not so let s talk question i didn even know until two minutes ago how to see my latest tweets until ien wt ahead and followed elon musk ande h actually had the directions posted right there how to do that so i feel like my brain just grew i just learned something new morning so wtha has been really the response to all of this been well really a firestorm obviously the reason you and i are talking about its i because it it conjures opinions and provokes opinions i think one of the big things that people think about now is that there s been a huge explosion of information and news all over the world and there s been a plunge in accuracy and accountability so people and brasnd are wondering how this is going to affect them and what they nca maybe believe and not believe boys in that theru tth there was a fake story that ran on reddit this week and some reputable news ageiencs ran with it so you do have to be very careful with the information that sut o there for sure so wtha what are your predictions moving forward on this becseau this isn t a complete done deal yet nd a there has been some some stalling in this takeover predictions are there will be continued news and it s really interesting that elon musk is sharing kind of provocative information almost daily sometimes hourly and he s sharing it through twitter so he has made some sort of critical statements about the platform which maybe they ll drive interest in the story maybe they ll dveri the ultimate price down who knows but i think people need to be watching this but also understanding that there s going to be a lot day to day that happens all right jed thanks so much for joining us this morning relyal appreciate it advertisement elon musk offers to end legal fight pay 44b to buy twitter share copy link copy video above how elon musk s takeover of twitter will affect userselon musk is abandoning his legal battle to back out of buying twitter by offering to go through with his original 44 billion bid for the social media platform the mercurial tesla ceo made the offer in a letter to twitter which the company disclosed in a filing tuesday with the u s securities and exchange commission the offer comes just two weeks before twitter s lawsuit seeking to force musk to go through with the deal goes to trial in delaware chancery court in a statement twitter said it intends to close the transaction at 54 20 per share after receiving the letter from musk musk s proposal is the latest twist in a high profile saga involving the world s richest man and one of the most influential social media platforms much of the drama has played out on twitter itself with musk who has more than 100 million followers lamenting that the company was failing to live up to its potential as a platform for free speech a letter from musk s lawyer dated monday and disclosed by twitter in a securities filing said musk would close the merger signed in april provided that the delaware chancery court enter an immediate stay of twitter s lawsuit against him and adjourn the trial scheduled to begin in two weeks by completing the deal musk essentially gave twitter what it was seeking from the court specific performance of the contract with musk meaning he would have to go through with the purchase at the original price the contract musk signed also has a 1 billion breakup fee eric talley a law professor at columbia university said he s not surprised by musk s turnaround especially ahead of a scheduled deposition of musk by twitter attorneys starting thursday that was not going to be pleasant on the legal merits his case didn t look that strong talley said it kind of seemed like a pretty simple buyer s remorse case if musk were to lose the trial the judge could not only force him to close the deal but also impose interest payments that would have increased its cost talley said what did surprise talley is that musk doesn t appear to be trying to renegotiate the deal even a modest price reduction might have given musk a moral victory and the ability to say he got something out of the protracted dispute talley said news of the renewed offer caused trading of twitter stock to be halted for much of tuesday afternoon on the new york stock exchange for news pending after it jumped nearly 13 to 47 93 that s still well below musk s original offer trading halts are how stock exchanges give investors a forced timeout when trading for a stock gets too chaotic or when a company is about to offer market moving news neither twitter nor attorneys for musk responded to requests for comment tuesday afternoon musk has been trying to back out of the deal for several months after signing on to buy the san francisco company in april shareholders have already approved the sale and legal experts say musk faced a huge challenge to defend against twitter s lawsuit which was filed in july musk claimed that twitter under counted the number of fake accounts on its platform and twitter sued when musk announced the deal was off musk s argument largely rested on the allegation that twitter misrepresented how it measures the magnitude of spam bot accounts that are useless to advertisers most legal experts believe he faced an uphill battle to convince chancellor kathaleen st jude mccormick the court s head judge that something changed since the april merger agreement that justifies terminating the deal legal experts said musk may have anticipated that he would lose things haven t been going well for him in court recently with the judge ruling more frequently in twitter s favor on evidentiary matters said ann lipton an associate law professor at tulane university the judge s denied several of musk s discovery requests lipton said it s also possible that musk s co investors in the deal were starting to get nervous about how the case was proceeding she said musk s main argument for terminating the deal that twitter was misrepresenting how it measured its spam bot problem also didn t appear to be going well as twitter had been working to pick apart musk s attempts to get third party data scientists to bolster his concerns twitter now has options in the case and doesn t necessarily have to accept a new offer from musk said robert anderson a law professor at pepperdine university twitter could still be concerned that the same thing might happen again without some additional security anderson said they re going to want some assurance that the deal is going to happen right away columbia s talley said he would insist on musk putting money into an escrow account until the deal is completed such an account could hold cash and or twitter shares as a good faith demonstration by musk talley suggested mysteriously neither musk nor twitter ceo parag agrawal have written anything about the deal on twitter where many developments in the dispute have been aired many of musk s tweets in the past 24 hours have been about a divisive proposal to end russia s invasion of ukraine drawing the ire of ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy musk argued in a tweet monday that to reach peace russia should be allowed to keep the crimea peninsula that it seized in 2014 he also said ukraine should adopt a neutral status dropping a bid to join nato following russia s partial mobilization of reservists if the deal does go through musk may be stuck with a company he damaged with repeated statements denoucing fake accounts susannah streeter senior markets analyst for hargreaves lansdown in the united kingdom wrote in an investor note this is an important metric considered to be key for future revenue streams via paid advertising or for subscriptions on the site and his relentless scrutiny of twitter s figures over the last few months is likely to prompt questions from potential advertising partners she wrote if musk were to lose among the remedies that would favor twitter is a court order to go through with the deal the chancery court last year forced private equity firm kohlberg co to go through with its 550 million buyout of decopac a company based in minnesota that calls itself the world s largest supplier of cake decorating supplies to professional decorators and bakeries the case was emblematic of the court s common though not uniform resolution of enforcing contractual obligations on buyers other options include musk being forced to pay the breakup fee each side agreed to if deemed responsible for the deal falling through or he might have to pay off a larger amount without actually buying the company for 44 billion
