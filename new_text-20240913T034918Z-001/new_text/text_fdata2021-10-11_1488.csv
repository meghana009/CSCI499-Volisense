jumbos rule b g nemesis on board a gunboat b g b g nemesis on board a gunboat b g by john curnow editor sail world aus 10 oct 2021 14 00 pdt not all the world s jumbos got retired and parked in the arizona desert at the beginning of 2020 boeing s venerable bus had served us all so so well later on that same year b g another powerhouse organisation gave us nemesis and this was a pretty cool piece of kit indeed so seeing as the behemoth known as brunswick corporation only recently completed its acquisition of navico b g s parent company i could not help but see the distinct parallels between all of that and a little project on some very well known and also record breaking maxis that has been going on since earlier in 2021 to that end i spoke with laura tolmay marketing communications manager at navico in sydney about how it all came to pass in previous years b g never had a direct partnership with wild oats however the vessels were always equipped with our gear through olectric who provided all the labour support and electronics in the middle of 2020 we began discussions with the wild oats team on a future partnership in conjunction with olectric to refit both wild oats x and xi with b g nemesis displays ws700 series wind sensors along with various graphic displays and wtp3 interfaces as the world s leading sailing instrument specialist we wanted to not only partner with a leader in performance racing but also acknowledge the unwavering loyalty and support that wild oats has always provided to b g last year we had an exciting launch of our b g nemesis displays they highlighted how we had shifted from an hv display to a fully customisable digital display that affords greater visibility and functionality wild oats x and xi were the optimum vessels to showcase the nemesis displays with expert crew along and a comprehensive racing schedule nemesis stock arrived into australia early in 2021 and olectric set out to install wild oats x with multiple nemesis 9 data displays ws730 vertical wind sensor and 7 x h5000 graphic displays with the intention of being race ready for a successful sailing season covid restrictions and the lack of sailing events have proven to be quite prohibitive to date works on wild oats xi have halted for now said tolmay in closing apart from being involved in some events in and around pittwater as sydney emerges from restrictions today there is some chance that wild oats x may take part in the southport yacht club s sail paradise regatta from 3 6 january 2022 so b g nemesis is the first of its kind in the marine industry a new generation of intelligent sailing data display that offers unparalleled visibility touchscreen and apple watch control with complete customisation or easy to use pre set multi function templates and automatic dashboards based on your point of sail nemesis allows you to define what data you see when and how you see it no matter what the conditions providing an intuitive link between your trusted instrument network and the real world nice over not out yassine drk s first attempt to complete 300nm solo non stop and unassisted in a laser no less started at 1040hrs on september 29 in front of dalia beach morocco now he might not have made it yet and that is something really important to remember here but the tale to date is a wonderful testament to determination adaptability respect for yourself and the sea as well as all the souls who gathered around to help him his support boat gladius arrived on station at 1000hrs and he received a radar reflector some little torches and a vhf from them it was the first he had actually met the volunteer crew who had stepped up once they had heard about his plans yassine talks about what it was like once under way as expected the wind was of 9 knots but soon after leaving things got different the first thing i noticed was that apart from having a dominant swell coming from the west i had to face waves from the east from the left from the right from everywhere so the challenge was not to nose dive imagine surfing a 5 to 6ft wave and then suddenly you get a 5 footer coming just in front of you i had two stashes of five litres water with me and a bag with all my food and batteries that weighed another 7 kilos so keeping the boat balanced was tough the wind was gusty i would say from 15 to 20 knots gusts so i had to keep really focused and apart from having my eyes on those weird waves coming from everywhere i had also to watch my back and watch for gusts so as to be ready to adjust mainsail and route the swell was of a super short period and also pretty hollow the way to surf those waves is to give a kick to the mainsail when the boat started to speed up it s a technique we use and it consists of pulling on a bit of mainsheet in a very fast way so the nose goes up and the boat accelerates note that the bodywork has to follow meaning that every time i had to adjust my upper body to avoid counter heel when the boat heels to your side capsizing like that means that a very long swim will follow after the boat turns turtle in the strait of gibraltar it s bad very bad the currents are so violent that there would be only one outcome all over i battled for around seven hours to leave the strait here s a little video of part of it all as going downwind was impossible i had to break my way out of the strait so it was all about close reaching which also reduced the likelihood of capsizing every time i felt that the boat was going to heel to my side i just pushed the rudder and got in the tacking position when facing the moroccan coast i had a 90 degrees angle to it and when going to the spanish coast i had a more opened angle so i could go deeper only on one side so i was sailing across the wind when on port tack and reaching when on starboard yankee foxtrot there was a time when i crossed the path of a super tanker i didn t panic i was kind of amazed by the waves crashing against it so much power those vessels are very quick you see it two kilometres away and then a few minutes later it s by your side i kept sailing in this way till i arrived at cape malabata where i got a bit inside tangier bay to just have a deep breath and some tobacco i ve never had similar experience i was proud of myself and happy that i hadn t capsized every time i had to tack i had to adjust the weight on board and change the two big bottles of water from one side to the other it wasn t a pleasant manoeuvre from cape malabata to cape spartel the swell period got a bit longer but the wind was still strong i managed to turn after cape spartel before dark the water got flat and it was a thai massage after what i had gone through the total distance to cross the strait from cires point to cape malabata ended up at 65km instead of 40km around 6pm i was in the atlantic ocean and it was less windy for an hour then when it got as dark as a black coffee the wind came back and again from astern my hope was that in the atlantic i was going to get it from the side in the drink i had a talk with the support boat before it got dark and we started off again we lost sight on each other at 10pm and at 1am i started to feel weak subsequently i threw up and was feeling very bad i had a fever at 2am i capsized and righting her took all my last energy i felt very cold and decided to find asilah s city port that was again a challenge as there were no lights showing you the entrance the marina is being rebuilt so it was impossible to spot the entrance i asked a fisherman and he pointed to a resort with blue lights saying the entrance was in that direction and you could only when you were 100 metres from it the wind died so i paddled for like 30 minutes and used the swell to get there i was afraid of being dragged onto the jetty i made it to the authorities pier and they were surprised to see me there of course they said i gave them a hard time as they were following my manoeuvres using thermal binoculars and didn t know what i was doing nor who i was by 5am i called my brother and asked him to come with my documents and my phone the officers offered me a hot shower a blanket a pillow and invited me to sleep a bit my brother came with dry clothes the boat got picked up and sent to tangier yacht club as asilah is only 40km from tangier my wife arrived as too my friend fabrizio and i went to tangier with them where i had a hot drink and fell asleep the waypoints of the journey can be seen here it s a matter of a few weeks before they try again the support boat is coming along again the owner holds multiple fishing world records and yassine is determined to be even more prepared it was a wonderful journey and i ll never forget that feeling in the strait deep focus maximum effort huge hills dolphins big birds coming to say hi or just curious and looking to understand what i was hahaha or the battle with the elements the next attempt will probably start from tangier instead of point cires i ended up with sore hands as i didn t block the mainsheet for the whole crossing i tested my limits in and have more love and respect for the ocean than ever as well as even more love for sailing a super appreciative yassine closed by saying the team on gladius have all my gratitude as it was very tough for them as well they came as volunteers to give a hand with a true mariner s spirit thanks to my wife brother family and friends jacky my dog the moroccan sailing association also to you john and the sail world family in typical style yassine added thank you to my

i had the good fortune to work for intel for 15 years during the dotcom boom and i cashed in the stock options right before the tech collapse i always said i wouldn t quit my day job to write full time until i knew that i could make it even without the writing income usually the advice is that you shouldn t quit your day job until you have enough residuals to cover your expenses but in this case my residuals are other investments to survive as a writer you need a patron somebody who loves your work and is willing to give you anything you want without strings attached my patron was my own previous self this guy who made a lot of money in high tech and gave it all to me i m not writing as a career you can t make a career off of short stories though i certainly hope to be able to sell novels and make a lot more money than i can on short stories when i start writing a story i explore the space around the story find the voice and find the structure stories tend to follow tropes to fall into cliché and this happens because there are structures that work they come out of our culture and out of the biology of our brains there are things that readers understand that readers expect and i play with those expectations very carefully you have to defy them to at least some degree or it s i ve read that a thousand times before yet if you play with readers expectations too much they start to become confused they say i don t know what the hell is happening here and they lose interest so you have to stay fairly close to the established track you want to strike off it but not too far both the publishers and the readers like writers who can do one thing really well and who have a consistent product even in science fiction people follow a universe they want to read another known space story another heinlein s future history story another hammer s slammers so my adhd i suppose you might call it my wanting to write all kinds of different stories has not particularly helped my career but it s who i am and it s what i like to do i called my collection space magic because i wanted to emphasize that i don t just do sf or fantasy and the stories were specifically selected to show the breadth of my interests i have maybe one third fantasy ideas to two thirds science fiction the mars society is an international non profit which is dedicated to generating excitement about the idea of sending people to mars a year or two ago i read an article about their simulated mars bases in my blog i put a list of space related things i d love to be able to do 1 was a trip to the international space station and 2 was going to one of these simulated mars bases for a couple of weeks an old roommate from college saw this post and said hey i know some people from the mars society i could put you in touch i sent in my application on december 23 2009 on december 24 i heard back from the director of operations of the mars society saying somebody had to drop out can you make it in two weeks so on two weeks notice i went off to the utah desert for two weeks of living in a simulated mars habitat with people i had never met and we pretended we were on mars you can read all about it on my blog at i also have a book called the mars diaries a collection of the crew s blogs which i self published for a very small audience i ve sold 40 or 50 copies a reasonable number worth the effort i have this concept i talk about a lot that i call protagonism the quality that a protagonist in a book has that the other characters do not have the protagonist makes thing happen that if they didn t happen there would be no book and when you are isolated a long way from home with a small number of other people you learn that if you don t fix the sink nobody else is going to and if you don t stop that thing from blowing away there s nobody else in the position to do it you become self reliant you learn to take action do all the things that make you the protagonist of your own story

the pandemic was hard for everyone but it was harder for some than others according to a study of 2000 americans conducted by one poll on behalf of big health found that only 54 of those with an income less than 30 000 per year felt that they had access to mental health services compared to 76 of those who make over 150 000 per year while some have looked for help there is still a stigma attached to getting that help with mental health issues 76 of asian americans are most likely to face stigma from their community compared to 57 of white americans the most common mental health issues 64 said that they have experienced heightened anxiety and 53 said that they had feelings of depression the big house study found that of those surveyed 39 have a prescription to help with their mental health which means they have gotten help from a doctor which is a good thing advertisement these simple ways to focus on your mental health can make a huge difference share copy link copy editor s note psychologist john duffy author of parenting the new teen in the age of anxiety practices in chicago he specializes in work with teens parents couples and families on this world mental health day the second of the covid 19 pandemic it is clear that people most people are struggling across cultures we were experiencing plenty of mental health issues well before the pandemic including but not limited to undue stress and anxiety poor self esteem eating issues and family strife all of these challenges have been exacerbated over the course of the past 18 months i encourage you to take honest stock of your own emotional well being today are you taking care of yourself are you suffering unnecessarily are you priding yourself on being busy when you are in fact exhausted are you hiding depression or anxiety to protect the people around you the following are six steps you can take today to enhance your mental wellness and that of those around you begin a daily wellness regimentaking care of yourself emotionally starts first thing in the day preferably before your feet hit the floor in lieu of checking social media or starting work draw in a few deep breaths and consider three things you find yourself grateful for these can be grand like your spouse job or health or modest like the weather the view from your window or even the luxury of those first breaths then if you haven t already try a brief guided mediation like one of these cnn picks or the calm or headspace app read a comforting excerpt from a favorite self help or other relaxing book by doing so you will create a calm relaxed mindset for the day even stressful days packed with activity will feel more manageable and tranquil if you do so and you will find yourself catastrophizing far less over the course of the day remember a lot of the things that enhance physical health also support emotional well being evaluate what you put in your body and your mind food drink drugs a constant stream of video programming and so on thinking about how you might manage your intake to make your body healthier will undoubtedly have mental health benefits as well i cannot express enough how these early in the day actions can impact your mindset of peace well being and gratitude for the rest of your day starter tip don t think you ll remember first thing in the morning write it on a sticky note and place it over your phone before you go to bed get outside your own mind every daywhen we are anxious or depressed our symptoms tend to occupy our minds we scan for severity or for new mental difficulties and the more we scan the more we tend to find further our depression anxieties and other emotional concerns tend to amplify when they remain our sole focus if we get out and attend to serving others we find that our own worries diminish we also feel better when we serve others coming away with a sense of satisfaction accomplishment and contribution a win win for mental health volunteer at a soup kitchen or your child s school work a phone helpline for others struggling with emotional difficulties remove the unnecessaryover the past couple of years there has been no doubt that we are too busy and protect precious little time to relax and do virtually nothing today presents a wonderful opportunity to consider what we can take away from our daily lives that might enhance our peace of mind and support our emotional wellness this is a day to remove the misguided pride in the word busy and focus not on all we can do but on what really needs to be done and what does not in fact the pandemic has presented a unique opportunity to do so many of my clients have found in their new work from home worlds that in past years much of their time has been spent on unnecessary activity from busy work to social media scrolling others find these activities prevent them from getting a full night s sleep or connecting with family which are crucial elements of emotional wellness removing some of this activity can help us protect time for some of these other endeavors that foster well being and growth assess your relationshipsassess how each of your relationships is working for you are you giving more than you re receiving from a sibling or friend do you feel hopeful and refueled after a coffee date with an acquaintance many of us spend far too much time and energy on relationships that are either toxic or one sided and that can include social media connections you may also recognize that you do not reach out and connect enough to others slowing down to connect more deeply and share your life and story with your close family or friends is among the most important ways you can strengthen your mental wellness check in with your peopleworld mental health day can be a welcome excuse to reset for improved self care but it also presents an opportunity to check in on the mental health of the people around you your family friends neighbors and anyone else in your orbit some people you feel you are very close to maybe suffering but are adept at hiding it check in with all the people you love and just ask them how they are doing and feeling for some this may prompt them to assess their own mental well being knowing there is someone in their life who cares enough to ask be willing to change and learnmany of my clients have stubbornly asserted that they know what s best for themselves and too often continue bad habits even as they come to me for help treat yourself to an hour a week of self focus and self care whether it s through therapy or other practices you will learn a lot about how your mind works and how to remove roadblocks to wellness you may have been clinging to for years in doing so you are not only tending to your own emotional well being but

shanghai oct 11 smm this is a roundup of global macroeconomic news last friday and what is expected today the u s dollar was largely unmoved by a disappointing u s employment report on friday as traders bet that the lacklustre numbers may not sway the federal reserve from starting a tapering of its asset purchases as early as november the labor department said in its employment report on friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 194 000 jobs last month economists polled by reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 500 000 jobs the fact that the gain in jobs was modest could temper expectations for a swift acceleration in economic growth following an apparent sharp slowdown in the third quarter but is unlikely to stop the federal reserve from starting the process of reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as november analysts said september s employment report is the last one available before the federal reserve s nov 2 3 policy meeting stock futures edged lower sunday night after finishing near the flat line friday after investors shook off concerns about a much weaker than expected labor market report released on friday dow jones industrial average futures fell 71 points or 0 21 s p 500 and nasdaq 100 futures lost 0 28 and 0 33 respectively in regular trading friday the dow slipped 8 69 points to 34 746 25 the s p 500 lost 0 2 to 4 391 34 the nasdaq composite fell 0 5 to 14 579 54 the markets responded to a disappointing jobs report that first sent the major averages lower although investors concerns eased up after digesting the data and realizing things perhaps aren t as bleak as the data initially suggested as for oil west texas intermediate crude futures the u s oil benchmark crossed 80 per barrel on friday for the first time since november 2014 as demand rebounds while supply remains tight the u s oil benchmark jumped more than 2 to trade as high as 80 09 on friday before easing from that level and hovering around 79 70 at 11 30am on wall street brent crude the international benchmark advanced 1 7 to 83 32 per barrel oil prices have surged in recent days alongside a broader rally in commodities including natural gas and coal amid an energy crunch that s sweeping europe and asia gold hit a more than two week high on friday as the dollar took a breather after u s jobs data came in well below expectations casting doubts about an immediate start to tapering by the federal reserve spot gold rose 1 2 to 1 777 00 per ounce by 9 38 am et 1338 gmt set for a second straight weekly gain u s gold futures advanced 1 3 to 1 781 60 the pan european stoxx 600 ended down 0 2 with autos gaining 1 2 while tech slid 1 3 to lead losses markets have fluctuated hard over the past week as global investors assess the possibility of persistent high inflation with u s bond yields driving jitters for growth oriented tech stocks ireland relinquished its opposition to new global corporate tax rules later on thursday agreeing to forego its 12 5 tax for large multinational corporations

menafn iraq business news by ahmed tabaqchali chief strategist of afc iraq fund any opinions expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of iraq business news the market as measured by the rabee securities rsisx usd index ended an unremarkable month down 3 3 but up 22 7 for the year the last 30 days of the 40 day arbaeen pilgrimage took place throughout the month ending on september 28th and as it progressed life slowed down to a crawl the arbaeen pilgrimage is among the world s largest annual pilgrimages with the last official figures before the onset of covid 19 showing about 14 mln pilgrims taking part in 2019 during the 40 days about two thirds came from within iraq and a third from iran lebanon the gulf states pakistan india the u k and the u s the pandemic had severely affected the number of pilgrims in 2020 especially the number of foreign visitors though things have started to recover in 2021 the pilgrimage climaxes at the end of the 40 day mourning period arbaeen in arabic of the death of prophet muhammad s grandson imam hussein leading to the climax pilgrims walk to karbala from across iraq famed iraqi hospitality is in full swing throughout the period as residents along the pilgrimage s many routes to karbala and especially in karbala itself open their homes to the visiting pilgrims providing them with shelter and food as documented in a bbc story in 2017 some stunning scenes of the pilgrimage can be seen in a 2020 piece by a new york times photojournalist during the month the average daily turnover on the iraq stock exchange isx was in line with the low levels of the last three months while the market as measured by the rabee securities rsisx usd index continued with its consolidation after the solid year to date

components were up with asiacell tasc up 5 0 national chemical and plastics industries incp up 4 2 and al mansour pharmaceutical industries imap up 3 9 nevertheless a ho hum month was a welcome reprieve from the fireworks of the prior month and the likely political uncertainty ahead of parliamentary elections on october 10th which in turn could extend the suspense for a few more months if recent history is a guide government formation negotiations following parliamentary elections have over the last few years lengthened to span many months as a function of the country s increasingly fractured political landscape which makes reaching a consensus extremely time consuming however irrespective of the political uncertainty before during and after the election the one certainty is that on the eve of the elections parliament will be dissolved and the current government will become a caretaker government until a new one is formed most likely just before the second quarter of 2022 q2 2022 consequently as a caretaker government it no longer possesses the authority to propose bills to parliament including the 2022 budget bill that would have been due to be presented to parliament for review and debate around the same time as the start of the elections the promising aspect of this is that the government according to the constitution s 1 12th rule will implement the current spending plans of the 2021 expansionary budget until a new government is formed by q2 2022 the rule essentially means that the government can spend up to a twelfth of the appropriations made in 2021 on a monthly basis until a new budget bill is passed by parliament moreover the new government that will likely be formed by q2 2022 will not have enough time to propose a 2022 budget and so will continue to implement the 2021 budget throughout the year until a new 2023 budget is approved by the new parliament an event unlikely to take place before the first quarter of 2023 the significance of this is that the expansionary 2021 budget which added fuel to the market s rally at its passage at the end of march as discussed here in market extends the rally will continue to be in force until early 2023 this in turn means the sustainability for the conditions that led to the consumer led economic rebound as discussed here in on the economics of coiled springs crouching tigers and chicken lickens sustaining the government s ability to execute the expansionary 2021 budget throughout the next 18 months is the bounty brought by high oil prices which are likely to continue throughout 2022 given the stronger than expected demand and less than expected supplies brent crude is seen to average usd 68 9 per barrel in 2021 and usd 70 7 per barrel in 2022 according to oxford institute for energy studies latest forecast made in september all of which supports the market s consolidation thesis and argues that a likely subsequent rally in the market as measured by the rabee securities rsisx usd index will be supported by expected high government spending fuelled by oil revenues that would sustain the consumer led economic rebound which in turn will eventually lead to a continued

news and notes from final eliminations day at the texas nhra fallnationals notes quotes photos videos and more updated throughout the day josh hart scored a fortunate round one win as he continues his pursuit of the rookie of the year crown facing leah pruett his parachute deployed at halftrack but fortunately for him the engine in her dsr performance dragster went silent about the same time the remarkable thing is that hart s r l carriers dragster still went 3 75 towing the chutes through the lights but he ll give up second round lane choice to mike salinas who ran 3 72 in beating krista baldwin first round losses by leah pruett antron brown and shawn langdon nos 6 7 and 8 in points widened the gap between the top five and the rest of the field as that top five steve torrence brittany force mike salinas billy torrence and justin ashley all advanced tenth place doug kalitta beat brown in a crazy race in which both engines dropped cylinders and both cars lost traction as the drivers fought for control to the stripe where kalitta won 4 50 to 4 55 john force beat alexis dejoria on a holeshot 3 916 to 3 893 in round one of funny car by just 007 second to collect some important points and he was quick to admit that deep staging probably got him the win i never try to kid anybody at my age i know that worsham can put her right down that racetrack so i rolled it to beat her just getting those couple of inches because we were neck and neck in the lights the downside of a deep stage is that it costs you e t and force will cede lane choice to cruz pedregon in round two after the cruzer posted a 3 898 in defeating terry haddock with just two round wins in the first three races of the countdown robert hight in seventh place 148 points out of the lead but qualifying no 1 here gave him a mental boost after double stepping the throttle in round one in st louis two weeks ago we ve dug ourselves a hole and we ve got to win from here on out if we want a chance to win a fourth championship he admitted we ve had some performance but no consistency i screwed it up in st louis jimmy and chris have not forgot how to race i m not looking at it as pressure i m looking at it is a challenge it s gonna be fun we re gonna have to throw down every run there s only 16 more runs in eliminations the rest of the year so i ll predict right now if we can win 12 of those we re the champs he got one of those 12 in round one beating jeff arend with a 3 95 with only eight winners advancing from round one it was obvious that at least two top 10 funny car drivers would take it on the chin and that turned out to be no 8 tim wilkerson who lost a top 10 vs top 10 battle with fifth place j r todd as well ninth place dejoria who fell to force and 10th ranked blake alexander who was upset by paul lee j r todd s first round run a 3 867 was low e t of the meet not bad for a team that had to bring out a new car after the car brushed the left wall during friday night qualifying that was a big morale boost it s been up in our pit this weekend said todd it s just me struggling driving it s still going left on me but that was a helluva run by todd smith jon o and the yella fellas wilkerson s 3 886 would have beaten every other winning driver out there except bob tasca iii s 3 84 by earning six qualifying session bonus points and qualifying no 1 greg anderson increased his lead over erica enders from 17 points to 21 points or more than a round of racing there s still a lot of racing to go but anderson covets those so called little points those little points make a difference at the end of the year he said if you go out and qualify and you earn those little points you beat your chest you feel great but you realize how easy that is to lose a round on the starting line on sunday so it s an advantage anybody can beat anybody anybody who lets the clutch off the clutch first on sunday can win the race because everybody s that close so i d rather have that much of an advantage than not have it for the first time in four tries this season chris mcgaha beat his son mason the old man was ready for the kid cutting a 011 light and then driving to a 6 65 to 6 66 win as the result of a pre race bet that means mason has to drive the rig home fortunately it s a short trip to odessa about five hours mason s loss allowed his dad to switch places with him in the standings seventh and eighth and he could lose another spot if matt hartford can beat greg anderson in round two kyle koretsky came into eliminations in third place but suffered a devastating first round loss to troy coughlin jr allowing dallas glenn to pass him for third koretsky could fall even further as he s now in the sights of aaron stanfield who also advanced to round two there s no doubt that pro stock motorcycle points leader and low qualifier steve johnson is on a tear and it s not just the performance of his suzuki that s doing it he s also riding well er i mean driving well as he ll be the first one to admonish you there s a big difference between driving a pro stock motorcycle and riding one he asserted it s two different stories you ride a bull you drive a pro stock motorcycle oh sure you can ride a motorcycle like a big ol harley going down the highway but when you ride a pro stock bike you go into the wall you don t throw your body forward on the launch you miss shift points you might as well be in the backseat so when you drive you re in control you re proactive and i feel like we did a good job this weekend johnson drove it well in round one too beating jianna salinas with a 6 840 that was low e t of the round until matt smith bashed out a 6 79 on a bye run when michael ray was a no show for the first time in the last 12 races angie smith beat eddie krawiec and handed the multi time world champ a huge setback smith s denso ebr ran 6 93 while krawiec s bike bogged badly krawiec was the only top 5 rider to lose in the opening stanza but the damage may be limited from behind only scotty pollacheck can pass him for fourth place and would need to reach the final to do that but krawiec s chance of catching the top three steve johnson angelle sampey and matt smith took a hard hit justin ashley scored a huge round two win in top fuel defeating billy torrence on a 3 75 to 3 749 holeshot to take over fourth place from the senior torrence ashley was 030 on the tree to torrence s 091 things got even better for ashley a few pair later when josh hart defeated no 3 points man mike salinas allowing ashley to climb into third place ashley can climb no further in the standings even if he wins the race here s the current points steve torrence 2453 brittany force 2421 justin ashley 2312 john force racing went 0 for 2 in the right lane in the second round of funny car as third ranked john force got loose and moved to the centerline to lose to cruz pedregon and low qualifier robert hight went up in smoke early and couldn t chase down j r todd who lost traction further downtrack by beating force pedregon moved past him into third place and todd could drop him to fifth if he wins in the semifinals current points standings matt hagan 2429 ron capps 2376 cruz pedregon 2336 john force 2334 out j r todd 2315 the pro stock standings got another shakeup in round two when aaron stanfield beat second place erica enders on a

stock motorcycle world championship took a dent when she lost to angie smith then lost her second position to matt smith who beat chris bostick points leader steve johnson advanced to the semifinals after besting scotty pollacheck current points standings steve johnson 2360 matt smith 2328 angelle sampey 2315 out it s not often that a pro mod gets sideways then backwards then takes flight that the driver is able to keep the car in one piece but that s what happened to jeff jones in round two when his imperial construction corvette got loose against chad green the back end of the car actually started to kite but then came down with jones facing the wrong way jones was disqualified for crossing the centerline but otherwise got off easy justin ashley did himself and points leader steve torrence a huge favor by beating second place brittany force on a semifinal holeshot 3 740 to 3 727 to reach his third final of the year the margin of victory was a slim 007 second torrence then added to his lead by stopping his new best buddy rookie josh hart in the other half of the semifinals 3 76 to 3 79 ashley can t catch force for second but can pull to within 70 points of second if he beats torrence in the final current points standings steve torrence 2473 brittany force 2421 justin ashley 2332 matt hagan is assured to leave the race with the points lead after both he and his second place don schumacher racing teammate ron capps advanced to the final round capps defeated cruz pedregon on a holeshot 3 92 to 3 90 while hagan got a freebie after j r todd double stepped the throttle then smoked the tires in the dhl toyota just a long light and a loss of focus todd admitted we ve got a tall mountain to climb after that current points standings matt hagan 2469 ron capps 2416 cruz pedregon 2336 out john force 2334 out j r todd 2315 out the news just kept getting better for pro stock points leader greg anderson as fifth place aaron stanfield was felled by chris mcgaha and anderson went to the final after troy coughlin jr shook the tires mcgaha s win was especially notable as he was 013 on the tree after earlier lights of 011 and 005 we ve been coming here since the place opened said mcgaha we stunk it up for years so to even done what we ve done today is special it s been two years since i ve been to a final so i might not even remember how to do it mcgaha s last final round appearance was at the norwalk event in 2019 where he certainly remembered how to win current point standings greg anderson 2500 erica enders 2439 out kyle koretsky 2334 out dallas

the planet is likely to be at least 3 c warmer in 2100 than at the time of writing even if immediate and radical action is undertaken tollefson 2020 climate change is thus a defining challenge of our times the loss of biodiversity is just as pressing the scenarios issued by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc provide sophisticated modelling of the complex interactions between human activity and climate yet their modelling of heterogeneous spatial effects and of the multiple margins affected by this phenomenon remains rather simplistic cruz and rossi hansberg 2021a 2021b addressing oswald and stern s 2019 concern and following up recent efforts such as the special issue of the economic policy journal azmat et al 2020 we have collected five papers in a new special issue of the journal of economic geography joeg that contribute to addressing these shortcomings and address important aspects of two main themes of the economic geography of climate change 1 first climate change brings effects that are heterogeneous across space in turn some regions of the globe will lose more population and output per capita than others and some may even be better off as a result several papers in this special issue document this heterogeneity at a fine spatial scale for instance figure 1 reports the predicted change in temperature from a 1 c increase in the global temperature at a 1 x 1 resolution for the whole world in the year 2200 2 the resulting heterogeneity is striking second humans and other species will have to adapt in order to live margins of actions to slow down climate change include making consumption habits and production processes less carbon and methane intensive several papers in this special issue emphasise adaptation via migration and geographic mobility in particular the papers emphasise how lack of mobility could contribute to worsening the socioeconomic costs of climate change figure 1 predicted change in temperature from a 1 c increase in global temperature in year 2200 in the first paper in the special issue conte desmet nagy and rossi hansberg 2021a see also conte et al 2021b speak to both themes outlined above and we organise this vox column following their view the authors introduce a quantitative dynamic spatial growth model featuring as in the pioneering work of william nordhaus 1993 the two way relationships among economic activity carbon emissions and temperature importantly the analysis allows for two sectors agriculture and non agriculture which are heterogeneously sensitive to temperature and for a very fine spatial disaggregation the authors feed their model with data on population temperature and sectoral output at a 1 x 1 resolution for the whole world and with increases in the carbon stock and global temperatures that follow the carbon intensive ipcc scenario known as representative concentration pathway 8 5 with the model thus calibrated they let it run forward for 200 years to quantify the spatially heterogeneous effects of climate change on population gdp per capita and the production mix of agriculture and non agriculture outputs they also stress the roles of trade and migration in mitigating or amplifying the losses induced by climate changes for each 1 x 1 spatial unit heterogeneous spatial effects of climate change the initial scenario in conte et al 2021a assumes that frictions to the mobility of populations and of goods are constant over time their model predicts that scandinavia finland siberia and northern canada gain populations and see increases in income per capita while north africa the arabian peninsula northern india brazil and central america lose on both counts figure 2 which reproduces figure 6 in their paper reports the effect of climate change on predicted population in 2200 agriculture becomes spatially more concentrated and shifts towards central asia china and canada these scenarios imply substantial movement of populations within and across countries especially if trade is costly therefore impediments to mobility may produce substantially less efficient transitions figure 2 effect of climate change on predicted population in 2200 log differences notes the figure displays the logarithm of predicted 2200 population relative to predicted population under no climate change regions in dark blue are predicted to more than double their population regions in dark red are predicted to lose more than half of their population the paper by castells quitana krause and mcdermott 2021 complements this work in two ways first it offers a retrospective regression analysis to quantify effects of past climate change on rural urban migrations see also peri and sasahara 2019a 2019b whereas conte et al 2021a is mainly an exercise in forecasting second it studies the relationship between the evolution of rainfalls and temperatures on the urbanisation rates of countries and on the structure of large cities over a long period of time 1950 2015 importantly they allow for heterogeneous effects among low middle and high income countries and study the effects on the whole urban structure of countries as well as urban size density and form they find that worsening climate conditions higher temperatures and lower rainfall are associated with higher urbanisation rates in countries with unfavourable climate initial conditions and that these effects are especially strong in developing countries and affect the density and growth of cities of all dimensions including the largest metropolitan areas another important aspect complementary to the economic effect of climate change is its effect on local social tensions and conflicts the paper by bosetti cattaneo and peri 2021 analyses whether cross border migration influenced the link between temperature increases and conflicts for 126 countries over the period 1960 2000 on one hand increased temperatures and more frequent droughts affect the probability of local conflict by increasing local scarcity of resources e g hsiang et al 2011 on the other hand economic models of migration such as conte et al 2021a show that mobility attenuates economic losses due to the drop in productivity caused by climate change bosetti et al combine these two insights and document that the probability of civil conflict is positively correlated with temperature in poor countries and that this correlation is especially strong in countries with low propensity to emigrate emigration works as an escape valve in times of economic duress reducing population pressure in areas of developing countries experiencing losses in agricultural productivity seems to be an effective way to reduce the risk that those turn into local conflict not much explored yet are the effects of climate changes on fertility addressing this issue is the paper by grimm 2021 which studies the relationship between climate shocks and the demographic transition in the us for the period 1870 1930 the author documents a positive relationship between the variance in rainfall of an area and its fertility differentials between farm and non farm households in rural societies child labour provides additional resources when climate change and uncertainty increase variation in agricultural productivity rural families may thus increase fertility while this mechanism does not operate in urban families climate change leads to rising sea levels and to more frequent hurricanes and typhoons coastal areas are at particular risk 3 using an approach conceptually close to the one in conte et al 2021a desmet et al 2021 estimate the economic costs of coastal flooding the paper by indaco ortega and taspinar 2021 in the joeg special issue complements that paper by documenting the effect of hurricane sandy on nyc business the 2021 flooding led to a heterogeneous reduction in employment about 4 on average and wages about 2 on average with larger effects in brooklyn and queens than in manhattan these heterogeneous effects reflect heterogeneity in the severity of flooding and of industry composition margins of adaptation to climate change desmet et al 2021 develop a model in the same family as conte et al 2021a and estimate that the economic loss due to coastal flooding in 2200 increases from 0 11 of real income when the migration response is allowed to 4 5 when it is not three other papers in this special issue also focus on the role of migration as an adaptation mechanism to climate change castells quitana et al 2021 document emigration from rural areas to cities within country boundaries and focus on mobility as a force affecting the urbanization consequences of climate change bosetti et al 2021 analyse how cross border migration influences the link between warming and conflicts for 126 countries over the period 1960 2000 4 emigration attenuates the effect of rising temperatures on the probability of armed conflict while it does not increase probability of conflict in neighbouring immigration countries the margin of mobility is crucial also for businesses and employers indaco et al 2021 show that business adapts to flood risk by relocating establishments and that some businesses may even benefit from floods firms in nyc reacted to hurricane sandy by closing and relocating establishments to neighbourhoods less exposed to flood risk the ability of relocating depends on the sector of business but in general mobility of firms is also a crucial margin to adjust to climate changes conte et al 2021a also find that migration and trade are substitutes high trade frictions are an impediment in the local adaptation of the production mix to climate change as a move towards autarky prevents exploiting a region s evolving comparative advantage this encourages migration out of regions that are most adversely affected towards regions that are least affected by rising temperatures interestingly such regions are concentrated in europe japan and in the us where productivity is high it follows that high trade costs do not lead to uniformly higher climate costs recent work by cruz and rossi hansberg 2021a 2021b also complementary to conte et al 2021a considers two other margins of climate induced changes amenities and fertility while still underexplored the fertility channel takes centre stage in the paper by grimm 2021 grimm analyses fertility differences between farm and non farm households within counties over time to identify causal effects of rainfall and drought risks on the demographic transition he finds that the fertility differential in areas with a high variance in rainfall was significantly higher than in areas with a low variance in rainfall interestingly this effect disappeared when irrigation and agriculture machinery weakened the link between rainfall variance and yields concluding remarks ultimately the complex set of consequences of climate change on the economy and society need to be analysed both considering comprehensive models that guide our understanding of channels mechanisms and heterogeneity of the effects as well as case studies and more targeted empirical analysis that zooms in on one or a few of those and provides details and causal connections we have gathered some pioneering papers that do that and combine these two types of approaches in this

as it progressed life slowed down to a crawl the arbaeen pilgrimage is among the world s largest annual pilgrimages with the last official figures before the onset of covid 19 showing about 14 mln pilgrims taking part in 2019 during the 40 days about two thirds came from within iraq and a third from iran lebanon the gulf states pakistan india the u k and the u s the pandemic had severely

2017 some stunning scenes of the pilgrimage can be seen in a 2020 piece by a new york times photojournalist during the month the average daily turnover on the iraq stock exchange isx was in line with

up 5 0 national chemical and plastics industries incp up 4 2 and al mansour pharmaceutical industries imap up 3 9 nevertheless a ho hum month was a welcome reprieve from the fireworks of the prior month and the likely political uncertainty ahead of parliamentary elections on october 10th which in turn could extend the suspense for a few more months if recent history is a guide government formation negotiations following parliamentary elections have over the last few years lengthened to span many months as a function of the country s increasingly fractured political landscape which makes reaching a consensus extremely time consuming however irrespective of the political uncertainty before during and after the election the one certainty is that on the eve of the elections parliament will be dissolved and the current government will become a caretaker government until a new one is formed most likely just before the second quarter of 2022 q2 2022 consequently as a caretaker government it no longer possesses the authority to propose bills to parliament including the 2022 budget bill that would have been due to be presented to parliament for review and debate around the same time as the start of the elections the promising aspect of this is that the government according to the constitution s 1 12th rule will implement the current spending plans of the 2021 expansionary budget until a new government is formed by q2 2022 the rule essentially means that the government can spend up to a twelfth of the appropriations made in 2021 on a monthly basis until a new budget bill is passed by parliament moreover the new government that will likely be formed by q2 2022 will not have enough time to propose a 2022 budget and so will continue to implement the 2021 budget throughout the year until a new 2023 budget is approved by the new parliament an event unlikely to take place before the first quarter of 2023 the significance of this is that the expansionary 2021 budget which added fuel to the market s rally at its passage at the end of march as discussed here in market extends the rally will continue to be in force until early 2023 this in turn means the sustainability for the conditions that led to the consumer led economic rebound as discussed here in on the economics of coiled springs crouching tigers and chicken lickens sustaining the government s ability to execute the expansionary 2021 budget throughout the next 18 months is the bounty brought by high oil prices which are likely to continue throughout 2022 given the stronger than expected demand and less than expected supplies brent crude is seen to average usd 68 9 per barrel in 2021 and usd 70 7 per barrel in 2022 according to oxford institute for energy studies latest forecast made in september all of which supports the market s consolidation thesis and argues that a likely subsequent rally in the market as measured by the rabee securities rsisx usd index will be supported by expected high government spending fuelled by oil revenues that would sustain the consumer led economic rebound which in turn will eventually lead to a continued recovery in corporate profits source

print books are suffering from a shortage and will be in short supply going into 2022 this is why most of the biggest titles that are available as a pre order on amazon are already sold out such as will smiths will and dave grohl s new autobiography publishers are warning booksellers that a lumber shortage is preventing them from fulfilling most of the anticipated orders there is also a myriad of supply chain issues primarily attributed to covid that prevent their staff from operating anywhere close to full capacity two of the largest print distributors ingram and bookazine have reached out to their accounts to urge them to take a range of actions to try to mitigate problems informing them of steps they should take to be better positioned to meet the needs of the fall and holiday top of the recommendation list from both ingram and bookazine is for accounts to order as early as possible we are experiencing shipping delays from the majority of our vendors and do not see the problem being eliminated prior to the holiday season said cindy raiton president of sales at bookazine we advise all accounts to allow extra lead time and to take advantage of stock availability knowing that reprints will be challenging raiton said bookazine is increasing inventory by 35 40 over the comparable increases it took last year in the same time period ingram content group s chief commercial and content officer phil ollila said the supply chain issues that were faced last year will continue going into the holiday season ingram is ordering books earlier and in bigger numbers than usual he said explaining that if stores order early and in carton quantities that will make it easier and quicker for ingram to ship books out while ingram is taking steps to hire more warehouse workers he added it is also looking for any way it can to save time in fulfillment ingram is also asking publishers to get them the books as soon as possible to allow the wholesaler to stock titles as close to customers as possible most of this fall s major releases have already been printed or have their printing runs scheduled and any delays to those scheduled print runs are expected to be minimal still some titles have seen their publication dates bumped by weeks or even months of those some now won t reach shelves until next year the place where readers are most likely to find themselves in a crunch though is with surprise bestsellers every year there are books that do much better than either publishers or booksellers expected them to and sell out their initial print runs normally when that happens booksellers immediately order more books and publishers are able to print those books and ship them out rapidly in 2021 that s going to be a lot more difficult if a publisher unexpectedly sells out of a book early it may not be able to send new copies to bookstores until well into 2022 what is the deal with print books being in short supply a lumber shortage and reductions in workers at paper mills have contributed to a paper shortage that s affecting not just book production but paper towels toilet paper and envelopes as well and because many books are printed in china the route from printer to the bookstore is currently fraught with bottlenecks port congestion lack of shipping containers a shortage of dockworkers and trucking staffing problems are impeding the movement of books from warehouses to stores luckily there is going to be no shortage of digital books the format rose 11 7 and generated 2 12 billion in revenue in 2020 and continued to rise in the first six months of 2021 there was a small dip in sales during the dog days of summer but overall more people should be buying them with existing e readers but also populating their device with new purchases such amazon is going to be releasing two new paperwhite s and kobo announced the sage and libra 2

correction an earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that afghan evacuees arriving under humanitarian parole don t have a pathway to citizenship they can apply for permanent residency after a year this story has been corrected at a storage unit in landover md in late september dozens of volunteers hustled furniture into moving trucks their goal was to furnish three apartments by the end of the day two for a family of eight from afghanistan and the other for a family from el salvador the yellow stuff is all going to the two bedrooms and the orange stuff for the one bedroom called out laura thompson osuri the director of homes not borders a maryland based nonprofit group that focuses on furnishing homes for refugees resettling in the united states in previous years the group would furnish about one to two homes each week osuri said but since august when the united states airlifted tens of thousands of people out of afghanistan and began resettling many of them in this country volunteers are moving at twice that pace at times furnishing two apartments in a single day the nonprofit has rapidly expanded its budget hiring new staff and purchasing additional storage space all while relying on private donations advertisement thousands of afghan evacuees have arrived in the d c area where local nonprofits are moving at an accelerated rate to resettle them in some cases with no government support there are local offices of large resettlement agencies that have multimillion dollar contracts with the federal government to aid refugees then there are dozens of smaller nonprofits like homes not borders that take on cases the large agencies are too busy to handle or that get referred to them by immigration attorneys or through word of mouth we re picking up the slack and doing a lot of work with little staff said osuri who founded homes not borders in 2017 i would definitely not say no to federal or state support i think they definitely need to support all of us on the ground the state department could not provide figures on how many afghan evacuees have refugee status but many of the families being brought to the united states are coming through humanitarian parole a process that previously lacked a legal path to citizenship and benefits that are offered to traditional refugees instead they receive limited assistance for 90 days and receive a one time stipend of roughly 1 200 advertisement the biden administration expanded the program on sept 30 to allow those under humanitarian parole to apply for permanent residency after a year it also allowed those under humanitarian parole to be eligible for some of the same benefits as refugees that s all they re getting right now said krish o mara vignarajah president and chief executive of lutheran immigration and refugee service one of the nine national organizations the federal government contracts with to resettle refugees obviously when you re starting over in a new country with nothing but the clothes on your back it s going to take more than that to reach self sufficiency and successfully integrate typically refugees would receive help in the form of money food and medical assistance among other things for about five years until they found a job but with humanitarian parole status that was not possible according to ruben chandrasekar the executive director of maryland s chapter of the international rescue committee a national organization based in new york city advertisement both the smaller nonprofits and the federally funded resettlement agencies have been working on finding ways to help those families find housing food and other needs at zero cost so the evacuees can retain as much of the stipend as possible while searching for work while we re very adept at you know helping our clients settle in and find work within three to four months when they start paying their bills and can meet their basic expenses that process has to be expedited with the parolees chandrasekar said they don t have a social safety net to kind of keep them afloat before the money runs out many of the federally funded organizations are also having to rapidly staff up after years of cuts during the trump administration the refugee admittance cap fell to historic lows president donald trump initially sought to allow 15 000 refugees into the united states for 2021 which would have been the lowest since the 1980 refugee act in the process offices that helped refugees closed and vital connections with different communities were lost vignarajah said while it receives federal funding leaders at lutheran social services have previously said the organization has a 1 8 million funding gap as a result of resettling 500 refugees over the past month the biden administration has since increased the refugee admission goal to about 125 000 for the next fiscal year which started oct 1 since then resettlement agencies have been working with the u s state department to reopen its offices advertisement our job is more difficult in that we re ramping up significantly after hitting rock bottom vignarajah said share this article share in maryland the international rescue committee projects it will resettle 1 150 individuals just in the next six months chandrasekar said by contrast during the trump administration the group resettled about 200 people from the u s refugee program and about 50 to 60 asylum seekers on average each year we could see a fourfold increase in our workload year over year chandrasekar said the sudden surge in need has had a ripple effect on other nonprofits focused on helping refugees said barbara ferris president of the international women s democracy center a d c based nonprofit that relies solely on private donations ferris s organization has a program called welcome refugees that focuses on providing personalized support as refugees navigate settling in the united states usually volunteers with the program focus on one family at a time whether that s helping family members settle into a home or helping them enroll their children in school advertisement since august ferris has had families from afghanistan referred to her organization through immigration attorneys and other resettlement agencies who are overwhelmed her nonprofit has fundraised and applied forgrants to increase its budget by 100 000 to meet the needs of families who fled afghanistan she said but the grant process can take six to eight months ferris said she was recently on a call with 55 other organizations who specialize in refugee resettlement work her organization is helping plan a pop up aid center in arlington va where volunteers will distribute clothes to women men and children who fled afghanistan they also plan to hand out forms that families can use to list items they need such as a lamp or a crib organizers will then send the forms out to their networks find the items and deliver them to the family later many of these needs can t wait for government support to come through she said our goal is to get them into a stable situation as quickly as possible so that the trauma begins to decrease ferris said advertisement in the case of homes not borders it partners with some of the federally funded resettlement agencies like the international rescue committee and the ethiopian community development council to furnish homes without expense to those who arrive under humanitarian parole however homes not borders relies mostly on private donations osuri said since august the nonprofit has set up nearly 40 homes for about 170 people saving the families 124 800 osuri said recently osuri s nonprofit also began helping people under humanitarian parole that exist outside of the resettlement system because they ve left military bases and are staying with family in the area they ve found homes not borders through word of mouth in the afghan and refugee community while setting up a home in riverdale md in late september volunteers from the nonprofit took around three to four hours to clean and furnish the two apartments for the family of eight from afghanistan advertisement they assembled bunk beds hung up wall art and cleaned some of the kitchen appliances in the apartments over a four hour period one of the organizations that homes not borders partners with called kindworks delivered fruits vegetables and other meals to stock the fridge for the incoming family while manizha azizi 44 helped place furniture in the apartment she was also texting other afghan families who had recently moved into the same apartment complex to check if they needed anything azizi came into the united states as a refugee from afghanistan in 1985 after the soviets invaded the country she started volunteering in september after she saw afghans fleeing kabul in the news i ve just kept coming back she said many of the organizations so far said they haven t had any shortages in private donations since august rather they ve been overwhelmed with public support and have been trying to find the space to store everything advertisement homes not borders started leasing a 2 500 square foot storage space back in july thinking that would be enough for the next five years but after august it had to expand to another storage unit a few doors down to fit all the couches kitchen appliances and other home goods it started receiving the international rescue committee branch in maryland experienced a similar story both its offices in silver spring and baltimore received a high amount of donations but without enough storage space for the items the group has asked people who are considering donating to check an amazon wish list it screated so the items can go directly to families in need immediately rather than into storage vignarajah emphasized that the process is still just gearing up in the days to come more families will be processed to move into the united states and then agencies will have to work on getting people connected with jobs setting up for english classes if needed and enrolling kids in public schools

members of the united auto workers overwhelmingly rejected a new six year collective bargaining agreement with deere co on sunday uaw vice president chuck browning who has led negotiations with the company said in a statement sunday night that 90 of members voted against a contract that the two sides proposed he said uaw international staff along with presidents and chairs of nine locals will return to the bargaining table monday some locals in iowa posted on facebook that workers will go on strike if deere doesn t meet the uaw s demands by the end of wednesday many workers who spoke to the des moines register on sunday said they wanted the union to go on strike the last strike among deere workers was in 1986 after the company laid off thousands of employees during the farm crisis deere executives said sunday night that they will hear the uaw out john deere remains fully committed to continuing the collective bargaining process in an effort to better understand our employees viewpoints company officials said in a statement in the meantime our operations will continue as normal all of the locals in iowa roundly rejected the agreement with each voting no by more than 85 more everybody wants a john deere tractor but not everybody wants a john deere job why you deserve better the signs read throughout sunday members loudly protested the proposed contract which called for modest wage gains and enhanced retirement benefits at the cost of future workers on the drive into des moines saydel high school where deere s ankeny employees voted someone planted signs reading reject this piece of trash and you deserve better inside the university of northern iowa s mcleod center waterloo workers booed a uaw international representative members yelled at him about a 2018 vote when union delegates approved a 31 pay hike for uaw leaders according to videos of the event provided to the des moines register in east moline another video showed an employee asked union leaders why the uaw hadn t told the members to walk after workers voted to authorize a strike in september you didn t hear us she said do you hear us now do you hear us now how can you stand up there on your high horse and not hear us this is not who we are we deserve better more iowa manufacturers place bets on supply demand as steel prices soar like playing the stock market the vote comes as deere takes in record profits fueled by high corn and soybean prices the company projects it will earn 5 7 to 5 9 billion this fiscal year which ends in november that would be at least 61 higher than the company s previous record year in 2013 at the same deere managers said in may that they were struggling to hire enough workers durable goods manufacturing companies around the country have reported a record number of job openings this year workers in those factories in turn are quitting in record numbers what s in the contract the proposed contract between deere and the uaw calls for an immediate 5 or 6 pay raise for factory hands depending on the job for lower end positions like fork truck drivers first year employees would make 20 10 an hour up 96 cents from what the company paid earlier this year for higher end skilled labor jobs like electricians and plumbers new workers would get 30 30 an hour a 1 71 increase deere also agreed to offer 3 pay bumps in 2023 and 2025 as well as throw in three extra holidays and two weeks of paid parental leave the company would change its formula to determine how much money retired workers get under deere s pension plan a worker with 25 years of experience would receive about 100 extra every month the company would also give retired workers five lump sum payments from 20 000 to 50 000 depending on how many years they worked for the company before stepping away but the contract would also end the pension program for new hires after nov 1 those employees would receive matching contributions from the company in a 401 k plan deere no longer a premium employer outside of saydel high school marty carter said he voted against the contract because the changes hurt future employees the proposal reminded him of what happened between deere and the uaw in 1997 when the company enhanced pension benefits for its current workers but cut starting wages for new hires almost in half john deere was once a premium employer said carter a welder for the company for the last 11 years it used to be the best place to work it isn t anymore i think about our kids and our grandkids we need great places for them to work one day when they grow older this isn t going to do it shawn fields an assembler for the last 11 years said his decision to vote against the contract was pretty simple especially after the company declared that employees like him were essential to the country during the covid 19 pandemic we busted our he said we got crumbs that s all it comes down to diana swartz who has worked as an assembler for the last four years said the contract would bump her wage by 74 cents to 21 43 an hour she said the pay doesn t compete with what she made at her old job working in production for cargill for 24 46 an hour she added that her proposed small pay bump isn t satisfying when the pay of deere s ceo john may increased by 160 during the pandemic may received 15 6 million in 2020 up from 6 million the year before may received an extra 5 million in stock awards in 2020 as well as an extra 2 3 million in incentives because the company hit certain targets like sales figures they ve long forgot who really does the work swartz said john deere s been a bully since 97 on the playground with the uaw they bullied the uaw around and got away with it it s time we stood up we deserve more tyler jett covers jobs and the economy for

fan letter dear dawn how a nasa robot messed up our science fiction dear dawn did we do something to piss you off because to tell you the truth your attacks on our books seemed kind of personal in 2011 we came out with a science fiction novel called leviathan wakes that featured a big plotline on the dwarf planet ceres the largest object in the asteroid belt in particular we imagined a hard nickel iron ceres with a population of millions thirsty for water harvested from the rings of saturn we did pretty well with the story it got a hugo nomination and the publisher bought some follow ups four years later we were launching a television show based on the book starring the embattled crew of an ice hauler trying to keep ceres station hydrated that was 2015 the same time you became the first spacecraft to orbit a dwarf planet and as we gathered in the writer s room and on set what did you tell us ceres has water lots of it not only that you found large deposits of sodium carbonate

underappreciated and it deserves all the love i was sucked into the story and had such a hard time stopping and then the ending completely wrecked me like is it legal to inflict these types of emotions upon me idk but this book had me crying late at night as i read a bout and it s a sort of space fantasy that s based on indian mythology and has me swooning gosh my heart still hurts and i need the sequel asap if this book isn t on your tbr you re doing something wrong because it is amazing and the ending is so horrible for my heart but so worth it you can read my review here 6 academy

into the spider verse labeled on wikipedia as a actor singer dancer and rapper told the hollywood reporter he hopes to write a song for the sequel spider verse star shameik moore hopes to record a song for the movie s sequel the interview also ranges into moore s other genre interests it turns out he s a fan of the harry potter movies the hollywood reporter the spider verse soundtrack had a few hits including post malone and swae lee s sunflower have you pitched yourself to do a track for the spider verse sequel shameik moore they were asking me to make a song for spider man before any of the songs on the soundtrack were even being considered the only reason i am not on the soundtrack is because i couldn t quite come up with a song myself to write from miles point of view so next time hopefully the music that i ve been making is for me it s not really for spider man it s for who i am my music is a bit edgier 12 the great sky road andrew porter sent screenshots of some flights of

list is quite substantial adri and joe talk about books locus recommended reading list at nerds of a feather what did you expect or want to see here that isn t joe the first thing i specifically looked for was matt wallace s final sin du jour novella taste of wrath i m not entirely surprised it didn t make the list simply because i m not sure it s received a fraction of the attention and love that the series deserved i passionately and sometimes aggressively love those stories and it has been a perpetual disappointment to me that they haven t been nominated for everything they are eligible for and even for some things they aren t i m holding out for a best series hugo nod but maybe i shouldn t hold my breath the second thing i looked for and this was mostly out of curiosity was whether anything from serial box made the cut nothing did because i m that sort of wonk i did a super quick check of previous years and the first season tremontaine made the list i m not surprised by that either because tremontaine is an expansion of the swordspoint world and i would expect to see locus recognize ellen kushner i do wonder if next year we ll see recognition for the vela or ninth step

nasa kicked off the commercial crew development program in 2010 to support the development of new crewed spacecraft here we are almost a decade into the program and on the verge of a manned launch it s taken a long time to get here and it may be a little longer still spacex has announced yet another delay in its dragon 2 test flight which was supposed to take place this month the precise date has slipped numerous times and this is after ample delays in earlier phases of the program we re in the home stretch now so each change in the schedule is that much more frustrating spacex initially wanted to conduct the first test launch of its crewed dragon capsule in 2017 then the timeline slipped to 2018 and then it was late 2018 more recently spacex promised a january 2019 launch and then it decided february was more likely you can probably blame the government shutdown for that one now we re looking at march 2 according to spacex 16 role playing last summer simon pegg talked about

of journalists according to matt carlson author of the robotic reporter the algorithm converts data into narrative news text in real time many of these being financially focused news stories since the data is calculated and released frequently which is why should be no surprise that bloomberg news is one of the first adaptors of this automated content their program cyborg churned out thousands of

it s the tale of two headlines the first from the smh warns about how the rescuing of the economy has pushed government debt towards 1 trillion and the second from sydney s the daily tele reminds us that half a billion dollars worth of spending is set to be unleashed by locked up sydneysiders this week now that freedom day has arrived in actual fact they are two parts to the one crucial interdependent story of economic growth which should carry the message don t worry just spend to save your job struggling businesses and the economy let me explain why being a spendthrift is a virtuous thing to do it was in the great depression of the 1930s that economists embraced the teachings of uk economist lord john maynard keynes and the politics of us president franklin d roosevelt both came up with the same plan to rescue their own economies and the world economy from the dole queues and social devastation of the worst economic downturn ever old world economists thought belt tightening and paying back debt was needed after the excesses of the roaring 20s built up debt that led to the collapse of the stock market on black monday 28 october 1929 when stock prices fell faster than the poor wretches who jumped out of buildings in new york after losing a fortune in fact the bank of england sent lord otto neimeyer to tell the likes of nsw premier jack lang to cut spending to pay back the government s uk lenders but old jack virtually told him to f off and went out and built the sydney harbour bridge like franklin and lord john jack saw the way out was not by belt tightening as keynes had argued convincingly the governments of the world had to spend and prosper the lesson was well learnt when the gfc hit in 2008 where very spending careful politicians and economists became keynesian fans overnight and it worked here we dodged a recession bullet and no other western economy was able to achieve that s why scomo and treasurer josh frydenberg went into spending mode when it was decided that the only solution to a closed down economy to beat the virus was to spend the impact of lockdowns has been seen again with deloitte economics telling us that an economy once tipped to grow at 4 plus this financial year might only make 1 5 however i must add that the second half of that financial year i e january to june will be growing at a 4 pace because of the release from lockdown effect the daily tele says sydneysiders will spend half a billion dollars this week alone and the momentum will build as we get closer to christmas and victoria eventually gets a ticket of leave from its virus created prison the nsw economy was losing a billion a week and melbourne would be in the same boat in fact when victorians are also released we need them to spend so the country can prosper spending will bankroll jobs which produces wages and profits that can be taxed to pay back federal and state government debt the daily tele revealed an important point with this a business nsw survey found that more than half of the state s businesses 53 per cent would have closed down without the covid assistance package from the government the package meant that 40 per cent of businesses were ready to snap back to opening as soon as the easing of restrictions was announced no economist has an economic model that can really forecast how we will spend for the rest of 2021 and into 2022 which i think will be a boom calendar year for the economy but one thing is for sure that a big chunk of the 60 billion we spend overseas will remain at home because there ll be a lot of reluctant travellers over 2022 who ll spend their money here at home this might change as time goes by but i d say local tourism businesses should be set for some strong trading years for some time but you might be thinking switzer seems to be in la la land not worrying about the government debt that s now at 847 billion and heading towards 1 trillion and you d be wrong we ll all be in la la land if we don t create an economy that grows its gross domestic product or gdp because that s the best way to test out whether a debt is manageable if you simply look at house price increases over the last 20 or 30 years you d be shocked but people kept making their mortgage debt repayments economists look at the government debt to gdp ratio and australia has one of the smallest in the western world this is an excerpt from the trading economics table on government debt to gdp in december 2020 for countries of the world the us was 108 of gdp japan 350 france 116 and the uk 97 2 and have a look at where we are and the countries around us we re so small and surrounded by countries that we don t usually compare ourselves to apart from new zealand now we might be up to 31 6 of gdp or even higher but when it comes to government debt and the power of our economy to repay that debt this has nothing to do with me being in la la land the governments of australia have spent and we will prosper and the best indicator of the dividend from their spending is the unemployment rate which is now at 4 6 while the us is at 4 8 the eu at 6 8 canada 6 9 sweden 8 6 and italy 9 3 treasurer frydenberg was one of the biggest spenders in the world as a percentage of gdp in fighting the coronavirus it will be his spending that will help us prosper in the future it s the kind of thing most former labor treasurers would reluctantly praise him for economics is a funny old world
the pandemic was hard for everyone but it was harder for some than others according to a study of 2000 americans conducted by one poll on behalf of big health found that only 54 of those with an income less than 30 000 per year felt that they had access to mental health services compared to 76 of those who make over 150 000 per year while some have looked for help there is still a stigma attached to getting that help with mental health issues 76 of asian americans are most likely to face stigma from their community compared to 57 of white americans the most common mental health issues 64 said that they have experienced heightened anxiety and 53 said that they had feelings of depression the big house study found that of those surveyed 39 have a prescription to help with their mental health which means they have gotten help from a doctor which is a good thing advertisement these simple ways to focus on your mental health can make a huge difference share copy link copy editor s note psychologist john duffy author of parenting the new teen in the age of anxiety practices in chicago he specializes in work with teens parents couples and families on this world mental health day the second of the covid 19 pandemic it is clear that people most people are struggling across cultures we were experiencing plenty of mental health issues well before the pandemic including but not limited to undue stress and anxiety poor self esteem eating issues and family strife all of these challenges have been exacerbated over the course of the past 18 months i encourage you to take honest stock of your own emotional well being today are you taking care of yourself are you suffering unnecessarily are you priding yourself on being busy when you are in fact exhausted are you hiding depression or anxiety to protect the people around you the following are six steps you can take today to enhance your mental wellness and that of those around you begin a daily wellness regimentaking care of yourself emotionally starts first thing in the day preferably before your feet hit the floor in lieu of checking social media or starting work draw in a few deep breaths and consider three things you find yourself grateful for these can be grand like your spouse job or health or modest like the weather the view from your window or even the luxury of those first breaths then if you haven t already try a brief guided mediation like one of these cnn picks or the calm or headspace app read a comforting excerpt from a favorite self help or other relaxing book by doing so you will create a calm relaxed mindset for the day even stressful days packed with activity will feel more manageable and tranquil if you do so and you will find yourself catastrophizing far less over the course of the day remember a lot of the things that enhance physical health also support emotional well being evaluate what you put in your body and your mind food drink drugs a constant stream of video programming and so on thinking about how you might manage your intake to make your body healthier will undoubtedly have mental health benefits as well i cannot express enough how these early in the day actions can impact your mindset of peace well being and gratitude for the rest of your day starter tip don t think you ll remember first thing in the morning write it on a sticky note and place it over your phone before you go to bed get outside your own mind every daywhen we are anxious or depressed our symptoms tend to occupy our minds we scan for severity or for new mental difficulties and the more we scan the more we tend to find further our depression anxieties and other emotional concerns tend to amplify when they remain our sole focus if we get out and attend to serving others we find that our own worries diminish we also feel better when we serve others coming away with a sense of satisfaction accomplishment and contribution a win win for mental health volunteer at a soup kitchen or your child s school work a phone helpline for others struggling with emotional difficulties remove the unnecessaryover the past couple of years there has been no doubt that we are too busy and protect precious little time to relax and do virtually nothing today presents a wonderful opportunity to consider what we can take away from our daily lives that might enhance our peace of mind and support our emotional wellness this is a day to remove the misguided pride in the word busy and focus not on all we can do but on what really needs to be done and what does not in fact the pandemic has presented a unique opportunity to do so many of my clients have found in their new work from home worlds that in past years much of their time has been spent on unnecessary activity from busy work to social media scrolling others find these activities prevent them from getting a full night s sleep or connecting with family which are crucial elements of emotional wellness removing some of this activity can help us protect time for some of these other endeavors that foster well being and growth assess your relationshipsassess how each of your relationships is working for you are you giving more than you re receiving from a sibling or friend do you feel hopeful and refueled after a coffee date with an acquaintance many of us spend far too much time and energy on relationships that are either toxic or one sided and that can include social media connections you may also recognize that you do not reach out and connect enough to others slowing down to connect more deeply and share your life and story with your close family or friends is among the most important ways you can strengthen your mental wellness check in with your peopleworld mental health day can be a welcome excuse to reset for improved self care but it also presents an opportunity to check in on the mental health of the people around you your family friends neighbors and anyone else in your orbit some people you feel you are very close to maybe suffering but are adept at hiding it check in with all the people you love and just ask them how they are doing and feeling for some this may prompt them to assess their own mental well being knowing there is someone in their life who cares enough to ask be willing to change and learnmany of my clients have stubbornly asserted that they know what s best for themselves and too often continue bad habits even as they come to me for help treat yourself to an hour a week of self focus and self care whether it s through therapy or other practices you will learn a lot about how your mind works and how to remove roadblocks to wellness you may have been clinging to for years in doing so you are not only tending to your own emotional well being but normalizing mental difficulties so that others may be more inclined to do the same i cannot think of a more impactful way to contribute to our world s collective wellness on a day dedicated to mental health

one ride in a sparkling new electric automobile should be enough to convince the skeptical that transportation is no longer as it used to be q my father who was born in 1900 and grew up at algoma in franklin county often spoke about the difficulty of the 11 mile trip from boones mill to roanoke on the road that followed magodee creek for part of the journey why was such a drive so hard i think that most people today have no idea what roads were like just a short time ago sam guerrant roanoke a with a vast geographic footprint including a range of features from piedmont to mountain peak laced with a network of waterways the county s citizens have faced and overcome transportation challenges throughout its history the back road from boones mill to starkey in roanoke county naff road on the franklin side of the line once crossed rocky magodee creek multiple times and apparently was actually part of the creekbed for stretches saunders guerrant the father claimed there were 22 crossings in all his son wrote another authority on the county s history retired physician and 1986 county bicentennial chair francis amos offered a smaller but still formidable estimate of the crossings i ve seen several different descriptions anywhere from 13 to 15 as the road basically followed the creek he said to continue with the geographic particulars the modern road slants northwest out of boones mill before diverging from the creek and heading north along the foot of cahas mountain from there it s a short ride to the county line and on to starkey piece of cake years ago travel was not so sweet anywhere in the county particularly once travelers left the main north south artery tracing the corridor now described by u s 220 the year before the start of the civil war the relative prosperity of franklin county farmers was in spite of rather than because of the transportation systems used to market their produce according to franklin county virginia 1786 1986 a bicentennial history by john s and emily j salmon this was so during an era in which the national internal improvement movement had been moving along smartly in other parts of the country not so much in franklin county poor roads hilly country frequent streams and long distances to major markets such as lynchburg and danville frustrated farmers no matter their economic class it was not until the middle of the 19th century that the picks and shovels of the internal improvements trend reached the county and even then its residents benefitted little regardless of occupation in other words heaven help you when traveling by horse or wagon in bad weather across any body of water or at night one 1835 traveler from campbell county to franklin county described the condition of the road in a letter to his wife as intolerably bad in the salmons telling in some sections the roads were so muddy and the mud so stiff that it seemed as though our horse would stick fast there was no state road system in those days construction and maintenance of roads being up to the counties various improvement plans were advanced then withdrawn in 1796 major franklin county landowner james callaway initiated a petition to the general assembly in favor of a plan to dredge and deepen the pigg river from its mouth to the washington iron works in present rocky mount the petitioner wrote that others of similar sentiment had helmed a craft loaded with nineteen hundred weight of iron from the forge to the confluence with the staunton roanoke river with but little obstruction the assembly approved the plan and appointed fundraising trustees investors balked though potential costs no doubt a sobering reality another group made a similar proposal for the blackwater and staunton in 1799 with an eye to smoothing agricultural transport that effort also foundered on the shoals of expense the impracticality of waterway travel made room for another transportation solution that was working elsewhere in the state the toll road was one method of coping with the inadequacy of the county road system nathaniel mason pawlett wrote in a brief history of the roads of virginia 1607 1840 such pay as you go routes were in use as early as 1772 near the end of the colonial period the general assembly in 1816 established a transportation fund and a group chaired by the governor called the board of public works to supervise expenditures the board was authorized to invest in private companies engaged in public works as long as three fifths of the stock was in private hands the franklin county application of the system began in 1838 with a company that developed the pittsylvania franklin botetourt turnpike that began in danville cut through snow creek rocky mount boones mill and big lick roanoke before terminating in fincastle the route survey followed quickly that year but it took three years for the road to be built at a cost of 26 000 808 266 14 in today s money according to officialdata org the rocky mount to big lick leg went for 292 52 per mile according to salmon and salmon other projects followed after the 1851 incorporation of the bedford southside co and the union hall co according to marshall wingfield s history of franklin county virginia the struggles and failures of these private enterprises were legion which eventually led to the statewide public highway system the troubles of the pittsylvania franklin road outfit was illustrated in a salmon and salmon vignette with just 5 miles of road left to be built in franklin county dr richard m taliaferro president of the company wrote to the board in 1841 complaining that toll collection had grown tedious because the gatekeepers were having trouble in the collection of fees based on 1 and 5 cents for instance people were charged 5 cents a head and hogs a penny a snout we are at a sad loss for pennies for change taliaferro advised
behind the shift are signs that the recent inflation scare won t fade soon amid supply chain strains surging commodity prices post lockdown demand ongoing stimulus and labor shortages complicating the task for policy makers is that growth may be slowing prompting some to warn of a stagflationary lite environment that puts central bankers in a bind as they debate which risk they should prioritize targeting inflation with tighter monetary policy adds to the pressure on economies but trying to boost demand may ignite prices further for now the feeling of many is that inflation has lingered longer than most predicted as huw pill the bank of england s new chief economist said last week the balance of risks is currently shifting towards great concerns about the inflation outlook as the current strength of inflation looks set to prove more long lasting than originally anticipated not all are as concerned or looking to change tack officials at the european central bank and bank of japan are among those intending to keep stimulating their economies aggressively and the international monetary fund predicts that in advanced economies at least inflation will soon ease to about 2 what bloomberg economics says stagflation is too strong a word still supply shocks that lift prices and lower output leave monetary policy makers with no easy options with little urgency to act the

list alongside persuading americans that the fed is also keeping an eye on higher than expected inflation he ll try to communicate that message without giving the impression that the fed is getting closer to raising near zero interest rates even though policy makers were evenly split on rate liftoff next year according to quarterly projections they released sept 22 but the forecasts displayed as anonymous dots on a chart can be affected by shifts in personnel in addition to powell s chairmanship president joe biden has the chance to pick three other governors on the seven seat board in

rosengren are stepping down following revelations about their trading activity in 2020 rosengren cited a serious health condition in announcing his early retirement what bloomberg economics says stubbornly high inflation means risks appear to tilt toward an earlier hike than our current baseline of a 2023 move however our analysis of the views of voting fomc members in 2022 suggests that the majority prefers a somewhat more accommodative timeline than implied by the committee median after rosengren s early resignation we think four 2022 voters currently favor a hike against six for a hold

policy makers led by president christine lagarde have already decided to slow purchases under their 1 85 trillion euro 2 2 trillion pandemic program in the fourth quarter and are likely to allow the plan to expire in march a debate in coming months about how to redesign the ecb s older bond buying scheme may prove more contentious with some advocating more flexibility and an increase in pace that others say may not be needed what bloomberg economics says wage growth is unlikely to accelerate sustainably until the significant spare capacity in the labor market is absorbed that will leave many on the governing council doubtful about the persistence of inflation and pushing for an increase in bond buying through the asset purchase programme they will also be concerned about the credibility

peers to start unwinding pandemic era rate cuts while officials said in september that they didn t necessarily have to wait until their bond buying plan finishes at the end of this year to act most economists are penciling in the first move in for 2022 markets are even more aggressive and at one stage were predicting three increases next year still concerns that a premature tightening would choke off the recovery may yet stay the boe s hand especially as u k consumers prepare for a difficult winter of mounting bills what bloomberg economics says inflation is becoming increasingly hard to ignore for the boe but we expect a rise in unemployment following the end of the government s furlough scheme and a slower recovery to cool concerns among policy makers that should mean interest rates are left alone until may still we can t rule out an increase this year if inflation continues to surprise and expectations drift higher dan hanson bank of canada current overnight lending rate 0 25 bloomberg economics forecast for end of 2021 0 25 bloomberg economics forecast for end of 2022 0 5 the bank of canada s next meeting is on oct 27 where it will release an updated set of quarterly forecasts economists largely expect the central bank to revise down its forecast for the third quarter after july and august monthly gdp showed the quarter tracking well below its previous 7 3 forecast while the institution is not expected to change its policy rate economists will be watching for changes to the pace of asset purchases or forward guidance governor tiff macklem has already reduced the pace of government bond buying three times in the past year and is expected to taper asset purchases once more this month to c 1 billion in government of canada bonds per week it s also possible the bank of canada will provide some update around its forward guidance which currently states it will keep interest rates low until the output gap is closed and inflation returns sustainably to 2 something it doesn t see occurring until the second half of next year what bloomberg economics says as economic reopening bumps up against fractured supply chains consumer price inflation may prove stickier for longer our updated projections have inflation holding above 4 through 2021 slowing to an average of 2 5 in 2h 2022 as the output gap closes in 4q 2022 an initial rate hike happens a

economics forecast for end of 2022 3 75 china s central bank began gradually curbing credit expansion to control financial risks this year once the economy s recovery from the pandemic was well underway however the economy started showing signs of weakening in the second half prompting authorities to make a surprise shift in july by reducing the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve in part to help banks with liquidity needs but also to boost lending to small businesses hurt by rising commodity prices since then growth risks have only gotten worse stringent virus control measures to contain sporadic outbreaks have made still cautious consumers even more wary of spending a debt crisis at a major property developer has roiled financial markets while beijing s tighter restrictions on the real estate market have caused a slump in construction investment more recently an electricity shortage has forced factories to shut with ripple effects across global supply chains that weaker outlook means the central bank will likely reduce the reserve requirement ratio for banks again economists predict and possibly even lower its policy rates what bloomberg economics says china s economy is facing a range of downside risks from power shortages to virus outbreaks and weak consumption market strains from the crisis at evergrande are another worry we expect the pboc to keep a loose stance to cushion the slowdown pumping more liquidity into the banking system and cutting the reserve requirement ratio by another 50 basis points probably in october or november a rate cut is unlikely in the near term that would only fuel financial imbalances that the authorities are keen to curb david qu reserve bank of india current rbi repurchase rate 4 bloomberg economics forecast for

stimulus measures as an economic recovery takes hold while it kept the benchmark repurchase rate unchanged at a historic low of 4 and the monetary stance dovish it made a gradual move to withdraw the billions of dollars it has pumped in since the start of the pandemic last year that liquidity injection risks adding to inflationary pressures and fueling an asset bubble with policy makers growing increasingly confident that the nascent recovery will gather pace as vaccination picks up and chances of a third wave ebb the reserve bank of india expects pent up demand and the festival season to give a fillip to urban demand in the second half of the financial year to march 2022 while rural demand is expected to be underpinned by a near normal monsoon and record food grain production what bloomberg economics says the rbi s decision to suspend quantitative easing at its october policy marked a retreat from its previous stance of keeping long term sovereign bond yields in check this is likely to steepen the yield curve but we don t see it is as a pre cursor to an imminent policy rate hike we are sticking to our view that the rbi will keep policy rates low for longer to revive growth on a more durable basis we expect it to begin a gradual rate hike cycle in april 2022 by first raising the reverse repo rate and see the first repo rate hike only in february 2023 abhishek gupta

unleashed the world s most aggressive monetary tightening campaign this year raising its benchmark interest rate by 425 points since march and promising to take it to a significantly restrictive level until inflation expectations ease back to target yet prices are rising by more than 10 a year the fastest pace since 2016 and expectations for 2022 are running above the 3 5 goal complicating matters for policy makers led by roberto campos neto is a severe drought that s making hydro electricity costlier just as commodities and food prices jump across the globe and local demand for services grow with the economic reopening all things considered traders in the local futures market are already betting that the selic will end 2022 above 10 what bloomberg economics says inflation continues to run hot and appears headed to a slow descent in the coming quarters in an effort to bring inflation expectations for 2022 back to the center of the target the central bank indicated that it intends to bring the monetary policy to tight territory for the first time since 2017 but has not hinted on how tight the policy will be we expect the bcb will continue to raise the policy rate through february after when the shifting focus to 2023 inflation will give the monetary authorities some reason to pause and monitor the effects of the tightening introduced that far adriana dupita bank of russia

meaning governor elvira nabiullina has delivered a total of 250 basis points of tightening this year and there s no sign she s done nabiullina said it may take more than one rate increase to tame runaway inflation and curb inflation expectations which remain elevated consumer price growth accelerated to 7 4 in september from a year earlier that was above economists expectations and boosts the chances for a 50 basis point rate increase on oct 22 delays in the domestic harvest as well as climbing food prices globally are keeping russia s inflation rate at the fastest pace in half a decade what bloomberg economics says most of the spike in russia s inflation looks fleeting but the central bank isn t taking any chances resilient demand and rising inflation expectations pose a more persistent threat once supply shocks fade policy makers are likely to favor another 50 bps of tightening this month to regain control if price pressure remains elevated further hikes may follow scott

central bank has made it clear that its next move will be to raise borrowing costs while no member of its monetary policy committee has voted for tightening this year that could change at its next meeting as the panel now sees material upside risks to its inflation outlook it prefers to anchor price growth expectations close to the 4 5 midpoint of its target range and sees inflation at or below the level through 2023 the implied policy rate path of the quarterly projection model which the mpc uses as broad policy guide indicates a 25 basis point increase in the final quarter of this year and in every quarter of 2022 and 2023 delaying the lift off could see the monetary policy authorities playing catch up with inflation potentially destabilizing the relatively well anchored inflation expectations the reserve bank said tuesday in its six monthly monetary policy review what bloomberg economics says the sarb continues to signal the need for a gradual normalization of rates from the record low of 3 5 it s model points to 4q as the possible start but we expect ongoing virus uncertainty and still muted core inflation to push this out to 1q2022 the bank envisions only a gradual rise in rates however rising inflation risks and the anticipation of higher u s rates could speed up the monetary tightening cycle once it begins boingotlo gasealahwe mint central banks banco de mexico

projections that inflation would slow by the end of the year consumer prices have been rising at an annual pace of around 6 since april double the central bank s target the deterioration in inflation expectations takes place as banxico is going through a leadership change governor alejandro diaz de leon will finish his term at the end of the year and he is set to be replaced by former finance minister arturo herrera a change that led to speculation about the board being more dovish in the future what bloomberg economics says we expect banxico to increase its policy rate by 25 basis points in november and again in december closing the year at 5 25 to anchor inflation expectations decelerating inflation weak growth and near neutral rates next year should allow for a pause until the

indonesia could justify another rate cut with the inflation outlook benign and recovery prospects dented by slow shots and the threat of more delta outbreaks but the rupiah remains vulnerable to selling pressure precluding a cut that suggests the central bank will instead lean on bond purchases to support growth making the next move in rates a hike in 4q 2022 or later tamara henderson central

of market turbulence by unexpectedly lowering interest rates last month reflecting the long shadow cast by president recep tayyip erdogan over monetary policy the surprise cut came despite rising prices and after erdogan called for lower borrowing costs making the lira the worst performing emerging market currency of this year again not delivering on the president s unorthodox doctrine could have cost the central bank governor sahap kavcioglu his job kavcioglu who held rates steady for five meetings until last month is the fourth governor since 2019 with the president having fired his three immediate predecessors both headline inflation and a core gauge closely watched by the central bank accelerated in september but some economists say officials may continue cutting rates as early as this month as it no longer offers a clear guidance on the monetary policy implications of price growth what bloomberg economics says turkey has embarked on an easing cycle while its peers are raising interest rates lower rates now risk higher rates in the future in the meantime the lira will continue to test fresh lows ziad daoud central bank of nigeria current central bank rate 11 5

contraction in almost three decades in 2020 that forced the central bank to cut its economic growth forecast for this year to 2 86 from 3 15 governor godwin emefiele has previously said the mpc can only shift to fighting inflation which has exceeded the 9 top of the central bank s target band for more than six years once the economy s recovery from last year s coronavirus induced contraction gathers pace what bloomberg economics says nigeria s inflation remains above target but the central has made it clear it wants to see a solid recovery before switches to fighting inflation we have pencilled in 4q21 as the start of the hiking cycle but a faster disinflation path and weaker than expected growth could stay the cbn s hand boingotlo gasealahwe other g 20 central banks bank of korea

other peers in developed nations in reining in pandemic era stimulus after lifting its benchmark interest rate from a record low of 0 5 in august the central bank has two rate decisions left this year and most economists believe it will go ahead with another 25 basis point hike in november rather than this week as the bok embarks on the path to policy normalization it is shifting its focus from fueling the economic rebound to curbing household debt at the center of financial imbalances governor lee ju yeol who steps down in march has recently held met with financial regulators and agreed to coordinate policy responses with them what bloomberg economics says the bank of korea has entered a rate hike cycle with its august liftoff and we see conditions ripe for another increase this year

central bank is a clear outlier in latin america s trend for rising interest rates with president alberto fernandez s government facing midterm elections in november the central bank is printing money to finance public spending at the fastest pace so far this year even with annual inflation accelerating past 50 central bank chief miguel pesce shows no signs of raising interest rates any time soon one reason is that higher rates would lead to greater interest payments on a ballooning debt load further complicating government finances central bank debt has catapulted to 4 2 trillion pesos 42 5

by norihiko shirouzu beijing shanghai reuters mercedes benz the german company founded by the inventors of the motor car is pouring more resources into its cutting edge research and design capabilities in china as the centre of gravity of the new auto world shifts eastwards in a drive to create a home away from home mercedes benz is doubling down on bases in beijing and shanghai to stay ahead of regulations and consumer trends in a car market that outstrips the united states and germany combined three years after initially announcing plans to strengthen its research and development r d in the country the luxury car brand owned by daimler otc will unveil its new tech center china in beijing this month reuters has spoken to four people close to the tech centre and the brand s chinese design studio who are familiar with the company s new china strategy all declined to be named because they are not allowed to speak with the media with 1 000 engineers the new tech centre is more than three times the size of the one mercedes benz opened in 2014 and the first outside germany that can test everything putting it more on par technically with the far bigger r d headquarters near stuttgart a person close to the centre said mercedes benz has also invested significantly in upgrading its chinese design studio and has moved the whole team from beijing to shanghai a megalopolis of about 25 million people known as the car design capital of china mercedes benz has good reason to elevate its chinese operations its car sales in china jumped 12 last year to a record 774 000 despite the pandemic streets ahead of its next two markets germany on 286 000 and the united states with 275 000 about 80 of the cars it sold in china were also made there typically with an array of china only features and models and asia overall accounted for almost half its global sales in 2021 china s auto market the biggest in the world since 2009 is expected to carry on growing steadily with demand forecast to reach 35 million vehicles by about 2030 versus 25 million now second home but mercedes benz like all foreign automakers in china is under growing pressure from local ev startups such as xpeng nyse li auto and nio nyse and their stylish vehicles with high tech features tailored to chinese consumers that s why the german carmaker s second home strategy for china is focused on making its design and technology more agile to respond quickly to the ever shifting landscape and to firmly entrench the mercedes benz brand the four sources said the expectations in china are for the in car experience to be served by a localised digital services ecosystem and such solutions must be conceived and built by people that live in china and truly understand the mobile internet bill russo head of consultancy automobility ltd in shanghai said mercedes benz customers in china are 36 years old on average roughly 20 years younger than in germany and are more tech savvy but they are also notoriously disloyal hopping from brand to brand as trends shift mercedes has spent 1 1 billion yuan 170 million upgrading the centre with much of the investment ensuring it can do an array of testing locally rather send new technologies back to the sindelfingen headquarters in germany a key reason for the expansion is to gain the proximity to those customers and their needs the person close to the tech centre said here we finally have everything we need to test the car fully said the source the centre has modern chassis test benches and others including for noise vibration and harshness as well as batteries and e drive powertrains and it has the flexibility to swap in new ones as technology develops two sources said mercedes has also added functions deemed important for chinese customers such as a team dedicated to intelligent connected electric vehicle ev technology tech savvy customers here require that you re very local in terms of intelligence connectivity and autonomous driving one of the sources said think rose gold all four sources said a sharper focus on the customer in china in recent years is already paying off a drive to create china only colours led to research into the preferences of younger luxury goods buyers while sensitive to being seen as hip and tech savvy there has been a revived interest in styles inspired by china s ancient dynasties as part of that research the studio came up with rose gold metallic a variation on rose gold tones adjusted for cars first used as an exterior colour for the mercedes benz a class l sedan in 2018 new evs such as the eqa and eqb now come in rose gold and it s also an interior tone in the eqc global ideas inspired by china said one source close to the studio adding that while mercedes needs to cater to its china customers first some china grown ideas will go global moving the studio to shanghai was partly driven by the need to significantly speed up the design process by making it more digital as most virtual model making vendors are based there besides shanghai is a lot easier a place to recruit design talent said the source close to the studio which is just north of city s prime waterfront district the bund designers typically sketch a car on paper or a touch sensitive computer screen and expert modellers then help sculpt the designs into clay models mercedes benz plans to more or less do away with those physical models under the new process the shanghai studio will review its designs using virtual tools except for the occasional quarter size physical models according to one of the four sources if the studio makes it to the final of internal competitions for car designs it will send designers and modellers to the main studio in germany to create life size models for the last round the source said rules of the road daimler s drive to strengthen its technology development in china also comes at a time when the cost of failing to be in step with beijing policymakers has never been higher beijing s sweeping regulatory crackdown in recent months has wiped billions of dollars off the value of some of the country s best known private firms and has weighed on the auto sector that s partly because tensions between the united states and china have created a tricky environment for foreign companies to import technology developed elsewhere and from battery technology to new kinds of mobility including smart connectivity and autonomous driving chinese policies and regulations are shifting and evolving rapidly if you respond to change after policies and regulation kick in it s too late said one of the contacts close to daimler with that in mind the tech centre works closely with the brand s external affairs team which keeps its finger on the regulatory pulse and that has proved key when it comes to so called vehicle to everything or v2x technology v2x controls communications between a car and everything outside from 5g cellular signals to low earth orbit satellites to smart traffic lights and cameras on the road in china vehicles will soon have to come with full fledged v2x capabilities to achieve a top safety ranking under a new version of its vehicle safety evaluation system or new car assessment program ncap which is expected in 2025 we knew this regulation was going to be implemented we started developing those self drive technologies including v2x to be in compliance with the new law and did so well before new regulation kicks in one of the tech centre sources said

vehicles and batteries this partnership between the state and ford will create another avenue for tennessee workers to skill up and settle down with a great american company tennessee gov bill lee said during a press conference trying to put some spin on whitmer s ineptitude her spokesperson emphasized to fox news that ford recently pledged to spent 250 million in michigan and add 450 jobs at three facilities ford s michigan investment is a rounding error compared to its tennessee and kentucky commitments in fairness the ford family has steadfastly been loyal to the detroit area and if the family remains in control the company will likely continue to retain a strong detroit area presence but given the sorry state of michigan s schools its infrastructure and its clownish leaders the argument to remain here becomes less compelling every day rep rashida tlaib d detroit one such leader is rep rashida tlaib part of a clique known as the squad a group of young congressional women who think they are still in high school tlaib s district straddles ford s headquarters yet she supports a boycott of israel and recently refused to approve funding for its iron dome defense system that protects citizens from continuous missile attacks ford and gm operate significant research and development centers in israel that both companies say are critical to their futures whether tlaib likes it or not among those protected by the iron dome are israeli ford and gm employees whose work has a material impact on her constituents given the antisemitic history of the company s founder i m doubtful that ford is proud or finds it advantageous that a congressperson representing its interests is deemed among the world s biggest anti semites by the simon wiesenthal center decades of decline southeastern michigan has been on a steady decline for decades morphing into a regional hub rather than a burgeoning metropolitan area with committed business leaders and a growing economy the number of publicly traded companies headquartered in michigan has declined by more than 50 percent in the past two decades the loss has a multiplier effect because for every headquarters job the u s bureau of economic analysis estimates that 2 5 new jobs are created to support the business such as accountants lawyers and other service providers detroit was once a headquarters city for great companies in various industries national bank of detroit was consistently ranked among the best u s banks particularly for technology michigan national was once among the most innovative consumer banks and a pioneer in multi branch banking kmart was a respected retailer and a good corporate citizen as well it was among the local companies that opposed the detroit free press and news merging business operations a move that led to the irreparable journalism decline of both publications and allowed michigan leaders to operate with limited accountability there are many who will say the loss of companies was inevitable and part of a national trend but one only need look to ohio and cleveland to appreciate the benefits of competent political leaders and committed business executives when toledo s teaching hospital announced plans to explore a sale marcy kaptur the longest serving woman in congress promptly protested arguing it was irresponsible to sell a hospital amid a pandemic ohio attorney general dave yost let it be known that he wouldn t sit idly by as well the former mayor of toledo spearheaded a local coalition to protest the hospital sale it was dead in the water before any bids were considered yost recently won a landmark 88 million settlement against a pharmacy benefit manager for ripping off the state and its residents he s also filed a landmark lawsuit to make google a public company cleveland has retained keycorp a respected regional banking company beth mooney ceo of keycorp is board chair of cleveland clinic consistently ranked in the very top tier of best hospital networks in the country i m doubtful cleveland s business leaders would sit idly by and let some yahoo from atlanta come to town and destroy a major hospital or other critical institution as metro detroit s political and business leaders allowed john fox to do with beaumont health attorney general dana nessel photo state of michigan the only local leader who dared speak up was veteran attorney mark shaevsky of farmington hills who a year ago wrote a thoughtful letter to attorney general dana nessel calling on her to remove fox and the directors who supported him shaevsky warned nessel about patient safety issues at beaumont s flagship royal oak campus which continues to deteriorate nessel still hasn t intervened apparently because bigger issues are weighing on her nessel recently mused that green bay packers quarterback aaron rodgers made her glad she is a lesbian underscoring her attention to detail she misspelled rodgers name that s the gravitas nessel brings to the office and here s a list of her accomplishments most of which i consider busywork and nothing approximating what ohio s yost has achieved whitmer has no economic vision for michigan according to the mackinac center for public policy the state s business subsidy programs are ineffective at creating jobs unfair to the businesses that don t get them and expensive to the state budget moreover few companies are even bothering to apply for subsidies that s a problem for programs ostensibly designed to create jobs said the nonprofit research center in midland glorified sweatshops if southeastern michigan s trajectory remains unchecked in a few years the biggest companies headquartered in the region might be rocket mortgage and united wholesale mortgage which are glorified sweatshops with great perks the stock prices of both companies are in the toilet indicating wall street isn t terribly excited about the future of these companies these companies could pack up and relocate to tennessee practically overnight fortunately rocket is controlled by dan gilbert who needs to keep some people around to fill his tax subsidized office and residential buildings in downtown

problems in a global supply chain already in disarray now staff starved companies are imploring workers like my to return for what would normally be peak production for winter clothing and christmas gifts the government is offering transportation back and companies are upping pay and benefits but little is working this is uncharted water said camilo lyon an analyst for btig who estimated nike s output alone has already been reduced by 180 million pairs of shoes no one understands how quickly or slowly the ramp up in production will be while small vietnam plays an out sized role in the global consumer economy supplying everything from walmart inc furniture and adidas ag sneakers to samsung electronics co smartphones after china it s the second largest supplier of clothes and shoes to the u s according to the american apparel and footwear association its importance increased during the trade war between the u s and china as manufacturing moved there to avoid tariffs at this point there is little brands like nike which recently cut its sales forecast largely on the lack of goods from vietnam can do factories in other countries are overloaded with orders and it would take months to train workers and move machinery the missed production will be especially apparent at retailers in december and extend well into the first quarter according to lyon who projected that output from vietnam wouldn t normalize until the middle of 2022 the full impact of this upheaval hasn t been priced into the stocks of apparel and footwear companies with big exposure to vietnam he said the challenges are by no means over lyon said the factory shutdowns could also affect tech companies such as apple inc which may see disruptions to deliveries of the iphone 13 due to closures at component suppliers a samsung electronics unit that makes household electrical appliances in vietnam said it expects to meet export targets if it can quickly return to normal operations vietnam contained covid last year giving its people a false sense that the country had dodged the pandemic but the delta variant struck hard in the spring bringing the harsh realities of the virus that much of the world had experienced a year earlier cases and deaths surged including more than 15 000 in ho chi minh city over the summer that prompted authorities to impose severe restrictions such as bans on shopping for food and curfews factories were instructed to establish on site accommodations essentially forcing employees who want to work to live in tents or temporarily shut down this left many workers who remained with no paychecks for months dwindling savings and reliant on government food packages delivered by soldiers the experience traumatized many migrant workers said vu tu thanh vietnam chief representative of the u s asean business council instead of isolating themselves at makeshift factory lodging or staying in the area without paychecks many workers returned to their home provinces the lifting of some restrictions in ho chi minh city and surrounding provinces earlier this month only further motivated those who hadn t yet left to do so adding to the fear is that vietnam has one of the lowest vaccination rates in southeast asia about 14 of its 98 million people are fully vaccinated the american apparel and footwear association has lobbied the biden administration to donate more vaccines to the country out of desperation local authorities have been sending text messages to workers to convince them to return they re also chartering buses to bring them back from their home

the nigerian national petroleum corporation oil marketers and experts on sunday explained why the federal government could not stop petrol subsidy despite its non inclusion in the 2022 budget independent petroleum marketers association of nigeria and experts including a professor of economics at the olabisi onabanjo university ago iwoye ogun state sheriffdeen tella in separate interviews with the punch said it would be disastrous for government to stop the subsidy without functional refineries in the country a study of the allocations for the ministries of finance and petroleum resources in the 2022 budget showed that the federal government made no provision for petrol subsidy for the coming year however it was learnt on sunday that the commodity might still be subsidised in 2022 as the country s sole importer of petrol the nnpc stated that there had been no counter order on subsidy from the federal government the corporation s group general manager group public affairs division garba deen muhammad in an interview with the punch confirmed that fuel subsidy would not be stopped until government and labour concluded their talks on the issue for more than four years the nnpc had remained the sole importer of petrol into nigeria as other oil marketers stopped importing the commodity due to their inability to access foreign exchange and the occasional fall of the naira against the united states dollar muhammad insisted that until negotiations with labour unions were concluded the price of the commodity would remain the same stressing that the minister of state for petroleum resources chief timipre sylva had earlier stated this muhammad said i know that the negotiations are ongoing and the minister when he spoke he made it clear that no conclusion would be reached and no decision on subsidy will be taken until the negotiations are concluded that is still the situation we are not complaining about subsidy burden we are carrying nnpc when pressed further on whether nnpc would continue to shoulder the humungous financial burden of subsidy the ggm replied yes the nnpc has not made noise about the burden it is carrying and it is something i cannot pass any judgment on because the higher authorities have spoken the minister the gmd group managing director of nnpc mele kyari have spoken that they are engaging labour this is because labour represents the nigerian people and it is until the negotiations are concluded that the decision will be taken the petroleum industry act which was passed in august this year does not give room for petrol subsidy it will be disastrous for fg to remove subsidy without refineries working ipman reacting to the issue ipman outlined some factors that should be met before the federal government would halt subsidy on petrol ipman s national public relations officer chief ukadike chinedu stated that getting the country s refineries working was the major factor that must be addressed he said it will be very disastrous for the federal government to remove subsidy without implementing certain factors the main factor is that the government should ensure that all the refineries are in good working conditions the other is that there must be a level playing ground for modular refineries to be operational in order to boost local production and counter the foreign exchange concerns we face in this country the importation of petroleum products drives subsidy and so if we no longer import these products we will deal with the concerns of forex so the nnpc and the government have a lot to do in order to take care of these things before they halt petrol subsidy we can t escape subsidy now or price will skyrocket economist also an economist tella said refineries should be fixed before subsidy could be efficiently stopped he said the fuel subsidy is not supposed to continue but the fact that our refineries are not working simply means that we can t escape it else the price would just skyrocket since they said it is not in the budget and nnpc would shoulder it actually the nnpc has its budget it would not affect the expenditure but it would affect what comes to the federal government and its allocation subsidy now political matter all nigerians shouldering it says ex lcci dg commenting on development the immediate past director general of the lagos chamber of commerce and industry dr muda yusuf said the matter of petrol subsidy had become political he also noted that all nigerians were shouldering the burden of petrol subsidy as the nnpc had been deducting some of the subsidy costs from its remittances to the federation accounts allocation committee monthly he said the political will to deal with the subsidy issue is one of the biggest challenges that we have and in fairness to the government it is also a politically difficult matter to deal with especially as we get closer to the elections in 2023 but a political economist and former presidential candidate prof pat utomi said there was a lot of dishonesty fuel subsidy he stated this matter should have been sorted a long time ago however we don t know who profit from them and there is a lot of dishonesty so we cannot engage the people on what we must do i have always been against the idea of subsidy without a specific goal of what you will achieve with the subsidy if you are going to subsidize to generate production so that you can boost production in an area and then you make the subsidy of whatsoever it is for a limited period to achieve the production levels that you want then i can understand subsidy another expert and the managing director chief executive sd d capital management limited idakolo gbolade however argued against the removal of the subsidy now stating that this action would further diminish the welfare of nigerians he said that the subsidy should only be removed when the country achieves self sufficiency in the refinery of its own petrol in as much as i know that the fuel subsidy is fraught with a lot of irregularities and unaccounted funds i still believe that the government should retain it whichever mechanism or method use until nigeria is self sufficient in refining its own crude oil we are getting close to that if it is possible for the private refinery launched by dangote to come to life i believe that we should have enough refined petroleum for the country at that point if the subsidy is removed nigerians won t feel the brunt so much because it will be traded based on the foreign cost of crude and it will be refined here in nigeria without landing charges and other charges he stated he added that public officers who are campaigning for the discontinuation of the subsidy are doing so for their own selfish interests as the subsidy is one of the few ways the federal government impacts the nigerian populace directly according to him those who are clamoring for the subsidy to be removed now are doing so for their selfish interests i can tell you that this is one of the very few dividends that the nigerian people are getting from the government it is the regulated price of petrol if it is removed now it will have an untold hardship on the average nigerian this is the only thing that the government is using to touch the grassroots a senior lecturer of economics at the pan atlantic university dr olalekan aworinde said that the removal of subsidy is a welcome development if the money is used efficiently to better the lives of nigeria in the budget that was released if the government does not earmark any money for subsidy it means that the government is ready to remove the subsidy although nnpc may say they may continue but how are they going to fund it basically we should be ready for the worst as government is ready to remove subsidy from the price of petrol however i can say it is a welcome development if government will use the money previously used for subsidy if they will sue it judiciously for the country to see a multiplier effect of that money that is fine however the problem is that we might not really see the multiplier effect if the money for subsidy is removed this government is engrossed in fraud corruption and so on so i do not believe that they will be able to spend the money efficiently that is the issue but the most important is that government will remove that subsidy which will curtail a lot of things because the subsidy itself is a fraud it is better to end the fraud if there government stops the subsidy the first advantage is that we are not going to have a situation of subsidy fraud also the market will be more competitive in the sense that people can now bring in fuel without the government influencing things also when supply is more than demand it would push the price down also we can begin to see the impact of the money spent on subsidy earlier increase in capital expenditure will better the lives of people it may also help with the debt stock of the government these are some of the advantages we can get however if it is not well implemented we will not see the multiplier effect of this he said copyright punch all rights reserved this material and other

25 years ago apartheid killers acquitted on october 11 1996 a south african court acquitted former defense minister magnus malan together with 15 co defendants charged with atrocities against the black population during the waning days of the apartheid regime malan three former generals and several other security officials were charged with deploying a secret assassination squad which massacred 13 people most of them women and children in 1987 the attack was part of a terror campaign designed to strengthen the inkatha freedom party and suppress supporters of the african national congress in the black homeland of kwazulu the campaign claimed 14 000 lives in the course of a decade the case was one of the few attempts to criminally prosecute former officials for the crimes carried out over 40 years by the racist regime in most cases the anc led government had granted amnesties to former military and police killers while relegating the investigation of atrocities to a truth commission when the anc was brought into government in 1994 classified information on other atrocities carried out against the population including on south africa s biological warfare program developed with the assistance of us and british intelligence services had been passed over from outgoing national party leader and president f w de klerk to the incoming mandela administration one of the last major trials in april 2002 relating to the truth and reconciliation commission ended in a failure to prosecute dr wouter basson known as dr death a chemical weapons expert and head of germ warfare programs in the south african army during the apartheid era malan was present in the courtroom for basson s acquittal the prosecutor who tried the malan case was together with much of the judiciary a holdover from the apartheid regime who had previously expressed disbelief that government run hit squads even existed the government of president nelson mandela had maintained the legal system handed down from apartheid which featured the absence of jury trials all verdicts were reached by judges the mandela administration called on south africans to respect the malan verdict 50 years ago afl cio president joins nixon s wage freeze board on october 12 1971 afl cio president george meany issued a statement signaling the cooperation of the labor federation in president richard nixon s program of wage freezes being carried out under the guise of fighting inflation at the time of the statement the nixon administration was enforcing a 90 day wage freeze set to expire november 13 in addition to offering nixon support meany announced that members of the afl cio bureaucracy would serve on the pay board the pay board was one of a handful of committees nixon had established to oversee the management of the pay freeze program the other major committees involved in the anti inflation efforts were the cost of living council and the price commission just one week earlier meany was posturing as an opponent to the pay board and promising that the afl cio would not join this made the october 12 announcement somewhat of an about face fearful that his assent would be seen by workers for what it was tacit union backing for a national program of pay cutting meany said the decision to join came only after personal assurances we have received this morning from the president of the united states that the pay board will be completely autonomous and that the cost of living council will not have veto power over its decisions leaders of other major unions outside the afl cio including united auto workers president leonard woodcock and international brotherhood of teamsters president frank fitzsimmons also indicated their support for nixon s plans after the union press conference president nixon issued his own statement praising the announcement saying the union bureaucrats have acted in the best interest of their own members and of the country then at a white house press conference secretary of labor james d hodgson outlined phase two of the inflation program hodgson explained that the pay board would be tasked with ensuring that workers wages stay within a level determined by the white house to be acceptable while the price commission would be tasked with surveying changes in the prices of goods the cost of living council would oversee the work of the two committees and direct their work both the white house and meany were careful to declare that the cost of living council would not be able to overrule the pay board while the unions attempted to frame their entry into the nixon administration as gaining a position of leverage in reality it was a fateful step in the transformation of the unions from organizations of the working class into tools of the state that could be reliably called upon when needed to suppress wages and quash militancy 75 years ago truman ends price controls amid us meat famine on october 14 1946 us president harry truman announced that his democratic party administration was ending price controls on meat products in a move that was dictated by the major businesses controlling the sector the move resulted in a doubling of meat prices leading to a devastating rise in the cost of living for the working class throughout us involvement in world war ii the population was subject to meat rationing at the conclusion of the conflict in 1945 demand and profiteering saw prices skyrocket by 70 percent truman reluctantly imposed price caps as the soaring cost of goods combined with stagnant or declining real wages provoked a growing movement of the working class the 1945 1946 strike wave was the largest in american history involving more than 5 million workers the introduction of the price controls was met with indignation by major farming and meat processing corporations producers withheld stock leading to a meat famine with much of the working population unable to purchase meat especially beef an article in the october 12 edition of the militant then the trotskyist publication in the us noted mounting protests by workers and housewives demanding access to meat supplies in one example cited by the paper toledo housewives organized in the housewives emergency league have demanded that the mayor and city hall wire truman urging the government nationalize the meat industry to be operated under union control they have demanded the right to conduct a housewives inspection of packinghouses refrigerated warehouses food lockers and all other places where meat is being horded to push up prices the following issue of the militant reporting truman s abolition of the price controls stated it has been sometime since the american people got such a bare faced demonstration of the government s subservience to the capitalists truman had mildly criticized the meat trusts but refused to take action against them instead capitulating to their demands at the same time he blamed his republican opponents for his about face 100 years ago upper silesia divided between germany and poland on october 11 1921 the league of nations divided the mineral rich region of upper silesia which lay on germany s eastern and poland s western borders poland whose territory had been divided for more than a century among germany tsarist russia and the austro hungarian empire was reestablished in the aftermath of world war i most of the upper silesian region had been a part of the german empire with a majority of german speakers but with a large polish speaking minority after the defeat of german imperialism in 1918 british french and italian troops occupied the area the allied imperialists sponsored a plebiscite to determine whether the area would belong to poland or germany in the run up to the vote in 1919 polish nationalists staged an uprising in response to a massacre of polish miners by german border guards polish workers staged a general strike the german military intervened and suppressed the uprising with great brutality an influx of british and french troops temporarily stabilized the region there was also a significant autonomy movement that sought eventual independence of upper silesia from both germany and poland the region voted on march 20 1920 by margins of 60 percent to stay with germany and 40 percent to stay with poland a second polish uprising occurred that year in august after a false report that the red army had taken warsaw inspired an anti polish pogrom by germans a third uprising occurred in the spring and summer of 1921 after polish nationalists heard rumors that a settlement of the dispute would favor germany the league of nations awarded to poland most parts of upper silesia that had voted in favor of unification with poland and which had for the most part come under the control of the forces of the polish nationalists these included the critical upper silesian mining areas with a heavy industrial infrastructure poland obtained almost half of the upper silesia s 2 073 663 inhabitants though it received only about a third of the total territory the german government of joseph wirth at first threatened to resign over the decision but then changed course german capitalism s interests were temporally appeased by an agreement with poland to supply coal but the loss of upper silesia served as a tool for mobilizing the incipient german fascist movement
this past weekend i spent some quality time in the wholesale channel at the national association of mortgage brokers annual in las vegas click here for my pptx slides the good news of sorts is that prepayment speeds increased month over month across all of the mbs major product types in september freddie mac speeds of note showed the largest increase the bad news is that wholesalers have cut margins pretty much to break even in response to falling volumes kind lending founder gary stearns told the namb audience that the wholesale channel always feels the pain first in a slowdown and that changes were coming to the industry after a remarkable run when it comes to profit margins and visibility on future volumes winter is here once again for the mortgage industry the remarkable and profitable springtime for 1 4s in 2020 is being replaced by something that looks a lot like 2019 that does not mean that the mortgage market is done with this bull cycle not by a long shot but it does mean preparing for a market without the fed as the largest buyer the fed s aggregate buying of mortgage backed securities last week was 5 4 billion compared to 4 9 billion the prior session according to the new york fed trading volume in the umbs 30 year stack was in positive territory across all coupons umbs 4 percent coupons were the most ahead at 241 2s saw the most bonds change hands at about 35 billion bloomberg reports volume in tbas was up 64 ahead of its trailing average while umbs 30 year volume came in at 98 ginnie mae ii 30 year at around 2 hardly a bad showing by any measure yet as we went into last friday the mailbox was filling up with notices from lock desks about repricing for future delivery market volatility is also back in force as 2021 ends both for pricing loans and equity valuations some of the independent mortgage banks that managed to go public this time a year ago when volumes peaked over 500 billion in november are getting beaten up pretty badly united wholesale mortgage and industry data duopoly black knight are the worst performers after the gses fannie mae and freddie mac even solid businesses like penny mac and guild mortgage are getting no respect in the equity market but mr cooper new residential and chimera on the flip side are leading the group of mostly reits higher along with several mortgage banks flagstar bancorp which is in the process of merging with new york community bank is one of the best performing mortgage specialty depositories this year top of the list however is western alliance bancshares which acquired amerihome earlier this year from athene one of the better bank names among all u s banks in 2021 western alliance is up almost 90 in 2021 all of the better names in the mortgage sector are supported by an investor community that is accustomed to ever higher stock prices making price corrections swift and steep one indicator that deserves mention is the brisk business being done in the world of non agency lending a fringe market that grows quickly atop the agency and bank markets but can retreat even faster as the mainstream mortgage business has migrated from a focus on government loans in 2020 to conventionals this year the same home price appreciation has driven the market for non qm loans into a buying craze the namb conference featured representation from over a dozen non qm lenders who are competing for a relatively small market of non agency loans investors are even scooping up fha loans are premium prices humans admittedly do not perform well in crowds when it comes to making investment decisions or life in general buying mortgage related assets is no exception a year ago there was some value to be had in loans and related servicing assets but today execution is well above fair value returns on late vintage conventional servicing for example at 5 6x multiples are looking decidedly negative through the cycle many investors don t appreciate this little nuance the big question on the minds of mortgage bankers is how the reduction or even cessation of mbs purchases by the fed will impact mortgage rates stan middleman founder and ceo of freedom mortgage told me in an interview last week that weak employment data and investor demand will keep rates low even if the fed ends purchases of mbs over the next six months while many observers wonder when and how home prices are likely to correct the reality is that investor demand for assets is unlikely to cool anytime soon this is why the fomc should deliberately move ahead with its stated plan to end mbs purchases instead the fed will focus open market purchases on treasury bills and coupons to maintain the size of the central bank s balance sheet as the mortgage market digests the progress in washington on a federal budget look for greater volatility in the financial markets the uncertainty about the economy that is likely to keep borrowing costs low is also likely to cause investors considerable agitation when the endless upward climb in asset valuations slows or reverses this market has no tolerance for negative returns even for a short period of time the impact of the fed ending direct purchases of mbs may be muted by secular demand for assets of any description but the short term reaction to actual changes could be significant for imbs and consumers alike in the meantime look for the smarter operators in the industry to take money off the table even as investors rush in to buy loans and servicing assets at prices that may ultimately generate significant capital losses but we ve seen this movie before

employees of the gorillas delivery service held a protest wednesday in front of the company s headquarters in the german capital of berlin in total more than 100 riders as the couriers are called and supporters came together to loudly demonstrate for better working conditions and the reinstatement of several colleagues the billion dollar start up announced last tuesday that all employees who participated in work stoppages over the previous weekend would be terminated on friday and saturday gorillas bike couriers went on strike against conditions of abuse and paralyzed several warehouses it is still unclear how many employees were given notice by letter or telephone according to the latest reports there are over 300 this is a massive attack on the right to strike that goes far beyond the gorillas delivery service the ruling class is launching an all out attack on working conditions and wages around the world in germany the social democrats free democrats and the greens are preparing a new government whose central tasks will be to enforce the debt brake so as to restrict public spending and squeeze the hundreds of billions of euros that were funnelled to the banks and corporations under the guise of the coronavirus bailout packages out of the working class with the federal election now over mass layoffs and the shutdown of entire industrial plants are being implemented the employers are demanding in the words of ford germany boss gunnar herrmann gigantic flexibility the message being sent with the mass sackings at gorillas is clear anyone who is not prepared to accept conditions of slave like exploitation must expect severe consequences the company s management makes no secret of the fact that the terminations are a punishment for the strikes a company spokesman said on tuesday evening such unannounced strikes that are not supported by a trade union are illegal after careful consideration we are now forced to enforce this legal framework this means that we end the employment relationship with those employees who actively participated in the unauthorized strikes and blockades who hindered the company through their behaviour and thus endangered their colleagues the arrogance and aggressiveness of the billion dollar company is breathtaking it is not the striking workers fighting for fair and safe working conditions who are endangering their colleagues but company management slavery like exploitation at the demonstration numerous riders reported on the completely unsustainable working conditions at gorillas and the brutal behaviour of the company a 21 year old gorillas rider who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals reported that the strikes began on friday october 1 in bergmannkiez in the neukölln district and then quickly spread to the warehouses in schöneberg and mitte on saturday a strike also took place at the gesundbrunnen warehouse on tuesday the company then carried out a blatant attack on the employees as the worker described it all the people on strike who had no protection against dismissal have been terminated without notice the rider explained some by letter and some by phone this is of course completely illegal that is why we are protesting against the working conditions and the action on the part of the company we demand the reinstatement of those who have been terminated strikes among gorillas delivery workers already took place repeatedly in spring and summer the 21 year old rider reports that working conditions have even worsened since then the shift times are now issued by a computer he said accordingly the shift times are extremely short i have a 30 hour contract and work six days a week four days in advance the legal minimum you will be notified of your shift you can no longer plan your free time because you never know when and where you have to work he went on to describe the extreme workload during a shift commenting we have six orders in one backpack and that happens over and over again sometimes you can t even close the rucksack because it s overloaded and you still have to deliver everything i have no idea how heavy the backpack is sometimes maybe 40 kilos you can hardly get it on your back and that s what it s like for the whole shift for eight hours there are also virtually no safety measures to protect workers from the covid 19 pandemic the disinfectant dispensers are usually empty and you really have to beg for masks remarked the worker another rider camilo reported that workers often receive their starvation wages late or are not paid in full this is a problem that has existed since the beginning he told us i ve been with gorillas for a year now and there are wage issues every month there is no regular payment and often people only get 100 or 200 although they ought to get 1 000 for example this means that many workers are left without income and still have to pay their rent etc camilo also pointed to the generally poor condition of the bikes with potentially fatal consequences nobody in the stores is responsible for ensuring that the bikes are in good condition he said very often workers ride their bicycles and for example the seat falls off or something breaks which leads to accidents accidents are very common at this company that also has to do with the company s business model which promises to deliver within 10 minutes there have been very serious accidents people with broken limbs people who needed an operation there was even a rider who almost died there is broad solidarity with the workers among the population alexander took extra time off to support the protest i want to set an example because i find the working conditions under which people work here unbearable he said the people who work here are completely overworked driving around 100 kilometres a day with 20 kilos on your back is impossible the sackings were the tipping point for me alexander pointed out that the attacks are part of a wider political development workers rights have been dismantled for a long time and attempts are being made to continue to dismantle them he commented many people are angry and no longer feel represented by the political parties the social divide is getting bigger and bigger and this is happening on the backs of the people who work here even the housing market is being capitalized how can we still lead a good life in this city without working 80 hours a week there is enough money but you have to distribute it differently you have to organize it differently that is long overdue which way forward in the struggle for better working conditions and wages the struggle at gorillas raises important issues that the entire working class confronts what form of organization and what political perspective is necessary to combat and abolish once and for all exploitative working conditions like those that prevail at gorillas many of the protesting workers including camilo and his colleague are members of the gorillas workers collective gwc which was founded independently of the verdi trade union at the beginning of the year the workers have made the experience that the union not only does not represent their interests but wants to control and suppress their struggle when we established contact with verdi one of verdi s demands to us was no more wildcat strikes they wanted to take control of the protest of course we don t agree verdi and the federal government advocate the formation of works councils at gorillas and other companies in the so called new economy the goal they are pursuing is clear as in other areas a works council sanctioned by the trade unions and management is supposed to control the workers suppress their struggles and thus prevent them from becoming the starting point for a broader movement of the working class in may germany s federal parliament even passed a works council modernisation act which is supposed to facilitate the establishment of works councils the representatives of the gwc with whom the wsws spoke also advocate the establishment of a works council however they emphasize that it must be independent of management and the verdi union what we are creating is not a works council that will work with the company we want that as a counterweight but we are organized ourselves we re not from verdi we don t have that much to do with them and we don t want to have anything to do with them explained a gwc representative he is well aware of the limitations and the potentially anti worker character of the works council perspective over time the works council will split up anyway he said and then there has to be another revolution or whatever the sozialistische gleichheitspartei socialist equality party sgp and the wsws explained in a previous statement why the focus on establishing a works council is a dead end works councils are not allowed to call job actions and are obliged by law to work for the company s wellbeing to work trustfully with the employer and to keep all information secret with the formation of a works council slave labour is not abolished at gorillas but contractually regulated and cemented the organization of strikes will become more difficult because during the term of collective agreements there is a statutory requirement to observe labour peace i e a strike ban the recent mass sackings have underlined that gorillas management will only accept a works council that corresponds to its interests at the same time there are many indications that the move is part of a broader restructuring of the company in order to accelerate the exploitation even further according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung among the founders in berlin s start up scene business models are discussed that are already common in the usa that agencies only contract the drivers to the suppliers to reduce personnel costs on the balance sheet in august efforts by gorillas to secure a 400 million investment deal with the largest us on demand delivery service doordash failed according to media reports doordash is said to have asked gorillas to stop its expansion in the us for the time being and instead work to reduce its losses in its european markets it is obvious that a single works council cannot do anything against the globally operating delivery giants which literally make enormous profits on the back of the workers when doordash went public on the new york stock exchange on december 9 2020 amid the pandemic the company generated 3 4 billion in revenue gorillas which only started deliveries in june 2020 now enjoys the status of a start up unicorn with a market valuation of over 1 billion the fight for rank and file committees and a socialist perspective to repel the company s attacks the riders in berlin must establish connections with their colleagues across germany and around the world according to its own information gorillas now employs around 10 000 drivers in 18 german cities including berlin hamburg munich cologne frankfurt karlsruhe and leipzig four european countries england france italy and the netherlands and in new york city other delivery services such as just eat takeaway lieferando are also active globally with several thousand employees other sections of the working class such as the striking nurses and teachers in berlin should also be contacted and mobilized workers around the world are facing similar attacks by capitalist governments and transnational corporations and are beginning to rebel against them in the united states on sunday over 10 000 workers at agricultural engineering giant john deere rejected by 90 percent a contract backed by the united auto workers union in south africa over 150 000 steel and metal workers went on strike last tuesday on may 1 the socialist equality party and its sister parties in the international committee of the fourth international called for the establishment of the international workers alliance of rank and file committees to create new independent organizations of struggle for workers in all industries and to link up the developing struggles internationally this offensive as necessary as it is urgent directly raises the question of a socialist perspective the statement calling for the establishment of the international workers alliance declares the fight against the pandemic and against war inequality exploitation and dictatorship is a fight against the entire capitalist social and economic order workers of all countries must be united in a common political offensive to take power expropriate the oligarchs and establish a socialist society based on the rational scientific and democratic control of production for the purpose of serving social need not private profit we call on all gorillas workers to discuss these issues with us very carefully and seriously this is the only way to successfully fight for the reinstatement of colleagues and for decent and safe working conditions
petaling jaya sept 28 smoky caramelised char siu with a sticky in house glaze mee ulam tossed in budu and lacto fermented chilli and juicy wontons each dumpling stuffed with prawns and pork and served in a prawn broth rasam this is yet another flavourful meal at fifty tales a contemporary restaurant in bandar sri damansara that offers dai chow fare with an artisanal touch chef owner aaron phua would tell you that he is a specialist at handmade egg noodles but his résumé is even more colourful than this already admirable accomplishment the 27 year old studied hospitality management and worked part time in hotels banquet halls and cafés he recalls i found my love for coffee in 2013 and interned at departure lounge together with my family we opened thirty seconds café in 2014 and i have participated in various barista competitions domestically and internationally advertisement chef owner aaron phua is a specialist at handmade egg noodles that last bit is another typical understatement from phua after several years of competing he was crowned the malaysia barista champion in 2019 and represented our country in the world barista championship 2019 in boston which would be a great place to be if one wanted to expand one s burgeoning coffee empire instead phua decided to return to his childhood dream which was to be a chef and thus fifty tales was born phua says at the end of 2019 i had the inspiration of opening a chinese noodle bar while making noodles at home there are many foreign cuisines available in the klang valley so we wanted to be a little different as a modern malaysian chinese restaurant i want to cook malaysian chinese dishes and recreate the nostalgic flavours i used to enjoy as a kid advertisement to that end the kitchen team makes fresh noodles from scratch every day using only eggs with no water chemicals or kansui alkaline fifty tales signature laksa left and eggplant with a nam yu dip right perhaps there s no noodle dish at fifty tales that s more representative of phua s philosophy than his signature og style every chewy slurp worthy strand slick with their own soy sauce and loaded with crunchy pork lard phua says our og noodles were what our customers kept coming back for based on my childhood memory it is how a bowl of dry noodles should be we will reintroduce it in the near future till the return of the og the restaurant s current signature bowl of noodles is their fifty tales laksa their mouthwatering take on curry laksa but phua assures there is more than meets the eye we make our rempah fresh and from scratch the way a granny would make it grinding and frying till pecah minyak also we use gula melaka in the mix with rich creaminess from the coconut milk and just the right amount of spiciness making egg noodles by hand with no kansui alkaline when phua first began he used pork bone broth for fifty tales noodles this caused some customers to confuse it with japanese ramen due to the prolonged pandemic and lockdown the team had a chance to rethink and realign their brand story along with the food that they cook as a result the new menu at fifty tales employs chicken broth rather than pork bone broth to differentiate it from the similar tonkotsu stock favoured by ramen shops more familiar comfort food standards such as hakka noodles laksa and pork lard rice are now also fixtures if the idea is to have customers revelling in nostalgic flavours fifty tales is off to a good start rather than rest on his laurels however phua wants to keep experimenting recently the kitchen started delving into lacto fermentation food ageing and even chinese charcuterie to add more depth of flavour adventuring into the world of food preservation and cultures means that even the simplest dishes can be elevated at fifty tales wagyu beef stir fry with lacto leeks and ginger left steamed octopus with shio koji pickled ginger and spring onions the humble eggplant soars with a dip made from nam yu red fermented bean curd if you think aubergines are boring the funkiness ensures every bite will thrill you carnivores might not think twice about a wagyu beef stir fry but pair that with lacto fermented leeks and ginger the dish now sings even seafood can benefit from the anaerobic process where microorganisms such as yeast and bacteria transform their texture and flavours fifty tales steamed octopus with pickled ginger and spring onions is one stellar example the use of shio koji made with rice salt and aspergillus oryzae mould tenderises and suffuses every ring and tentacle with umami when the restaurant first started operations were rudimentary a lean and agile approach meant that fifty tales could try to cater to a general crowd and then adapt as they learn on the go chicken two ways steamed with spring onion pesto left and fried tenders with aged calamansi salt right phua shares we started as a 10am to 10pm restaurant aiming to serve both lunch and dinner crowds our food is suitable for all age groups there will be something for everyone we are a very small team of four people we would definitely love to grow the team but the current situation just wouldn t allow it that current situation is of course the same one affecting everyone though the f b food and beverage industry has its own specific difficulties phua explains we have had to rely solely on delivery and takeaways since the beginning of the lockdown business has definitely dropped significantly but we are thankful to all who have supported us we remodelled our menu experimented with new items so that as dine in resumes we can give our customers the best dining experience they re longing for the challenging situation has dialled up creativity levels some of the new dishes include chicken done two ways steamed and served with a vibrant spring onion pesto and pickled cucumbers as well as fried as tenders with a dusting of aged calamansi salt clams with chrysanthemum oil and chinese rose wine left grilled kailan with kelulut honey and 32 day aged preserved duck ham right regulars of fifty tales look forward to visiting the restaurant on the weekends for their cincai dinner cincai may mean casual or as one pleases in local slang available only on friday through sunday the rotating menu often features whatever is seasonal or fresh from local markets phua explains cincai dinner is basically a menu that focuses on dishes that are meant to be paired with plain noodles or plain rice here we introduce dai chow style dishes such as our chrysanthemum clams grilled kailan and smoked lychee sambal prawns dai chow style might be understating his delicate offerings just a tad the fresh clams are steamed with chrysanthemum oil and chinese rose wine florets of kailan are lightly grilled with kelulut honey and balanced with some 32 day aged preserved duck ham which are made in house there is care that goes into every dish something phua will attest to he adds our cincai dinner is only available on weekends because as a kid i remembered only having such dinners outside during weekends smoked lychee sambal prawns one can empathise we all have a favourite version

people who visited singapore from germany and brunei only 2 tested positive on the day of the announcement singapore prime minister lee hsien loong addressed the nation to explain why singapore is reopening aggressively and to placate people who are worried that this may lead to new waves of infection he said singapore cannot stay locked down and closed off indefinitely it would not work and it would be very costly we would be unable to resume our lives participate in social activities open our borders and revive our economy companies and investors need to carry out regional and global business from singapore people working for them need to travel to earn a living students need to go on overseas attachments and internships although singapore has seen the number of covid 19 cases soar to record levels recently with an average of almost 3 200 cases per day in the last week the number of those who have become seriously ill is low at two per cent only two out of every thousand needed intensive care treatment or have died due to a vaccination rate of about 85 per cent of the total population about 98 per cent of those who catch covid 19 in singapore have mild or no symptoms the accelerated border opening will be widely welcomed by the tourism industry which saw a trickle of leisure visitors since covid 19 struck in 2019 the last full year before the pandemic singapore had 19 1 million visitors and tourism accounted for about four per cent of gdp raking in usd 27 1 billion of receipts unfortunately the singapore vtl at the moment does not cover visitors from china indonesia and india the top three countries from which visitors came in 2019 together they accounted for almost 43 percent of all visitors to singapore that year 1 42 million indians visited singapore

forced to raise money in the financial markets to the tune of about usd15 billion earlier in the week echoing singapore s approach in dealing with covid 19 as an endemic disease the international air transport association iata urged governments to implement simplified regimes to manage the risks of covid 19 as borders reopen to international travel it argued that travellers are not adding to the risk to the local population quoting data from the uk which has one of the most liberal stance on visitors entering the country it said that fewer than 250 people have tested positive per day out of the three million passengers which arrived between february and august in its october 4 news release it cited a recent survey of the top 50 travel markets which accounted for 92 percent of global air traffic pointing to the urgent need for the simplification of the various measures governments are using to manage the risks of covid 19 the organisation believes that wildly inconsistent covid 19 travel restrictions are stalling the recovery of air transport travel restrictions bought governments time to respond in the early days of the pandemic nearly two years later that rationale no longer exists covid 19 is present in all parts of the world travel restrictions are a complex and confusing web of rules with very little consistency among them and there is little evidence to support

former scana ceo kevin marsh center is led out of the courtroom by attorney robert bolchoz right after a south carolina judge accepted a plea deal that included a two year federal prison term for marsh on monday oct 11 2021 in spartanburg s c marsh is the first executive to go to prison for the failed project to build two nuclear reactors which cost ratepayers billions of dollars and never generated a watt of power ap photo jeffrey collins columbia s c a former utility executive who lied to ratepayers and regulators costing billions of dollars after he found out a pair of nuclear reactors being built in south carolina were hopelessly behind schedule will soon be heading to prison for two years a state judge monday accepted the negotiated sentence of former scana ceo kevin marsh he is the first executive to go to prison over the project which lasted nine years and never generated a watt of power recommended videos marsh has cooperated with investigators spending at least seven days talking to the fbi prosecutors said a ceo for a fortune 500 company is going to prison and is paying 5 million to the people of south carolina state attorney general alan wilson said outside the spartanburg county courtroom under the agreement marsh is to report in early december to a federal prison in butner north carolina which includes a large hospital rather than a state facility he will serve the entire federal two year federal sentence south carolina circuit judge mark hayes suspended a 10 year state sentence but told marsh he will have to serve it if he does not keep cooperating or fails to successfully serve three years of probation marsh isn t the only executive facing legal problems a second former scana executive and an official at westinghouse electric co the lead contractor to build two new reactors at the v c summer plant north of columbia have also pleaded guilty a second westinghouse executive has been indicted and is awaiting trial prosecutors now are expected to turn their attention to westinghouse while marsh lied about the lack of progress in the final years of construction of the reactors westinghouse knew of the problem long before and did not tell marsh or other scana executives u s assistant attorney brook andrews said at marsh s sentencing thursday in federal court marsh s lawyer asked the judge and by extension the public to remember that this should not be the end a project like this doesn t go down the tubes because one person was involved said defense attorney robert bolchoz who compared marsh to a captain of a ship who trusted a crew working against him marsh pleaded guilty in federal court in february to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud and in state court to obtaining property by false pretenses the nuclear debacle was set up by a law passed in 2007 that allowed utilities to charge ratepayers to build power plants before they started generating power it divorced the risk from the people who were spending the money state assistant attorney general creighton waters said you won if you won and you won if you lost if the project was a failure and you abandoned it you still got to recoup that cost from customers that put a lot of responsibility on marsh as the leader of scana and he failed by keeping his mouth shut when problems mounted and collecting bonuses instead of risking his job waters said marsh made 5 million in 2017 the year the utility abandoned the hopelessly behind schedule project his plea agreement requires 5 million in restitution which has already been paid to a fund that provides help to pay electric bills of low income people the actions by marsh and other executives took more than 1 billion from the pockets of ratepayers and investors authorities said in an 87 page securities and exchange commission lawsuit filed against him and a second executive in 2020 scana and its subsidiary south carolina electric gas were destroyed by the debt and poor management and were bought out by dominion energy of virginia in 2019 state owned utility santee cooper which had a 45 stake in the project ended up saddled with 4 billion in debt even though scana controlled management of the project marsh read a brief statement in court monday similar to the one he read in federal court thursday he said not a day has gone by in the past four years where he did not regret that failure of the project i accept full responsibility marsh said i feel sorry for everything that occurred marsh s original plea deal said sentencing would wait until the investigation was over to assure his full cooperation but prosecutors relented after marsh s wife of 46 years was diagnosed with incurable breast cancer marsh never wavered from saying the two reactors being built at the v c summer site north of columbia would be finished by the end of 2020 a deadline that had to be met to receive the 1 4 billion in federal tax credits needed to keep the 10 billion project from overwhelming the utility prosecutors said marsh lied and presented rosy projections on the progress of the reactors that he knew were false in earning calls presentations and news releases to keep investors happy and pump up the company s stock price u s district judge mary geiger lewis reluctantly accepted the deal even though she felt prosecutors and marsh s lawyers made it sound like the executive made mistakes instead of intentionally misleading people for well over a year your crime was committed with a little more elegance and sophistication than many i see geiger told marsh on thursday but you don t get credit for that ___ follow jeffrey collins on twitter at

fairfield the town in which i live like many other connecticut towns continues to make meaningful progress in adding diverse new housing to its existing stock of over 21 000 housing units you may not be aware of our town s hard work and good results and that may be due to the fact that we usually only hear about the ratio of affordable housing as a percent of total housing stock and how it s not moving quickly towards 10 towns that have 10 of their total housing stock designated as affordable are exempt from the controversial 8 30g affordable housing law the 8 30g law is much maligned for a reason it enables any size of a housing development in any location without regard to zoning laws that residents relied on when purchasing their own homes simply put 8 30g enables housing developers to largely ignore zoning regulations governing height lot coverage setbacks traffic congestion impact on property values etc if they deed restrict 30 of the units to be affordable the burden shifts from the applicant justifying the development to the commission justifying a denial which can only be done if there is evidence of substantial harm to health or safety but it is a virtual mathematical impossibility for most towns to ever achieve 10 of their housing stock as affordable even so this ratio is often cited at zoning hearings and in court appeals and judges decisions as evidence that the town is not doing much to add affordable housing to its housing stock but this ratio is deeply flawed as an indicator of a town s progress toward adding to its diversity including affordability of its housing stock the ratio ignores many things and is itself misleading as a measure of a town s progress first the math doesn t work out because 8 30g enables dense new housing development with only 30 being affordable that means 70 is at full rental value so even if all new development is 8 30g the ratio would go up very slowly because total non affordable units go up much more than the affordable ones also much new housing development isn t based on 8 30g non 8 30g new housing may only add between 0 10 as affordable so actual new affordable units can be added but the ratio can still decrease because total housing stock increases much more all this means that the math won t allow the 10 goal to be reached and in fact the ratio could decline despite adding large numbers of both affordable and non affordable but still diversified housing stock second the ratio ignores actual progress and hard work being done by towns to diversify and expand its housing stock most of which isn t reflected in the percentage of affordable units to total housing units fairfield has been continually adding to the diversity of its housing stock in fact working toward the intent behind the 2020 and 2021 legislative proposals put forth in hartford by expanding multifamily apartments in transit areas the use of in law apartments accessory dwelling units and mixed use housing above retail in the walkable downtown areas but adding to the diversity of housing doesn t improve the ratio because generally only 0 10 of non 8 30g housing is designated as affordable this means that the math gets worse for that ratio even though the town is doing exactly what housing advocates wish it to do towns will remain subject to 8 30g without an end in sight and have a flat or declining ratio used against them in court even as communities work hard to add to the diversity of housing the ratio thus sets up connecticut s towns with an unachievable goal and towns should not be charged with failure based on it we shouldn t allow all our town s hard work and actual progress to be judged by this ratio but more importantly our state should reform 8 30g so it s not used as a cudgel to impose unbridled development based on failure to achieve an unachievable ratio it must be acknowledged that the new state wide zoning initiatives and laws to add to the overall diversity of housing stock without focusing solely on affordable units work at cross purposes to 8 30g working towards an elusive 10 ratio of affordable to total housing units in all municipalities zoning boards are required to follow state mandates but here the mandates of the new zoning laws and proposals which may still be enacted in future legislative sessions versus the 30 year old 8 30g law contain conflicting objectives and towns are caught in the middle it is time for our state legislature to reform those laws that work at cross purposes with other laws while penalizing towns trying to achieve the goals of both alexis harrison is a candidate for the fairfield town plan zoning commission

california governor gavin newsom signed a number of woke bills into law over the weekend including a ban on gas powered leaf blowers to schools requiring students to be taught ethnic studies one liberal pleasing law will see gender neutral children s sections being required in large toy stores while female students in schools and colleges will be provided free menstrual supplies in women s bathrooms newsom hastily signed the flurry of new bills into law on saturday night ahead of his sunday night deadline for approving or vetoing new legislation for the year the governor appears re energized after managing to easily beat back a republican campaign to oust him from office during a recall election last month during the september recall vote newsom bolted to a quick victory boosted by a healthy turnout in the overwhelmingly democratic state california gov gavin newsom left also signed into law america s first ethnic studies requirement for high school students state assemblyman jose medina a former ethnic studies teacher who wrote the bill said it was long overdue california public schools and colleges must stock their restrooms with free menstrual products under a new law signed by california governor gavin newsom this weekend free menstrual products in schools one new law sees california public schools and colleges having to stock their restrooms with free menstrual products the move comes as women s rights advocates push nationwide for affordable access to pads tampons and other items california s latest effort builds on a 2017 law requiring low income schools in disadvantaged areas to provide students with free menstrual products it expands the law to include grades 6 to 12 community colleges and the california state university and university of california systems starting in the 2022 23 school year it encourages private schools and colleges to follow suit our biology doesn t always send an advanced warning when we re about to start menstruating which often means we need to stop whatever we re doing and deal with a period democratic assemblywoman cristina garcia said of her legislation just as toilet paper and paper towels are provided in virtually every public bathrooms so should menstrual products california joins a growing number of states who lead the way in demonstrating that menstrual equity is a matter of human rights the advocacy group period said in statement no student should ever lose learning time due to their periods period gender neutral toy departments on saturday newsom signed a woke law forcing stores with toy departments to have gender neutral sections where traditional blue and pink toys and toothbrushes are banned large department stores must now display products like toys and toothbrushes in gender neutral ways a win for lgbt advocates who say the pink and blue hues of traditional marketing methods pressure children to conform to gender stereotypes the new law however does not completely outlaw traditional boys and girls sections at department stores instead it says large stores must also have a gender neutral section to display a reasonable selection of items regardless of whether they have been traditionally marketed for either girls or for boys california is the first state to require large department stores to display products like toys and toothbrushes in gender neutral ways that does not include clothes the law only applies to toys and childcare items which include hygiene and teething products the law also only applies to stores with at least 500 employees meaning small businesses are exempt author of the bill evan low an assemblyman and democrat from san jose said he was incredibly grateful newsom signed the bill this year it was democrats third attempt in the state legislature trying to pass the law with similar bills failing in 2019 and 2020 low said he was inspired by the 10 year old girl daughter of one of his staffers who asked her mom why certain items in the store were off limits to her because she was a girl we need to stop stigmatizing what s acceptable for certain genders and just let kids be kids low said my hope is this bill encourages more businesses across california and the us to avoid reinforcing harmful and outdated stereotypes he added while california is the first state to require this some large department stores have already changed how they display their products target corp which has 1 915 stores across the united states announced in 2015 it would stop using some gender based signs in its stores the law was opposed by some republicans and some conservative groups who argued the government should not tell parents how to shop for their children author of the bill evan low an assemblyman and democrat from san jose said he was inspired by the 10 year old girl daughter of one of his staffers who asked her mom why certain items in the store were off limits to her because she was a girl ethnic studies mandate also over the weekend california became the first state in the nation to make ethnic studies a required class for high school students after five years of debate the requirement would apply to students who graduate in 2030 and was created and approved by the state board of education in march after gov gavin newsom vetoed a similar measure last year until it was inclusive of all communities during the bill signing newsom said students must understand our nation s full history if we expect them to one day build a more just society ethnic studies courses enable students to learn their own stories and those of their classmates california gov gavin newsom has signed into law friday afternoon a bill requiring students to take ethnic studies classes in order to graduate the bill will go into effect in 2025 and california students who begin high school in 2026 will be required to pass at least one semester of the new course the course will focus on the past and presents struggles of marginalized groups in america including black asian latino jewish middle eastern native and indigenous americans women and other groups who face bigotry the los angeles times reports the bill was authored by state assemblyman jose medina with the help of an advisory committee made up of teachers and educators medina called the new requirement long overdue and just one step in the long struggle for equal education for all students the bill which was first reposed in 2016 received stark criticism as opponents claimed it was filled with radical ideology and obscure jargon and bias against capitalism the version that newsom vetoed last year also received backlash from the members of the california legislative jewish caucus which said the bill failed to properly address anti semitism while providing positive representation for the boycott movement against israel there were 14 forms of bigotry and racism in the glossary said assemblyman jesse gabriel d encino who called the exclusion of anti semitism glaring obvious and offensive anti semitism is now noted more clearly in the curriculum as a form of bigotry it also now includes the experiences of armenian and sikh communities in the us all while toning down anti capitalist sentiments williamson evers a former us assistant secretary of education continued to speak out against the curriculum saying it is still full of left wing ideological propaganda and indoctrination it still force feeds our children the socialist dogma that capitalism is oppression individual school districts will have the task of developing courses using the state s curriculum guide allowing schools to focus on parts of the curriculum that represent their student s demographics all public high school will have to offer ethnic studies courses by 2025 and students who start high school in 2026 must pass at least one single semester course newsom signed off on the new law on saturday banning gas powered equipment that uses small off road engines gas powered equipment includes generators lawn equipment pressure washers chainsaws weed trimmers and even golf carts under the new law the machinery will have to be battery powered or plug in ban on gas powered mowers in one of the more unusual bills passed this weekend california is to soon ban the sale of new gas powered leaf blowers and lawn mowers the move is aimed at curbing emissions from a category of small engines on pace to produce more pollution each year than passenger vehicles the gas powered equipment to be banned uses small off road engines a broad category that includes generators lawn equipment pressure washers chainsaws weed trimmers and even golf carts under the new law these machines must be zero emissions meaning they ll have to be battery powered or plug in proponents of the law said it will reduce amount of smog induced pollution in the air which will improve the air quality and combat climate change the law which was authored by democratic assemblyman marc berman is part of an aggressive strategy to reduce pollution in the nation s most populous state this is a pretty modest approach to trying to limit the massive amounts of pollution that this equipment emits not to mention the health impact on the workers who are using it constantly berman said it s amazing how people react when they learn how much this equipment pollutes and how much smog forming and climate changing emissions that small off road engine equipment creates he added the state budget approved earlier this year includes 30million to pay for this effort and help professional landscapers and gardeners make the transition from gas powered equipment but an anonymous industry representative has told the la times that the budget is woefully inadequate for the nearly 50 000 small businesses that will be affected by the new law vice president of government relations for he national association of landscape professionals andrew bray also noted that zero emission commercial equipment is much more expensive and much less efficient than its gas powered counterpart author of the law democratic assemblyman marc berman right said that it s a pretty modest approach to trying to limit the massive amounts of pollution that this equipment emits not to mention the health impact on the workers who are using it constantly he said that a gas powered riding lawnmower costs between 7 000 and 11 000 while the zero emissions version costs more than twice that amount the california air resources board has already started working on executing the law which is a lengthy process scheduled to conclude early next year will barrett director of clean air advocacy for the american lung association in california said gov newsom signing this law really sets a strong course to not only his commitment to transitioning to zero emissions but also to cleaner air and healthier lungs california is the only state with the authority to regulate air quality this way in this way which is part of an exception carved out by federal law in the 1970s while other states can t enact their own regulations they can choose to follow california s lead newsom signed the law on saturday and ordered the california air resources board to apply the new rule by january 1 2024 or as soon as regulators determine what is feasible this isn t california s first statewide effort to go greener last year the state s regulators approved a first of its kind rule to force automakers to sell more electric work trucks and delivery vans also in 2020 newsom ordered regulators to ban the sale of all new gas powered cars and trucks in california by 2035 a date that has since been embraced by some of the world s largest automakers california has more than 16 7million of these small engines in the state about 3million more than the number of passenger cars on the road officials say running a gas powered leaf blower for one hour emits the same amount of pollution as driving a 2017 toyota camry from los angeles to denver a distance of about 1 100 miles the law newsom signed also orders regulators to offer rebates for people to change out their equipment which is aimed at landscaping businesses that use such machines more often portable gas powered generators must also be zero emissions by 2028 which also could be delayed at the discretion of the state agency

hopelessly behind schedule will soon be heading to prison for two years a state judge monday accepted the negotiated sentence of former scana ceo kevin marsh he is the first executive to go to prison over the project which lasted nine years and never generated a watt of power marsh has cooperated with investigators spending at least seven days talking to the fbi prosecutors said a ceo for a

allowed utilities to charge ratepayers to build power plants before they started generating power it divorced the risk from the people who were spending the money state assistant attorney general creighton waters said you won if you won and you won if you lost if the project was a failure and you abandoned it you still got to recoup that cost from customers that put a lot of responsibility on marsh as the leader of scana and he failed by keeping his mouth shut when problems mounted and collecting bonuses instead of risking his job waters said marsh made 5 million in 2017 the year the utility abandoned the hopelessly behind schedule project his plea agreement requires 5 million in restitution which has already been paid to a fund that provides help to pay electric bills of low

although it may seem that we just ended deliberations on the state budget we will nonetheless in another month or so begin serious discussions on the biennial budget for virginia for 2022 2024 state agency heads and the governor s staff are already hard at work to prepare an executive budget that will be presented to the house of delegates and the state senate in december with the federal funds that have been coming into the state along with an amazingly strong state economy there should be funding available to meet some state needs that have not been met in the past virginia s rainy day fund is at capacity and available for turn downs in the economy governor northam wisely recommended to the general assembly to not spend all the federal monies available for covid relief but rather hold some monies in reserve should the economy slow down virginia budget revenue projections are not set politically but rather are the work of recognized economists and persons who are knowledgeable of economic matters using available data even though they likely do not live in virginia if revenue can be predicted with good data and economic models the expenditure side of the budget is often decided in a pull tug match among established programs political favorites special interests and advocacy groups in a political setting too often established programs continue their funding with a small inflation bounce but without the scrutiny needed to determine their effectiveness much of the budget is taken up with the continuation of existing programs new programs with a price tag find it difficult to break into the regular budget cycle sometimes new programs or initiatives are funded as pilot programs to see how they will perform before being added to the baseline budget one program for which there is an abundance of evidence of its cost effectiveness that only recently is starting to break into consideration for serious long term funding is preschool or early education the evidence has become overwhelming that spending on preschool education should be considered an investment because of its high rate of return there are numerous studies conducted by business groups that might otherwise be skeptical of new government programs showing that early education preschool programs pay for themselves over the long run in avoided costs that are necessary when preschool education is not available a decades long longitudinal study the perry preschool program study found that preschool programs provide a 7 to 12 return for every dollar spent on preschool programs the returns come from the savings realized when remediation programs are not needed as children come to school prepared and ready to learn there are longer term gains as children who attend quality preschool programs are likely to be successful in life generally in employment and in personal satisfaction over the last few years virginia has been ramping up its funding for preschool programs based on the research and on the observable difference by students who get an early start at learning preschool funding gets a great rate of return monetarily but its saves money in other areas of the budget and in the personal lifetime satisfaction of students who are enriched by their experience of getting a head start ken plum is a member of the virginia house of delegates

yes we can trust the fed secretary yellen by mike gleason as congress finally came to an agreement last week to temporarily lift the debt ceiling investors breathed a sigh of relief the stock market bounced and commodity indexes ran up to new multi year highs precious metals markets meanwhile staged modest advances after showing virtually no reaction to the preceding debt drama in washington as metals markets try to turn the corner for a fall rally other raw materials are moving relentlessly higher energy commodities including crude and natural gas are leading the charge also pushing higher are agricultural futures rising food costs are hitting consumers pocketbooks whenever they shop at the grocery store or go out to eat at a restaurant especially noticeable is the soaring cost of meat â as seen in everything from strip steaks to sliced bacon beef prices have risen 14 this year pork prices have jumped 12 speaking of pork politicians in washington are going to be bringing home a lot more of it now that the debt ceiling is being lifted once again there was never any real doubt about whether the government would find a way to keep borrowing the only question was how it would go about doing it in this case mitch mcconnell the republican leader in the senate folded after months of insisting he wouldn t help democrats raise the debt limit he finally agreed to do just that mcconnell s deal with democrats enables the government to borrow another 480 billion through december 3rd leading up to that date another debt showdown may loom the political maneuverings that may occur are uncertain but the ultimate outcome isn t even if congress failed to push another debt limit extension through in time the treasury department and the federal reserve have emergency backup plans in place one of them entails minting a trillion dollar platinum coin and depositing it at the fed a former director of the united states mint has confirmed that it would be a quick and easy process to retool the existing platinum eagle mold for the lofty new denomination treasury secretary janet yellen pooh poohed the idea when asked about it during a cnbc interview last week obviously it would be embarrassing for officials to have to resort to such a maneuver doing so would make the fed s role in monetizing government spending far too obvious janet yellen i trust the fed to make the right decisions the platinum coin is equivalent to asking the federal reserve to print money to cover deficits that congress is unwilling to cover by issuing debt it compromises the independence of the fed conflating monetary and fiscal policy i trust the fed to make the right decisions supply bottlenecks have developed that have caused inflation i believe that they re transitory but that doesn t mean they ll go away over the next several months i trust the fed to make the right decisions former fed chair yellen wants us to trust current fed chair jerome powell when he says inflation is transitory and merely the effect of supply disruptions she doesn t want us to focus on the fact that the central bank is now buying well over 50 of all new treasury debt nor does she want us to be concerned that the m2 money supply is growing at a 13 annual rate sure let s trust the fed what the fed can absolutely be trusted to do is continue inflating but that means investors can t trust fiat dollars to hold their value debt instruments denominated in u s currency will almost certainly return less than the inflation rate over time bondholders risk an enormous loss of purchasing power even if the issue never results in formal defaults all financial assets entail some amount of trust in counterparties to make good on their promises by contrast hard assets have intrinsic value that doesn t require any trust in counterparties institutions or governments gold and silver coins are the only forms of money that have endured throughout the ages as empires have come and gone and as all fiat currencies have eventually failed in a true flight to quality precious metals will be the most sought after asset class for the time being investors still trust the fed to keep stimulating the stock market and propping up the bond market but when they realize they can no longer trust central bankers to maintain price stability they may begin to dump vulnerable paper assets mike gleason is a director with money metals exchange a national precious metals dealer with over 50 000 customers gleason is a hard money advocate and a strong proponent of personal liberty limited government and the austrian school of economics a graduate of the university of florida gleason has extensive experience in management sales and logistics as well as precious metals investing he also puts his longtime broadcasting background to good use hosting a weekly precious metals podcast since 2011 a program listened to by tens of thousands each week home

after what was a rather disappointing us jobs report as we look forward to a week that sees us earnings season get underway in earnest and where guidance is likely to be just as important as the headline numbers themselves said michael hewson chief market analyst at cmc markets data on friday showed us nonfarm payrolls majorly disappointed in september total nonfarm payroll employment rose by

submission of a request to the us food drug administration for emergency use authorisation for azd7442 online clothing retailer asos unveiled a board shake up alongside its annual results which showed a profit hike however the fast fashion firm warned on the year ahead amid supply chain issues and other cost pressures revenue for the financial year to august 31 jumped 20 to gbp3 91 billion as retail sales grew 19 to gbp3 78 billion while pretax profit rose 25 to gbp177 1 million however sales growth in the year ahead is expected to be in the range of 10 to 15 with interim revenue growth in mid single digits this reflects tougher comparables and industry wide supply chain pressures the company expects sales to accelerate in the second half of the year and has laid out plans to generate gbp7 billion of annual revenue over the medium term adjusted pretax profit for the 2022 financial year is expected around gbp110 million to gbp140 million this would be well below the gbp193 6 million

pod point founded in 2009 said it is one of the original electric vehicle charging providers in the uk it expects around 25 million charge points will be needed in the uk by 2040 and its outlook is

integrate de la guerra plaza and library plaza outdoor dining and events with opportunities for enjoyment of the space for all ages we have made an exciting but temporary start it is now time to carefully plan block by block so that we don t overdo and overrun what gives us our charm and appeal with careful planning and adaptive reuse of vacant spaces we can incentivize housing in the downtown core without sacrificing our mountain views and solar access there is no reason to raise building heights when the vacuous spaces left by macy s and nordstrom and sears are available and should be converted to housing or mixed use similar to alma del pueblo with affordable units available we are now using our city parking lots for community benefit projects and we likewise need to be careful in our planning for the use of these spaces once they are gone they are gone and we need to hold firm that it is the community that benefits the city needs to do our part to make it easy predictable and inexpensive to open new businesses which should not be held up by arbitrary processes this is also the time to hold property owners accountable who choose to leave their storefronts vacant there are renters to rent these spaces but rents are too high and out of line with what is offered in nearby locations property owners need to be more flexible in renting and not be holding out for years for the highest unrealistic rent these vacant storefronts are a burden on the whole community and i believe it is time for there to be a community benefit fee to property owners who are choosing to leave vacancies with property owners and the city each doing our part to expedite we can be a vibrant downtown noozhawk can you please define equity and what your approach would be to make city government more diverse and more representative of the community it represents ks equity is the recognition that not everyone is coming from an equal field of opportunity and the use of this knowledge to strive to reach an equal field of outcomes in city government this would look like equal representation on all of our boards and commissions as well as in positions of leadership this takes active recruitment and diligence in making sure that decision making bodies incorporate all who are affected by the decisions we are not there yet it is a personal commitment of mine to actively recruit diversity to our boards and commissions holding a position vacant if necessary until a representative pool of applicants is achieved it is also a personal commitment of mine to actively seek the input and direction of the local chumash community when we are designing de la guerra plaza and ortega park for instance bipoc input needs to be part of the conversation early and consistently actively seeking equity also requires celebration and visibility of our multicultural community the santa barbara trust for historic preservation this past year ran a series on asian american films neighborhood celebration and local history while the historic landmarks commission recognized the significance of local black landmarks and the importance of chicano muralism at ortega park equity requires actively seeking out the opportunities for community wide representation and visibility noozhawk how will you reduce the number of homeless encampments unhoused people and homeless related nuisance crimes in santa barbara ks for the first time in a meaningful way we are moving people from encampments to bridge housing and on to permanent supportive housing but we are far from done at the height of the pandemic cities were prohibited from relocating encampments almost as soon as that restriction was lifted santa barbara moved quickly to relocate camps in fire prone areas first to temporary and on to permanent supportive housing as we initially concentrated outreach to encampments there was temporarily an increase downtown now we need to expand the number of beds available to be able to move more people into shelter over 80 of our unhoused population are locals who grew up here or went to school here or worked here the solution is housing there are currently hundreds of vouchers in the hands of homeless residents and a lack of willingness to accept the vouchers we need to work in partnership with our housing authority to provide 100 affordable housing to the greatest number of people with services available to genuinely address root causes with state mandated restrictions in place against booking for nuisance behaviors we have to look for another way to address this issue for years there have been discussions of a restorative homeless court this is a successful model in santa maria and it would be extremely beneficial for the county to offer this opton in santa barbara in restorative court someone with an infraction can choose to enter a sobering facility or work off the infraction in some way there are consequences to illegal or nuisance behavior rather than the revolving door of the county jail and those consequences may lead to rehabilitation for several years i have advocated for the installation of a social worker at the downtown public library and just this week this position was approved and ready to go the embedded social worker will be able to bring services to the library and museum areas to where people already are this social worker can help with connecting to services and housing and getting document ready and their presence should alleviate some nuisance behaviors and we need bathrooms noozhawk how should santa barbara respond to state senate bill 9 which allows for duplex development up to four units in single family zoned neighborhoods ks as a council member i led efforts to fight sb 9 and sb 10 i pushed our council to go on record in opposition i helped convene a town hall meeting with council members and our local legislators who ended up not supporting these pieces of legislation i individually signed on with other cities who were more proactive sooner and with the l a times and other lobbyists against sb 9 and sb 10 this bill potentially quadruples densities away from our urban core and into hillsides and remote areas we do not have the infrastructure to support the water supplies or waste or hazards this much increase to density on the outskirts would call for this added density also does nothing to increase our affordable housing stock as there is no inclusionary requirement this will lead to denser neighborhoods away from our urban core at a higher cost and substantial environmental burden no thanks i believe we need to fight this overreach into our local control and overriding our careful planning of where we incentivize inclusionary housing in our downtown core noozhawk what can santa barbara do that it s not already doing to reduce climate change related hazards for its residents and move toward a more sustainable future in terms of energy and water resources ks this has been an incredible four years both in dealing with unprecedented impacts of climate change with historic drought fires debris flow rising temperatures and pandemic and with progressive actions in long range planning for sea level rise an enhanced urban water management plan our community wildfire protection plan addressing vegetation management and evacuation routes and the recent rollout of santa barbara clean energy all of which i was materially involved with i am also very proud of the city s new department of sustainability resilience with resources and staffing dedicated to meeting the ever increasing challenges of climate change related hazards in the next steps i am proposing a pilot program in developing a resilience hub at a local school this concept was born out of the montecito debris flows where an area school could be an emergency center with enough solar powered battery storage on a micro grid to be self sustaining in the event of emergency or disaster with an industrial kitchen and room for sleeping a resilience hub would also be a center for emergency information in english and spanish where families and community members can find shelter and a communication center in terms of water resources lake cachuma is already at 50 capacity following our last historic seven year drought as liaison to the water commission and board member of the cachuma operation and maintenance board as well as the cachuma conservation release board i am actively working to secure our diversified water portfolio to ensure we have enough water supply at our current population well into the future noozhawk what is the most important issue specifically in your district that you plan to address if elected ks clearly public health and safety are the most important issues specifically facing district 4 with overarching implications on so many issues the majority of district 4 is in the high fire or extreme high fire hazard zone during the thomas fire much of our district including myself had to evacuate several times and for many days our roadways are narrow and winding and sloped increasing density in these areas stresses our infrastructure and increases the risk and difficulty of evacuation this is one of the main reasons why i continue to fight sb 9 and sb 10 we are an island city bound by water and mountains with one main artery in and out as we experienced in the debris flows our island city can become quickly isolated from services and emergency response i will continue to fight to fund fire and community safety and fight overdevelopment in our fire prone district we don t have the infrastructure to support increased demands in this district aside from these protections i am committed to improvements in our parks franceschi park and others protecting open spaces and continuing to support the economic development of coast village road and downtown read all of the noozhawk questionnaires with santa barbara city

a former utility executive who lied to ratepayers and regulators costing billions of dollars after he found out a pair of nuclear reactors being built in south carolina were hopelessly behind schedule will soon be heading to prison for two years a state judge monday accepted the negotiated sentence of former scana ceo kevin marsh he is the first executive to go to prison over the project which lasted nine years and never generated a watt of power marsh has cooperated with investigators spending at least seven days talking to the fbi prosecutors said a ceo for a fortune 500 company is going to prison and is paying 5 million to the people of south carolina state attorney general alan wilson said outside the spartanburg county courtroom get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters under the agreement marsh is to report in early december to a federal prison in butner north carolina which includes a large hospital rather than a state facility he will serve the entire federal two year federal sentence south carolina circuit judge mark hayes suspended a 10 year state sentence but told marsh he will have to serve it if he does not keep cooperating or fails to successfully serve three years of probation marsh isn t the only executive facing legal problems a second former scana executive and an official at westinghouse electric co the lead contractor to build two new reactors at the v c summer plant north of columbia have also pleaded guilty a second westinghouse executive has been indicted and is awaiting trial prosecutors now are expected to turn their attention to westinghouse while marsh lied about the lack of progress in the final years of construction of the reactors westinghouse knew of the problem long before and did not tell marsh or other scana executives u s assistant attorney brook andrews said at marsh s sentencing thursday in federal court marsh s lawyer asked the judge and by extension the public to remember that this should not be the end a project like this doesn t go down the tubes because one person was involved said defense attorney robert bolchoz who compared marsh to a captain of a ship who trusted a crew working against him marsh pleaded guilty in federal court in february to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud and in state court to obtaining property by false pretenses the nuclear debacle was set up by a law passed in 2007 that allowed utilities to charge ratepayers to build power plants before they started generating power it divorced the risk from the people who were spending the money state assistant attorney general creighton waters said you won if you won and you won if you lost if the project was a failure and you abandoned it you still got to recoup that cost from customers that put a lot of responsibility on marsh as the leader of scana and he failed by keeping his mouth shut when problems mounted and collecting bonuses instead of risking his job waters said marsh made 5 million in 2017 the year the utility abandoned the hopelessly behind schedule project his plea agreement requires 5 million in restitution which has already been paid to a fund that provides help to pay electric bills of low income people the actions by marsh and other executives took more than 1 billion from the pockets of ratepayersand investors authorities said in an 87 page securities and exchange commission lawsuit filed against him and a second executive in 2020 scana and its subsidiary south carolina electric gas were destroyed by the debt and poor management and were bought out by dominion energy of virginia in 2019 state owned utility santee cooper which had a 45 stake in the project ended up saddled with 4 billion in debt even though scana controlled management of the project marsh read a brief statement in court monday similar to the one he read in federal court thursday he said not a day has gone by in the past four years where he did not regret that failure of the project i accept full responsibility marsh said i feel sorry for everything that occurred marsh s original plea deal said sentencing would wait until the investigation was over to assure his full cooperation but prosecutors relented after marsh s wife of 46 years was diagnosed with incurable breast cancer marsh never wavered from saying the two reactors being built at the v c summer site north of columbia would be finished by the end of 2020 a deadline that had to be met to receive the 1 4 billion in federal tax credits needed to keep the 10 billion project from overwhelming the utility prosecutors said marsh lied and presented rosy projections on the progress of the reactors that he knew were false in earning calls presentations and news releases to keep investors happy and pump up the company s stock price u s district judge mary geiger lewis reluctantly accepted the deal even though she felt prosecutors and marsh s lawyers made it sound like the executive made mistakes instead of intentionally misleading people for well over a year your crime was committed with a little more elegance and sophistication than many i see geiger told marsh on thursday but you don t get credit for that ___ follow jeffrey collins on twitter at
