azuka onwuka four years ago when president muhammadu buhari was inaugurated 2019 seemed like a very long time but here we are in 2019 the year of another election which will determine whether buhari will continue in office or not soon people will stop saying that buhari has spent three years in office and start saying that he has spent four years in office the arrival of 2019 reminds one of how the administration of gen ibrahim babangida spoke about year 2000 in the 1980s and 1990s as if it was light years away there were catch phrases like health for all by the year 2000 education for all by the year 2000 food for all by the year 2000 the year 2000 seemed like a magic year when so much would have been achieved by the dawn of 2000 none of those lofty dreams was achieved then vision 20 2020 was launched in after the return of democracy it was meant to make nigeria one of the first 20 economies of the world by 2020 2020 is just one year away the administration of buhari came in with many promises and high hopes it promised to crush boko haram and solve the insecurity problem in nigeria on the contrary while government spokespersons are claiming to have technically defeated boko haram the insurgents have been attacking military bases killing soldiers en masse and sacking villages in addition the herdsmen have become emboldened and dangerous sacking communities and killing people in the dozens also buhari promised to fight corruption to a standstill however corruption has continued unabated with nigeria dropping on the corruption perceptions index from 136th in 2016 to 148th position in 2017 among 180 countries there have been allegations that the fight against corruption is targeted at the opposition senator shehu sani captured it metaphorically when he said when it comes to fighting corruption in the national assembly and the judiciary and in the larger nigerian sectors the president uses insecticide but when it comes to fighting corruption within the presidency they use deodorants recent examples were in the cases of governor abdullahi ganduje of kano state who was shown on various video clips allegedly receiving bribes from contractors but while the economic and financial crimes commission feigned ignorance of that the same agency was celebrating how it would arrest mr ayo fayose of ekiti state a member of the opposition party upon his exit from office similarly since june 2018 when the west african examination council had confirmed that the secondary school certificate of mr okoi obono obla who is the senior special assistant to the president on prosecutions was doctored the president has kept quiet about it pretending that he is not aware of it as his aides are wont to say in contrast the opposition candidate in the governorship election in osun state senator ademola adeleke has been facing prosecution over his secondary school credentials the consequence is that even those who are genuinely involved in corrupt practices are being seen as being victimised because of their political leaning that has placed a question mark on the entire fight against corruption before the 2015 elections buhari and his party complained about the economy and the exchange rate of the naira they complained about the high pump price of petrol at n87 per litre as well as the petrol subsidy which they described as fake and fraudulent four years into governance the nigerian economy has experienced a big blow the economy went into recession in august 2016 and has been struggling since then about 10 million jobs have been lost trillions of naira have been lost at the stock market poverty rate has risen with 90 million nigerians said to be in extreme poverty by the end of 2018 the nigerian currency rose from an exchange rate of about n200 to an american dollar to about n500 in early 2017 before falling to about n360 per dollar inflation also rose to over 18 per cent before dropping to above 11 per cent one year into his administration buhari surprised nigerians with an increase in the pump price of petrol rather than the promised reduction to n40 per litre the price of petrol was increased from n87 to n145 per litre with the excuse that such a move would eliminate any subsidy there was also a surprise package on the fuel subsidy issue rather than being completely removed the amount given out in fuel subsidy has continued to increase similarly nigeria s debt profile has continued to rise the experience of buhari in power has justified the statement of mario cuomo that one campaigns in poetry but governs in prose the difference between promise and reality has been too wide in his administration however the biggest challenge facing the buhari administration is organising the 2019 elections the standard of that election will determine where buhari will be placed in the nigerian history of elections in 2003 2007 and 2011 buhari was a contestant in the elections he complained bitterly on all those three occasions that the elections were not transparent and credible in the company with some opposition politicians he demonstrated on the streets of abuja the federal capital territory against the quality of election conducted under the presidency of chief olusegun obasanjo in 2015 he defeated the incumbent dr goodluck jonathan of the pdp to become the president of nigeria which was the first time such had happened in the country the challenge now is whether buhari will superintend over a free and fair election and also allow a result that does not favour him to be announced also will buhari concede defeat if the result does not favour him the hallmark of the advanced democracies in the world is the fact that the incumbent has no influence over the elections as well as no advantage over other contestants that points to the true independence of the electoral body even though nigeria s electoral body has a name that starts with independent it is not independent the incumbent president appoints the chairman of the independent national electoral commission and all its commissioners he also appoints the heads of all the security agencies that provide security on the day of the election incumbent presidents have influenced the decisions of inec in the past on federal elections and state elections the recent elections conducted in ekiti and osun states were adjudged to be below standard therefore there is no high hope that the 2019 elections that will determine the fate of buhari as nigeria s president will be of sterling standard it is only buhari that can determine the quality of the 2019 elections but it is dangerous for a nation to hang its electoral hope on the whims and caprices of a leader it is better to have a system that protects everybody than to hope on the good heartedness of a leader the speed with which 2019 has arrived has reminded us again that time does not just fly it waits for nobody twitter brandazuka copyright punch all rights reserved

an impasse over the federal budget reaches a stalemate the president and congress both refuse to back down triggering a near total government shutdown the president declares emergency powers congress rescinds his authority dollar and bond prices plummet the president threatens to stop social security checks congress refuses to raise the debt ceiling default looms wall street panics the fourth turning strauss howe strauss and howe wrote their book in 1996 they were not trying to be prophets of doom but observers of history able to connect events through human life cycles of 80 or so years using critical thinking skills and identifying the most likely triggers for crisis debt civic decay and global disorder they were able to anticipate scenarios which could drive the next crisis which they warned would arrive in the mid 2000 decade the scenario described above is fairly close to the current situation driven by the showdown between trump and the democrats regarding the border wall it has not reached the stage where all hell breaks loose but if it extends until the end of january and food stamp money is not distributed to 40 million people mostly in urban ghettos all bets are off the likelihood of this scenario is small but there are numerous potential triggers which could still make 2019 go down in history as a year to remember as we enter the eleventh year of this fourth turning the fourth crisis period in u s history the mood of u s citizens and citizens around the globe continues to darken fourth turnings are driven by generational configuration and the emotional reaction to events by the prophet generation leaders nomad generation spearheads and hero generation cannon fodder as we close out this year stock markets are gyrating wildly central bankers are trying to reverse their nine years of interventionist strategies to sustain the establishment civil chaos spreads across the european continent saber rattling between the u s russia and china increases the animosity between political parties reaches new heights the deep state relentlessly pursues their mueller led coup against trump mega social media corporations tighten their grip on free speech by silencing conservatives leftists push their socialist open borders normalizing degeneracy agenda and global recession gains momentum as trade declines and global debt reaches unserviceable levels examining the three prior fourth turnings may give us a window into where we stand and what may happen in the coming year we are in the tenth year of this crisis with the eleven year anniversary slated for september 2019 the american revolution crisis was catalyzed in 1773 when the boston tea party forever changed the colonial mood towards revolution after eight years of struggle and desperate measures the climax was reached with the surrender of cornwallis at yorktown in 1781 but there was still thirteen more years of crisis as the new states forged a constitution elected washington its first president and he withstood the jacobins put down the whiskey rebellion and finalized a treaty with england in year ten of the crisis two years past the climax the treaty of paris was signed british troops left the continent and washington resigned as commander of american troops the articles of confederation had been ratified in 1781 and remained in place until succeeded by the u s constitution in 1789 there was no tenth or eleventh year of the civil war crisis lincoln s election with only 40 of the popular vote prompting the attack on fort sumpter and subsequent secession of southern states triggered the bloodiest conflict in world history with 8 of all white men aged 13 to 43 killed in the war including 6 in the north and 18 in the south the acceleration of this fourth turning into a five year window from 1860 to 1865 was not a positive development the extreme intensity of the conflict resulted in 700 000 tragic deaths the catalyst occurred five years too soon and the resolution a generation too soon a more extended crisis may have allowed tempers to moderate and the conflict to end in a more constructive manner instead with the surrender at appomattox and assassination of lincoln the resolution felt more like a defeat than a victory turmoil continued for at least a decade after the resolution the great depression world war ii crisis saw its tenth and eleventh years as the most ominous dangerous and destructive for great britain as they bore the brunt of the german onslaught 1939 saw the nazi invasion of poland and the official start of world war ii in may of 1940 germany launched its blitzkrieg offensive through holland and belgium defeating the french and british forces in a matter of weeks chamberlain resigned as prime minister replaced by churchill as france surrendered in late june the battle of britain raged from july through october as hitler relentlessly bombed england trying to force their surrender germany italy and japan signed the tripartite pact in september setting the stage for the u s eventual participation in the war einstein informed fdr of the potential for an atomic bomb during 1939 and the manhattan project was born the climax of the crisis occurred with the successful d day invasion the dropping of two atomic bombs on japan and successful demobilization of military forces marked the end of the crisis history may not repeat but human nature never changes so the 80 year cycles of manmade crisis will repeat the length of time from the american revolution climax in 1781 until the civil war climax in 1863 was 82 years the next climax in 1944 was 81 years after the civil war climax therefore we can expect a climax to this current crisis sometime in the 2025 range the question is what events will transpire between 2019 and 2025 before a climax is reached based upon history the resolution will not be based on compromise civility reason or peaceful means the combustible combination of unpayable debt civic anarchy and global chaos are set to detonate creating an era of maximum darkness death destruction and decisions making america great again will require personal sacrifice dreadful choices survival skills intelligent decisions and the courage to win at all costs the first ten years of this crisis were the early winter solstice period when public order began to pass its nadir the coldest days of winter beckon with the harshest years of the crisis ahead many melancholy days lie ahead as bitter winter winds and blizzard like conditions sweep the bleak landscape testing the mettle of even the bravest souls the catalyst for the crisis was the wall street created global financial meltdown in 2008 the election of trump marked the beginning of the regeneracy with trump as the gray champion the last two years have certainly marked a new more volatile phase of this crisis setting the stage for the fireworks to come the regeneracy is less like fdr s new deal initiated unification of the country and more like the lincoln regeneracy after the first battle of bull run when he ordered the enlistment of a half million men to fight a like number of fellow american men both american factions were unified in their cause the chain reaction of emergencies and unyielding responses will continue unabated until a final resolution is achieved in retrospect the spark might seem as ominous as a financial crash as ordinary as a national election or as trivial as a tea party the catalyst will unfold according to a basic crisis dynamic that underlies all of these scenarios an initial spark will trigger a chain reaction of unyielding responses and further emergencies the core elements of these scenarios debt civic decay global disorder will matter more than the details which the catalyst will juxtapose and connect in some unknowable way if foreign societies are also entering a fourth turning this could accelerate the chain reaction at home and abroad these events will reflect the tearing of the civic fabric at points of extreme vulnerability problem areas where america will have neglected denied or delayed needed action the fourth turning strauss howe strauss and howe foresaw the core elements which would surely propel the next fourth turning they were plain to see for people who chose to see the world with eyes wide open debt civic decay and global disorder are on center stage as we enter the fateful year of 2019 a madness seems to be gripping the nation a melancholy realization all is not right everything has a chaotic feel as financial markets are falling politicians threaten and attack each other government dysfunction is laid bare for all to see deep state snakes slither behind the scenes trying to bring down trump racial tensions grow foreign governments topple russia and china challenge u s hegemony and the global debt ponzi scheme is entering its collapse phase there are no moderates only pro trump and anti trump factions compromise and workable solutions to our deep seated problems are off the table the mood of the populace ranges from frustrated and angry to depressed and stressed the aroma of conflict wafts through the air as battle lines are being drawn the initial spark of a global financial meltdown created by greedy wall street banks the feckless fed and corrupt government officials was driven by bad debt outright control fraud by the financial industry captured rating agencies easy money provided by the wall street owned fed and utter contempt for properly regulating the wall street cabal by the fed and sec this emergency was met by an unyielding response from the establishment with the easiest money policies in world history bailing out criminal bankers with taxpayer funds increasing global debt by 80 trillion to 250 trillion 318 of global gdp running fiscal deficits exceeding 1 trillion per year and pretending all that debt will be repaid pretend and extend has been the solution the deep state has taken extraordinary measures to try and retain their stranglehold on the wealth of the nation and control of the political financial social and media levers of society they have utilized a combination of propaganda disguised as news social media distractions technological surveillance misinformation campaigns welfare to keep the poor sedated and the continued issuance of debt to keep the masses satiated with consumer goods as their wealth dissipates but the teetering edifice of debt delusion and deception is poised to topple in 2019 as we enter 2019 year eleven of this ongoing crisis you can sense the panic and distress permeating from the pores of the establishment figures and their rich shadowy benefactors trying to maintain their unseen presence behind the curtain as they pull the strings operating as the invisible government running the show for their own benefit it seems the unanticipated election of trump has thrown a monkey wrench into their well oiled pillage machine forcing them to reveal themselves as they attempt a not so subtle coup against a sitting president fourth turnings always sweep away the existing social order in a torrent of violent upheaval and the blood of young men but that doesn t mean the existing establishment will give up their wealth power and control without a fight and the fight is underway the volcano has erupted and the molten lava could flow in numerous pathways over the next six or so years imagine some national and probably global volcanic eruption initially flowing along channels of distress that were created during the unraveling era and further widened by the catalyst trying to foresee where the eruption will go once it bursts free of the channels is like trying to predict the exact fault line of an earthquake all you know in advance is something about the molten ingredients of the climax which could include the following economic distress with public debt in default entitlement trust funds in bankruptcy mounting poverty and unemployment trade wars collapsing financial markets and hyperinflation or deflation social distress with violence fueled by class race nativism or religion and abetted by armed gangs underground militias and mercenaries hired by walled communities political distress with institutional collapse open tax revolts one party hegemony major constitutional change secessionism authoritarianism and altered national borders military distress with war against terrorists or foreign regimes equipped with weapons of mass destruction the fourth turning strauss howe the ingredients of distress in the next phase of this crisis could include any or all of those pondered by strauss and howe twenty two years ago i can make the case for multiple levels of distress breaking free from their channels making 2019 as historic a year as 1939 or 1940 my prognosis for 2019 follows economic distress economic distress is mounting as the machinations of the fed wall street and the u s government prove to be nothing more than debt financed illusions once the easy money spigot is turned off and the tide of zero interest debt for wall street and mega corporations recedes you realize everyone was swimming naked the national debt grew by 1 4 trillion in 2018 during the best economy ever according to trump we added 12 trillion to the national debt and have generated a historically weak recovery especially for the working class we ve gone nine years without recession and the longest period in u s history between recessions was ten years without the tax cut stimulus interest rates higher corporate profits flagging global trade waning and central bankers withdrawing liquidity recession is likely in 2019 driving deficits towards 2 trillion the number of zombie companies ge sears jc penney chesapeake all fracking companies propped up by cheap junk bond debt is astronomical national debt default is still a ways off but a tsunami of corporate debt defaults will inundate the economy once the recession knocks the legs out from beneath this faux recovery corporations and consumers have never been more indebted stock valuations have never been higher an economy that begins to self destruct when interest rates approach 3 proves the solutions implemented by those in power did nothing for the average american while further enriching the parasitical class pulling the strings at this point a specific triggering event is unnecessary to provoke the economic conflagration the unbearable weight of unpayable debt is going to cause the structure to collapse at free fall speed like the twin towers pancaking everyone in the floors below with a recession inevitable in 2019 we know the stock market declines 30 to 40 during recessions on average when a stock market is this overvalued based solely on fed easy money and corporate buybacks apple has lost 9 billion on their buybacks this year the withdrawal of liquidity combined with recession and declining profits will knock 50 to 60 off current prices i wonder how many middle class 401k contributors expect this to happen well this will be the third time in 18 years so you would think they d learn by now recession means job losses consumer debt defaults less tax revenue for the government more wasteful spending by politicians pretending to care soaring deficits currency gyrations and the potential for rising interest rates as no one will be willing or able to buy the newly issued debt will we have massive deflation or hyperinflation anything is possible in a collapse scenario what is certain will be millions of angry americans looking for someone to blame and politicians seeking to distract them with some foreign threat to their safety and security this is when trade wars morph into real wars social distress the social distress sweeping the country gets the majority of attention on the left wing corporate media propaganda machines as they purposely fan the flames of divisiveness keeping the sheeple angry at each other keeps them distracted from the continued pillaging of the national wealth by the deep state scum operating in plain sight the daily war against the normals has reached new heights of hypocrisy and idiocy the unceasing mantra of diversity trying to normalize the lifestyles of the mentally ill glorifying socialism as venezuela implodes due to socialism promoting the climate change agenda to abscond with more taxes and trying to force left wing agendas down the throats of white traditional family oriented people is on the verge of starting civil violence as we are witnessing in france the ruling class has gone too far in accumulating the wealth of the nation through the capture of regulatory political financial and communication structures wealth inequality arisen through fraud deception and corruption will lead to class warfare likely after the next financial collapse the current government shutdown over funding for a border wall is essentially a showdown over the racial makeup of the country and allowing unfettered access to welfare benefits to illegal invaders who will loyally illegally vote for their democrat benefactors for eternity racial politics is what has kept blacks enslaved on the welfare plantation in decaying urban ghettos run by democrat politician plantation owners a black uprising led by kanye west has struck fear into the hearts of democrats giving them further incentive to keeping the southern border open to new democrat voters with gun grabbing liberal politicians attempting to disarm the deplorables in flyover country while supporting antifa and black lives matter terrorists and thwarting efforts to keep criminals and terrorists from illegally entering the country a violent showdown is inevitable political distress the political distress since the 2016 election has reached levels not seen since the civil war crisis period the deep state controllers next hand picked figurehead president hillary clinton inexplicably lost the election to a nyc reality star real estate mogul who boasted about grabbing pussies and had a weakness for strippers and playboy bunnies clinton s arrogance and hubris were her downfall as the deplorables she ridiculed and a majority of white women in the country gave trump a slim victory and drove millions of pussy hat wearing feminazis into a rage college students across the land sobbed in their safe spaces and missed their queer theory or pick your gender classes but not only were snowflakes across the land melting but the surveillance state spooks who attempted to rig the election in clinton s favor went into a frenzy as fear of their traitorous machinations being revealed forced them to begin a coup attempt against trump the mueller comey clapper brennan obama clinton reactive coup attempt is ongoing and will come to a head in 2019 the outcome of this epic struggle between the deep state and the non approved upstart president could create civil war like conditions how will trump supporters react if they believe their leader is removed through impeachment based on false charges will they take to the streets in armed insurrection will the police and military fire on their fellow citizens what if trump refuses to step down creating a constitutional crisis what if he is assassinated on the other hand what if trump s allies within the doj and military present evidence of collusion against the obama administration clinton and top officials in the fbi doj and cia how would the left wingers react to military tribunals with their beloved leaders in the docket even if these earth shattering events don t come to fruition a democrat controlled house will thwart everything trump attempts to accomplish as they position themselves for the 2020 presidential election the anger and disillusionment of the masses will deepen military distress the potential for catastrophe on the military front hasn t been higher in decades the linear thinking lemmings dismiss the possibility of a global conflict because they are just as obtuse as experts before them throughout history since world war ii we have only experienced proxy wars where the outcomes would not change the course of world history there have been no total wars where the loser is utterly shattered and complete victory is attained those who practice revisionist history act as if the previous two fourth turning total wars were completely predictable before they began in 1858 no one believed a civil war taking the lives of 700 000 americans was just over the horizon exactly 80 years later in 1938 few believed a global conflict which would kill 65 million people in six years was imminent here we are exactly 80 years later and anyone predicting a global conflagration killing millions is declared a loon every previous fourth turning has ended in total war with victory of the good guys always in doubt every total war has ratcheted up the level of death and destruction as technological advancements enhance our war making abilities human nature does not change we are not smarter less war like more humanitarian or less arrogant than our predecessors throughout history hubris power and miscalculation by egomaniacal leaders leads to war we know the climax of this fourth turning is slated for around 2025 this infers a high likelihood of a major war involving the u s in the foreseeable future will it ignite in 2019 all the combustible elements are present the onset of a global depression trade wars china russia feeling pushed into a corner and the volatile political situation in the u s and eu provide a potential pathway to global conflict economic indicators from china show the slowest economic growth in a quarter century their natives are restless plunging oil prices will throw the russian economy into recession the eu economies led by germany are seizing up with the slowdown in global trade japan has essentially been in recession since the 1990s the u s is poised for a recession in 2019 immigration chaos in europe brexit ukrainian nazis provoking russia south china sea territorial disputes the syria turkey iran israel ticking time bomb saudi anarchy socialist south american regimes imploding and u s political pandemonium have created a perfect storm of domestic and international disasters what do low life politicians do when faced with terrible domestic issues they seek to distract their citizens with a foreign threat see blame russia for everything as an example of this tried and true propaganda technique desperate politicians do desperate things to retain power desperate deep state actors care not one wit for their fellow countrymen they are willing and able to sacrifice the youth of their nation to fight wars which will further enrich themselves and their fellow traitorous benefactors we are nothing but cannon fodder to this psychopathic scum putin and xi are essentially dictators who have no fear of elections every two years they are serious men in possession of nuclear missiles capable of destroying the world blaming them for all the ills in your own country is a fool hardy tactic the ever increasing saber rattling whether in the ukraine syria south china sea or during antagonistic trade negotiations can easily lead to unintended consequences all leaders have enormous egos and are prone to over confidence and miscalculation regarding how their opponent will react someone is going to do something stupid and then all hell is going to break loose no escape the risk of catastrophe will be very high the nation could erupt into insurrection or civil violence crack up geographically or succumb to authoritarian rule if there is a war it is likely to be one of maximum risk and effort in other words a total war every fourth turning has registered an upward ratchet in the technology of destruction and in mankind s willingness to use it history offers no guarantees obviously things could go horribly wrong the possibilities ranging from a nuclear exchange to incurable plagues from terrorist anarchy to high tech dictatorship we should not assume that providence will always exempt our nation from the irreversible tragedies that have overtaken so many others not just temporary hardship but debasement and total ruin losing in the next fourth turning could mean something incomparably worse it could mean a lasting defeat from which our national innocence perhaps even our nation might never recover strauss howe the fourth turning there is no escape from the fourth turning we are midway through this crisis and the existing social order retains tenuous control over the levers of finance government and the legacy media history tells us our society will be reshaped and transformed before this crisis resolves itself sometime between now and 2029 it would be the utmost of arrogance to believe our nation will be protected from destruction by an all powerful god we ve made bad choices deferred hard decisions squandered our financial resources allowed our educational system to be corrupted and valued all the wrong things there will be consequences the overt last ditch financial debt schemes concocted by the entrenched establishment to prolong their power and control are unraveling and a death and rebirth of the social order through a chaotic cleansing is in the offing i believe the real fireworks will begin during 2019 i don t eagerly await the terrible storms headed our way i wish we didn t have to withstand the brutal gales of this coming winter but we have no choice you have to survive winter to experience the blossoming spring the coming decade will try our souls and force everyone to make choices that will make a difference the specific events are unknowable but how we react and who we support during the events will be the decisive factor in whether this fourth turning is resolved in a positive way having it resolved in negative way could be an unimaginable tragedy patrick henry made his famous give me liberty or give me death speech during the first american fourth turning his words ring true today we are already at war sides have been drawn we are going to have to fight whether we like it or not our only other choice is chains and slavery the time to choose has arrived welcome to 2019 the war is actually begun the next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms our brethren are already in the field why stand we here idle what is it that gentlemen wish what would they have is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it almighty god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death patrick

this is the first column for the new year of 2019 and i hope everyone had some enjoyable and relaxing holiday time with your families friends and significant others and hoping that your new year in 2019 will be healthier happier and more prosperous based on the current demand purchasers are still out there this winter looking and searching for that perfect white picket fence of a dream home but let s be realistic finding that letter perfect home is getting much harder these days due to our still very outrageously low inventory that is slowly increasing especially below one million dollars the demand in that segment of the market is still quite strong and healthy assuming sellers have priced their homes correctly i still see overpricing where the sellers and their agents are just tailgating the market and aren t where the current pricing structure has been trending again i am not saying that the market isn t crashing but is softening and making downward adjustments for the reasons of higher interest rates and that maximum allowable 10 000 state and local tax deduction and also the increase in real estate taxes for about 30 percent of nassau residents for the 2019 2020 tax year with the craziness of the stock market worst december since the great depression many more people have cashed out staying in cash for the moment people appear to be very nervous but maybe some of the smart and shrewd ones are still putting their money where their mouth is jumping right back into the market looking at the 1000 gain in the dow on thursday dec 27 buying on the downside appears to be a safe path to take but we ll see how this progresses going into 2019 however it s an amazing time to take some of the cash and instead of the stock market how about putting a down payment on your first home investment or vacation pied a terre my son is purchasing his 3rd property an investment out in southold if it was located in nassau it would be at least double in price but his idea is to rent it out one to three months or more per year and to pay all his expenses as his mortgage will be paid down in the long run there is nothing more secure than being able to touch and feel your real estate whereby the stock market being as volatile as it is lately one has very little control over it since the majority of us are tiny little fish in the huge pond but owning real estate has mostly positive attributes and potential losses are not as dramatic in the short run as investing in the stock market the learning curve of investing in real estate to me is a much more pragmatic and logical entity whereby stock investments over the last 20 to 30 years has been a very emotional environment and many times logic has been thrown out the door but holding the long term will always make you a winner if you invest carefully look at the current economy interest rates historically still very low our unemployment rate the lowest since 1969 and everything appears to look fantastic right unfortunately the word uncertainty steps into the arena of investing and with the partial shutdown of our u s government trade wars still unsettled and pending issues with our southern borders gm closing plants and laying off thousands of workers terrorist attacks around the globe you have to wonder where is the good news it s there on page 5 buying your primary residence investing in quality real estate and or fixing and flipping properties is what i call a much safer path to pursue if you are not a stock picker or well versed in the stock market hopefully things will settle down in 2019 but now is the time to strike while the coals are hot and beg borrow and steal from whomever only kidding to secure some real estate the dream is still alive and well especially with millennials and other groups who still feel owning a home is pursuable and still part of the american dream there is a superb article by patrick sisson for the urban land institute about the top 10 emerging trends that will influence and shape real estate in 2019 you have some choices and you can look at the world two different ways either with fear fanaticized expectations appearing real or face every day and rise being positive and believing things will always get better and improve is a mindset that only a few practice and believe wholeheartedly in the concept while everyone else heads for the hills because the doom and gloom scenario is the easiest path to take as human beings when things get tough the tough get going and dig in for the long haul nothing can stop the man or woman

the new executive chairman of the alfred e mann foundation for scientific research sees the foundation continuing its mission of developing devices for unmet medical needs the foundation for the first time is also inviting outside companies to use its resources founded in 1985 the valencia calif based foundation has launched several innovative companies including second sight medical products nsdq eyes which makes devices for the visually impaired cochlear implant manufacturer advanced bionics now a subsidiary of sonova holding ag six soon and minimed developer of a hybrid closed loop insulin delivery system now part of medtronic nyse mdt it was essentially an incubator before the term incubator even existed said dr robert greenberg who took over as executive chairman in june 2018 after serving as non executive chairman since 2004 john petrovich leads amf as its ceo this infrastructure of laboratory space and technical talent and equipment and expertise regulatory and quality in the manufacturing of these devices the core expertise ended up being leveraged each time a new company was developed a lot of that built up knowledge has really benefited each new startup greenberg said devicetalks returns june 5 6 2019 in boston now co located with the robotics summit expo greenberg was ceo and chairman of second sight from its inception in 1998 through 2015 second sight developed and marketed an implantable retinal prosthesis the argus ii to restore useful vision to patients blinded by retinitis pigmentosa greenberg also oversaw the successful development and human implantation of a wireless cortical visual prosthesis the orion which the company says has the potential to eliminate nearly all forms of blindness every project the foundation undertakes must be designed for a high unmet medical need either to help a large number of people or to provide a high impact for a small group of people such as amputees deciding which projects to take on remains one of its biggest challenges we look at ip what patents we might have or might be able to license as well as freedom to operate greenberg said we ll look at market size reimbursement team ability to access folks with expertise in the area all the factors that you would look at for a startup in his new role greenberg has encouraged incubating local companies in addition to internal projects he likes to think about the foundation as a research institution with a commercialization focus greenberg shares the belief of the foundation s founder the late al mann that unless the products actually make it to a company they won t benefit patients one of the realizations that i had about a year ago was that this infrastructure can be super helpful to startups that might only have half a dozen people he said we started working with local companies providing them access to the labs to the personnel and to the infrastructure in general as far as picking those companies our criteria are similar to picking our own internal projects they include bivacor a houston texas startup that is developing a completely artificial heart using two centrifugal impellers placed on a single rotor to provide perfusion to the left and right sides of the body the device uses magnetic levitation to provide precise stable operation with no mechanical wear it is currently being tested in animal trials although our ultimate goal is to help these individuals and patients with these various diseases we feel really strongly that these products ultimately need to find a home in a company so that they can be distributed for the benefit of patients greenberg said the foundation s financial resources and accumulated knowledge enable it to stick with projects for the long term and allow the companies it develops to be more capital efficient and to make fewer mistakes greenberg said mann was a leader in the aerospace industry when he made a donation to johns hopkins university s applied physics laboratory to develop a rechargeable pacemaker in 1968 the following year at the university s request mann took over the product s development co founding pacesetter systems with johns hopkins researcher robert fischell pacesetter was purchased by siemens in 1985 and later by st jude medical and mann used some of the proceeds to start the foundation to convert university based research into products that filled unmet and poorly met medical needs a more recent foundation based startup axonics modulation technologies nsdq axnx went public in october raising 138 million in its ipo the irvine calif based company is developing novel implantable sacral nerve neuromodulation tech to treat patients with urinary and bowel dysfunction disorders with hopes that the platform will be expandable into other clinical indications in the future axonics r snm device won ce mark approval in the european union in june 2016 an external trial module won an fda nod in july 2017 it s approved for market in canada and australia and expects to file a pre market approval bid with the fda during the first quarter of 2019 now the foundation is working on an implantable myoelectric ime sensor a matchstick sized device designed to transmit electrochemical signals from muscles in the residual limb of an amputee to intuitively move a prosthesis a controller interprets the signals and commands the prosthesis to perform a particular movement such as opening and closing the hand rotating the wrist 360 degrees and laterally moving the thumb combining these three movements enables several grasps that are invaluable for performing everyday tasks according to the foundation veterans at the walter reed national military medical center are participating in a clinical trial of the sensor and the foundation expects to transfer the technology to a corporation in 2019 greenberg said i think medtech is one of the most exciting areas that you can go into in engineering in general greenberg said we re looking a lot more at digital health solutions we re looking at how artificial intelligence and data can play a role in medical devices it s something that historically we had a lot of implants that were generating data but we weren t necessarily using that data we re spending a lot more time now looking at particularly with our implants we re thinking a lot more about the data and how that can be leveraged for the benefit of patients
there are different theories on being effective but she believes in picking issues that are super popular and forging coalitions to win on those issues cnn massachusetts sen elizabeth warren took a major step toward a presidential run on monday announcing in a video message and email to supporters that she is forming an exploratory committee ahead of an expected campaign for the democratic nomination in 2020 with her announcement 13 months before the iowa caucuses warren who became a progressive star by taking on wall street after the 2007 financial crisis and more recently president donald trump is the first democrat with a national profile to take formal action ahead of an anticipated presidential campaign in a four and a half minute video warren made clear she would not shy away from the pugilistic tone and themes that catapulted her to national prominence in her upcoming presidential run economic equality government accountability and the reining in of big corporations corruption is poisoning our democracy warren says in the video as images of republican leaders flash across the screen politicians look the other way while big insurance companies deny patients life saving coverage while big banks rip off consumers and while big oil companies destroy this planet the clip begins with the senator recalling a hardscrabble childhood in oklahoma her mother got a minimum wage job after her father suffered a heart attack he would eventually work as a janitor he raised a daughter who got to be a public school teacher a law professor and a senator we got a real opportunity to build something warren says working families today face a lot tougher path than my family did in one of multiple nods in the video to racial inequality she adds that families of color face a path that is steeper and rockier a path made even harder by the impact of generations of discrimination an early acknowledgment of the political importance of appealing to and winning the support of minority voters as she warns of a deepening crisis faced by the american middle class warren points a finger squarely at the republican party using images of former presidents ronald reagan and george w bush along with grinning cameos from treasury secretary steven mnuchin departing house speaker paul ryan senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and trump warren is a searing critic of the president and trump has responded by openly mocking her native american heritage and referring to her as pocahontas her decision in october to respond to trump and other critics by releasing the results of a dna test aimed at proving her ancestry fell flat with many democrats and overshadowed her midterm message the announcement also comes in the midst of a prolonged partial government shutdown over trump s insistence on funding for a border wall which has caused political chaos that has spooked investors and sparked turmoil in the stock market this backdrop could prove to be a boon for warren who is widely expected to build a campaign centered around her signature economic populist message and anti corruption platform by launching an exploratory committee warren can begin raising money for the coming campaign despite swearing off corporate pac money she enters the 2020 cycle with 12 5 million left over from her 2018 senate campaign according to federal election commission records warren can transfer that money into her presidential coffers speaking to reporters on monday warren suggested she was unlikely to seek the assistance of a big money outside group i don t think we ought to be running campaigns that are funded by billionaires whether it goes through super pacs or their own money that they re spending she said democrats are the party of the people and the way we make that clear is we join together and we fund our campaigns we make our campaigns work through the people warren added i ve already received donations from all 50 states the district of columbia and puerto rico that s how you build a grassroots campaign that s what i believe a source close to warren has said the timing of monday s announcement on new year s eve when most people aren t plugged into the news had more to do with a need to build an apparatus by identifying and hiring staff than influencing other contenders plans but some democratic operatives are skeptical and one fundraiser suggested the warren team might be hoping that a hefty day one haul made public in early 2019 could cause potential rivals to reconsider their options it s a gamble that folks will give a ton of small money today the democrat said rufus gifford former president barack obama s 2012 campaign finance director made the same point in a tweet elizabeth warren must think she can put up huge numbers on her january report scaring others out of the race he wrote only reason i can figure you d launch a presidential campaign on new year s eve even before monday s notifications went out the work of building the infrastructure to support a presidential bid had been well underway since her re election to the senate in november warren has made hundreds of calls to political grassroots leaders in the early states of iowa new hampshire south carolina and nevada the source said she is expected to hit the campaign trail later this week if no votes are scheduled to end the government shutdown warren s staff members are also having discussions with operatives in those states and are in the process of searching for campaign office space in the boston area the expected location of her presidential campaign headquarters dan geldon warren s longtime aide who served as her chief of staff in the senate and was once the senator s student at harvard law school is likely to serve a senior role in the eventual warren campaign the source said more than a year out from the first round of voting and with months to go until the first debate the coming democratic primary is already shaping up to be one of the most fierce and feisty nominating contests in a generation warren s work to establish and defend the consumer financial protection bureau or cfpb made her a star among progressives who first pushed for what would be a successful 2012 senate run and then with less luck a presidential bid she ultimately passed up four years later this time around the large democratic field is expected to include multiple candidates touting progressive platforms a reality that underscores her influence within the party but could also complicate her path to its nomination some two dozen candidates are said to have shown interest in a 2020 bid warren s national profile which traces back to her work as a watchdog following the 2008 bank bailouts immediately places her among the favorites alongside former vice president joe biden vermont sen bernie sanders and rising star beto o rourke the departing texas congressman who just lost a bid for the us senate a cnn des moines register mediacom survey earlier this month of likely iowa caucusgoers found warren with 8 support trailing biden 32 sanders 19 and o rourke 11 numbers broadly consistent with other early national polling warren welcomed the coming fight during her remarks on monday and in particular the potential for a crowded field of progressive hopefuls i think it s great that we have a strong and growing group of democrats who are making these arguments who are fighting these fights she said that s how we build a movement we do it together warren s decision to more formally begin the process comes less than a month after the editorial board for her hometown newspaper the boston globe ruffled progressive feathers by suggesting she consider abandoning a potential run warren missed her moment in 2016 and there s reason to be skeptical of her prospective candidacy in 2020 the board wrote in early december citing a poll from september 2018 that put former massachusetts gov deval patrick a democrat who has since ruled out a presidential run this cycle ahead of warren it also suggested she had become too much of a divisive figure an apparent reference to the heavily publicized dna test it confirmed warren had distant native american ancestry but was met with backlash from some tribal leaders activists and outspoken democrats who fretted over whether warren had played into trump s

statement but any early missteps or even disappointing polling are unlikely to dampen excitement among the party s increasingly influential progressive bloc elizabeth warren on a visceral level is

by voxeu org unlike income inequality wealth inequality along racial lines in the us has received relatively little attention this column presents new evidence on the changing landscape of relative wealth among whites blacks and hispanics between 1983 and 2016 using an augmented measure of wealth it highlights how cuts to social security will disproportionately affect minorities by edward wolff while many studies have documented the wide disparity in income between whites on the one hand and african americans and hispanics on the other the gap in wealth is even greater in seminal work on the subject oliver and shapiro 1995 document and analyse the sources of the wealth differences between blacks and whites and discuss some of the deleterious effects of low wealth on the wellbeing of black families including access to decent housing and education poor health lower longevity and the like the racial disparity in standard wealth holdings in the us after fluctuating over the years 1983 to 2007 was almost exactly the same in 2007 as in 1983 with a ratio of mean wealth between the two groups of 0 19 see wolff 2017 and 2018 for more details median net worth among black as well as hispanic households was close to zero over the whole time period as were the ratios of median wealth between minority and white households however the great recession from 2007 to 2010 hit african american households much harder than whites and the ratio of mean wealth between the two groups plunged from 0 19 in 2007 to 0 14 in 2010 see figure 1 indeed the mean wealth of black households suffered a 33 decline in real terms see figure 2 white wealth in contrast declined by 12 the relative and absolute losses suffered by black households from 2007 to 2010 are to a large extent ascribable to the fact that blacks had a higher share of homes in their portfolio than did whites and a much higher debt net worth ratio 0 55 versus 0 15 these factors led to a wide disparity in annual real rates of return on their respective portfolios 9 92 versus 7 07 between 2010 and 2016 there was no change in the racial wealth gap figure 1 ratio of mean net worth by race and ethnicity 1983 2016 figure 2 mean net worth by race and ethnicity 1983 2016 1000s of 2016 dollars hispanic households made sizeable gains on whites from 1983 to 2007 the ratio of standard mean net worth grew from 0 16 to 0 26 the hispanic homeownership rate climbed from 33 to 49 and the ratio of homeownership rates with white households advanced from 48 to 66 however in a reversal of fortunes hispanic households got hammered in the years 2007 to 2010 with their mean net worth plunging in half the wealth ratio falling from 0 26 to 0 15 their homeownership rate down by 1 9 and their net home equity plummeting by 47 the relative and absolute losses suffered by hispanic households over these three years were also mainly due to the much larger share of homes in their wealth portfolio and their much higher leverage a debt net worth ratio of 0 51 versus 0 15 these factors led to a large difference in real returns over the years 2007 to 2010 10 76 versus 7 07 per year unlike black households there was a rebound in hispanic wealth from 2010 to 2016 and the ethnic wealth ratio went up from 0 15 to 0 19 though still well below its 2007 peak differential leverage and the resulting differences in rates of return on net worth played major roles in accounting for the relative collapse of the wealth of minorities over the great recession the high positive rate of return among black households explained about three quarters of the advance of their wealth from 2001 to 2007 while the negative return accounted for 78 of the ensuing collapse from 2007 to 2010 among hispanics it accounted for 59 of the gain in the first period and 57 of the drop in the second racial differentials in returns accounted for 43 of the relative wealth gain of black households from 2001 to 2007 and 39 of decline from 2007 to 2010 disparities in returns played a somewhat smaller role in explaining changes in the ratio of mean wealth between hispanics and whites over the years 2001 to 2007 they accounted for 33 of the relative wealth gain and over the years 2007 to 2010 for 28 of the relative drop off the standard definition of wealth net worth includes marketable assets such as housing and other real estate bank deposits and money market accounts securities corporate stock and mutual funds defined contribution dc pension plans including iras and 401 k s and unincorporated businesses what if we now include social security wealth and defined benefit db pension wealth to obtain a broader measure of wealth augmented wealth is defined as the sum of conventional net worth db pension wealth and social security wealth db pension wealth is defined as the present value of the discounted stream of future db pension benefits and social security wealth in analogous fashion is the present value of the discounted stream of future social security pension benefits when the definition of wealth is so expanded the wealth gap markedly shrinks there was a profound alteration of the private pension system after 1989 with a dramatic rise in dc pensions and a corresponding decline in db pensions however the take up rate in dc coverage was much greater for whites than the two minorities with the share of households with dc plans climbing from 26 in 1989 to 60 in 2016 among whites from 16 to 34 among blacks and from 13 to 31 among hispanics the percentage with db pensions declined for all three groups all in all the proportion holding any pension wealth went up from 62 to 72 among whites from 40 to 50 among blacks and from 31 to 40 among hispanics in 2016 there still remained sizeable gaps in retirement wealth the sum of pension and social security wealth and augmented wealth between minorities and whites though these gaps were considerably smaller than those in standard net worth the ratio of pension wealth the sum of dc and db pension wealth of african americans to whites was 0 3 see table 1 this difference largely reflects disparities in pension holdings the gap in social security wealth was much smaller a ratio of 0 6 overall the retirement wealth of the former was 45 that of the latter over time the black white ratio of pension wealth went more or less steadily downhill from 0 45 in 1989 to 0 3 in 2016 while the ratio of social security wealth went uphill from 0 44 to 0 6 as a result the racial gap in retirement wealth was about the same in 2016 as in 1989 the ratio of pension wealth between hispanics and whites was 0 22 in 2016 the ethnic discrepancy in social security wealth was about the same as the racial difference as was the gap in retirement wealth almost in parallel to the racial discrepancies the hispanic white differential in pension wealth enlarged that in social security wealth narrowed and the ratio in retirement wealth was about equal in 2016 and 1989 table 1 ratio of mean retirement and augmented wealth by race and ethnicity 1989 2016 source author s computations from the 1989 2001 2007 and 2016 scf the most notable finding is the ratio of augmented wealth between blacks and whites was 0 27 in 2016 about double the ratio in standard net worth while the black white ratio of mean net worth declined between 1989 and 2016 the ratio of augmented wealth was about the same in the two years social security made the difference since the ratio of mean net worth plus db pensions between the two fell from 0 22 to 0 18 likewise the ratio of augmented wealth between hispanics and whites was greater than that of net worth 0 28 versus 0 19 in 2016 the ethnic ratio of augmented wealth was a bit higher in 2016 than in 1989 as was the ratio of net worth the main reason for the lower wealth gap in augmented wealth than net worth between minorities and whites is that the portfolio composition of augmented wealth was much more heavily tilted toward social security among the former in 2016 social security wealth comprised 46 of the augmented wealth of blacks and 44 among hispanics compared to 20 among whites see table 2 pension wealth made up 23 among african americans compared to 21 among whites and 16 among hispanics correspondingly net worth excluding dc pensions was more important for whites accounting for 59 of their total wealth compared to 31 among blacks and 40 among hispanics over time pension wealth particularly dc wealth rose in importance for whites but remained more or less constant for blacks and hispanics social security wealth in contrast rose as a share of total wealth for blacks remained constant among hispanics but fell among whites table 2 portfolio composition by race and ethnicity 1989 2016 percentage of augmented wealth source author s computations from the 1989 2001 2007 and 2016 scf this study highlights the importance of social security in the minority community in 2016 social security made up a much greater share of total augmented wealth of minorities than of whites on a policy note efforts to curtail social security payouts will have a much more deleterious effect on the finances of the

stocks for the long term the dow jones industrial average ended the year down 5 6 percent the index suffered a deep plunge since it broke its all time high in october and had its worst december since 1931 s p 500 followed a similar trajectory closing the year down 6 2 percent and the nasdaq composite was off 4 percent this puts 2018 as the market s worst year since the great recession of 2008 markets have recently become increasingly concerned about a possible recession in 2019 some investors however believe these worries are overstated and think solid fundamentals and current valuations present a good opportunity for investment in u s stocks we actually had been viewing the most recent market action as a buying opportunity said brian jacobsen a multi asset strategist at wells fargo asset management if history is any guide we re probably going to reclaim the previous highs sometime in 2019 and my best guess is that it will be sooner rather than later before the latest rebound stocks plunged for four straight trading days and staged the worst ever christmas eve performance the recent sell off pushed the s p 500 near bear market territory which means a 20 percent drop from its recent peak jacobsen said there are historical experiences such as in 1998 and 2011 when stocks recovered after falling almost 20 percent it took three quarters for the s p 500 to recover in 2011 and the recovery was much faster in 1998 amid russian debt default of 1998 the index regained its previous highs in 46 days in both cases the u s economic fundamentals reclaimed attention and helped propel the market higher jacobsen said no signs of recession investors are currently skittish due to talks about the inverted u s treasury yield curve and slowing housing market which are widely considered to signal an impending recession goldman sachs however says the recent market plunge does not indicate an economic downturn in its latest report the investment bank revised down its u s growth forecast for the first half of 2019 from 2 4 percent to 2 percent in light of the fed s tightening monetary policy and weaker u s data however we are still not particularly worried about a recession goldman s chief economist jan hatzius wrote in the report according to hatzius the two key risk factors inflationary overheating and asset market bubbles remain absent valuations do not look excessive given a substantial rise in corporate earnings and the recent drop in asset prices he noted more importantly the private sector remains in very good financial shape and looks much less vulnerable to a decline in asset prices or a tightening in lending standards than in the last several cycles he said despite recent wild swings in wall street the u s stock market outperformed major markets around the world the german dax had its worst year in a decade falling more than 18 percent since the start of the year the ftse 100 ended the year down 12 5 percent china closed the year as the worst performing major stock market in the world major indexes in shanghai and shenzhen both lost more than 24 percent in 2018 markets at mercy of fed the u s stocks may continue to outperform in 2019 however some experts predict that stock market performance is at the mercy of the fed at least for the short term chinese stocks crashed as the trade war with the united states and the economic slowdown intensified investor worries stocks lost nearly 2 3 trillion in market value in 2018 besides the trade war which grabbed much of the attention in 2018 beijing s deleveraging efforts in the financial system played a big role in the stock market plunge the u s stocks may continue to outperform in 2019 however some experts predict that stock market performance is at the mercy of the fed at least for the short term stocks may rally in the first three months of the year according to j p morgan so long as the fed holds the interest rates steady in its march meeting signs of capitulation by institutional investors are creating a window of opportunity for equity markets into q1 assuming the fed reacts to market stress j p morgan analyst nikolaos panigirtzoglou wrote in a note to investors on dec 28 in its december meeting the fed raised its benchmark interest rate and lowered its forecast of rate hikes next year to two from three despite its dovish tone for next year fed chairman jerome powell failed to assure markets that the central bank was easing off its tighter policy approach as much as markets had expected stocks initially rose after the december meeting but fell sharply during powell s post meeting press conference according to panigirtzoglou whether the fed gets even more dovish next year will be the key factor in determining the market comeback at the beginning of 2019 if such dovish shift does not materialize and the yield curve inversion fails to improve any equity rally in q1 would most likely be short lived panigirtzoglou said

via andres cardenal cfa there is no way to know for certain how deep or long lasting a market correction will be but some indicators have a solid track record in terms of predictability over the long term credit spreads are particularly effective in that regard when the stock market falls and credit spreads remain stable this is many times a short term dip and ultimately a buying opportunity on the other hand if credit spreads are increasing as the stock market is falling this can signal that the situation is far more serious and concerning for illustrative purposes the chart shows the evolution of the s p 500 and high yield credit spreads since 1999 watching the credit markets can be particularly important in the current scenario since corporate debt levels in the us is at new historical highs this generally tends to happen near the end of the expansionary economic cycle and factors such as the trade war slowing economic growth in china and europe falling liquidity from the fed and the political uncertainty coming from washington are putting considerable pressure on financial markets if we see a sustained increase in credit spreads going forward highly indebted corporations could be particularly vulnerable to all kinds of problems credit spreads and stocks by the numbers the following quantitative system is available in real time for members in the data driven investor and it s based on managing risk exposure in the stock market by watching the main trends in the credit market we start by creating a ratio that measures the relative performance of ishares iboxx high yield corporate bond hyg versus ishares 7 10 year treasury bond etf ief when this ratio is rising it means that high yield bonds are outperforming treasury bonds so risk appetite is increasing and credit spreads are falling rising risk appetite in the bond markets is usually good for stocks too and vice versa the chart shows how the ratio has evolved since 1999 with the 100 days moving average of such ratio in blue when the ratio is above the 100 day moving average meaning that credit spreads are falling and risk appetite is rising in the credit markets the system is invested in spdr s p 500 spy conversely when the ratio is below the 100 day moving average the system goes for safety buying ishares 20 year treasury bond etf tlt the system has substantially outperformed a buy and hold strategy in spdr s p 500 in terms of returns and downside risk since 2008 the system gained 408 6 more than quadrupling the 101 1 produced by a buy and hold position in the same period in annual terms the quantitative system gained 16 versus 6 6 for spdr s p 500 more importantly the system has a much smaller drawdown than the buy and hold strategy the quantitative system has a maximum drawdown of 18 9 versus 52 3 for the index tracking etf we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us source etfreplay com the table below shows the performance statistics for the system versus the spdr s p 500 in every year since 2008 in years such as 2008 and 2018 the system went for protection because risk appetite was falling in the credit markets and this allowed the model to not only protect investor capital but even make a sizeable profit in a bear market for stocks notably the system only had a small loss of 0 9 in 2015 making money in 10 of the past 11 years in case you were wondering the system sold stocks and purchased bonds in october of 2018 which was obviously a smart decision in retrospect no particular indicator can be perfect or infallible we want to have multiple indicators and then we weight the evidence from those indicators to make investment decisions based on hard data and statistical evidence as opposed to opinions and emotions sometimes it s relatively easy to reach a conclusion because most of the indicators are pointing in the same direction and in other occasions the evidence is more mixed and nuanced importantly systems such as this one are designed to avoid big drawdowns which is arguably the most important priority when managing capital however if markets go through sideways periods and shallow pullbacks the system should be expected to provide false signals meaning that the system goes for safety when it should instead remain long stocks in a small market adjustment that being acknowledged having access to quantitative systems is remarkably valuable because many of the most expensive mistakes investors generally make are due to subjectivities and emotions interfering with rational decision making the quantitative systems are not perfect and they never will be but they do a solid job at protecting your capital from devastating drawdowns while also providing a valuable tool to analyze the market environment in a clear and objective way all asset classes are interconnected and price action in the bond market can tell us a lot about what is going on in the stock market too as of the time of this writing price behavior in the bond market is sending a bearish signal for stocks members in the data driven investor have access to quantitative systems to protect the portfolio in

by frank holmes ceo u s global investors with only one trading day remaining in 2018 i m pleased to report that the price of gold has so far beaten the s p 500 index for the month of december 4 4 percent versus minus 10 percent the fourth quarter 7 4 percent versus minus 15 percent and the year minus 2 percent versus minus 7 percent since stocks have stumbled recently this might not come as such a shock what might surprise some of you is that gold has also outperformed the market for the century 344 percent versus 67 percent click to enlarge what this means is that even though the yellow metal is still down from its 2011 peak it has proven itself as a valuable diversifier in most any investor s portfolio and if stocks are headed for another big pullback next year it could become even more valuable looking back over the past 12 months i m not surprised to see that my five most popular and widely shared posts of 2018 involve gold with one exception below i count them down beginning with a story about texas the home state of u s global investors the texas bullion depository the first of its kind in the u s officially opened to the public in austin in early june capping three years of planning and construction at the time texans were able to deposit their gold and other precious metals at an already existing facility earlier this month though officials broke ground on a new state of the art 40 000 square foot facility in leander texas just north of austin this is wonderful news because texas is such a trend setting state it might encourage other states to look into creating their own depositories it also has the potential to attract even more investors to precious metals which i believe are crucial components of any well diversified portfolio for most of 2018 the gold bears were large and in charge with hedge funds shorting the yellow metal in record numbers this past summer a major contributor to this is gold s negative correlation to the u s dollar which was strong relative to other major world currencies throughout the year a bottom in gold prices looked especially likely after vanguard the world s largest mutual fund company announced it was closing its precious metals and mining fund back in 2001 when gold had similarly found a bottom vanguard dropped the word gold from what was then the gold and precious metals fund and the change coincided with a decade long precious metals bull run click to enlarge so could this mean another bull run is in the works no one can say for sure of course but the timing of vanguard s announcement was certainly interesting now that gold is trading above 1 280 again for the first time since june my confidence that the metal is set for a huge breakout has only grown stronger photo courtesy of menë in november i shared with you one of my favorite new precious metal jewelry companies menë you might not be familiar with the name yet but you could be soon enough in its first 10 months of operation menë did as much as 7 million in sales and in more than 53 countries as of october founded in 2017 the company s mission is to disrupt the gold jewelry market it aims to do this by making its pieces strictly from 24 karat gold or platinum selling directly to the consumer and pricing its merchandise fairly and transparently unlike traditional sellers menë prices its jewelry based on the changing value of gold then charges a 15 percent to 20 percent design and production fee on top of that here at u s global investors we believe gold is money and a timeless investment menë which takes its name from the aramaic word for money has clearly run with that idea going so far as to trademark the phrase investment jewelry we see the company as an attractive way to invest in gold s love trade with russia in the news almost daily this year thanks mostly to the investigation into the 2016 u s presidential election i wanted to know which had the larger economy russia or texas spoiler alert it s texas by about 400 billion we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us at the time of my writing this russia was ranked as the number one oil producer in the world in september however the u s regained the title after pumping out nearly 11 million barrels per day late in the summer a feat the american industry has never before achieved today the u s produces between 11 60 and 11 70 million barrels per day whereas russia averages around 11 37 million barrels on a similar note the international energy agency iea just issued its prediction that by 2025 the total amount of u s oil production would equal that of russia and saudi arabia combined my post popular post of 2018 was coincidentally also the very first thing i wrote this year the yellow metal had ended 2017 up more than 13 percent its best year since 2010 while senior gold miners gained more than 11 percent all of this occurred even as the stock market closed regularly at all time highs and the price of bitcoin was rising by leaps and bounds i attributed gold s strong 2017 performance mainly to the fear trade specifically to concerns over inflation interestingly inflation never really materialized this year the year over year percent change in the consumer price index cpi didn t even breach 3 percent most forecasts for 2019 are just as mild however there are other things to keep an eye on in the new year namely the ballooning u s deficit growing debt at the consumer corporate and government levels rising interest rates and signs of a global economic slowdown what s more democrats take control of the u s house of representatives next month we can probably expect to see multiple investigations into the trump administration which could possibly slow the progress of additional pro growth pro business policies taken together these risks burnish the investment case of gold s fear trade i remain bullish on the metal for 2019 and recommend a 10 percent portfolio weighting 5 percent in bullion and jewelry and the other 5 percent in well managed gold mining stocks mutual funds and etfs gold market this week spot gold closed at 1 280 75 up 24 70 per ounce or 1

a high hope for a low heaven is a shakespearean phrase that minnesotans might try on for size this new year s setting sights on modest improvements isn t as fun as dreaming wild dreams but given the divided governments hunkering down in washington and st paul as well as the absence of steady leadership from the white house a low heaven might be the best that high hopes can deliver this year here are some of the star tribune editorial board s modest wishes for 2019 integrity that some measure of political integrity can be restored to our battered democracy this is a vast topic but there should be some hope that partisan gerrymandering can be corrected with the next census that the census itself can be fairly conducted that voter suppression can be minimized that sore loser laws passed in wisconsin michigan and elsewhere can be corrected that facts can again form the basis for decisionmaking that campaigns will not welcome foreign interference in elections that presidents will make public their tax returns and business dealings that a free press will not be disparaged as an enemy of the people and that respectful disagreement will not be taken as personal betrayal national leadership that republican u s senators summon the courage to place country ahead of career by carrying out an intervention of sorts with president donald trump letting him know that he will lose their support unless he changes his erratic behavior his divisive rhetoric his insults to allies and his cozying up to tyrants while the 2020 ballot box continues to be the best remedy two more years of trump could severely damage democratic institutions and global stability national leadership part ii that democrats in congress will surprise us and fill the void left by republicans who used to

inflationary pressures continued to be elevated in sierra leone since the last monetary policy statement the governor of the bank of sierra leone professor kelfala kalllon said today the governor said that headline inflation increased from 16 59 percent in june 2018 to 19 29 percent in october 2018 this development the governor indicated resulted primarily from an increase in food prices which was compounded by a depreciation of the leone and an upward adjustment in the domestic pump price of fuel the governor stated however the mpc noted that although the inflation rate remains high there are signs that inflationary pressures are easing as evidenced by a decrease in the inflation rate to 18 14 percent in november 2018 the stability in the exchange value of the leone against major currencies and an improved domestic food supply as we enter the harvest season monetary policy statement __________ the monetary policy committee mpc of the bank of sierra leone bsl met on friday 28th december 2018 under the chairmanship of the governor professor kelfala morana kallon based on an assessment of international and domestic economic developments and their potential impact on the outlook for inflation in sierra leone the mpc decided to maintain the monetary policy rate mpr at 16 50 percent the factors that informed this decision are discussed in the rest of this statement on the domestic front real gdp growth is expected to drop to 3 7 percent in 2018 from the 3 8 percent recorded in 2017 this reflects the continued suspension of iron ore mining which continues to weigh down on economic activity coupled with subdued aggregate demand since the last mpc inflationary pressures continued to be elevated with headline inflation increasing from 16 59 percent in june 2018 to 19 29 percent in october 2018 this development resulted primarily from an increase in food prices which was compounded by a depreciation of the leone and an upward adjustment in the domestic pump price of fuel however the mpc noted that although the inflation rate remains high there are signs that inflationary pressures are easing as evidenced by a decrease in the inflation rate to 18 14 percent in november 2018 the stability in the exchange value of the leone against major currencies and an improved domestic food supply as we enter the harvest season on the money supply front the broad money stock expanded by 2 53 percent in q3 2018 compared to the contraction of 0 25 percent recorded in q2 2018 this was largely explained by growth in net foreign assets and credit to the private sector reflecting the government s fiscal consolidation efforts net government domestic borrowing declined by 1 93 percent in this regard the expenditure control measures recently announced by government in the 2019 budget which should reduce government borrowing and bring fiscal operations back to a sustainable path represent a major step in restoring conditions for macroeconomic stability the money market remained tight with some banks resorting to the collateralized discount window at the bank of sierra leone the tight liquidity condition in the money market caused the interbank rate to rise to 14 76 percent in q3 2018 from 13 66 percent in q2 2018 however the mpc noted that liquidity conditions slightly improved in october and november 2018 following net injections from government to finance infrastructure projects the mpc was also encouraged by the fact that growth in bank credit to the private sector recovered strongly rising from 6 60 percent in q2 2018 to 17 65 percent in q3 2018 consequently the yield across all tenors of government securities increased during the quarter however government s fiscal consolidation efforts which should lower its demand for loanable funds are expected to lower those yields this expected reduction in the government s appetite for loanable funds should provide incentives to the commercial banks and other financial institutions to increase private sector lending regarding the exchange rate the mpc notes that the leone appreciated against the dollar slightly during q3 2018 more significantly its exchange value in terms of major currencies remained relatively stable during much of q4 2018 this was mainly due to subdued demand for foreign exchange as a result of tight monetary conditions and the injection of foreign exchange by our development partners this development which the mpc expects to continue in the near future should dampen inflationary pressures especially through the exchange rate effect on the pump price of fuel the banking sector remained sound well capitalized and profitable however though on declining trajectory the non performing loans ratio remain slightly above 10 percent which is mildly worrisome global growth is expected to be firm driven by strong growth in the united states and developing economies and is projected to grow by 3 7 percent in 2018 and 2019 however the escalating trade frictions among major economies and the uncertainties surrounding brexit could undermine the growth momentum real gdp growth is expected to pick up to 5 1 percent in 2019 supported by the resumption of iron ore production and exports improved foreign direct investments in the agriculture and tourism sectors public investments in infrastructure supported by policy reforms the mpc however recognizes that continued economic recovery over the medium to long term horizon depends on sustained macroeconomic stability and addressing underlying structural constraints especially on the supply side on the inflation front recent data confirm an emerging disinflationary trend therefore the policy priority for the bsl in the coming months is to maintain that disinflationary momentum while allowing scope for a recovery of aggregate demand to push real gdp back towards its potential growth rate based on the near term outlook the balance of risks as well as the need to await the impact of recent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms measures in the economy the mpc resolved to keep the monetary policy stance unchanged hence effective monday december 31 2018 the following rates are published for the information of the public monetary policy rate is 16 5 percent standing deposit facility rate is 13 5 percent standing lending facility rate is 20 5 percent

johnson johnson inc s statement was unequivocal the fda has tested johnson s talc since the 70s every single time it did not contain asbestos the company said in a dec 19 tweet it followed by several days the publication of a reuters investigation here that found the healthcare conglomerate knew for decades that the carcinogen lurked in its baby powder and other cosmetic talc products the tweet posted under the handle jnjnews didn t mention that the u s food and drug administration fda found traces of asbestos in the company s shower to shower talc in 1973 as revealed in agency documents here reviewed by reuters and it is only one of dozens of tweets conveying a similar message about talc safety since the reuters article appeared dec 14 the reuters article prompted a stock selloff that erased about 40 billion from j j s market value in one day and created a public relations crisis as the blue chip healthcare conglomerate faced widespread questions about the possible health effects of one of its most iconic products to reassure investors and consumers j j has tweeted posted on facebook run a series of full page newspaper ads across the united states published a lengthy rebuttal to the reuters investigation on its website and announced a 5 billion stock buyback chairman and chief executive officer alex gorsky has appeared in a company video and on cnbc s mad money to reinforce the company s position that position has been unwavering j j insists that its baby powder is safe and has been asbestos free at least since regular testing began in the 1970s the message doubles down on the stance the company has taken to defend against lawsuits in which about 11 700 plaintiffs allege that the j j talc they used in past decades caused their cancer the company is pursuing this strategy despite the evidence that talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for the carcinogen from the 1970s into the early 2000s test results that the company didn t disclose to regulators or consumers in response to a reuters request for comment the company said it is committed to defending the talc litigation and that same long term view is reflected in our ongoing communications that consistently point to the strong scientific evidence that our talc is and always has been safe as for the 1973 shower to shower test j j noted that the result didn t reflect fda s final determination about this sample in a 1976 table summarizing the agency s early 1970s cosmetic talc testing however in that 1976 table which reuters examined the fda did not indicate any result positive or negative for the type of asbestos found in the shower to shower sample in 1973 given the mass of litigation it faces j j has little choice but to zealously dispute findings that its products sometimes contained traces of asbestos said eric dezenhall a crisis management consultant in washington d c if your position in court is that the claims being made are false you can t just shrug your shoulders he said soon after the reuters article appeared j j executives consulted crisis management experts according to people familiar with the matter among the company s reasons for deciding to maintain its stance on absolute talc purity these people said was a conviction that a company known for putting health and safety first had the facts on its side a litigation track record that included victories and mistrials and the expectation that adverse verdicts will be overturned on appeal through lawyers many of j j s subsequent messages have mirrored the company s written responses to questions and findings reuters presented to the company during its investigation they deny that the company kept information from regulators and point to the many studies finding that talc is safe and doesn t cause cancer those earlier responses were composed by j j s outside litigators led by peter bicks at orrick herrington sutcliffe and conveyed to reuters by lawyers at a crisis management firm co founded by lanny davis a lawyer who represented u s president bill clinton in the 1990s and michael cohen president donald trump s former attorney who has pleaded guilty to multiple criminal charges gorsky in his appearance on mad money invoked j j s now legendary response to the tylenol crisis as evidence that the company can be trusted to address any safety problems linked to its products in 1982 j j moved decisively to pull all tylenol from store shelves after seven people died from taking cyanide laced pills i can t believe the company that took that dramatic of an action would allow a product that they felt in any way could be harmful to stay on the market gorsky told mad money host jim cramer we unequivocally believe that our talc our baby powder does not contain asbestos citing the tylenol recall provides some reputational buffer said stephen a greyser the harvard business school professor who wrote the first study of the company s handling of that crisis but it is not a total protection because it won t shield the company from a loss of trust if consumers or investors conclude the company hasn t been fully forthcoming in this case he said j j needs to guard against reputational contagion the risk that a loss of confidence in baby powder could bleed over into how consumers shareholders and others view the company more broadly greyser added the key difference between the two crises is that poisoned tylenol presented a threat to consumers at the time while the documented asbestos contamination of j j talc that reuters investigated spanned from 1971 to the early 2000s j j says that if it believed that baby powder today presented safety risks it wouldn t hesitate to remove it from store shelves given that the product accounts for less than 0 5 of annual revenue the company joined its talc supplier imerys talc america a unit of paris based imerys sa in requesting that a trial scheduled for january in st louis be delayed for among other things what they called negative national and local news coverage resulting from the reuters investigation that would inevitably taint prospective jurors the judge denied the motion the same judge recently upheld a 4 69 billion jury award in a separate ovarian cancer case which j j says it expects to be overturned on appeal the judge said j j s promotion of a product that the evidence showed was contaminated with a known carcinogen was particularly reprehensible in an emailed statement imerys talc america said it is committed to the quality and safety of its products and that rigorous research overwhelmingly confirms that talc is safe and no agency has asserted that talc causes cancer undermined by evidence some of j j s messages in its recent campaign omit key details regarding findings on talc and in certain instances are undermined by other evidence according to a reuters review of the company s statements the dec 19 tweet claiming that the fda s own tests never found asbestos in j j talc for example ignores an agency scientist s 1973 finding that a shower to shower sample contained asbestos fibers according to a copy of an fda report titled asbestos and other contaminants in talc and a deposition of a former j j head toxicologist the fda did not respond to questions for this article citing a partial government shutdown on cnbc gorsky said we also not only used the best testing methodologies that were available but we continued to improve them through the years j j s testing methods do exceed the industry standard but even so as a geologist and frequent j j expert witness acknowledged in court this year only a tiny fraction of the company s talc sold over the past 40 years has been tested using what is widely recognized as the best method to detect asbestos fibers known as transmission electron microscopy plaintiffs lawyers are already homing in on inconsistencies between j j s statements and other evidence regarding its talc and they are planning to depose gorsky in coming weeks there is no flexibility in what they re saying said leigh o dell one of the lead lawyers representing plaintiffs in thousands of lawsuits against j j consolidated in a new jersey federal court taking these statements on behalf of the company and pointing out to juries and judges the misrepresentations contained in those statements i think you re going to see that in every case going forward whether it s an ovarian cancer case or a mesothelioma case one of j j s recent tweets criticized plaintiffs lawyers far from a new theory or insight plaintiffs lawyers have resurrected a disproven argument about asbestos in our talc that dates to the 1970s the reuters investigation found that tests by j j s own contract labs and others periodically found small amounts of asbestos in talc from mines that supplied the mineral for baby powder as recently as the early 2000s some j j tweets and newspaper ads have adopted a question and answer format what about the allegation you withheld safety information the company said in a full page ad in usa today the day after christmas it is false the company said all safety concerns are taken seriously and we share all relevant information with regulators some twitter users have responded to j j s tweets with praise and support others have referenced their relatives longtime use of j j talc products and subsequent deaths from ovarian cancer we re very sorry to hear this j j responded to several twitter users expressing a desire to speak with them and offering a phone number to call in response to another recent tweet in which j j said its talc doesn t contain asbestos one twitter user asked did it used to no j j responded for decades j j s baby powder has repeatedly been tested for asbestos and found not to contain asbestos additional reporting by alison frankel edited by john blanton
former donald trump economic advisor stephen moore lauded decreasing income inequality in america on cnn after the stock markets suffered their worst december since 1931 cnn anchor pamela brown reminded moore of a trump tweet from october bragging about the stock market something he did repeatedly before the market downturn i remember back then there was a warning to the president look you know if you re going to take credit for when it s high you have to take blame for when it s low brown recalled what do you think moore admitted the stock market had a brutal month in december but claimed the big story was actually the stock market gains in the final week of the month moore said that 2018 was the best year for the american worker in probably in 50 years that s the big story of the year he argued i don t understand the negativity yeah the stock market was down but look for workers it was a great great year and nobody can deny that cnn global economic analyst rana foroohar explained the details behind the headline numbers noting there is a lot of bifurcation if you look at the top 12 or so cities around the country the big coastal cities the rich areas we know are taking most of those gains she explained there are large chunks of the country being left behind foroohar also noted the lack of middle class job growth there is also a big gap in terms of the types of jobs being created she explained there is a lot of jobs at the very high end there s a lot of 15 an hour jobs not enough in the middle the wall street journal had a great piece about a month ago that showed that the biggest wage gains have actually been for the people at the bottom moore replied so we re actually for the first time in a long long time seeing a shrinking in income equality because people at the bottom have more flexibility in terms of their job choices actually what we need is jobs in the middle foroohar argued we don t have enough middle class jobs watch
