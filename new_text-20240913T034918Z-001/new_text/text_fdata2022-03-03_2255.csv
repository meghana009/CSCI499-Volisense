management to evaluate the financial performance of the company s long term investment strategy and core business activities over periods of time as well as assist with the determination of the appropriate level of periodic dividends to common stockholders the company believes that non gaap core operating income assists investors in understanding and evaluating the financial performance of the company s long term investment strategy and core business activities over periods of time as well as its earnings capacity a limitation of utilizing this non gaap financial measure is that the effect of accounting for non core events or transactions in accordance with gaap does in fact reflect the financial results of our business and these effects should not be ignored when evaluating and analyzing our financial results in addition the company s calculation of non gaap core operating income may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies therefore the company believes that net income determined in accordance with gaap should be considered in conjunction with non gaap core operating income furthermore there may be differences between non gaap core operating income and taxable income determined in accordance with the internal revenue code as a reit the company will be required to distribute at least 90 of its reit taxable income subject to certain adjustments to qualify as a reit and all of its taxable income in order to not be subject to any u s federal or state corporate income taxes accordingly non gaap core operating income may not

up for our wine club today did you know you can support the nation by drinking wine in 2021 when president joe biden delivered his first joint address to congress in person attendance was drastically cut back capping the number of attendees at 200 this year capitol hill dropped its mask mandate ahead of the speech and invited all 535 members of congress to attend the state of the union address but the changes didn t make the scene feel any less strange lawmakers still couldn t bring guests some announced virtual guests who would watch the address from home while their hosts watched from the house chamber a year after the attack on the capitol excessive security has remained the norm the controversial fencing around the capitol complex went back up for the event despite the fact that there were no credible or specific threats made ahead of the president s speech and there were cops everywhere capitol police swarmed in and around the various senate and house office buildings hundreds of national guard troops were stationed throughout the capitol itself to back up capitol police which requested additional backup from other law enforcement agencies the secret service was present as well representative lou correa a democrat from california told me and a couple reporters that the occasion would mark his first time sitting up in the chamber s balcony since january 6 the day a violent mob of trump supporters stormed the capitol how do you feel we asked i feel like my plan would have worked he replied his plan he told us was to throw the attackers off the balcony don t worry i m armed correa joked slowly opening his jacket to take out a plain blue pen but some things like the time honored tradition of drinking at a boring work event never change do you have any wine or champagne representative veronica escobar of texas asked in the house gallery adding that she might have to take some wine in her purse washington s imperial ambitions are just as timeless no pandemic crisis or political development can shake lawmakers commitment to war following russia s invasion of ukraine biden s team reworked the speech which is typically centered on domestic policy to try to unite the nation around the battle between democracy and autocracy inside the house chamber lawmakers wore yellow and blue dresses ties scarves and pins in a display of support for ukraine biden was especially on theme dedicating the first 12 minutes of his hour long speech to ukraine he praised ukrainians wall of strength against putin and called out russian oligarchs to bipartisan applause just russian oligarchs not american ones but he showed little interest in de escalation or peace instead he declared that russian president vladimir putin will pay a price for invading ukraine and touted the destruction of russia s economy strangling the economy of a nuclear armed power during a geopolitical crisis biden argued is a good thing current issue view our current issue he has no idea what s coming biden said the ruble has already lost 30 percent of its value the russian stock market has lost 40 percent of its value and trading remains suspended the russian economy is reeling and putin alone is the one to blame popular swipe left below to view more authors swipe the toxic culture at tesla the toxic culture at tesla feature bryce covert the 2024 olympics are already

then pivoted to domestic policy offering a list of policy priorities a 15 minimum wage higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy lowered prescription drug prices that have all died in congress under his watch build back better basically but without ever mentioning build back better because we all know how that turned out throughout the speech biden also attempted to get ahead of the republican party s main lines of attack its obsession over rising crime rates open borders inflation fearmongering and the baseless accusation that democrats are anti police we should all agree the answer is not to defund the police he said drawing strong applause from house minority leader kevin mccarthy and minority whip steve scalise the answer is to fund the police fund them fund them but the progressive flank of his party was not having it missouri representative cori bush a leader in the black lives matter demonstrations in st louis after the police killing of michael brown is sticking to the call to defund the police all our country has done is given more funding to the police she tweeted after the speech the result 2021 set a record for fatal police shootings representative rashida tlaib who gave the progressive state of the union response on behalf of the working families party also contrasted with biden on police reform we can t police away homelessness poverty or our mental health crisis in our country tlaib said care not more criminalization is how we ensure lasting safety for all bush attended the address in a bright red shirt with the number 18 000 written across it in hopes of pressuring the administration to start granting clemency to those whose petitions have been backlogged by the criminal justice system we just need it signed by the president bush told me before biden spoke those are 18 000 bodies 18 000 human beings last year s increase in the number of people entering the federal prison system was the first increase in eight years she added so things are going backwards on the way out every democratic lawmaker i walked by praised the president s speech republicans also stayed on script as far as i can tell no willingness to change gears from the extreme left wing agenda texas senator ted cruz told reporters nancy pelosi and chuck schumer have chosen to advance a hard left agenda from the socialist wing of the party cruz continued and i heard nothing today from president biden that he intends to change course

portfolio throughout the year and margin compression caused by high commodity prices summary full year 2021 financial results net income loss for the year ended december 31 2021 was 4 0 million compared to net income of 68 2 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the decrease compared to the prior year was primarily the result of a 64 4 million loss due to winter storm uri in addition we had a mark to market gain this year of 5 5 million compared to a mark to market gain of 14 3 million a year ago for the year ended december 31 2021 via renewables reported adjusted ebitda of 80 7 million compared to adjusted ebitda of 106 6 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the decrease was primarily due to decreases in both power and gas usage partially offset by higher gas margins the decrease was also offset by g a reductions pertaining to bad debt legal settlement expenses and lower customer acquisitions costs for the year ended december 31 2021 via renewables reported retail gross margin of 132 5 million compared to retail gross margin of 196 5 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the decrease was primarily attributable to a smaller customer book particularly due to restrictions on our organic sales channels limiting our ability to ramp up sales the shift in the customer mix towards more residential contracts not only reduces the risk in the portfolio but also has a positive impact on our g a and balance sheet liquidity and capital resources 1 reflects amount of letters of credit that could be issued based on existing covenants as of december 31 2021 2 the

non gaap measures adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda less i customer acquisition costs incurred in the current period plus or minus ii net gain loss on derivative instruments and iii net current period cash settlements on derivative instruments plus iv non cash compensation expense and v other non cash and non recurring operating items ebitda is defined as net income loss before the provision for income taxes interest expense and depreciation and amortization we deduct all current period customer acquisition costs representing spending for organic customer acquisitions in the adjusted ebitda calculation because such costs reflect a cash outlay in the period in which they are incurred even though we capitalize and amortize such costs over two years we do not deduct the cost of customer acquisitions through acquisitions of businesses or portfolios of customers in calculating adjusted ebitda we deduct our net gains losses on derivative instruments excluding current period cash settlements from the adjusted ebitda calculation in order to remove the non cash impact of net gains and losses on these instruments we also deduct non cash compensation expense that results from the issuance of restricted stock units under our long term incentive plan due to the non cash nature of the expense we adjust from time to time other non cash or unusual and or infrequent charges due to either their non cash nature or their infrequency we have historically included the financial impact of weather variability in the calculation of adjusted ebitda we will continue this historical approach but during the first quarter of 2021 we incurred a net pre tax financial loss of 64 9 million due to winter storm uri as described above this loss was incurred due to uncharacteristic extended sub freezing temperatures across texas combined with the impact of the pricing caps ordered by ercot we believe this event is unusual infrequent and non recurring in nature our lenders under our senior credit facility allowed 60 0 million of the 64 9 million pre tax storm loss incurred in the first quarter of 2021 to be added back as a non recurring item in the calculation of adjusted ebitda for our debt covenant calculations as our senior credit facility is considered a material agreement and adjusted ebitda is a key component of our material covenants we consider our covenant compliance to be material to the understanding of our financial condition and or liquidity we will present any credits received related to the storm exceeding 4 9 million as a reduction of the related 60 0 million non recurring add back to adjusted ebitda for consistent presentation there are no assurances credits will be received we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides information useful to investors in assessing our liquidity and financial condition and results of operations and that adjusted ebitda is also useful to investors as a financial indicator of our ability to incur and service debt pay dividends and fund capital expenditures adjusted ebitda is a supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts investors commercial banks and rating agencies use to assess the following our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the retail energy industry without regard to financing methods capital structure or historical cost basis the ability of our assets to generate earnings sufficient to support our proposed cash dividends our ability to fund capital expenditures including customer acquisition costs and incur and service debt and our compliance with financial debt covenants retail gross margin we define retail gross margin as operating income loss plus i depreciation and amortization expenses and ii general and administrative expenses less i net asset optimization revenues ii net gains losses on non trading derivative instruments and iii net current period cash settlements on non trading derivative instruments retail gross margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary performance measure used by our management to determine the performance of our retail natural gas and electricity business by removing the impacts of our asset optimization activities and net non cash income loss impact of our economic hedging activities as an indicator of our retail energy business operating performance retail gross margin should not be considered an alternative to or more meaningful than operating income loss its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we believe retail gross margin provides information useful to investors as an indicator of our retail energy business s operating performance we have historically included the financial impact of weather variability in the calculation of retail gross margin we will continue this historical approach but during the first quarter of 2021 we added back the 64 9 million net financial loss incurred related to winter storm uri as described above in the calculation of retail gross margin because the extremity of the texas storm combined with the impact of unprecedented pricing mechanisms ordered by ercot is considered unusual infrequent and non recurring in nature we received credits totaling 0 5 million related to winter storm uri costs in the third quarter of 2021 which is included in the calculation of retail gross margin for consistent presentation the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net income loss and net cash provided by operating activities the gaap measure most directly comparable to retail gross margin is operating income loss our non gaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss net cash provided by operating activities or operating income loss adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin are not presentations made in accordance with gaap and have important limitations as analytical tools you should not consider adjusted ebitda or retail gross margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap because adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin exclude some but not all items that affect net income loss and net cash provided by operating activities and are defined differently by different companies in our industry our definition of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies management compensates for the limitations of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these data points into management s decision making process the following tables present a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net

the big picture amazon hasn t shied away from experimenting with brick and mortar concepts in recent years which is a bit ironic considering the internet shopping pioneer s role in disrupting traditional retail in its formative years its 4 star stores for example only sell items that have a four star or higher rating are top sellers or are new and trending on amazon com the e commerce giant confirmed to cnbc that it will be shutting down all of its amazon books physical stores in the us and uk along with its amazon 4 star and remaining amazon pop up stores closure dates will vary by location the company said all told nearly 70 stores will be going away an amazon spokesperson said they will help impacted employees find roles elsewhere in the company those who decide to move on will be given severance growth at amazon has slowed as of late however which is reflected in the company s share value year to date the stock is down nearly 11 percent one of its bigger acquisitions whole foods is still going strong amazon earlier this week opened its first whole foods store with just walk out technology allowing shoppers to grab what they need and skip the checkout line thanks to the combined magic of computer vision sensor fusion and deep learning the company is also planning to launch an apparel store called amazon style in glendale california later this year featuring clothing and high tech changing rooms image credit tim mossholder

lockdowns in nsw and victoria that prevented anyone from spending money but by the december quarter delta was under control and the economy bounced back 3 4 that s the biggest quarterly gdp gain since 1976 and it was all about consumer spending which bounced back 6 3 across the country including 11 4 in nsw and 7 5 in victoria the annual rate of gdp growth had stumbled but not fallen it rose to 4 2 in december up from 3 9 perhaps the most significant number to come out of the data is the subsequent drop in household savings to 13 6 from 19 8 but the equilibrium level is 5 so australians have not finished spending yet the only problem is that by christmas another variant had arrived but enough history yesterday the asx200 opened lower as wall street and our futures had decreed to be down 55 points in the first half hour with that out of the way the buyers moved in ahead of the later gdp release they only bought two sectors energy closed up 4 9 on oil prices above us 100 bbl and materials up 3 0 on increases in iron ore coal gold lithium et al numbers like that would typically have the asx200 soaring except for the natural enemy of the resource sectors financials having risen 1 0 on tuesday as australian bond yields held firm against a us crunch yesterday they succumbed to a fall in yields with the two year down 6 points to 1 01 as us yields again retreated sharply the sector fell 1 4 what insurance company investors were doing on tuesday is anyone s guess sending insurers slightly higher as yesterday suncorp sun fell 1 6 insurance australia group iag 4 4 and qbe insurance

turmoil consumer discretionary and related reits were the other major losers down 1 1 and 1 2 perhaps investors saw december quarter consumption as representing the peak ur westfield urw fell 5 8 the big winners on the day were the two big oil majors santos sto up 6 2 and woodside petroleum wpl up 6 1 remembering that santos now includes oil search whitehaven coal whc followed with 5 9 and diversified miner south32 s32 5 9 so thanks to holes in the ground and sea the local market managed to overcome negative sentiment in the us which in its fickle way turned positive again last night our futures are up 69 points this morning hurray for 25 last night the fed chairman told congress effectively the fed funds rate would be raised by 25 basis points in two weeks three weeks ago this would have been a big relief for wall street as it is not 50 points given recent events abroad some on wall street had begun to wonder whether the fed would hike in march at all this is evident in the us ten year bond yield bouncing back 16 points to 1 87 last night we recall that in january surging bond yields in the wake of the fed s policy pivot sent wall street into correction last night on surging bond yields the s p500 jumped 1 9 the nasdaq the known victim of higher rates rose 1 6 it s a funny old world we could note nonetheless that the biggest enemy of stock markets is uncertainty and what the fed was going to do this month has been the prime source until last night it s not typical for wall street to cheer a rate rise but last night it did we also note tuesday night s fall took the s p500 perilously close to the 4300 support level the prior low a breach of which would have opened up a technical black hole but wall street has already been sold down hard twice support held all this in the face of another 8 surge in oil prices opec russia confirmed last night it would not increase oil production beyond current quotas the release of government held global oil reserves has been steamrollered one saving grace is that the northern hemisphere is heading into summer all hopes of some lower us inflation numbers from this month have been dashed march last year

semiconductor manufacturers are warily eyeing global stocks of neon xenon and palladium necessary to manufacture their products makers of potato chips and cosmetics could face shortages of sunflower oil the bulk of which is produced in russia and ukraine and if the conflict is prolonged it could threaten the summer wheat harvest which flows into bread pasta and packaged food for vast numbers of people especially in europe north africa and the middle east food prices have already skyrocketed because of disruptions in the global supply chain increasing the risk of social unrest in poorer countries on tuesday the global shipping giant maersk announced that it would temporarily suspend all shipments to and from russia by ocean air and rail with the exception of food and medicine ocean network express hapag lloyd and msc the world s other major ocean carriers have announced similar suspensions the war just makes the worldwide situation for commodities more dire said christopher f graham a partner at white and williams jennifer mckeown head of global economics service at capital economics said the global economy appeared relatively insulated from the conflict but she said shortages of materials like palladium and xenon used in semiconductor and auto production could add to current difficulties for those industries semiconductor shortages have halted production at car plants and other facilities fuelling price increases and weighing on sales that could add to the shortages that we re already seeing exacerbate those shortages and end up causing further damage to global growth she said international companies are also trying to comply with sweeping financial sanctions and export controls imposed by europe the united states and a number of other countries that have clamped down on flows of goods and money in and out of russia in just a few days western governments moved to exclude certain russian banks from using the swift messaging system limit the russian central bank s ability to prop up the rouble cut off shipments of high tech goods and freeze the global assets of russian oligarchs the biden administration said the technology restrictions alone would stop about a fifth of russian imports but the impact on trade from the financial curbs is likely to be even larger cutting off russia s imports from and exports to nearly all of its major trading partners said eswar prasad a professor of trade policy at cornell university even when trade flows may take place directly between russia and its trading partners the reality is that payments often have to go through a western dominated financial system and usually have to go through a western currency he said in a statement saturday european commission president ursula von der leyen said europe and its allies were resolved to continue imposing massive costs on russia and that disconnecting russian banks from swift would also halt russian trade loading cutting banks off will stop them from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide and effectively block russian exports and imports she said the economic consequences of these moves are not yet entirely clear russia accounts for less than 2 per cent of global domestic product so the implications for other countries may be somewhat limited but for the russian government and the economy both of which are heavily dependent on trade to generate revenue the impact could be catastrophic capitol economics has estimated russian gross domestic product could contract by 5 per cent this year a change that in isolation would knock just 0 2 percentage points off global growth caroline bain chief commodities economist at capitol economics said financial sanctions were halting the trade of metals and agricultural commodities likely exacerbating strains in global supply chains credit suisse and société generale have suspended financing for commodity trading with russia as has the industrial and commercial bank of china she said while the economic implications of the war and sweeping sanctions on russia are not yet clear many industries are bracing for a bad situation to get worse there could be quite a bit of self sanctioning going on obviously people are quite nervous about taking up contracts on russian commodities when everything is so uncertain bain said while governments haven t released many specifics on what kind of trades will be allowed she added our understanding is that all trade apart from energy is being targeted the conflict may also ripple through some industries by disrupting the flight networks that companies use to deliver goods globally shipping ports around the black sea have closed halting dozens of cargo vessels but the more immediate effects are likely to be felt in air shipments between asia and europe which now have to divert around russian airspace said eytan buchman chief marketing officer of the freightos group a digital freight booking platform already hit hard by the pandemic the russia ukraine war is exacerbating the world s supply chain crisis credit ap western europe and russia have imposed reciprocal flight bans bringing travel between the two regions to a halt on monday jen psaki the white house press secretary said a us ban on russian flights was not off the table as shipping planes divert around russian airspace they will take longer and spend more on fuel and they may opt for smaller and lighter loads as a result buchman said especially on the air cargo side it will have a big impact already flights along major trade routes have slowed somewhat according to an analysis by flexport a logistics company flights between new delhi and london for example were about 8 per cent longer on average between wednesday and sunday than similar flights three months prior data from flightradar24 an aviation tracking firm showed loading longer trip times could create cascading delays and backlogs for industries that depend on airfreight including electronics semiconductors and fast fashion so far though the effects of the flight bans have been limited for passenger airlines there were already relatively few tourists travelling between europe and asia where many countries have strict coronavirus policies cargo carriers are nimble said john grant a senior consultant with oag an aviation advisory and data firm they

listen to this article listen to this article washington moscow s war on ukraine and the ferocious financial backlash it s unleashed are not only inflicting an economic catastrophe on president vladimir putin s russia the repercussions also are menacing the global economy shaking financial markets and making life more perilous for everyone from uzbek migrant workers to european consumers to hungry yemeni families even before putin s troops invaded ukraine the global economy was straining under a range of burdens surging inflation tangled supply chains tumbling stock prices the ukraine crisis both magnified each threat and complicated the potential solutions we are actually in uncharted territory said clay lowery executive vice president at the institute of international finance a trade group of global banks we know there are consequences that we cannot predict for now at least the damage to the overall global economy appears to be relatively slight if only because russia and ukraine are not economic powerhouses important as they are as exporters of energy precious metals wheat and other commodities the two together account for less than 2 of the world s gross domestic product most major economies have only limited trade exposure to russia for the u s it s 0 5 of total trade for china around 2 4 barring a major escalation of the war far from impossible the effects on the u s china and most of the emerging world should be limited said adam slater lead economist at oxford economics he foresees only a 0 2 drop in global gdp this year still russia is a vitally important supplier of oil natural gas and metals and higher prices for those commodities are sure to inflict economic damage around the world europe relies on russia for nearly 40 of its natural gas and 25 of its oil for the european continent russia s war has significantly heightened the likelihood of runaway inflation another economic setback or both here is a deeper look an economic siege infuriated by putin s aggression the united states and other western nations have targeted russia with sanctions of unprecedented breadth and severity for a major economy they have thrown major russian banks off the swift international payment system limited high tech exports to russia and severely restricted moscow s use of its foreign currency reserves the rapid and unified international retaliation against russia appeared to catch putin s regime by surprise the world or most of it anyway is laying economic siege to russia wrote carl weinberg chief economist at high frequency economics the sanctions quickly caused damage the russian ruble plunged to a record low monday depositors lined up at atms to try to withdraw their money from the embattled banking system cut off from google pay and apple pay russians were stuck at ticket booths at metro rail lines the institute of international finance foresees the russian economy enduring a double digit contraction this year worse even than its 7 8 drop in the great recession year of 2009 oxford economics said evidence from wars ranging from the 1980 1988 iran iraq war to the 1999 nato bombing campaign against serbia suggests that a staggering collapse of the ukrainian economy of 50 to 60 is possible hard times for europe with its dependence on energy from russia europe s economy is now especially at risk natural gas prices shot up 20 after the war started on top of earlier increases and now are roughly six times what they were at the start of 2021 the gas price shock is feeding higher inflation and swelling utility bills the result is that households have less money to spend and hopes for a surge in consumer spending resulting from fewer pandemic restrictions and covid 19 cases have diminished escalating gas prices have caused what economists call demand destruction among industrial enterprises like fertilizer makers that use a lot of gas and have now slashed production farmers are paying more to run machinery and buy fertilizer germany s economy which sagged by 0 7 in the fourth quarter of 2021 would face a technical recession if it shrank again in the first three months of 2022 the economic downdraft could be offset by an increase in german defense spending in response to the russian invasion chancellor olaf scholz has said the government would commit 100 billion euros 111 billion to a special fund for its armed forces and raise defense spending above 2 of gdp the drag from higher prices and the negative confidence affect may lower real gdp growth in the eurozone from 4 3 to 3 7 for 2022 said holger schmieding chief economist at berenberg bank no supply chain relief the world s unexpectedly robust recovery from the pandemic recession left companies scrambling to find enough raw materials and components to produce goods to meet surging customer demand overwhelmed factories ports and freight yards have meant shortages shipping delays and higher prices disruptions to russian and ukrainian industries could delay any return to normal conditions mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics noted that russia and ukraine together produce 70 of the world s neon critical in the making of semiconductors that is especially worrisome because the world and automakers in particular are already enduring a shortage of computer chips when russia seized crimea from ukraine eight years ago neon prices shot up 600 though zandi notes that chipmakers have since stockpiled neon and sought alternatives to russian supplies russia and ukraine together supply 13 of the world s titanium which is used to make passenger jets and 30 of the palladium which goes into cars cellphones and dental fillings zandi said russia also is a major producer of nickel used to produce electric car batteries and steel it s impossible for supply chains to catch up said vanessa miller a partner at foley lardner llp who specializes in supply chains trouble in the neighborhood the conflict and sanctions will also do damage to russia s neighbors in central asia as its own workforce has aged russia has turned to younger migrant workers from such countries such as uzbekistan and tajikistan those workers families have come to rely on the money they send home remittances even at the height of covid 19 in 2020 remittances from russia to uzbekistan topped 3 9 billion and to kyrgyzstan 2 billion according to the russian central bank the pressure on the ruble banking restrictions on foreigners and in the long run the collapse of the labor market in russia will have an immediate and profound economic impact on central asia gavin helf an expert on central asia for the u s institute of peace wrote this week a strain on food supplies ukraine and russia account for 30 of the world s exports of wheat 19 of corn and 80 of sunflower oil which is used in food processing much of the russian and ukrainian bounty goes to poor unstable countries like yemen and libya the threat to farms in eastern ukraine and a cutoff of exports through black sea ports could reduce food supplies just when prices are at their highest levels since 2011 and some countries are suffering from food shortages anna nagurney a management professor at the university of massachusetts amherst described the consequences as extremely troubling wheat corn oils barley flour are extremely important to food security nagurney said especially in the poorer parts of the globe with ports airports and rail lines closed and young ukrainian men fighting the russian invasion she asked who s going to be doing the harvesting who d be doing the transportation rising prices the ukraine war coincides with a high risk moment for the federal reserve and other central banks they were caught off guard by the surge in inflation over the past year the consequence mostly of the economy s unexpectedly strong recovery in january u s consumer prices rose 7 5 from a year earlier the biggest such jump since 1982 in europe figures out wednesday show inflation accelerated to a record 5 8 last month compared with a year earlier for the 19 countries that use the euro currency now the fighting and sanctions that have disrupted russia trade with the global economy threaten to send prices ever higher especially for energy russia and ukraine zandi said together produce 12 of the world s oil and 17 of its natural gas to combat inflation the fed is set to begin raising interest rates when it meets in two weeks reversing the ultra low rate policies it adopted in 2020 to help rescue the economy from the pandemic recession likewise the european central bank is gradually withdrawing its pandemic stimulus efforts but now central bankers must weigh intensifying inflationary pressure against the risk that the ukraine crisis will weaken economies in europe for now any hints of rate hikes are out of the question carsten brzeski chief of global macro at ing bank yet the fed roundly accused of being slow to recognize inflation s resurgence may continue its shift away from easy money policies barring a stock market collapse or a broadening of the war beyond ukraine zandi said i don t expect any change in the fed s conduct of monetary policy as a result of the economic cross currents created by the russian invasion of ukraine

gross margin of 132 5 million compared to retail gross margin of 196 5 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the decrease was primarily attributable to a smaller customer book particularly due

costs incurred in the current period plus or minus ii net gain loss on derivative instruments and iii net current period cash settlements on derivative instruments plus iv non cash compensation expense and v other non cash and non recurring operating items ebitda is defined as net income loss before the provision for income taxes interest expense and depreciation and amortization we deduct all current period customer acquisition costs representing spending for organic customer acquisitions in the adjusted ebitda calculation because such costs reflect a cash outlay in the period in which they are incurred even though we capitalize and amortize such costs over two years we do not deduct the cost of customer acquisitions through acquisitions of businesses or portfolios of customers in calculating adjusted ebitda we deduct our net gains losses on derivative instruments excluding current period cash settlements from the adjusted ebitda calculation in order to remove the non cash impact of net gains and losses on these instruments we also deduct non cash compensation expense that results from the issuance of restricted stock units under our long term incentive plan due to the non cash nature of the expense we adjust from time to time other non cash or unusual and or infrequent charges due to either their non cash nature or their infrequency we have historically included the financial impact of weather variability in the calculation of adjusted ebitda we will continue this historical approach but during the first quarter of 2021 we incurred a net pre tax financial loss of 64 9 million due to winter storm uri as described above this loss was incurred due to uncharacteristic extended sub freezing temperatures across texas combined with the impact of the pricing caps ordered by ercot we believe this event is unusual infrequent and non recurring in nature our lenders under our senior credit facility allowed 60 0 million of the 64 9 million pre tax storm loss incurred in the first quarter of 2021 to be added back as a non recurring item in the calculation of adjusted ebitda for our debt covenant calculations as our senior credit facility is considered a material agreement and adjusted ebitda is a key component of our material covenants we consider our covenant compliance to be material to the understanding of our financial condition and or liquidity we will present any credits received related to the storm exceeding 4 9 million as a reduction of the related 60 0 million non recurring add back to adjusted ebitda for consistent presentation there are no assurances credits will be received we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides information useful to investors in assessing our liquidity and financial condition and results of operations and that adjusted ebitda is also useful to investors as a financial indicator of our ability to incur and service debt pay dividends and fund capital expenditures adjusted ebitda is a supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts investors commercial banks and rating agencies use to assess the following our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the retail energy industry without regard to financing methods capital structure or historical cost basis the ability of our assets to generate earnings sufficient to support our proposed cash dividends our ability to fund capital expenditures including customer acquisition costs and incur and service debt and our compliance with financial debt covenants retail gross margin we define retail gross margin as operating income loss plus i depreciation and amortization expenses and ii general and administrative expenses less i net asset optimization revenues ii net gains losses on non trading derivative instruments and iii net current period cash settlements on non trading derivative instruments retail gross margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary performance measure used by our management to determine the performance of our retail natural gas and electricity business by removing the impacts of our asset optimization activities and net non cash income loss impact of our economic hedging activities as an indicator of our retail energy business operating performance retail gross margin should not be considered an alternative to or more meaningful than operating income loss its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we believe retail gross margin provides information useful to investors as an indicator of our retail energy business s operating performance we have historically included the financial impact of weather variability in the calculation of retail gross margin we will continue this historical approach but during the first quarter of 2021 we added back the 64 9 million net financial loss incurred related to winter storm uri as described above in the calculation of retail gross margin because the extremity of the texas storm combined with the impact of unprecedented pricing mechanisms ordered by ercot is considered unusual infrequent and non recurring in nature we received credits totaling 0 5 million related to winter storm uri costs in the third quarter of 2021 which is included in the calculation of retail gross margin for consistent presentation the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net income loss and net cash provided by operating activities the gaap measure most directly comparable to retail gross margin is operating income loss our non gaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss net cash provided by operating activities or operating income loss adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin are not presentations made in accordance with gaap and have important limitations as analytical tools you should not consider adjusted ebitda or retail gross margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap because adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin exclude some but not all items that affect net income loss and net cash provided by operating activities and are defined differently by different companies in our industry our definition of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies management compensates for the limitations of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these data

denver metro district residents in colorado would have been able to instantly toss from their local neighborhood board any member with ties to the developers building their community under a state senate bill discussed tuesday but heavy opposition from developers and metro district proponents scuttled senate bill 22 136 which died in that chamber s local government committee the panel killed the measure after hearing from several residents who testified of abuses they ve experienced through the years developers bankers finance experts and lawyers that work or control metro districts testified how any changes to current law would affect future home building in a state thirsty for it metro districts are largely how new housing is built in colorado they argued that the measure would discourage development and ultimately exacerbate colorado s housing woes senators weren t completely against any reform sen chris kolker d centennial was emphatic that metro districts face many problems that need to be fixed he just didn t think this bill did the trick there are significant things that require reform kolker said for one there are too many conflicts of interest in developing metro districts residents at the hearing decried a lack of voice with how a metro district s property taxes are calculated nearly all of it leveraged on municipal bonds issued by a district s board of directors districts are typically formed by developers who own the land where homes will be built in that process the developers decide how much debt future residents will pay to cover the costs of building a district s infrastructure such as sidewalks sewers and roads bonds are issued and residents have no approval or say in the process when i saw what was going on here it was alarming and i m thinking i was chicken little with her head cut off said terese charles a metro district resident we re only 175 houses and we are millions and millions of dollars in debt bill sponsor sen tammy story d conifer the lone supporting vote seemed surprised at some residents testimony sens joann ginal d fort collins chris holbert r parker and paul lundeen r monument joined kolker voting against it this is just astounding story said the residents have basically no voice it s taxation without representation it s a significant conflict of interest for developers the bill would have required metro district boards that are largely composed of people with ties to its developer to disclose that conflict of interest in a mailer before each scheduled meeting sign up for free news alerts stay in the know on the stories that affect you the most sign up for free view all of our newsletters success thank you for subscribing to our newsletter view all of our newsletters additionally the mailer would have included a self nomination form that a resident can submit to take over the seat of a board member who doesn t actually live in the district and has ties to the developer and legally permitted to sit on the board under the proposal the board must terminate the developer affiliated position and immediately appoint the resident who submitted the self nomination form to that seat in cases where residents submit more self nominating forms than developer affiliated positions available for termination the board has to call a special election to fill the seats the bill would have also allowed residents to bring citizen initiatives for local election which they currently cannot do there are a lot of people with a lot of money who want to see corporate control of metro districts continue said charles wolfersberger an accountant who manages metro districts whose board of directors are resident controlled wolfersberger showed senators several examples where interest rates returns on construction bonds issued by developer controlled metro district boards all to be paid by the residents who will eventually move there are as high as 40 percent in some cases the developer is the owner and beneficiary of the bonds in jefferson county metro district resident fayre ruszczyk told legislators of the 27 metro districts with the highest mills property tax levy 20 are controlled by developers developers frequently qualify someone to be on a metro district board by giving an option to purchase a sliver of land without actually buying it to a family member friend or associate in some cases metro districts are formed by as few as two people it just is so ridiculous that the developers can sit down with themselves as board members and decide how to tax the electors and then benefit tremendously from that billions of dollars applied to electors who cannot ever get over this in their lifetime story said developers balked at the possibility that residents could simply file a form to unseat a metro district board member regardless of their affiliation to the developer and warned that financial ruin could follow there will not be the will to fund infrastructure said zach bishop with investment banker piper sandler these early stage costs are high and colorado will exacerbate its ability to provide housing by passing this bill residents still have the right to unseat a board member through a recall noted barbara biggs who spoke for the special district association the trade group that represents special districts which include metro districts voters already have the right to vote against someone they don t like she said jim gibson a critic of developer controlled boards said one developer controlled 146 metro district board seats by the people it placed there and one person held seats on 73 metro district boards the last time that i checked each of you only held one elected seat gibson said to the senators

davenport iowa march 02 2022 globe newswire lee enterprises inc nasdaq lee lee or the company today announced that independent proxy advisory firm glass lewis co llc glass lewis has recommended that lee shareholders vote on lee s white proxy card for all of lee s director nominees with a similar recommendation from institutional shareholder services iss announced yesterday both leading proxy advisory firms have rejected the withhold campaign that alden global capital llc together with its affiliates alden is waging against two of lee s nominees the lee enterprises board of directors commented we urge shareholders to ignore alden s disingenuous self serving campaign and support the lee nominees consistent with the glass lewis and iss recommendations lee s three nominees chairman

experience valuable insights and hard work as we execute our strategy and build value for all shareholders in making its recommendation glass lewis noted1 upon review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this campaign we find significant cause to question alden s actions and we do not believe lee s shareholders would be best served by supporting its campaign e find lee s total shareholder returns have been strong in recent periods particularly since the bhmg acquisition and over the last 12 to 18 months as the company has reported progress and measurable results on its transformation strategy those results include industry leading growth in digital subscribers digital advertising revenue and total digital revenue achieved under the current board and management s strategy alden s reputation and track record stated view on how to fix newspaper firms for the digital environment and recent campaigns at two other newspaper companies suggest alden is attempting to advance its well established agenda by seeking to destabilize lee s current leadership with hopes of acquiring the company on the cheap based on the strategy and results this board has delivered to date since lee embarked on its transformation process we see no reason to support efforts that would threaten to disrupt the company s progress or potentially enable an investor with questionable intentions to seek to reap the benefits of this strategy or the inherent value of lee solely for itself lee s board urges shareholders to protect their investment by voting for all the board s three nominees using the white proxy card if you have already returned a blue proxy card sent by alden you can change your vote by signing dating and returning a white proxy card only your latest dated proxy card will be

early japanese buddhist art is usually divided into three periods from the arrival of the faith to the highly refined art of the heian period 794 1184 the more ascetic kamakura period 1185 1333 during the reign of the first shoguns and the muromachi period 1335 1573 what forms does it take over the centuries thousands of statues and sculptures were made for temples and monasteries paintings often executed in ink on silk were also hung up for ceremonies or rituals while scrolls with more secular themes began to appear in the later kamakura period the main subject of course was the buddha and stories from his life though images of other deities or guardians were also produced in large numbers there is a wide variety of topics and styles especially in painting says julia meech the editor of impressions the journal of the japanese art society of america they range from simple paintings of buddhist sages in ink on paper where the interest is in the brushwork to temple paintings on silk with gold leaf often paintings combine elements of calligraphy such as excerpts from religious texts with images in the later heian and early kamakura periods chanting the name of the deities depicted was believed to generate a karmic link between the worshipper and the object of devotion
semiconductor manufacturers are warily eyeing global stocks of neon xenon and palladium necessary to manufacture their products makers of potato chips and cosmetics could face shortages of sunflower oil the bulk of which is produced in russia and ukraine and if the conflict is prolonged it could threaten the summer wheat harvest which flows into bread pasta and packaged food for vast numbers of people especially in europe north africa and the middle east food prices have already skyrocketed because of disruptions in the global supply chain increasing the risk of social unrest in poorer countries on tuesday the global shipping giant maersk announced that it would temporarily suspend all shipments to and from russia by ocean air and rail with the exception of food and medicine ocean network express hapag lloyd and msc the world s other major ocean carriers have announced similar suspensions the war just makes the worldwide situation for commodities more dire said christopher f graham a partner at white and williams jennifer mckeown head of global economics service at capital economics said the global economy appeared relatively insulated from the conflict but she said shortages of materials like palladium and xenon used in semiconductor and auto production could add to current difficulties for those industries semiconductor shortages have halted production at car plants and other facilities fuelling price increases and weighing on sales that could add to the shortages that we re already seeing exacerbate those shortages and end up causing further damage to global growth she said international companies are also trying to comply with sweeping financial sanctions and export controls imposed by europe the united states and a number of other countries that have clamped down on flows of goods and money in and out of russia in just a few days western governments moved to exclude certain russian banks from using the swift messaging system limit the russian central bank s ability to prop up the rouble cut off shipments of high tech goods and freeze the global assets of russian oligarchs the biden administration said the technology restrictions alone would stop about a fifth of russian imports but the impact on trade from the financial curbs is likely to be even larger cutting off russia s imports from and exports to nearly all of its major trading partners said eswar prasad a professor of trade policy at cornell university even when trade flows may take place directly between russia and its trading partners the reality is that payments often have to go through a western dominated financial system and usually have to go through a western currency he said in a statement saturday european commission president ursula von der leyen said europe and its allies were resolved to continue imposing massive costs on russia and that disconnecting russian banks from swift would also halt russian trade loading cutting banks off will stop them from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide and effectively block russian exports and imports she said the economic consequences of these moves are not yet entirely clear russia accounts for less than 2 per cent of global domestic product so the implications for other countries may be somewhat limited but for the russian government and the economy both of which are heavily dependent on trade to generate revenue the impact could be catastrophic capitol economics has estimated russian gross domestic product could contract by 5 per cent this year a change that in isolation would knock just 0 2 percentage points off global growth caroline bain chief commodities economist at capitol economics said financial sanctions were halting the trade of metals and agricultural commodities likely exacerbating strains in global supply chains credit suisse and société generale have suspended financing for commodity trading with russia as has the industrial and commercial bank of china she said while the economic implications of the war and sweeping sanctions on russia are not yet clear many industries are bracing for a bad situation to get worse there could be quite a bit of self sanctioning going on obviously people are quite nervous about taking up contracts on russian commodities when everything is so uncertain bain said while governments haven t released many specifics on what kind of trades will be allowed she added our understanding is that all trade apart from energy is being targeted the conflict may also ripple through some industries by disrupting the flight networks that companies use to deliver goods globally shipping ports around the black sea have closed halting dozens of cargo vessels but the more immediate effects are likely to be felt in air shipments between asia and europe which now have to divert around russian airspace said eytan buchman chief marketing officer of the freightos group a digital freight booking platform already hit hard by the pandemic the russia ukraine war is exacerbating the world s supply chain crisis credit ap western europe and russia have imposed reciprocal flight bans bringing travel between the two regions to a halt on monday jen psaki the white house press secretary said a us ban on russian flights was not off the table as shipping planes divert around russian airspace they will take longer and spend more on fuel and they may opt for smaller and lighter loads as a result buchman said especially on the air cargo side it will have a big impact already flights along major trade routes have slowed somewhat according to an analysis by flexport a logistics company flights between new delhi and london for example were about 8 per cent longer on average between wednesday and sunday than similar flights three months prior data from flightradar24 an aviation tracking firm showed loading longer trip times could create cascading delays and backlogs for industries that depend on airfreight including electronics semiconductors and fast fashion so far though the effects of the flight bans have been limited for passenger airlines there were already relatively few tourists

semiconductor manufacturers are warily eyeing global stocks of neon xenon and palladium necessary to manufacture their products makers of potato chips and cosmetics could face shortages of sunflower oil the bulk of which is produced in russia and ukraine and if the conflict is prolonged it could threaten the summer wheat harvest which flows into bread pasta and packaged food for vast numbers of people especially in europe north africa and the middle east food prices have already skyrocketed because of disruptions in the global supply chain increasing the risk of social unrest in poorer countries on tuesday the global shipping giant maersk announced that it would temporarily suspend all shipments to and from russia by ocean air and rail with the exception of food and medicine ocean network express hapag lloyd and msc the world s other major ocean carriers have announced similar suspensions the war just makes the worldwide situation for commodities more dire said christopher f graham a partner at white and williams jennifer mckeown head of global economics service at capital economics said the global economy appeared relatively insulated from the conflict but she said shortages of materials like palladium and xenon used in semiconductor and auto production could add to current difficulties for those industries semiconductor shortages have halted production at car plants and other facilities fuelling price increases and weighing on sales that could add to the shortages that we re already seeing exacerbate those shortages and end up causing further damage to global growth she said international companies are also trying to comply with sweeping financial sanctions and export controls imposed by europe the united states and a number of other countries that have clamped down on flows of goods and money in and out of russia in just a few days western governments moved to exclude certain russian banks from using the swift messaging system limit the russian central bank s ability to prop up the rouble cut off shipments of high tech goods and freeze the global assets of russian oligarchs the biden administration said the technology restrictions alone would stop about a fifth of russian imports but the impact on trade from the financial curbs is likely to be even larger cutting off russia s imports from and exports to nearly all of its major trading partners said eswar prasad a professor of trade policy at cornell university even when trade flows may take place directly between russia and its trading partners the reality is that payments often have to go through a western dominated financial system and usually have to go through a western currency he said in a statement saturday european commission president ursula von der leyen said europe and its allies were resolved to continue imposing massive costs on russia and that disconnecting russian banks from swift would also halt russian trade loading cutting banks off will stop them from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide and effectively block russian exports and imports she said the economic consequences of these moves are not yet entirely clear russia accounts for less than 2 per cent of global domestic product so the implications for other countries may be somewhat limited but for the russian government and the economy both of which are heavily dependent on trade to generate revenue the impact could be catastrophic capitol economics has estimated russian gross domestic product could contract by 5 per cent this year a change that in isolation would knock just 0 2 percentage points off global growth caroline bain chief commodities economist at capitol economics said financial sanctions were halting the trade of metals and agricultural commodities likely exacerbating strains in global supply chains credit suisse and société generale have suspended financing for commodity trading with russia as has the industrial and commercial bank of china she said while the economic implications of the war and sweeping sanctions on russia are not yet clear many industries are bracing for a bad situation to get worse there could be quite a bit of self sanctioning going on obviously people are quite nervous about taking up contracts on russian commodities when everything is so uncertain bain said while governments haven t released many specifics on what kind of trades will be allowed she added our understanding is that all trade apart from energy is being targeted the conflict may also ripple through some industries by disrupting the flight networks that companies use to deliver goods globally shipping ports around the black sea have closed halting dozens of cargo vessels but the more immediate effects are likely to be felt in air shipments between asia and europe which now have to divert around russian airspace said eytan buchman chief marketing officer of the freightos group a digital freight booking platform already hit hard by the pandemic the russia ukraine war is exacerbating the world s supply chain crisis credit ap western europe and russia have imposed reciprocal flight bans bringing travel between the two regions to a halt on monday jen psaki the white house press secretary said a us ban on russian flights was not off the table as shipping planes divert around russian airspace they will take longer and spend more on fuel and they may opt for smaller and lighter loads as a result buchman said especially on the air cargo side it will have a big impact already flights along major trade routes have slowed somewhat according to an analysis by flexport a logistics company flights between new delhi and london for example were about 8 per cent longer on average between wednesday and sunday than similar flights three months prior data from flightradar24 an aviation tracking firm showed loading longer trip times could create cascading delays and backlogs for industries that depend on airfreight including electronics semiconductors and fast fashion so far though the effects of the flight bans have been limited for passenger airlines there were already relatively few tourists

our expectations or any change in events conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based except as required by law reconciliation of non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues we prepare and release quarterly unaudited and annual audited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we also disclose and discuss certain non gaap financial information used to evaluate our performance in this and other earnings releases and investor conference calls as a complement to results provided in accordance with gaap we believe that current shareholders and potential investors in our company use non gaap financial measures such as adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues in making investment decisions about our company and measuring our operational results the term â œadjusted ebitdaâ refers to a financial measure that we define as earnings before certain charges that management considers to be non operating expenses and which consist of interest taxes depreciation amortization stock based compensation for which we include related fees and taxes and other charges for which we include restructuring charges and acquisition related expenses adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues divides adjusted ebitda for a period by the revenues for the corresponding period and expresses the quotient as a percentage management considers these non operating expenses to be outside the scope of descartesâ ongoing operations and the related expenses are not used by management to measure operations accordingly these expenses are excluded from adjusted ebitda which we reference to both measure our operations and as a basis of comparison of our operations from period to period management believes that investors and financial analysts measure our business on the same basis and we are providing the adjusted ebitda financial metric to assist in this evaluation and to provide a higher level of transparency into how we measure our own business however adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues are non gaap financial measures and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues should not be construed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with gaap or other non gaap measures that may be used by other companies such as ebitda the use of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues does have limitations in particular we have completed seven acquisitions since the beginning of fiscal 2021 and may complete additional acquisitions in the future that will result in acquisition related expenses and restructuring charges as these acquisition related expenses and restructuring charges may continue as we pursue our consolidation strategy some investors may consider these charges and expenses as a recurring part of operations rather than expenses that are not part of operations the table below reconciles adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues to net income reported in our unaudited

chair jerome powell said wednesday that he supports a traditional quarter point increase in the federal reserve s benchmark short term interest rate when the fed meets later this month rather than a larger increase that some of its policymakers have proposed but powell did open the door to a bigger hike in the event that inflation which has reached a four decade high doesn t noticeably decline this year as the fed expects it to i m inclined to propose and support a quarter point rate hike to fight the acceleration of inflation that has engulfed the economy in recent months powell told the house financial services committee on the first of two days of semiannual testimony to congress most other fed officials have in recent weeks supported a similar modest rise while a few have said they back a half point hike or are at least open to such an increase higher fed rates typically lead in turn to higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses including for homes and auto loans and credit cards we have an expectation that inflation will peak and begin to come down this year powell said but he added to the extent inflation comes in higher then we would be prepared to move more aggressively by raising rates by more than a quarter point later this year the stock market rose in response to powell s support of the smaller increase the s p 500 jumped 1 7 in mid day trading the fed chair cautioned that the economic consequences of russia s invasion of ukraine and the resulting sanctions by the us and europe are highly uncertain and said it s too soon to say how they might affect the fed s policies before russia s invasion the fed planned to carry out a series of rate increases this year powell said potentially at each of the remaining seven fed meetings for now the fed will proceed carefully along the lines of that plan economists have forecast that the fed will implement five to seven quarter point hikes this year powell spoke a day after president joe biden said in his state of the union address that my top priority is getting prices under control this month s increase would be the first since 2018 and it would mark the beginning of a delicate challenge for the fed it wants to increase rates enough to reduce inflation now at a four decade high but not so fast as to choke off growth and hiring powell is betting that with the unemployment rate low at 4 and consumer spending solid the economy can withstand modestly higher borrowing costs the fed s rate is now pegged near zero where it has been since the pandemic struck in march 2020 and the fed responded by slashing interest rates to help support the economy powell acknowledged that consumer price increases have jumped far above the fed s target of 2 inflation hit 7 5 in january compared with a year earlier and that higher prices had persisted longer than expected he also pledged to use the fed s tools to bring inflation back down to its target we understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food housing and transportation the fed chair said under questioning by rep roger williams a texas republican powell said he believes the fed can reduce inflation without tipping the economy into recession one reason he thinks so powell said is that the economy is strong now with solid growth and the unemployment rate at a low 4 the fed chair added that the central bank expects inflation to gradually decline this year as tangled supply chains unravel and consumers pull back a bit on spending many economists agree with him but nevertheless think inflation will stay elevated rising prices are spreading beyond items that were disrupted by the pandemic autos electronics furniture and other household goods into broader categories of spending especially rental costs goldman sachs has raised its forecast for inflation and now predicts that prices according to the fed s preferred measure will still be rising at a relatively high annual rate of 3 7 by year s end that is far above the fed s own most recent projection issued in december of 2 7 powell said the fed will also begin reducing its huge 9 trillion balance sheet which more than doubled during the pandemic when the fed bought trillions of dollars of bonds to try to hold down longer term rates he said the central bank s policymakers will likely agree on a plan for how to shrink its bond holdings when it meets in two weeks but declined to say when the plan might be implemented oxford economics a consulting firm projects that the fed will reduce its holdings by about 400 billion this year which it estimates would have the effect of rates hikes adding up to roughly one half of a percentage point the ukraine crisis has driven up oil prices by about 18 to roughly 110 a barrel which will make gas more expensive some economists have forecast that average gas prices could soon reach 4 a gallon up from a national average of 3 66 wednesday costlier energy will send inflation even higher than it otherwise would have been in the coming months bolstering the case for fed rate hikes but more expensive gas also deprives consumers of money to spend on other things this in turn will likely hold down consumer spending and potentially weaken the economy a scenario that would usually discourage the fed from raising rates powell warned that the war could lead to shortages of such commodities as neon gas and palladium which are used to produce semiconductors a lack of computer chips last year slowed production of cars and electronics and contributed to high inflation but the fed chair also suggested that the war s overall effect on the us economy may be limited as long as the conflict doesn t significantly escalate only about 0 5 of us trade is with russia our financial institutions and our economy do not have large interactions with the russian economy he said and it s gotten smaller and smaller in recent years source ap
house speaker ryan fecteau visited brunswick wednesday to tout a bill aimed at expanding maine s housing stock by allowing single family homeowners to build a secondary housing unit on their property fecteau s bill would put nine recommendations from the state s commission to increase opportunities in maine by studying zoning and land use restrictions into law the lack of affordable housing has reached a crisis level fecteau said before it impacts our children s futures and their ability to make a life for themselves in maine i believe we need to act we can do that today by simply removing outdated zoning regulations that prevent housing from being built one of those recommendations is to allow an accessory dwelling unit to be built on the property of any single family home in maine the smaller living units can either be attached to the original home exist within the footprint of the original home or be independent from the home on the same lot homeowners can freely build a structure for their son returning home from college to look for his first job or older mainers can be taken care of close to their grandchildren aging joyfully with the family they love said fecteau it would be a godsend for so many families to be able to take care of a loved one right on the property they already own and the primary dwelling they ve lived in all their lives according to a news release maine needs to build 1 000 affordable units each year to meet demand but only 25 of that need was met on average from 2014 2020 advertisement maine housing authority director daniel brennan said he didn t know how many secondary units could be built as a result of this bill but said once municipalities make it easier for people to do people are going to realize how easy it is fecteau said allowing mainers to build in law apartments or cottages on their property benefits communities as well because it doesn t take away other land that could be used for commercial properties while diversifying an area s population chris lee builds detached units through his brunswick based company backyard adus lee said his company has built 15 units each year in 2020 and 2021 and plans to build another 20 30 this year lee said most of the units he builds are between 700 800 square feet have two bedrooms and cost about 200 000 230 000 about 75 of the units he builds are for an aging parent on their adult child s land said lee this allows the aging parent or couple to be taken care of and be close to their grandchildren building a smaller unit for an elderly parent or couple also frees up space for other demographics in the area who need to find appropriate and affordable housing lee said the elderly couple can sell a house that s too big for them and a young family can buy it instead of buying a smaller condo that a young professional can then move into said lee advertisement related small housing units growing bigger in maine brunswick code enforcement officer and zoning administrator julie erdman told the times record last month over 100 of these secondary living units have cropped up in brunswick erdman said this type of housing is attractive because it gives people a place to live and serves as a source of income for the owner but doesn t impact the density of an area a lot of the time people might make an accessory apartment with the intention of having family there but use it as a rental down the road said erdman i think a lot of people are able to make ends meet by renting them out in neighboring bath city councilors gave preliminary approval last month to a new rule that lets residents create and rent out a living unit on the same property as their single or two family home councilors are expected to give final approval to that rule wednesday evening bath has 2 640 single family or two family residences that would qualify to add a living unit as a result of this new rule according to bath housing director deb keller if just 5 of those eligible residents took advantage of the allowance it would add 132 new housing units in the city aside from providing more housing for those looking to move to bath keller said the increase in housing could have ripple effects that benefit the region s workforce shortage we have seen an increase in rental prices over the past five years in the 70 range and it s clear that wages haven t kept pace with housing costs said keller the shortage of housing in the entire region spanning bath brunswick topsham freeport and surrounding towns has impacted our ability to build and sustain a strong workforce there isn t a quick fix but we need more housing and we need to be working at this problem from a variety of angles mainehousing spokesperson scott thistle said the authority supports adding secondary units to single family homes as long as they aren t used for short term rentals like airbnb as they take that property off the housing market we are even more supportive of adus that would be added to existing single family homes if they are provided as affordable rents for those who may otherwise struggle to pay for a market rate unit in these extraordinarily tight and costly housing markets said thistle aside from giving the green light to secondary living units fecteau said his bill would empower municipalities to make changes to foster better conditions for housing construction and forge a state and local partnership to address the housing crisis the bill also holds incentives for communities to discuss and address zoning issues related headlines maine s housing crisis is building a

renewables we successfully rebranded to show our commitment to provide green energy to our customers we persevered through winter storm uri which resulted in power and ancillary costs reaching maximum allowed clearing prices coupled with increased demand the result of which resulted in a significant loss reflected in the first quarter in spite of this loss we were able to remain liquid and secured customer book acquisitions for approximately 107k rces to bolster our customer book we named two new c suite executives with decades of combined retail experience to lead our team and carry out our sustainability goals we believe via renewables has laid the ground work to be successful in 2022 said keith maxwell via s chief executive officer and chairman of the board looking forward to 2022 our

decrease in adjusted ebitda was due to lower gross margin quarter over quarter partially offset by decreases in g a expenses for the quarter ended december 31 2021 via renewables reported retail gross margin of 25 2 million compared to retail gross margin of 49 0 million for the quarter ended december 31 2020 this decrease is attributable to fewer customers in our overall portfolio throughout the

ebitda of 106 6 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the decrease was primarily due to decreases in both power and gas usage partially offset by higher gas margins the decrease was also offset

million compared to retail gross margin of 196 5 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the decrease was primarily attributable to a smaller customer book particularly due to restrictions on our organic sales channels limiting our ability to ramp up sales the shift in the customer mix towards more residential contracts not only reduces the risk in the portfolio but also has a positive impact

current period plus or minus ii net gain loss on derivative instruments and iii net current period cash settlements on derivative instruments plus iv non cash compensation expense and v other non cash and non recurring operating items ebitda is defined as net income loss before the provision for income taxes interest expense and depreciation and amortization we deduct all current period customer acquisition costs representing spending for organic customer acquisitions in the adjusted ebitda calculation because such costs reflect a cash outlay in the period in which they are incurred even though we capitalize and amortize such costs over two years we do not deduct the cost of customer acquisitions through acquisitions of businesses or portfolios of customers in calculating adjusted ebitda we deduct our net gains losses on derivative instruments excluding current period cash settlements from the adjusted ebitda calculation in order to remove the non cash impact of net gains and losses on these instruments we also deduct non cash compensation expense that results from the issuance of restricted stock units under our long term incentive plan due to the non cash nature of the expense we adjust from time to time other non cash or unusual and or infrequent charges due to either their non cash nature or their infrequency we have historically included the financial impact of weather variability in the calculation of adjusted ebitda we will continue this historical approach but during the first quarter of 2021 we incurred a net pre tax financial loss of 64 9 million due to winter storm uri as described above this loss was incurred due to uncharacteristic extended sub freezing temperatures across texas combined with the impact of the pricing caps ordered by ercot we believe this event is unusual infrequent and non recurring in nature our lenders under our senior credit facility allowed 60 0 million of the 64 9 million pre tax storm loss incurred in the first quarter of 2021 to be added back as a non recurring item in the calculation of adjusted ebitda for our debt covenant calculations as our senior credit facility is considered a material agreement and adjusted ebitda is a key component of our material covenants we consider our covenant compliance to be material to the understanding of our financial condition and or liquidity we will present any credits received related to the storm exceeding 4 9 million as a reduction of the related 60 0 million non recurring add back to adjusted ebitda for consistent presentation there are no assurances credits will be received we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides information useful to investors in assessing our liquidity and financial condition and results of operations and that adjusted ebitda is also useful to investors as a financial indicator of our ability to incur and service debt pay dividends and fund capital expenditures adjusted ebitda is a supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts investors commercial banks and rating agencies use to assess the following our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the retail energy industry without regard to financing methods capital structure or historical cost basis the ability of our assets to generate earnings sufficient to support our proposed cash dividends our ability to fund capital expenditures including customer acquisition costs and incur and service debt and our compliance with financial debt covenants retail gross margin we define retail gross margin as operating income loss plus i depreciation and amortization expenses and ii general and administrative expenses less i net asset optimization revenues ii net gains losses on non trading derivative instruments and iii net current period cash settlements on non trading derivative instruments retail gross margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary performance measure used by our management to determine the performance of our retail natural gas and electricity business by removing the impacts of our asset optimization activities and net non cash income loss impact of our economic hedging activities as an indicator of our retail energy business operating performance retail gross margin should not be considered an alternative to or more meaningful than operating income loss its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we believe retail gross margin provides information useful to investors as an indicator of our retail energy business s operating performance we have historically included the financial impact of weather variability in the calculation of retail gross margin we will continue this historical approach but during the first quarter of 2021 we added back the 64 9 million net financial loss incurred related to winter storm uri as described above in the calculation of retail gross margin because the extremity of the texas storm combined with the impact of unprecedented pricing mechanisms ordered by ercot is considered unusual infrequent and non recurring in nature we received credits totaling 0 5 million related to winter storm uri costs in the third quarter of 2021 which is included in the calculation of retail gross margin for consistent presentation the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net income loss and net cash provided by operating activities the gaap measure most directly comparable to retail gross margin is operating income loss our non gaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss net cash provided by operating activities or operating income loss adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin are not presentations made in accordance with gaap and have important limitations as analytical tools you should not consider adjusted ebitda or retail gross margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap because adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin exclude some but not all items that affect net income loss and net cash provided by operating activities and are defined differently by different companies in our industry our definition of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies management compensates for the limitations of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these data points into management s decision

with television anchors and others biden said he would re emphasize my determination to see to it that the eu nato all of our allies are on the same exact page in terms of sanctions against russia and how we deal with the invasion and it is an invasion of ukraine this from a tweet by cnn anchor jake tapper who also reported that biden declared global unity the one thing that gives us power to impose severe consequences on putin for what he s done presidents host these kinds of lunches with television anchors before every state of the union address the sessions are off the record but white houses often put a few comments on the record in this case biden wanted to make clear his message on ukraine david jackson more americans are at higher risk of russian cyberattacks after ukraine invasion what you should do right now biden will roll out mental health crisis strategies biden will outline his plan for tackling the mental health crisis during his first state of the union the white house said tuesday that biden will call on congress to pass legislation to support those policies that increase the capacity of the mental health system to provide care make it easier for those who need care to get it and address the determinants of health among the policies he will pitch according to the white house a plan to spend 700 million on training scholarship and loan repayment for those who pursue careers in mental health and substance abuse treatment in rural communities and other underserved areas a proposal that health plans cover robust behavioral health services with an adequate network of providers including three behavioral health visits each year without cost sharing to address concerns about digital technology and social media damage to the mental health of young people biden wants to ban targeted advertising for children online and stop online algorithms from returning results that damage their mental well being rick rouan pelosi won t be wearing a mask during state of the union as she sits behind president joe biden during his state of the union address house speaker nancy pelosi will be mask less i m not going to be wearing a mask tonight pelosi told msnbc tuesday if i had little children or if i were around little grandchildren i would because some of them would not be vaccinated democratic house leadership lifted its mask mandate in the house in time for the president s first state of the union it comes as the rate of positive covid 19 test results dropped to 2 7 at the capitol s testing site according to politico and as the district of columbia dropped its indoor mask mandate as covid 19 cases have plummeted in washington the white house on tuesday ended its mask requirement for vaccinated staff members but white house press secretary jen psaki on monday said she hadn t spoken to biden on whether he will wear a mask when he walks into the house chamber he will certainly not be wearing a mask when he s speaking psaki said joey garrison what was the shortest state of the union the longest which presidents delivered the longest and the shortest state of the unions it depends on your measuring stick based on word count president george washington s delivered the shortest speech on record in 1790 before the annual message was even dubbed the state of the union washington s speech to a joint session of congress measured in at 1 089 words according to the congressional research service not every president has delivered an oral message however after president thomas jefferson eschewed a speech in favor of a written message to congress in 1801 it took more than a century before president woodrow wilson revived the tradition of an in person speech in 1913 dating back to 1964 the shortest oral delivery of a state of the union was president ronald reagan s 31 minute speech in 1986 according to the american presidency project at the university of california santa barbara the congressional research service noted that speech still had a word count about three times as long as washington s inaugural annual message the longest written message to date belongs to president jimmy carter who delivered a 33 667 word written state of the union in 1981 in his final state of the union in 2000 president bill clinton set the high watermark for an in person speech at just under 90 minutes president donald trump s 80 minute average is the longest of all presidents dating to 1964 according to the american presidency project rick rouan why is this biden s first state of the union the concept of an annual update from the president to members of congress has existed as long as the presidency president george washington delivered the first of what was then called the annual message in 1790 that is rooted in the constitutional requirement to provide an update from time to time the speech was not formally named the state of the union until 1947 according to the congressional research service but recent tradition has been for presidents to not deliver a formal state of the union in the year they were inaugurated but instead to simply speak before a joint session of congress president joe biden did that in 2021 as the six presidents before him had done in their inauguration years that means biden s 2022 address will be his first formal state of the union rick rouan

from relatively limited exposure to russia which has been saddled with a sweeping array of government sanctions in the wake of its escalating aggression toward ukraine investors have also been betting that the conflict will delay interest rate hikes central banks best weapon against surging inflation as russia s role as a global oil and gas giant means that costs of cutting ties with the country will quickly cascade through the world economy but federal reserve chair jerome powell said it would still be reasonable to raise rates in march citing inflation well above 2 and a strong labor market in remarks prepared for the house financial services committee powell indicated he would support the central bank raising its benchmark interest rate 25 basis points lower than many investors had priced in if inflation continues to heat up after dropping sharply tuesday the dow rebounded in afternoon trading to close up 1 8 or 600 points the broader s p 500 gained 1 8 or 80 points the tech heavy nasdaq advanced 219 points for a gain of 1 6 russia s invasion of ukraine its impact on global energy prices potential to fuel inflation and possible hit to economic growth as economic sanctions take effect is clearly prompting a shift in investors expectations russ mould investment director at aj bell said wednesday in comments emailed to the washington post european indexes which have sold off sharply as businesses felt the weight of sanctions also recovered wednesday europe is heavily reliant on russia for oil and gas as well as other critical commodities the benchmark stoxx 600 index closed up 0 9 while france s cac40 gained nearly 1 6 britain s ftse100 closed up more than 1 3 government bonds an investor safe haven also edged higher in response to powell s testimony with the

trading around 1 928 60 per troy ounce as march trading gets underway stocks are likely to see a continuation of the volatility that has dominated in 2022 analysts say companies were already being vexed by labor shortages a deeply distressed global supply chain soaring inflation and the coronavirus pandemic s continued threats before the crisis in ukraine earlier this week the u s government and its european allies introduced massive penalties that banned all people in the united states and european union from trading with russia s central bank the sanctions also apply to russia s finance ministry and its sovereign wealth fund in recent days officials had also moved to bar several major russian banks from swift a global monetary transfer service crack down on russian oligarchs and prevent russia s central bank from bailing out the domestic economy the united states joined europe and canada on tuesday in closing its airspace to russia a move russia has reciprocated which is likely to jack up travel costs oil prices continued their explosive ride booming more than 8 in premarket trading in the wake of news that the international energy agency was releasing 60 million

111 per barrel both have been pushed past seven year highs amid the fears of disruption while it appears that the market is somewhat immune to the sanctions the oil element is more of a wild card chris larkin managing director of trading at e trade from morgan stanley said wednesday in comments emailed to the post if the russian invasion disrupts oil supplies the trickledown effect could be significant oil prices had already spiked more than 40 since december largely boosted by inventory pressures and russia s threats toward ukraine the national average for a gallon of gas in the u s crested at 3 65 on wednesday up from 3 39 a month ago according to aaa opec the cartel of oil producing nations said wednesday that it would not dramatically increase oil output in response to the crisis in ukraine opting instead to stick to an earlier plan to increase the daily output by 400 000 barrels next month it has been gradually adding that much oil each month to correct drawdowns that occurred earlier in the pandemic when demand for fuel plummeted a significant increase in output might have taken some of the pressure off global energy markets but opec concluded that such an infusion was unnecessary because the current market turmoil is tied to geopolitical events market fundamentals were sound the group said in a press statement powerhouse russian stocks cratered wednesday with london listed giants lukoil sinking 95 and gazprom plunging more than 50 russian markets were closed for the third straight day as the bank of russia tried to keep money from flooding out of its economy which was already showing signs of severe distress before the new measures were implemented last week as the incursion into ukraine unfolded moscow s moex index endured one of the steepest equity crashes in its stock market history so far government sanctions have stopped short of targeting russia s energy sector in a meaningful way sanctions on russian oil would slash the global supply which was already facing inventory problems before the conflict and cause further price spikes according to anthony denier ceo of trading platform webull this could be the catalyst for a global economic slowdown and it s not just oil denier said wednesday in comments emailed to the post russia and ukraine together produce 25 percent of the world s wheat if international shipments are shut off we can expect supply shortages and surging food prices this will hurt consumers in europe and around the world even possibly in the u s wheat futures boomed to a 14 year high tuesday according to marketwatch aluminum nickel and corn other commodities tied to russia and ukraine have also been pushed to multiyear highs the washington post s aaron gregg contributed to this report

but it needs to be done and not just because of russia covid was another lesson as america was caught without crucial supply chains for masks and protective equipment at the beginning of the pandemic and without enough computer chips as the virus raged on and while i don t like idly speculating about conflict with china part of avoiding such a conflict is making sure its costs are clear and our deterrence is credible as of now whether we have the will to defend taiwan militarily is almost secondary to whether we have the capability to sever ourselves from chinese supply chains in the event of a violent dispute

if you have ever accompanied a 5 year old child to a store you know the risks of saying no to their demands for what you deem to be an unneeded purchase in some cases their breathing weakens tears well up and their little bodies shake in anger this can be heartbreaking and lead to longer term problems if you give in to the temptation of spoiling them marketers celebrate this moment of pester power for its shattering of rationality and the cultivation of a lifelong vulnerability to the shopping frenzy never mind that kids can learn to identify those frenzied feelings and develop tools to deal with them which include slow and deep breathing to calm the body and soul that psychological skill is not much welcome in our culture of consumerism this brings us to the latest craze to gin up the masses cryptocurrency and the useless stuff you can buy with it in the hope of a big payday advertising for crypto is on the rise reflected in this year s super bowl commercial breaks as with most commercial advertising crypto marketing exploits the psychology of missing out or being less than which can elicit a perpetual feeling of inadequacy of body image health and fitness income and possessions celebrities feed this new frenzy by hawking crypto and nonfungible tokens nfts movie studios add options for crypto exchanges talent agencies like caa pay to represent tokens and some high profile people including the mayor of new york city ask to be paid in cryptocurrency and then there are the grifters influencers and scam artists crooks using dating apps to cheat people out of money to buy crypto and the bullying of ordinary folks threatened with identity theft if they don t pony up some crypto coins if you haven t watched dan olson s the line goes up about the false promises and dangers of crypto you might want to set aside a few hours to check it out all this publicity good and bad has the effect of creating the illusion of crypto s ubiquity and status as a store of value despite its well documented volatility such as when bitcoin lost half its value in january still as of last year 14 percent of americans held some amount of cryptocurrency some for buying nfts some to hedge against inflation and others who have money to burn and no casino nearby the crypto sales pitch the sales pitch is basically that you can eliminate middlemen central banks data brokers stock markets and participate anonymously actually pseudonymously because the blockchain on which crypto operates is supposed to enable decentralization and anonymity so why has so much of the recent reporting on web3 the catchall for crypto nfts and the metaverse identified a culture of fomo bullies mocking crypto skeptics as losers and wimps as one software engineer says some proponents of crypto get enormously angry with those who so much as question the technology much less criticize it and i ve been told on more than a few occasions that it s not okay for me to express my skepticism or opinions the reality of crypto ownership even the much vaunted idea of decentralized power of crypto exchanges doesn t really match the reality of crypto ownership for example 95 percent of bitcoin is held by 2 percent of accounts 80 percent of the nft market is owned by 12 percent of accounts this is a picture of centralized power with one telling characteristic every member of forbes s 2021 crypto billionaires list is a man a third of them attended stanford or harvard out of the 12 listed only one isn t white the problem of concentrated power hasn t lessened the enthusiasm among marketers of cryptocurrency and nfts in fact the get rich quick ruses of crypto enthusiasts can barely hide the similarities of the crypto market to a ponzi scheme the wall st journal acknowledges as much when it tells us that while crypto wealth will benefit only a handful of companies individual small time investors will as is so often the case not be the ones who profit from their rise cryptocurrency s problems software developer david rosenthal has helpfully inventoried many of cryptocurrency s problems it s built as if there were no externalities like energy consumption and carbon emissions when in fact token mining and exchanges consume as much electricity as some european countries and the system generates massive amounts of e waste as miners burn through hardware its purveyors manipulate prices through hype and deception ransomware enabled by crypto has disrupted supply chains crypto gangs eat up storage capacity by exploiting free tier web services and it has driven notorious crime waves rosenthal acknowledges the potential of blockchain based protocols for decentralizing authority and safely preserving digital information but notes the empirical reality of re centralization via concentrated permissionless blockchains like that of bitcoin as well as in long standing centralized permissioned blockchains which are more energy efficient the former is also more expensive more dependent on cryptocurrency and speculative investors and a bigger emitter of greenhouse gases he notes the reason for this extraordinary waste is that the profitability of mining depends on the energy consumed per hash cryptocurrencies assume that society is committed to this waste of energy and hardware forever their response is frantic greenwashing even if crypto ran on renewable energy he adds the idea that it is ok for speculation to waste vast amounts of renewable power assumes that doing so doesn t compete with more socially valuable uses for renewables or indeed for power in general crypto s over consumption of electricity has led many countries to ban cryptocurrency mining in an effort to conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions china has already done this while sweden and norway have asked the eu to ban crypto mining across the union one key goal for these countries is to stay on track to meet emission reductions set by the paris agreement of 2015 which means there s no place for crypto s unsustainable libertarianism many other countries have also banned or are considering banning crypto for this and other reasons in the u s where regulation of crypto is mostly non existent silicon valley continues to dominate the narrative with libertarian nonsense about freedom from big central powers and anonymity for crypto traders there s even a move by some crypto miners to reopen shuttered coal fired power plants just to power their dirty businesses the good news is that blockchains can be created to help fight the climate crisis and projects are underway to be everything that crypto isn t starting with the decarbonization of energy production the united nations development programme undp is working on a number of global initiatives to ensure what they call an equitable digital future for everyone the un s environment programme and the undp have also backed a coalition for digital environmental sustainability codes which has among its goals a plan to use digital technologies to build a virtual world of sustainable practices which just might offer a green antidote to the hyper consumerist vision of the tech bros metaverse we can breathe easier knowing that these projects for a sustainable digital future exist but we must also recognize how the manufactured frenzy behind cryptocurrencies and nfts can trigger many of our worst consumerist behaviors and further exacerbate the dangers of climate change we re not so distant from that 5 year old after all

day of the war ukrainian government agencies and volunteers have published videos of disoriented russian prisoners of war saying they had no idea they were about to be part of an invasion until just

new york mar 3 ap wall street took another sharp swing wednesday this time back to rally mode as stocks and treasury yields rose even as oil prices continued to climb the s p 500 was up 2 in afternoon trading after federal reserve chair jerome powell said he supports a more modest rise in interest rates this month than some investors had feared also read china to maintain normal trade relations with russia despite international sanctions he also said he still expects inflation which is at its highest level in 40 years to moderate through the year the comments helped gains for stocks from earlier in the morning to accelerate also read india abstains from voting on unga resolution that deplores russia s aggression against ukraine other areas of the market were also showing less fear from the prior day when worries about russia s invasion of ukraine sent the s p 500 tumbling 1 5 and prices soaring for all kinds of commodities treasury yields jumped to recover some of their steep losses from the past week gold receded and a measure of nervousness among stock investors on wall street eased after swinging sharply in recent days we ve seen wild swings but not major changes in the indexes said jeff kleintop chief global investment strategist at charles schwab geopolitical conflicts can be very unsettling but you don t tend to get bear markets from these just periods of volatility markets have been spinning wildly as investors try sometimes blindly to gauge how high russia s attack on ukraine will push prices for oil wheat and other commodities where the region is a major producer on top of that are worries about what upcoming hikes in interest rates by the federal reserve and other central banks around the world will do to the economy and inflation the fed s powell said in testimony to congress that his central bank is set to raise its key interest rate for the first time since 2018 but he also said the attack on ukraine may have muddied conditions with its impact on the us economy highly uncertain adding that we re never on autopilot the fed is balancing a tightrope where it needs to raise interest rates enough to rein in the highest inflation in generations but not so much that it pushes the economy into a recession all the while higher interest rates tend to put downward pressure on stocks and most other investments the yield on the 10 year treasury leaped to 1 86 from 1 72 late tuesday while the two year treasury surged to 1 50 from 1 31 yields though remain well below where they were before russia s invasion the 10 year yield was above

decade brent crude the international standard climbed 7 6 to 112 93 per barrel leaders of opec and other major oil producing countries decided wednesday to stick with their plan to gradually increase oil production the opec coalition of oil producers made up of opec members led by saudi arabia and non cartel members led by russia chose to increase oil production by 400 000 barrels per day in april the move follows a perhaps less impactful decision by the united states and other major governments in the international energy agency to release 60 million barrels from strategic reserves to boost supplies markets dismissed the notion that 60 million barrels of strategic reserves released will be consequential to the risks of russian supply jeopardised tan boon heng of mizuho bank said in a report russia pumps more than that in just six days in the stock market all the uncertainty about oil prices and inflation has led to big swings not only by the day but also by the hour through wednesday afternoon the s p 500 swung between gains of 0 4 and 2 2 the dow jones industrial average rose 616 points or 1 8 to 33 900 as of 3 27 pm eastern time the nasdaq composite was 1 7 higher more
