november s election was the most secure in history in georgia there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud and no significant issues with absentee ballots whistle blowers i tried to be helpful in the beginning and answer a couple of his questions but it quickly became obvious he didn t care about potential fraud instead he was attempting to trap me into embellishing one of my affidavits with potentially inaccurate information so he could accuse me of perjury i explained to him that the election was certified months ago and the secretary of state was on record as stating that there was no election fraud that meant there was no other purpose for his call other than to build a case against me so i terminated the conversation with him ig history for the past several months the office of georgia secretary of state sos brad raffensperger has been quietly investigating whistle blowers who believe they detected potential fraud in the november 2020 election that s right these witnesses swore they detected potentially counterfeit ballots in the fulton county hand count audit that occurred on november 14th and 15th they also observed a variety of other anomalies the november 2020 election was certified by december 11th and raffensperger told the wall street journal on december 12th 2020 that reports of many counterfeit mail in ballots thousands of missing test ballots several dominion voting system malfunctions numerous missing chain of custody forms major hand count audit errors and even foreign interference into georgia county election servers have dominated the news while raffensperger continues to insist there is no evidence of election fraud he also continues to investigate potential election fraud after the election was certified in the fulton county ballot inspection case and attempted to interview them some examples follow swore she saw mail in ballots that were not folded for mailing were not marked with a writing instrument were on questionable paper stock and were voted the exact same way in all down ballot races she states thatshe has explained repeatedly that she was contacted by braun who asked her to come in for an interview in january when she got there braun tried to get information about specific suspect batches that were already named in her affidavit and he pressed her to change her story as voyles has consistently stated the same account of events for nearly eight months was contacted by braun and interviewed for over an hour when she asked what was the purpose of his investigation braun told her he was only collecting information but he does not know what the office will do with it hartman confirmed that braun contacted her again this week trying to obtain photographs of suspect ballots ironically this new found interest in potential election fraud comes over six months after the election was certified braun startled hall s wife by sending a columbia county deputy to their home near augusta to tell hall he wanted to interview him by then hall had learned of braun s treatment of voyles he called braun to say he would not be talking with him she also explained thefor thousands of test ballots that were printed prior to the election at the georgia world congress center gwcc theand fulton smeans they could have been wrongfully introduced into the election results thorne summed up her interview with braun nevertheless thorne phoned him back and evenwhere the test ballots were stored to explain everything she saw although braun claimed to be collecting information about potential fraud in fulton county he declined to go she then asked are you investigating me or investigating my claims braun also contactedhe gave us a full statement about his experience with braun to make sure we got it right the sos ig division was implicated at the june 21st ballot inspection hearing by fulton board of registrations and elections attorney amanda palmer as conducting a secret illegal inspection of the mail in ballots that are the subject of the lawsuit the office even recently acknowledged in a news report the tampering they likely committed after the election was certified and the ballots had been sealed unlike most ig offices that are created to conduct internal investigations therather than hold them accountable the sos ig office is currently headed byduring her time at the roswell police department before being hired to lead the inspector general s office one of his more notable cases was the attempted false prosecution of voting system technician laura gallegos who he tried to blame for certification violations committed by the well connected lowndes county elections director who he and handel tried to protect harvey worked in dekalb county with the original inspector general shawn lagrua who handel appointed
escaping the united states may be leading to an extreme market bubble setup the past few years have seen housing prices skyrocket as flippers speculators and traditional buyers jump into home buying or selling to relocate to different areas throughout the us one interesting facet of this phenomenon recently hit nbc news over the past few days related to the super hot boise idaho and coeur d alene idaho market home prices in the boise area have skyrocketed higher by over 30 in just 12 months in coeur d alene home prices have risen over 85 in the past 12 months is a supply demand measure distorted by recent buying activity and what s next my concern is that the post covid buying relocating trends have pushed the supply demand pricing factors well past the equilibrium simply put the moratoriums and policies related to home renters and homeowners throughout the covid 19 crisis have created a supply crisis at a time when many people had the capabilities to sell and relocate into different areas of the us at the same time diminishing supply with hyper active demand pushes price levels upward and to the left as illustrated on the supply demand chart below the data and activity are supporting a hypothesis that speculators flippers and homebuyers have chased the rising price levels well past a key equilibrium level suggesting that a reversion process is very likely in the near future this reversion event may be similar to the 2008 09 housing crisis as banks suddenly realize they ve issued loans to borrowers at extremely high price levels with very little collateral to support these transactions or borrowers suddenly realize they are trapped in an overpriced home while the economy reverts to lower output levels either way this seems like a receipt for some type of crisis in the making the four basic laws of supply demand are simple to understand basically the market is always seeking to maintain an equilibrium between buyers and sellers based on supply demand factors when extreme events take place to disrupt the equilibrium these events unfold to push prices higher or lower depending on the event type eventually as prices reach an extreme level buyers and sellers begin to understand the extreme nature of the price disruption and a process of reverting will take place price is always seeking to establish a proper equilibrium between demand and supply as buyers and sellers negotiate fair price levels for transactions once buyers or sellers believe the price levels are extreme they typically become much more hesitant to engage in transactions because the risks become far too excessive as well this is known as the law of supply and demand as seen below from investopedia the biggest factor driving this substantial boom cycle is the relocation of people from cities to more rural areas as covid 19 hit a big wave of people suddenly decided to give up their city life and move into more rural areas to avoid close proximity issues the super low interest rates and the fact that the covid 19 income disruptions were mostly related to entertainment retail and restaurant workers prompted those with the capital means to take advantage of somewhat stagnant rural pricing at the time now about 14 months later home prices in these rural areas are rivaling or beating price values in some of the most prominent metropolises in the us this type of pricing activity throughout mostly rural areas seems very reminiscent of the 2005 to 2008 setup of the markets related to the market meltdown housing credit crisis of 2008 09 we are starting to see similarities in the data that may suggest the current housing boom cycle is running on fumes right now likely driven by speculators flippers and super low interest rates let s see what the data is showing us and you can draw your own conclusions mba purchase index data shows decidedly lower trends the us mba purchase index includes all mortgage applications related to the purchase of single family homes covering both conventional and government loan types and all products offered this index is an excellent indicator of demand and activity related to the total us buying trends since mid february 2021 the mba purchase index has broken downward after reaching what appears to be an excess peak in late 2020 and early 2021 my team and i believe this rollover in mortgage purchase activity is similar to the 2006 2007 decline in mortgage activity that happened just before the broad market collapse that took place in 2008 09 see the left side of the us mba purchase index chart below even though mortgage activity shown on this chart suggests that activity levels are peaking near 350 and have historically bottomed near 150 an extreme downturn in the current housing market trends could prompt a pullback closer to the 100 level as buyers pull away from a potentially dangerous real estate market price decline reversion event buyers of big ticket items such as a house tend to wait out big downturns waiting for the best deals this downward trend in mortgage purchases aligns with the supply demand theory that buyers are becoming hesitant to chase new purchases at these current extreme levels are there other data that point to a broader market slowdown in home sales do current price levels properly reflect a sufficient supply demand equilibrium that allows for continued rising price levels in part ii of this article we ll continue exploring the data related to the current housing market and begin to explore the potential global price event that may unfold over the next few years one thing is certain from the data we ve presented so far it appears the housing bubble is starting to stall what will it take to burst this bubble event and is the us federal reserve

us home buying trends showing signs of an extreme bubble setup â is it about to burst as we continue to explore the recent data and setup related to the current housing market bubble this part ii of our research will continue to highlight the similarities we are seeing in the current market climate to the 2005 2008 housing credit market event that crashed the markets over 15 years ago additionally we ll also highlight some of the efforts the us federal reserve and global central banks have taken to support the recovering global economy over the past 15 years are they pushing the markets to extremes and will they be prepared for a reversion event if one takes place in the first part of this research article we highlighted the supply demand equilibrium function and the four laws of the supply demand equation it is important to understand that all price exploration valuation functions operate within the boundaries of these supply demand functions buyers and sellers are always operating within these boundaries even if they don t know it be sure to sign up for our free market trend analysis and signals now so you don t miss our next special report the process of moving beyond the supply demand equilibrium is usually driven by extreme market events such as extreme demand for a product a fad or a very low supply component where manufacturers can t keep up with demand from buyers this represents an extreme buying frenzy where buyers chase prices higher attempting to get in before the peak fomo in the opposite case where supply is excessive or where buyers suddenly decide they are not interested in a product this is when the supply demand equilibrium level tends to fall below normal price equilibrium levels this represents an extreme depressed market value where deep price discounts are usually common my team s research suggests the us housing market is shifting from an extreme demand event fomo into a more moderate price reversion event that may align with a broad global market correction reversion event recently we published a couple of articles that have begun to play out accurately my team and i believe the recent fomc statements in support of continued asset buying and continued mortgage backed security buying efforts may have actually set off a confidence crisis among investors and traders this could be considered similar to the mid 2018 deep market decline set off by the us federal reserve pushing interest rate above 2 5 in a moderate rate increase process these types of confidence crisis events can be initiated by any number of factors in reality a few examples could be consumers traders suddenly realizing price levels are well past extremes a sudden shift in consumer spending habits a belief that the future economy will be shaken up by unknown factors or simply a supply demand equilibrium extreme suddenly becoming very evident the one thing that seems to happen in any case like this is that traders investors and consumers sometimes act like a flock of birds when these types of events unfold at first just a few notice the change in direction then almost the entire flock of birds see the change and as one except for a few stragglers change course to follow the leaders we may be at this point now if true and this begins to unfold over the next few weeks and months then we may start to see a wave of reversion events taking place across many various asset classes stocks currencies cryptos homes and others now that we ve set the process function event up for you to understand let s continue exploring the us housing market data to attempt to confirm our expectations us pending home sales fall dramatically from post covid highs us pending home sales have recently moved decidedly lower after reaching highs above 130 on the chart below the recent uptick from 106 to 114 may represent a temporary rebound after the nearly 30 decline in sales activity some people attribute this decline in sales activity to the lack of inventory available in certain areas whereas i attribute this decline to more of a consumer sentiment reaction the process of a supply demand peak price level event often coincides with a buyer s understanding that a peak price event is taking place they may then decide to hold off on making any immediate purchases because they believe price levels are excessively high history has shown this type of event to be very common fads come and go one minute the pet rock was hot and then it was not beanie babies were hot for years now they sell for pennies tulips were many centuries ago for a brief few months more expensive than homes and horses then the tulip market collapsed all of these are examples of buying extremes in a supply demand function that determines operational boundaries of function almost like physics creates constructs that all of space time adheres to the downward price trend of us pending home sales suggests the post covid extreme buying phase ended in early 2021 and has continued to decline substantially my research team believes a deeper decline is necessary to cleanse out the continued excess in the markets which would potentially represent a 75 85 print in us pending home sales for a period of at least 3 5 months although lows on this chart are fairly short term on average we believe the excess buying phase prompted by the post covid 19 relocation event will eventually prompt a strong downside reversion event that will prompt many months of price exploration in an attempt to settle a market bottom case shiller index shows pricing lags demand changes this case shiller 20 city index clearly shows the current real estate market trend has reached extreme levels remember this case shiller index is populated using 20 of the biggest metropolitan areas in the usa it is not reflective of more rural areas we ve highlighted past extreme levels on this chart with red drawn arcs in 2004 05 2010 11 2014 15 and 2020 21 taking a look at the biggest declines in recent history we watched the case shiller index move from 17 to 19 from 2005 to 2009 we also watched this index fall from 13 to 2 from 2014 to 2019 at the current extremes we believe the case shiller index will likely fall into negative levels as the extreme market dynamics for real estate unwind across the globe the us federal reserve and global central banks have pushed the envelope well beyond extreme levels with easy money policies super low interest rates and low or no down payment options for buying a home these policies have resulted in the resurgence of extreme buyer frenzy in the markets the unwinding event will likely take many months to unfold if our research is correct and the process will require a breakdown of consumer sentiment related to opportunities in housing the fact that the case shiller index is still printing high levels while the other mortgage and buyer activity has dramatically weakened is nothing new price is always the last thing to breakdown when trends change direction take a look at the charts in this article to see how price levels breakdown after consumers change their buying habits and expectations the current downtrend in mortgages and buying activity suggests a big price decline is about to hit the markets possibly resulting in negative price growth for many months years reit real estate sectors could get slaughtered if you are seeing what we are seeing in these charts the next thing we would want to see is confirmation of our research we would want to see the us and global market indexes begin to break downward as traders shift expectations away from extreme appreciation trends and towards more protective expectations related to future economic reversion events we would expect the us and global market indexes to begin to revert to lower levels possibly moving downward by 12 to 15 or more while the housing market trends continue to settle into a reversion event process if this happens then we would expect the real estate sector to start to move lower over the next 60 days and then really begin to collapse towards covid 19 lows we couldn t begin to attempt to identify any real downside bottom levels depending on how this event plays out the extreme high price levels in big cities and rural areas suggest this rally in the housing market is a bit different than the one from 2004 to 2008 this time everything is extremely overvalued therefore the downside reversion event may be bigger and longer term than what we experienced in 2008 2010 the interesting thing about all of this in our opinion is that we ve been closing out a lot of our research articles with 2020 and 2021 are certain to be full of some of the biggest trends we ve seen are you ready for these big trends after the 2020 covid rotation as well as the extreme rally in the markets after the march 2020 market bottom here we are at the precipice of what may become one of the biggest market reversion events in history still are you ready for these big trends traders want to stay ahead of these trends and opportunities related to what may become the next big disruptive technology gains as we move further into the 21st century it is very likely that space will become the dot com internet disruptive technology over the next 20 to 40 years or longer that

as the climate change crisis worsens due both to lack of appropriate radical action and the maintenance of capitalist business as usual ecological concerns have become more widespread environmentalism comes in many shapes and forms and some types of discourse have become more mainstream over the years campaigns to protect animals and forests and care for the planet make their way into movies social media and political speeches this is generally positive since one obstacle to change is strong anti environmental propaganda however the majority of mainstream environmentalism tends to focus either on change through individual action or on the very limited approaches put forward by mainstream nongovernmental organizations ngos and other institutions these proposals fail to deal with the root causes of the crisis and neglect the level of urgency required to avoid worst case scenarios the scale of change necessary to actually curb climate change biodiversity loss deforestation and water pollution is that of systemic action but these more macro approaches are often perceived as the jobs of heads of state or even as projects best pursued through alliances between countries and corporations willing to go greener this is environmentalism with a neoliberal face or better yet a myriad of empty promises that can be packaged and sold as solutions so that governments and corporations can look more responsible even as widespread fossil fuel extractivism and destructive vegetable and animal agriculture continue unchecked business as usual means that richer countries can pledge to become more sustainable and will even invest in important ecological transition areas such as in the expansion of renewables and electricity powered public transportation at the same time countries that sit at the margins of capitalism and may be considered as developing or underdeveloped face particular obstacles to ecological transition the majority of green technology alternatives are developed in the global north and tend to be protected by intellectual property rights that make them hard to acquire in the global south even though the mineral resources required to build batteries and solar panels often come at the expense of poor communities in latin america and africa and the electronic waste generated by the capitalist system s rule of planned obsolescence is shipped to large landfills in south asia this scenario exposes two contradictions connected to the idea of development under capitalism both of which have to do with the unequal relationship between the countries at the center of capitalism and those at the periphery a system of dependent capitalism ensures that countries rich in natural resources in the global south continue to offer these resources cheaply with a special role played by multinational corporations and special trade deals only to have to import industrialized goods at a much higher rate later on it also means that those in richer countries that benefit from such an arrangement are likely to try to influence local politics in the south and even to make use of state power to ensure that oil keeps flowing thus maintaining the usual path of progress while extractive resources are also taken to feed those countries demand for food clothing and even the means of ecological transition imperialism too comes in many shapes and forms it may involve direct intervention in coups d état wars and assassination attempts it can also influence local political economy such that the natural resources required to keep up the paths of development in the north both the conventional fossil fuel dependent one and neoliberal environmentalism continue to be extracted and traded extraction designed to enrich other countries and corporations amounts to ecological imperialism which sociologists john bellamy foster hannah holleman and brett clark describe as a system whereby the extraction of resources has often devastated poor countries which have been faced with the expropriation appropriation without equivalent or reciprocity of the free gifts of nature to capital to be found in their territories along with the ecological costs of extraction 1 it is very convenient for richer countries to maintain a system of industrial extractivism in the south that way they secure prime access to the minerals necessary for capitalism to green itself without hurting the chances of the same old corporations to enrich their shareholders through access to oil and other nonrenewable sources of fuel both dirty and green capitalism are sustained this is why it is common for countries in latin america to feel pressured to privatize national energy and oil companies and to allow foreign mining in their territory because u s support for coups in venezuela bolivia and brazil is connected to access to natural resources in the region it is no wonder that jair bolsonaro is now in power and that the brazilian national oil company petrobras is at risk of falling further into the hands of private capital this makes brazil a key area of focus and one that highlights the importance of the country s radical ecological movement brazil authoritarianism at the service of ecological imperialism the case of brazil under bolsonaro helps to illustrate how authoritarian governments in the global south see ecological concerns as impediments to capitalist growth it is symbolic of how the latin american right wing has no project of development in the region and would rather cut deals with foreign capital to ensure the local elites get rich while multinational corporations and financial institutions get even richer recent leftist experiences in latin america known as the pink tide focused on resource extraction in partnership with the capitalist class as part of their developmentalist perspective an authoritarian far right government like brazil s however is willing to go to extremes in the destruction of nature to ensure record high growth for agribusiness and access to sacred indigenous territory for mining companies with no regard for local consequences bolsonaro has shown willingness to bend rules change laws and remove legal enforcement and accountability measures as well as facilitate access to land and biomes as natural resources to be exploited by foreign companies moreover bolsonaro s approach has been defined by disregard for violence against indigenous and traditional communities easier access to arms for illegal miners and large landowners criminalization of social movements and environmentalists and a push toward industrial extractivism with foreign participation bolsonaro was elected in 2018 after a period of renewed anti leftism in brazil which also contributed to the u s backed coup against the government of dilma rousseff and the undue and illegal conviction of former president luiz inácio lula da silva lula was bolsonaro s main adversary and without him in the race the path trailed by bolsonarismo to the presidential office became easier since his election the quality of life of brazilians has decreased the liberal right supported bolsonaro for his commitment to the same austerity measures that currently strangle social programs and impact the state s capacity to fight the covid 19 pandemic brazil was already in an economic crisis prior to the pandemic and the recovery has been slow with high unemployment rates and large numbers of brazilians trying to make ends meet with low level informal jobs widespread hunger is back and food insecurity is now part of the daily life of half of the population the destruction of nature adds to this scenario which is sometimes perceived as a matter of bolsonaro s incompetence as if he lacked only the ability and intelligence to run a country like brazil this reasoning however distracts us from drawing the conclusion that the apparent disregard for lives during the covid 19 pandemic high rates of deforestation and the continuing problems with violence in brazil are part and parcel to the political project led by bolsonarismo it is about ensuring that the state serves as much as possible as a facilitator to local and foreign capital while bolsonaro s base relies on him to promote conservative values and measures for this task the robbery of nature is key and the destruction of the livelihoods and culture of the peoples involved in protecting brazilian biomes becomes a necessary task the bolsonaro government is not simply lazy when it comes to environmental issues rather it promotes an openly anti environmental agenda during his electoral campaign bolsonaro repeated old racist statements about indigenous peoples and traditional black quilombola communities he also declared that he would not settle any indigenous territorial claims or agree to agrarian reform this posture attracted support from the large landowning class which is also represented in congress by the ruralista caucus the caucus promotes pro agribusiness policies that relax environmental regulations and facilitate access and usage of dangerous agrochemicals currently the anti ecological bolsonarista agenda relies on a special tripod of ecological degradation guns virus and soy if colonialism was built on guns germs and steel as jared diamond suggests the far right has slightly updated the tools for plundering people and nature in the 21st century the first of these is seen in the use of violence a disregard for workers lives the criminalization of struggle and the role the military has played in the government as well as bolsonaro s efforts to facilitate gun ownership during the pandemic bolsonaro issued presidential decrees that relaxed gun controls and facilitated access to firearms a sport shooter can now own up to sixty firearms and a hunter thirty bolsonaro s decrees would also permit teenagers 14 years and older to shoot firearms in a sporting context and individuals to carry up to two guns in the end these latter initiatives were vetoed by the judiciary because they go against the brazilian disarmament statute 2 but bolsonaro s pro gun ideology goes beyond placing firearms in the hands of individuals in a country where gun violence is already alarming it promotes the militarization of everyday life with support for police violence more arrests and increasing rates of imprisonment in inhumane conditions all under the motto that a good criminal is a dead criminal the armed forces are well entrenched within the bolsonaro government leaving open the question of whether they are part of the coup that already took place in 2016 or might participate in another yet to come this has awakened complicated narratives around democracy and authoritarianism brazil still mourns the period of the military dictatorship but the bolsonaro government brought back a discourse that praises torture and censorship while promoting historical revisionism by referring to the 1964 coup as a revolution the presence of the armed forces in government runs as deep as the ministry of health general eduardo pazuello who was minister of health between may 2020 and march 2021 helped to promote pandemic denialism discredited medical approaches and slow and contradictory action on vaccine purchases generally the federal government has taken little to no action when it comes to actually fighting the pandemic it is only now in april 2021 pursuing vaccination and bolsonaro continues to blame governors and mayors for getting in his way even though vaccine where it is available has arrived only on account of autonomous action by those same governors and mayors the virus in the tripod mentioned above is of course covid 19 its role emerges clearly in the argument by ricardo salles bolsonaro s minister of the environment that the government should take advantage of everyone s distraction by the pandemic to impose the destructive bolsonarista agenda by the end of april 2021 brazil had surpassed four hundred thousand official covid 19 related deaths with no serious effort by the federal government to turn the situation around on the contrary bolsonaro laughs at accusations of genocide and the instrumentalization of necropolitical power by his government encourages anti vaccine and anti mask behavior and has managed to sustain somewhat successfully the myth that a lockdown would hurt workers thus relieving himself of the responsibility of providing for the people during periods of intense social distancing indeed the pandemic has been a fruitful scenario for bolsonaro in which he can advance his agenda without fear of a response in the form of mass mobilizations minister salles who was handpicked by bolsonaro took leadership of the ministry in spite of his conviction on counts of environmental fraud during his time as part of the são paulo state government salles administration is known for its intimidation tactics against public servants who demonstrate concern for environmental protection and its concerted efforts to stall crucial remediary action while slashing budgets including those earmarked for the fight against climate change salles is now under investigation for alleged links to a scheme involving millions of dollars of illegally sourced wood together salles and bolsonaro endeavor to promote lies about their environmental record to international audiences at the same time that they continue to dismantle environmental protections in an april 2021 speech at joe biden s climate summit bolsonaro pledged to make brazil carbon neutral by 2050 coinciding with a request from salles for 1 billion a year in foreign aid to protect the environment yet at the time four hundred employees of the brazilian institute of the environment and renewable natural resources ibama had already denounced salles for freezing all action connected to environmental law enforcement at the agency it is not uncommon for bolsonaro to lie at such events and in the past he has even claimed that the bad press his government receives on environmental issues is itself the result of lies by ngos and environmentalists that want to attract foreign funding for themselves there is also what can be called the bolsonaro effect on nature ever since he took power his anti environmental agenda has signaled to illegal miners and landowners that environmental crimes will not be taken seriously this has led to an increase in deforestation by 222 percent between 2018 and 2019 and crises such as the fire in the amazon in 2019 which began with a day of fire celebrated by bolsonaro supporters and a loss of 30 percent of the world s largest tropical wetland area the pantanal in 2020 under similar circumstances registered cases of violence against indigenous communities also doubled between 2018 and 2019 this adds an important layer of context to the great growth and profit experienced by agribusiness in brazil between 2020 and 2021 here the last element in the tripod soy represents not only the country s most exported commodity but also the key role played by extractive industry in transferring natural goods from latin america to richer countries agribusiness is doing quite well in brazil the country s gross domestic product from agribusiness reached a record high of 24 31 percent growth in 2020 a year that also saw record growth in the sale of coffee cacao and sugarcane soy is the most exported good and it also generates the most wealth for brazilian agribusiness 3 but soy and other crops are grown with extreme quantities of agrochemicals russia for one has recently complained about the level of glyphosate in the soy it has imported from brazil 4 it is estimated that 20 percent of the soy grown in regions of amazonia and the cerrado come from deforested areas 5 when soy is exported in bulk to satisfy the wants of agribusiness and the financial market the super exploitation of labor in the global south is accompanied by an unequal ecological exchange the depletion of freshwater and soil nutrition deforestation and threats to indigenous territories this combination of effects ensures that brazil plays a key role in the global commodity chain which has long contributed to the transfer of raw materials natural wealth from poor countries to rich ones 6 if gold taken from latin america and africa during colonization ended up in bank vaults and churches in europe today soy from brazil feeds livestock in china and the european union while lithium from chile and nickel and cobalt from brazil are used for renewable technologies in the united states which continues to import petroleum from ecuador to maintain its growing demand for energy and other resources these three elements guns virus and soy comprise the tripod of ecological degradation under bolsonaro and are the logical outcome of a doctrine that treats commodity exports and foreign ownership of natural resources as signs of development nature is only valued in the form of natural resources and if it is to be valued in conservation then it is up to the population and corporations to join adopt a park programs and other initiatives that shift the responsibility from the state to individuals and the market the other option is to request millionaire donations from other states in exchange for conservation but there is little chance that these conservation funds will translate into concrete responsible action by the ministry of the environment like the elements of colonialism embodied in the guns germs and steel tripod bolsonaro s project is about controlling the population eliminating resistance and reaping as much from nature as possible anti imperialism from the south to the north the rise of the far right has mobilized individuals and organizations throughout the world to show support for the opposition in the countries affected but besides keeping informed about what happens under right wing governments such as sebastián piñera s government in chile bolsonaro s in brazil and rodrigo duterte s in the philippines it is of crucial importance that those living in richer countries and the so called liberal democracies understand and denounce the ideological and economic linkages between authoritarian governments that act against the interests of people and nature one example is seen in the case of the amazon rainforest currently large portions of the brazilian amazon are under threat from fires illegal logging and general deforestation it is common knowledge that while this problem has been created in brazil it has global consequences the amazonian rainforest is not only a key center of biodiversity but influences climate patterns across the continent forest loss is directly correlated with the intensification of climate change thus we routinely encounter international calls to save or protect the amazon the majority of these calls are well intended and reflect a deep concern not only for global climate consequences but also for the ways attacks on the amazon simultaneously target indigenous and traditional communities in the region the problem occurs when approaches aimed at identifying the root cause of forest loss tend to single out local governments ignoring the ways that the bolsonaro government is not simply anti ecological but also tied to a network of powerful actors local and abroad that stand to gain from deforestation it is easy to pigeonhole environmental struggles in the global south as the results of bad electoral choices or mistaken ideas about development but when we connect this widespread destruction to extractivism and commodity creation as dynamics of dependency rooted in capitalism the responsibility of countries at the center of capitalism becomes clearer scholars arghiri emmanuel and samir amin helped to popularize the theory of unequal ecological exchange in the 1970s although its underpinnings can be also found in karl marx s discussion of agriculture and soil fertility when taken into account it requires that we examine the flow of materials behind something as simple as a particular pattern of deforestation if there is illegal logging where do the logs go if forest loss is due to mining where are these minerals sent and where do they gain industrial value before their by products are sold at a much higher price back to underdeveloped countries when forests burn to make room for soy monocrops that will be exported to feed livestock elsewhere how do we consider the many local losses that compound the global ecological crisis it seems that when losses are both local and global the interests of ecological imperialism which is truly anti ecological have a way of impacting the most vulnerable everywhere be it in the center or at the margins of capitalism although work on unequal ecological exchange also called ecologically unequal exchange tends to also look for calculations of such unequal transfers when it comes to matters such as biodiversity loss or impacts on a biome that cannot be easily reversed it is much harder to quantify nonetheless there are ways of assessing the magnitude of the impact this level of loss constitutes what karl marx called an irreparable rift in social metabolism in relation to nature a tendency toward a metabolic rift that is central to the capitalist mode of production and its accompanying system of extractive practices around nature that treats natural elements simply as free gifts 7 therefore we are dealing not only with a system that takes from nature at rates and amounts higher than it is possible to give back but one that translates what it takes away into a chain of value that is organized according to patterns of development the international division of labor and colonialism this ecological imbalance has a fundamental relationship to the economic inequalities that surround exchanges between countries as the amazon is destroyed it is not enough to simply look at bolsonaro and hope that the brazilian people choose differently and are allowed to do so in the next elections it is also definitely one sided to assume the best approach would be to simply impose sanctions on brazilian businesses as involved as they may be in environmental destruction especially if one does not take into consideration the flow of goods that create an international market so compelling for brazilian agribusiness that large landowners are willing to burn forests drench crops in agrochemicals and even murder indigenous leaders and environmentalists to gain access to territory approaches that locate responsibility only locally neglect the role unequal ecological exchange plays in the destruction of one place as a means to meet demands in another they also tend to neglect the ways imperialist influence is responsible for many of the destructive dealings in the global south the support bolsonaro received for his association with donald trump contributed to the bolsonaro effect indeed brazil s current inaction on climate change was modeled after trump s own climate denialism in fact ernesto araújo who was foreign minister under bolsonaro until march 2021 would promote conspiracy theories about globalism and cultural marxism among other narratives that would together indicate the government s subordination to trump and rejection of international accountability 8 in 2019 brazil s minister of mining and energy traveled abroad to attract the interest of foreign companies and brazil even sponsored an annual fair hosted by the prospectors and developers association of canada 9 canadian mining companies are known for the scale of their operations in latin america including brazil in fact canada s belo sun is among the companies to benefit from bolsonaro s intervention to permit gold mining in indigenous territories 10 the success of these canadian companies abroad is also due to support by the canadian state helping to facilitate investment and navigate spaces of political opposition to predatory mining 11 and when it comes to oil imperialist influence is transparent there is documentation of the involvement of the u s department of justice in the operation car wash operação lava jato investigation in brazil which began in 2014 and would ultimately undermine the operations of petrobras the national oil company as well as lead to the undue prosecution condemnation and imprisonment of former president lula 12 even china needs to be considered for the role it played in the decline of natural wealth in latin america for while its demand for brazilian commodities including in the energy sector may not follow the interventionist approach of western imperialism it nevertheless contributes to a pattern of unequal ecological exchange 13 add to this the presence of multiple tools of financialization in brazil s commodity sector from futures trading to investment packages that can generate rewards from crops grown in stolen land and the complexity of connections that sustain the web of ecological destruction in the global south becomes close to overwhelming this is why it is so important for anti imperialist efforts to not only be rooted in the affected countries but also to extend to the places where large corporations and imperialist states orchestrate these profitable initiatives in the united states this demonstrates the limitations of calls for a green new deal so long as they remain constrained to its borders it is unacceptable politically or ecologically to promote transitions away from carbon in one place while its economy continues to fund the destruction of nature elsewhere worse yet what can be said for dreams of a solar powered society in europe when the mineral components for panels and batteries are extracted from africa and latin america when ecological imperialism and unequal ecological exchange are taken into consideration it is impossible to deny that any legitimate concern for what right wing governments such as bolsonaro s are doing in their countries also requires an inward examination of the demand for raw materials and the foreign policies of the global north thus it becomes essential that people in the global north examine the role of their governments and local corporations in the destruction of other ecosystems and also how aspirations toward an imperial mode of living 14 in the north are sustained by unequal ecological exchange the center periphery system determines where wealth and impact concentrate in the world and for a very long time the development of the richer countries has meant that underdevelopment and high costs are borne by poor countries a consideration of these forces has to take ecology into account all the more so when it comes to those involved in discussions and actions surrounding ecological transition when a country like brazil whose territory is key to the recuperation of ecological losses is devastated by an anti environmental far right government analyses and political proposals need to include those who have benefited and stand to benefit even more from this destruction it means ultimately that ecological transition demands we adopt the vantage of the south such a perspective must posit alternatives to development that break the dynamic of unequal ecological exchange and challenge the way ecological imperialism takes resources both for business as usual and to green part of the world at the expense

our continent cannot keep supplying the global north we can t ina maria shikongo fridays for future windhoek a major struggle over resources is unfolding in southern africa in the wildlife preserves of the okavango delta home to 200 000 people and spanning parts of namibia and botswana a canadian oil company is drilling for oil over the fierce opposition of indigenous people activists and environmental experts the company reconnaissance energy africa known as reconafrica has a plan objectionable to virtually everyone except its investors and namibian and botswanan government partners who have granted permits for exploratory tests it promises to unleash untold levels of pollution destruction of water supplies and farmland permanent harm to animals including endangered species and the eviction of residents from their land reconafrica s rush for what they are calling largest oil play of the decade is nothing short of devastating profit fueled extraction with strong echoes of africa s colonial past yet big oil is on the ropes pushed by mass resistance and calls for climate justice oil gas and mining companies are facing an unprecedented crisis environmental activists have long denounced extractive industries for their climate destroying capabilities demanding a transition to sustainable energy sources and that fossil fuels be left in the ground since the passage of the paris agreement on climate change in 2015 calls for governments and multinational corporations to take urgent action have accelerated as this article was going to press in june 2021 a series of major statements and rulings compelling a curb on fossil fuel production have shaken the industry to its core in this context with the contradictions of destructive extraction laid bare how can we understand this aggressive push by reconafrica into one of the largest protected wildlife regions on the globe part of the answer lies in the solutions on offer claims of a path to net zero put forward by major firms such as bp and shell paper over a global contradiction achieving net zero on their terms means that ordinary people of the global south will pay the price as nations of the global north export their carbon footprints this struggle cannot be seen more clearly than in the fight for the future of okavango reconafrica drilling at any cost in 2014 representatives of a canadian junior oil company called reconnaissance energy africa signed a lease to a 13 000 square mile 8 75 million acre area approximately the size of belgium in namibia and botswana according to the company s website they hold a 90 interest in the 6 3 million acre namibian section with the national oil company namcor holding the remaining 10 and a full 100 of 2 45 million acres in adjacent botswana reconafrica secured extremely favorable terms from the namibian government a 5 royalty fee and 35 corporate tax if the oil exploration is commercially viable the company is entitled to a 25 year production license after a series of delays reconafrica obtained permits to explore raising enough capital to drill three exploratory wells with an ipo of 23 million in 2020 and beginning drilling in january 2021 in kawe kavango east in an elephant habitat the company has long predicted a major find up to 31 billion barrels of oil1 upon the april 15 announcement that the first of a three well drilling program provides clear evidence of a working conventional petroleum system in the kavango basin their stock prices surged company statements brim with enthusiasm for this last great oil find with geological conditions ostensibly similar to the texas permian basin we know we have discovered a new sedimentary basin it s up to 35 000 feet deep and it s a large and very expansive basin every basin of this depth in the world produces commercial hydrocarbons it just makes sense reconafrica co founder craig steinke told cnn 2 drilling in the second well was underway in mbambi also in kavango east as new politics went to press it s difficult to overestimate the destructive potential in reconafrica s plans investigative journalists area residents and activists have accumulated a vast body of evidence of the dangers to okavango demolishing the company s claims to adequate safety measures as a result resistance to the drilling plan is growing national geographic launched a series of articles in the fall of 2020 condemning the immense threats posed to the wildlife livelihoods and environment in the region among the most serious is the potential for water contamination in an area with scarce water supplies the okavango is a wetland fed by an inland delta the region s major water source as the magazine describes any contamination to the aquifer will be all but impossible to contain and clean up 3 reconafrica s license to explore lies adjacent to the main river of the okavango delta and exploratory drilling is being carried out 160 miles upstream critics of the project have raised serious concerns about the lack of analysis in the environmental impact assessment eia of the impact on ground and surface water especially given the vast amount of water that drilling requires the dangers posed to the water supply actually affect roughly half the population of namibia a mainly arid country as the okavango river supports the water security of more than one million people 4 namibia has already experienced frightening degrees of warming at a rate outpacing that of other regions the national geographic series has laid out in painful detail the danger posed to the area s wildlife the okavango region is home to the largest herd of african elephants left on earth and myriad other animals african wild dogs lions leopards giraffes amphibians and reptiles birds and rare flora including important migratory routes for the world s largest remaining elephant population wild animals use the entire region which is why angola botswana namibia zambia and zimbabwe have created the kavango zambezi transfrontier conservation area or kaza for short bigger than italy it s the largest conservation area on the continent reconafrica s licensed areas overlap with this huge international park 5 the region is also home to six wildlife conservancies and is typically described as the largest terrestrial transfrontier conservation area in the world shockingly while recon africa has a license to explore as critics have pointed out not all required permits were obtained for the testing of the wells the company has made a series of promises and claims that have failed to materialize they pledged to line pits for the safe disposal of well water yet photos clearly show that that promise has been broken reconafrica claims that they are using water that is organic and 100 safe to the environment for drilling yet waste from drilling fluids is extremely hazardous and potentially radioactive namibia s ministry of agriculture water and land reform has stated that the company wasn t consulted on permitting 6 likewise as activist ina maria shikongo of the organization fridays for future windhoek pointed out permits were never granted for the road building to the second drill site conducted by reconafrica despite the immense pollution and noise disruption to residents and wildlife caused by the construction these serious questions notwithstanding the drilling of boreholes has gone ahead it s called greenwashing said shikongo describing company misrepresentations in an interview this should be a crime 7 the danger that the company could frack in the okavango looms large reconafrica has not received a license to frack from the namibian government and earlier references to the possibility of using unconventional methods i e fracking have disappeared from their website now company spokespeople insist fracking is off the table yet a number of senior executives made their reputations by fracking such as ceo scot evans formerly of halliburton drilling operations are headed up by none other than the geologist credited with developing the fracking method nick steinsberger described by an industry publication as one of the men who made the american shale boom happen in an interview steinsberger captured the hubris of drilling at any costs that characterizes the project i am honored to have been responsible for completing the first 25 horizontal shale wells ever drilled in shale patch this is indeed where modern day fracking began now i m hoping for something just as exciting in namibia s kavango basin i could have gone pretty much anywhere but we all want something big the next big find and they don t happen very often these days at least not onshore we re looking for the next american shale boom and africa s got the most potential 8 south african geologist jan arkert believes however that fracking will be required to extract the oil from the soil and that harmful emissions will inevitably be released into the atmosphere 9 despite the dangers company representatives joyfully declare the potential for 120 billion barrels of oil equivalent numbers potentially laughable because they are so high 10 but it s not only the exploratory glee that mimics the tone of colonial adventurers of over a century ago reconafrica public relations spin comes with promises for the people of namibia and botswana and supposed improvements in their way of life including jobs but as with many extractive projects drilling is not labor intensive so the project is not expected to lead to many new jobs and the skilled jobs onsite are mainly held by workers from canada and the united states in fact jobs for residents in the region have been mainly limited to short term manual labor and in some cases workers have been fired after a brief stint and pay withheld according to shikongo when the labor commissioner went to investigate he himself was slapped with a lawsuit by the company in fact reconafrica has taken pains to emphasize their ostensible strong social license and eagerly talk up their efforts at community engagement through a series of public meetings in the region but as a number of accounts have described their outreach was fraught with problems public notices were only distributed in english a language not spoken by a majority of the residents and the sessions themselves limited due to covid related restrictions only included a small number of people the company s behavior has been so egregious that a lawsuit has been brought by the family of andreas sinonge in mbambi whose farm is located near the second borehole according to national geographic over 600 working farms lie within reconafrica s exploration area some irrigated with water from the okavango river 11 intending to bring the company and several government ministries before the namibian high court they argue that they never consented to the drilling and that reconafrica is squatting illegally the law is clear in its intent communal land is not to be turned over to private companies for the sake of profit seeking we already had land rights and were in occupation of that piece of land by the time recon came and started drilling for oil and gas extraction we were forcefully and unlawfully evicted from our land stated the filings 12 other reports assert that the area wasn t included in the original eia13 and eports of bullying of community leaders who have spoken out against oil drilling have surfaced 14 the right to free prior and informed consent and the right to say no are recognized global principles for local residents in the face of community destroying extraction and reconafrica to date has in practice trampled on this fundamental notion indigenous resistance and community organizing in the face of this corporate aggression the indigenous san people of the okavango have mobilized and spoken out in protest a statement to the namibian and botswanan governments from the san people explained that we note that as the custodians of this land for thousands of years and the rightful current inhabitants and custodians of this land we have never been consulted nor have we given the go ahead to any entities to prospect for oil and gas in this our lands we depend on the presence of the animals for food as well as to attract tourism from which we derive an income in this way we will be prevented from hunting and gathering food collecting medicine and performing our cultural practices and sacred rituals in short it will prevent us from being san 15 they argue that the area should be protected under unesco commitments to the cultural landscape accompanying its designation as a world heritage site further they continue the exploration violates the united nations declaration on the rights of indigenous people and the commitments to protect the environment enshrined in the namibian constitution as a result of protest against the violation of the site reconafrica was compelled to accept an exemption for the tsodilo hills of the unesco designated area a victory but a small section of the exploration area activists have been moving into action both locally and internationally fridays for future windhoek frack free namibia and botswana the kavango alive activist network and saving okavango s unique life soul among others have grown their resistance over the past year through a series of marches on unesco offices the parliament and government ministries in april 2021 on earth day and on the heels of u s president joe biden s leaders climate summit protesters in windhoek delivered letters to the u s and german ambassadors the letter read in part we are gravely concerned with developments in northern namibia specifically in the region of the kavango basin where the fossil fuel industry s desperate last gasp of air threatens to destroy one of africa s last lifelines and home to a truly magnificent and unique ecosystem reconafrica a petroleum exploration company headquartered in canada is currently engaging in oil and gas exploration in the kavango basin the watershed of the famed okavango delta this very delta home to the last great herd of african elephants recently confirmed to be dangerously close to extinction is protected by us public law known as the defending economic livelihoods and threatened animals act or the delta act when president biden said yesterday we have to move we have to move quickly to meet these challenges surely this meant stopping even the slightest damage to one of the world s most delicate and magnificent surviving eco systems especially in the name of dirty energy the struggle to save the okavango is gathering steam internationally with a march 2021 protest by extinction rebellion at reconafrica s now shuttered vancouver office and mobilizations in south africa belgium and the united kingdom a petition drive calling on canadian prime minister justin trudeau has gained wide support in the face of activist assertions of their right to say no the regional governments have instead insisted upon their right to explore notwithstanding strong environmental protections in the namibian constitution and the fact that both namibia and botswana are parties to the paris agreement aspirations for resource nationalism on the part of both have remained firm in a joint government company press release namibian minister of mines and energy thomas alweendo extolled the initial drilling results as a great period for the people of namibia hinting at hypocrisy in the idea that the global south should be denied any developmental potential extraction offers meanwhile activists critical of the government s actions are branded as outsiders and hostile to the opportunities on offer for indigenous people said ina maria shikongo reconafrica for their part has welcomed the government as one of the friendliest regimes for explorers 16 an investigative piece by the globe mail has revealed close ties between a company consultant and namibia s president hage geingob 17 extraction in africa and the net zero era the oil industry is in a race against time the calls for net zero emissions and curbs on fossil fuel exploitation have created contradictions where the world s oil companies face urgent demands to transition to sustainable fuel sources at the same time as oil is becoming profitable again during the pandemic prices crashed globally because of a glut in supply even dipping into negative territory in the early stages of the crisis today a new oil boom could be around the corner with prices creeping upwards but even in the downturn of 2020 consumption still averaged 91 million barrels a day more than the world consumed daily in 2012 18 the world s largest banks have provided 3 8 trillion to fossil fuel companies since 2016 when the paris agreement took effect 19 global banks provided 750 billion in financing to coal oil and gas companies in 2020 alone 20 at the same time costs for a sustainable transition are enormous where energy investment will need to rise to 5 trillion a year by 2030 to achieve net zero from 2 trillion today 21 these tensions exert contradictory pressures on the fossil fuel industry in a number of directions a product of a wider capitalist economy inextricably tied to competition and profit how to invest in new technologies while maintaining a way to profit through extractive industries these tensions are currently unfolding on a global scale with the struggle over the transition and who will pay setting companies on a competitive crash course likewise global powers claiming the mantle of net zero aspirations are embarking on a new period of green imperialism these are the dynamics of the sustainable transition and activist forces and the left must understand this new terrain as one we are compelled to fight on reconafrica is on a no holds barred drive to extract profit for as long as that window of opportunity remains open and because of mounting pressures on the industry their tendency to cut regulatory corners as reported by environmentalists and activists no matter the cost to communities and wildlife will only intensify on the one hand a small junior oil company like reconafrica cannot go it alone as the company itself has stated they will need the bigger resources of an oil major to step in and pull off the exploration success they claim lies in the okavango given these pressures when national geographic revealed on may 21 the existence of a whistle blower securities and exchange commission sec complaint against the company citing more than 150 instances of false and misleading statements to investors the news was shocking but not entirely surprising in response reconafrica hurriedly filed 22 amendments with canadian securities regulators and lashed out at the magazine for running false statements and a hit piece on the other hand in the net zero landscape big oil needs wildcatters like reconafrica small companies willing to take risks in unexplored territory who can continue to deliver a return on investment in fossil fuels in less heavily regulated regions of the world in this context oil majors might be more compelled to sell off their assets to producers more willing to buck the pressures towards greening their enterprise in late may 2021 an avalanche of change from stockholder rebellions at shell exxon and chevron to a ground breaking court ruling in the netherlands compelling shell oil to slash emissions by 45 by 2030 compared to 2019 levels are only the latest developments for high profile companies like bp and shell who had already made net zero commitments the fossil fuel industry is fighting for its future in okavango and other extraction hot spots across the continent extraction continues under the guise of these new finds by companies like reconafrica opting to violate regulations and human rights with historically weaker regulatory enforcement countries of the global south will be likely destinations for these last great discoveries as francois engelbrecht of the university of witwatersrand in south africa explained to cnn the big risk is that the global north makes the transition and that africa becomes the dumping ground for the world s fossil fuel technologies the last place where this kind of energy is being pursued 22 a 2020 study for example found that european oil exported to nigeria exceeded eu pollution limits by as much as 204 times 23 ina maria shikongo describes the stakes well you cannot be talking about cutting emissions on your side of the planet but then you are coming to release 1 4 billion tons of co2 on our side how is it that you can literally put our lives before this company people need to understand that reaching these targets globally is that companies are coming to africa to cause more emissions and it s not fair more climate refugees will be created more crimes against humanity and for what so we can continue feeding this greed it s slavery on another level it s a continuation of colonialism the transition has to be about saving lives so everyone has a fair share we have all of the raw materials but we live in poverty but it s an imposed poverty 24 conclusion on may 18 the international energy agency iea an organization representing rich countries dropped a bombshell declaration in their net zero by 2050 report all new fossil fuel extraction needs to halt after this year to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and investors must not take on any new projects 25 in this unprecedented call for change the iea insisted that current targets are insufficient to avert the climate emergency the number of countries which have pledged to reach net zero has grown but even if their commitments are fully achieved there will still be 22 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide worldwide in 2050 which would lead to temperature rise of around 2 1c by 2100 26 well above the 1 5ₒ c aspirational goal of the paris agreement while big oil and governments of the global north advocate for market based net zero so called solutions to the crisis front line struggles underscore the actual stakes the oil industry super majors and junior operators alike will not leave the fossil fuel world stage quietly fortunately the global resistance continues to grow accelerated in no small part by struggles like the one in okavango that is helping to reshape the terms of this fight beyond its borders the coalitions knitted together to stop reconafrica in namibia and botswana both put the worst most outrageous abuses on full display in southern africa and likewise provide strength and insights for the wider movement as ndaundika shefeni of soul remarks as opposition grows across the region and world unlikely alliances are forming of spiritual leaders cultural organizations conservation charities and grassroots community groups 27 these are the forces that will most decisively stop extraction and avert a climate emergency on terms to meet the needs and interests of ordinary people including those currently in the cross hairs of profit fueled extraction and this is the strategic vision embraced by activists across the continent and beyond some fighting for decades as they continue to challenge disastrous oil exploration from nigeria s niger delta region the site of drilling for three quarters of a century to the new east african crude oil pipeline planned to run through uganda and tanzania home to world famous wildlife preserves as nigerian environmental activist nnimmo bassey puts it now is the time for reconafrica to spare okavango the people of namibia and africa the avoidable harms which will result from their mindless pursuit of profit at the expense of the people and planet anything less will be nothing other than willful climate and ecological crimes 28 the

this was a clarifying week for global investors or for anyone concerned about authoritarian capitalism of just how much the chinese communist party ccp would be willing to pay to ensure its dominance the answer according to a rough calculation from a new partnership formed by the rhodium group and the atlantic council is as much as 45 trillion in new capital flows into and out of china by 2030 if the party were willing to pursue serious reform it s an immeasurable loss of economic dynamism graph courtesy of the rhodium group and atlantic council geoeconomics center s china pathfinder project get san diego local news weather forecasts sports and lifestyle stories to your inbox sign up for nbc san diego newsletters what is clear is that chinese president xi jinping during this month s celebration of the one hundredth anniversary of the ccp has sent an unmistakable message at home and abroad of who is in charge chinese domestic companies particularly of the tech and data rich variety will be more likely to shun western capital markets and adhere to party preferences foreign investors only too happy to accept risk for the long proven upside of chinese stocks now must factor in a growing risk premium as xi tightens the screws wall street must now acknowledge that the risk of investing in these companies can t be known much less disclosed writes josh rogin in the washington post therefore u s investors shouldn t be trusting their futures to china inc the story that triggered this week s stir was the 4 4 billion u s initial public offering ipo of the world s largest ride hailing and food delivery service didi the ripples could be long lasting and far reaching for the lucrative relations between china and wall street dealogic shows that chinese companies have raised 26 billion from new u s listings in 2020 and 2021 until this week the greatest concern for investors was that new us accounting rules would stymie that flow it is now more likely to be chinese regulators themselves who plug the spigot the facts are that didi global began trading on the new york stock exchange on june 30 auspiciously one day ahead of the ccp centennial celebration one early hint of trouble was that the company played down the blockbuster listing not only did company officials resist the usual routine of ringing the opening bell they went further by instructing their employees not to call attention to the event on social networks still didi s shares rose 16 on the second day of trading setting the company s market value at nearly 80 billion but by july 2 chinese regulators put didi under cybersecurity review banned it from accepting new users and then in the next days went even further by instructing app stores to stop offering didi s app credit all of that to a mixture of increasingly authoritarian politics regulatory concerns over data privacy and u s markets and the continual expanding of fronts in the u s chinese contest the cost to investors by friday was a drop to only 67 of the stock s original value if that s as far as the downside goes and if the regulatory retaliation against didi stops where it is this week could still be dubbed a win by didi executives the more serious matter is the wider chilling effect coming in the context of a series of stalled or reversed chinese economic and marketization reforms the latest came on thursday when the wall street journal reported that the cyberspace administration of china which reports to xi would police all overseas market listings on that same day chinese medical data firm linkdoc became the first chinese company to ditch its ipo after the didi news expect more chinese companies to shelve planned listings and for many others to remove them from consideration for all the billions of lost investment capital this could bring over the short term the larger cost is one that could be measured in trillions of dollars of endangered potential as xi consistently backs away from the market liberalizations he once appeared to champion the story could not be more clearly written than through the accompanying chart from rhodium and the atlantic council s geoeconomics center from 2000 to 2018 china s economic growth shook the world as it expanded its share of the global gross domestic product gdp from 4 to 16 china enjoyed similar growth in goods exports and imports graph courtesy of the rhodium group and atlantic council geoeconomics center s china pathfinder project at the same time however china s inward portfolio investment grew from near zero to just 2 of the global total while its outward portfolio investment grew from near zero to only 1 this is not just unachieved potential from the past it is now also the deeply endangered potential for the future that could equal the estimate 45 trillion through 2030 in a must read analysis of the chinese economy in foreign affairs atlantic council nonresident senior fellow daniel rosen who is also a rhodium group founding partner argues that china under xi has repeatedly attempted to reform the chinese economy only to pull back the accompanying chart provides a useful overview of what has become habit graph courtesy of the rhodium group and atlantic council geoeconomics center s china pathfinder project the consequences of that failure are clear rosen writes since xi took control total debt has risen to at least 276 of gdp from 225 it now takes 10 yuan of new credit up from six to create one yuan of growth gdp growth fell to 6 in the year ahead of the pandemic from 9 6 writes rosen at some point china s leaders must confront this tradeoff ustainable economic efficiency and political omnipotence do not go hand in hand conventional wisdom has it that the west was naïve to think that china s economic growth and modernization which the west so enthusiastically supported would eventually bring with it political liberalization now the conventional wisdom is that china has shown it can be brutally authoritarian and economically dynamic simultaneously what s probably more true is that xi may soon face the contradictions between his simultaneous desire for economic dynamism and increased authoritarian control history shows he cannot have both but for the moment xi appears willing to risk the dynamism in favor of the control
german chancellor angela merkel is set to visit the white house on july 15 when she meets us president joe biden the nord stream 2 pipeline is likely be at the very top of the agenda the us has long opposed this kremlin led energy infrastructure project but in recent months biden has made clear his readiness to explore possible compromises that could minimize any negative impacts from the pipeline while preventing a rift in us german relations during the coming meeting in washington merkel is expected to present the economic case for nord stream 2 while repeating assurances of germany s readiness to insist on the continuation of russian gas transit through ukraine following the end of the current contract which is due to expire in 2024 from a purely commercial point of view merkel s arguments may appear persuasive but as most honest observers recognize nord stream 2 is no ordinary business project on the contrary it is a geopolitical weapon aimed at the heart of europe that has been conceived since day one as a tool to isolate ukraine and strengthen russia s position in its confrontation with the western world stay updated as the world watches the russian invasion of ukraine unfold ukrainealert delivers the best atlantic council expert insight and analysis on ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox with construction of nord stream 2 currently nearing completion russia is doing little to allay fears that it intends to blackmail europe with the new pipeline on the contrary moscow s actions indicate that it is growing more confident in its ability to leverage energy supplies for geopolitical gain in recent months kremlin controlled gas giant gazprom has refused ukrainian offers of additional pipeline capacity despite surging european demand for gas due to a range of factors including maintenance on alternative russian pipelines moscow prefers to wait for nord stream 2 to be commissioned and wants to send a clear message that it expects russia s european customers to facilitate this process without delay russia s decision not to send additional gas to european markets via ukraine has resulted in record high prices and plummeting gas stocks this is raising concerns across europe ahead of the coming heating season ukraine s gas transmission system operator is more than capable of meeting any increases in european demand for russian gas supplies but in recent years moscow has preferred to reduce flows while developing alternative transit routes bypassing ukraine despite this broad downward trend in both 2019 and 2020 gazprom did book additional ukrainian capacity to offset temporary shortfalls due to pipeline maintenance work elsewhere it is therefore reasonable to conclude that moscow had no major issue with the practice until the current summer season most observers attribute this change in policy to nord stream 2 and russia s desire to underline that the new pipeline is the only way to secure additional gas supplies moscow s actions cannot be explained away by referencing the legitimate economic interests of gazprom in reality these recent maneuvers reflect the geopolitical interests of russia and the personal preferences of vladimir putin the kremlin has clearly sensed a lack of unity within the western world over the nord stream 2 project and is eager to deepen these divides while pushing home its own strategic advantage by refusing to address the current shortfall in supplies putin hopes to increase the pressure on germany and the eu to issue the final approvals required before nord stream 2 can enter service in this thinly veiled manner he aims to underline the growing strength of russia s position as europe s main gas supplier gazprom s recent actions demonstrate once again that russia is not a reliable partner and has no intention of separating economic from geopolitical interests instead moscow regards energy supplies as a foreign policy tool to expand russian influence this is most immediately apparent within the boundaries of the former czarist and soviet empires where modern russia continues to regard its independent neighbors as only partially sovereign and subject to informal kremlin control the primary target of russia s current pipeline policies is ukraine while the negative impact of nord stream 2 on the ukrainian economy has been well documented putin s new pipeline poses a potentially far greater threat to ukrainian security by undermining the country s status as a key transit route to the eu moscow will succeed in dramatically reducing ukraine s geopolitical importance this could pave the way for a major escalation in russia s ongoing military intervention in ukraine with the battle over nord stream 2 now entering its final and decisive stage it is time for european leaders to consider the implications of this game changing infrastructure project is it really in europe s interests to support a pipeline that russia clearly regards as a geopolitical weapon how can eu leaders claim to stand with ukraine while allowing nord stream 2 to proceed the only sensible answer to these awkward questions is greater european solidarity unless ukraine and eu member states stand together now there can be little doubt that they will each individually fall victim to further acts of russian blackmail and aggression once moscow has consolidated

upon hearing that i was making a cheffed up version of munggo a rich filipino mung bean stew my husband gleefully quoted lines from the candygram scene in blazing saddles 1974 mongo like candy he said the band mungo jerry had a song titled in the summertime he went on to point out i didn t know he was so full of mongo details he also loves beans when i think of munggo the little beans are top of mind because that is the star ingredient years ago i learned about munggo stew from a filipino friend s mom mrs esperanza i was intrigued by it south asian dals may be made with mung beans but here was a classic dal like dish from the filipino kitchen mrs esperanza offered a recipe that was good and employed bittermelon leaves picked from the vines she said the dish was healthy though as i recall she included pork in hers it was delicious albeit heavy there are also versions of munggo that include shrimp or shrimp and pork i ve been keeping an eye out for interesting munggo recipes and alvin cailan presents one in his book amboy recipes from the filipino american dream it s smart and wonderfully satisfying with lots of umami built in via a shiitake mushroom broth and it s vegan if you re cooking for folks with such eating preferences filipino culinary nimbleness cailan is an incredibly gifted chef from los angeles who has a knack for dissecting classics and creatively reinventing them filipino cooks are incredibly versatile and capable given their geography about 7 640 islands comprise the philippines plus history and experiences of being guest workers all over the world serving in the u s military and negotiating colonization filipino americans like ken concepcion a former high end chef and now a cookbook shop owner impact food on many levels through his food and in his book cailan demonstrates his filipino creativity many times over for example amboy offers up cheeseburger lumpia on page 98 pulled pork adobo on page 218 and a lentil twist on oxtail kare kare stew on page 316 he takes on banh mi croque madame and japanese noodle dishes he puts his filipino american imprint on mazemen a preparation akin to a brothless ramen second photo below amboy s munggo his memoir cookbook is an honest reflection of his life and he dispenses freely on what he loves and hates in food cailan admitted hating the earthy flavor of munggo when he was young but then he realized the little beans health benefits he wanted to make mung beans shine but without a ton of pork fat as is often involved he wrote he eventually developed a healthy brilliant iteration the broth adds the savorines that pork would lend and offered it as a side dish on his menus i like his recipe a lot but frankly it s cheffy the shiitake stock yielded one gallon but all i needed was 4 cups for the munggo stew there was no pointer on freezing the stock and the garlic chips required deep frying 8 thinly sliced garlic cloves after i made the recipe the first time i slightly adapted it for my home kitchen and hopefully yours too less time and smaller quantities of ingredients are involved the recipe preserves cailan s gentle balanced handling of ingredients translating restaurant recipes well for home cooks isn t easy but that s no reason to skip a cookbook there s lots of wonderful culinary ideas and stories in cailan s amboy if you re into exploring modern filipino food it s a terrific book to include in your library mung bean s healthy power in english we know this legume as mung beans but the powerhouse ingredient is known as mongo munggo moong and maash in parts of south and southeast asian and the middle east in china and vietnam they re called green beans đậu xanh in vietnamese domesticated in the indian subcontinent as far back as 1500 b c mung beans have long been known as a healthy food according to traditional chinese medicine mung bean s power to include cooling the body improving skin and detoxifying your system the india times recently summarized mung bean s potential benefits such as helping with digestion weight loss and diabetes in this article sourcing mung beans at most standard supermarkets mung beans are seen as the common bean sprouts if you shop at a health food store you ll encounter green unhulled mung beans venture to a chinese southeast asian or south asian market you ll see three 3 mung bean options unhulled split with their green hulls and hulled and split as small yellow legumes some stores sell organically grown hulled mung beans too hulled split mung beans are what i mostly use in my kitchen because the legume cooks up fast and buttery tasting steamed ground mung beans are used as fillings and toppings in viet dumplings old school sizzling rice crepes sticky rice cakes and sweet soups the unhulled beans are most sprouted as i ve once done when i wanted homegrown bean sprouts now i have cailan s munggo to add to my mung bean repertoire when making this recipe start with the stock since the mung beans need to soak for 2 hours or more if you like how to fry garlic chips if you need and assist watch this a video how to on frying garlic chips i made it for the laphet thoke burmese tea leaf salad recipe but it s used here too print recipe shiitake mushroom stock use a medium grade dried shiitake for this stock there s no need to spend fortune but don t skimp because good dried shiitakes help build savory depth in the munggo recipe i slightly adapted this recipe from amboy by alvin cailan each batch makes about 4 cups if you double the recipe use a larger pot ingredients 3 ounces dried shiitake mushrooms 5 by 10 inch piece of kombu dried kelp snipped into 3 or 4 pieces 8 cups water instructions put the ingredients in a 3 or 4 quart pot set over high heat and bring to a boil lower the heat to simmer until the liquid has reduced by nearly half about 2 hours the flavor will be very mushroomy and savory let cool for 15 minutes before filtering through a fine mesh strainer allow the mushroom to cool then squeeze on them to get any extra bits of liquid save the mushroom and seaweed for other uses their flavor is mild but you can certainly eat them you should have about 4 cups if you have a lot more boil the stock down if you re shy of the target amount add water the stock is ready to use or to store see below notes refrigerate the stock for a week or freeze for up to 3 months alternatively put the ingredients in the pot then cover and refrigerate overnight return to room temperature bring to a boil the lower the heat to simmer for 45 minutes cool briefly then strain you should have 4 cups kombu and dried shiitake are sold at many markets but your best selection will be at east or southeast asian markets never miss a recipe subscribe to the vwk newsletter

the best financial decision businessman gerald ratner ever made was to start giving after dinner speeches for a living ratner famously lost everything in 1991 when as chief executive of jewellery chain ratners he joked that some of its products were total crap the 71 year old told donna ferguson he now earns a lucrative living giving motivational speeches he also does business mentoring and his book reinvent yourself has just been published before the fall gerald ratner in 1985 as his jewellery chain grew what did your parents teach you about money how important it is to have it and to make it my family opened the first ratners jewellery shop in richmond west london and that s where my father worked my mother served in the shop while she was pregnant with me so i can honestly say i was born into the business sometimes money was tight and sometimes we had luxuries because the jewellery business is seasonal i remember my parents were always talking about money and the shop and from a young age that made me want to go into the family business they were fairly careful and quite frugal but at the same time they liked keeping up with the joneses for example in the 1950s my mother told my father to put an aerial up to make the neighbours think we had a tv when we didn t it was important to them to show off a bit unfortunately their careful attitude to money didn t rub off on me maybe i rebelled against it i m definitely a spender not a saver i can t resist temptation have you ever struggled to make ends meet yes after i lost my job in 1992 i was unemployable according to the press i didn t earn any money for five years the value of my shares in ratners plummeted and i had no other savings i cut back on everything but i still couldn t make ends meet i had to sell my house at a loss and i ended up with nothing in order to get by i borrowed from a friendly bank manager and got into debt on credit cards i would only make the minimum monthly repayments and pretended the debts didn t exist i was depressed there were days i would struggle to get up in the morning it was a dark period of my life did you ever take any unemployment benefits no that would have been too humiliating but i did start cycling and that made me feel a lot better i experienced the benefits of health and exercise from a mental health perspective so i decided to open a health club i put an advert in my local paper saying i was going to open one shortly and would waive the joining fee if people signed up i got 150 people which enabled me to start that business in 1997 i sold it four and a half years later for 4million that s how i turned my life around have you ever been paid silly money yes to give a 20 minute speech about my career at an event in texas i d rather not say how much i was paid but it was a substantial sum i normally get paid a few thousand pounds to give a speech i ll talk about ratners and my comeback in business i find it cathartic when i look back now i think aren t i lucky today it makes me appreciate what i have what was the best year of your financial life it was 1990 at that point i was earning 850 000 a year living in a 1 6million house and i had a few million pounds worth of shares i never thought it was all going to end i certainly didn t think it was going to end over a stupid joke but i owed 1 7million on my mortgage and i had converted my stock options into shares when each share was worth 4 20 their value fell to just 2p each after my speech and i still had to pay tax at 60 per cent on the price i paid when i converted them so when i eventually got my tax bill it came to 1million even though the shares weren t worth much by then the most expensive thing you bought for fun it was a helicopter for 2 5million 1 9million i thought it would enable me to visit my shops more quickly but it didn t work out like that what is your biggest money mistake making that speech at the royal albert hall london in 1991 it cost me my salary job mental health everything people have asked if i regret saying what i did it s not a stupid question because i m a lot happier these days but i would not say it s worked out for the best because it s deeply regrettable that a lot of people other than myself lost their jobs the best money decision you have made going back to the royal albert hall in 2003 to give a speech ironically that was the start of my lucrative speaking career do you save into a pension no i used to save in a pension when i was at ratners but when george osborne said you could cash in your pension i cashed it in so i ll be working until i drop do you invest directly in the stock market no i don t feel comfortable putting my money into somebody else s hands and being reliant on their performance i ve seen the other side of it i know that company directors often tend to put themselves before their shareholders do you own any property yes i have a nice five bedroom victorian house in the village of cookham in berkshire which i bought ten years ago for more than 2million i don t know how much it s worth today but i can t think of a better investment than buying your own home what is the one luxury you treat yourself to cycling 25 miles every morning on a carbon fibre bike it cost me a few thousand pounds and i ve got all the gear that goes with it which is quite expensive but i love my bike it s like my best friend if you were chancellor what would you do i would cut back on the amount that is paid out to public sector workers in pensions it s too generous and it puts a huge burden on the state people are retiring earlier and living much longer than they used to it s just ridiculous how much some police officers and headteachers have accumulated in their pension by the time they retire even if that s in their 50s i think the current system is not fit for purpose do you donate money to charity yes to animal welfare charities such as the rspca i think animals get a rough deal what is your number one financial priority to enjoy my life the pandemic makes you realise you can t take anything for granted you just don t know what s around the corner
there is no doubt that the 2017 launch of investment fund blue whale growth has proved an unequivocal success in the past few days the fund s share price has broken through the 2 mark double its 1 launch price nearly four years ago for billionaire peter hargreaves co founder of investment platform hargreaves lansdown the fund has yet again demonstrated his shrewd business sense and ability to build winning companies together with fund manager stephen yiu hargreaves set up investment business blue whale capital in 2017 the global fund blue whale growth followed shortly afterwards with hargreaves investing 25million of his own money at launch ever since hargreaves and his family have been investing more of their money in the fund the result is that today their holding in the 850million fund is worth 200million plus and hargreaves has no intention of taking profits in a buoyant note published last week he confirmed that his family were still adding to their holdings and proclaimed that the six strong investment team led by yiu had the hunger to keep in the forefront of performance the fund s performance has been consistently excellent with returns in calendar years 2019 and 2020 being 27 and 26 per cent respectively so far this year the fund has generated a return of ten per cent yiu who learnt his trade as a fund manager at artemis new star and hedge fund nevsky capital as well as hargreaves lansdown remains incredibly humble about the fund s success you would think you can t keep making 20 per cent a year he says maybe 15 per cent per annum over the medium term but not 20 per cent he is also mindful of the threat that inflation poses for equity markets inflation is a worry he says if it moves towards four or five per cent here or in the us that will present some headwinds for equity markets and it could lead to a correction but it s not part of our current thesis the fund only has a small cash position representing a tad over two per cent of the portfolio and yiu says there is no intention to raise this at the moment some of the fund s 29 holdings yiu adds have sufficient dominance in their markets to counter any uptick in inflation by raising prices the likes of amazon and microsoft companies such as visa and mastercard both top ten holdings would also not be adversely impacted as they would earn more fees on higher transaction values although some 70 per cent of the fund is invested in companies listed in the us yiu is keen to point out that these companies earn their revenues globally they also generate their profits across a broader range of business sectors than their stock market categorisation would suggest so while 54 per cent of the fund s portfolio is classified as technology only a fifth of the holdings revenues are generated from technology business yiu has not made any drastic changes to the fund s portfolio five of the top ten holdings adobe alphabet facebook mastercard and microsoft were first bought in the early stages of the fund s life disposals this year include stakes in unilever we saw better opportunities elsewhere and medical device supplier boston scientific a couple of hiccups over product launches yiu says blue whale capital will remain focused on managing global portfolios a new investment trust is a possibility although we are not ready yet blue whale growth has annual charges of 0 87 per cent pays minimal income and its stock market id code is bd6pg78
can you rake in devilishly good dividends year after year without relying on sin stocks like the uk economy dividends paid by uk companies to shareholders are firmly in recovery mode last week wealth platform aj bell forecast that dividend payments made by the 100 largest companies listed on the uk stock market would grow by 25 per cent this year to just short of 77billion although the bounce back is admittedly after the dividend decimation of last year caused by the economic fallout from the pandemic it will be warmly welcomed by an army of private investors who depend on the income to bolster their household finances if aj bell s financial crystal ball gazers are right it should mean that the ftse100 index as a whole will deliver an annual income this year equivalent to around four per cent a rate not available from most other financial assets especially cash where savers are lucky if they can get an annual return of 0 01 per cent furthermore aj bell believes the recovery in dividends will continue into next year albeit at a slower pace 2 2 per cent so all good news well not really if you dig a little deeper into the wealth platform s analysis you soon discover that much of this year s dividend lift will be provided by just ten companies these include a clutch of big banks barclays hsbc natwest and lloyds which last year were leant on by the city regulator to stop paying dividends while the pandemic raged and the economy teetered on the edge of catastrophe also among the ten are mining giants anglo american bhp glencore and rio tinto completing the list are bt and housebuilder persimmon while many investors will be comfortable holding some of these big income friendly stocks an increasing number will be more selective as a result of ethical considerations a heightened focus on environmental social and corporate governance esg issues means many investors are now shunning sin stocks irrespective of the juicy dividend carrots dangled before their eyes although sin is a subjective term when used in investment circles sin stocks tend to include mining companies including the four just mentioned oil and gas companies the likes of bp and shell and businesses involved either in the manufacture of cigarettes imperial brands and british american tobacco or alcohol diageo all are dividend friendly indeed last week shell confirmed its intention to give shareholders more cash following its decision last year to slash its dividend by two thirds dan lane senior analyst at share dealing service freetrade says the link between sin stocks and attractive dividends presents a dilemma for income investors mindful of esg considerations he says with the ftse100 full of big pharmaceutical mining and weaponry businesses and vice stocks such as tobacco and alcohol matching your morals with your money is easier said than done especially given that some of the least sustainable businesses pay some of the highest dividends among some of the big companies expected to pay dividends this year equivalent to an annual rate yield of seven per cent are sin stocks anglo american bat bhp imperial brands and rio tinto is it even possible to get income outside the sectors of sin asks lane well it is although it will mean investors being more pragmatic in terms of the income they want from their shares a little less income now in the hope of a growing income in the future andy marsh is co manager of artemis income a 4 8billion fund popular with investors in search of income it is currently delivering an overall income equivalent to around four per cent a year to get this the fund holds some dividend friendly sin stocks such as anglo american and bp in its 47 strong portfolio as well as barclays expected to be one of the market s biggest dividend payers this year it also has exposure to some big yielders such as legal general seven per cent and direct line eight per cent yet a key part of marsh s overall investment strategy is about identifying uk companies which pay a modest dividend between two and three per cent a year but offer the prospect of sustained dividend growth in the next three to five years as a fund manager cashflow is everything when it comes to looking for businesses which will pay shareholders a sustainable income says marsh we want to ensure a company will have sufficient cash left over to pay dividends once it has paid all its bills and made all the necessary investment in its business to protect and grow it strong cashflow drives strong dividends but if a business s cashflow looks as if it could be compromised red lights flash it s a signal that a dividend shock could be around the corner marsh says the likes of relx and london stock exchange are good examples of businesses underpinned by good cashflow he says although both have roots going back to the 19th century they have morphed unnoticed by many towards the new economy they re profitable growing future facing and the dividends they pay appear sustainable they also tick all the boxes as far as esg investors are concerned ftse100 company relx he says has embraced technology to digitalise its publishing business meanwhile lse also ftse100 listed earns 70 per cent of its revenue from subscriptions built around its data and analytics the digitalisation of financial markets data is still in its early stages adds marsh it presents a long term opportunity as demand grows from banks wealth and asset managers relx grew its dividend last year by just under three per cent and it currently offers a dividend yield equivalent to around 2 4 per cent london stock exchange grew its dividend by seven per cent last year with marsh predicting double digit growth over the next three to five years both these companies appear on aj bell s list of ftse100 companies which have grown their dividends every year for the past decade see table last year this list was 24 strong but it has now shrunk to just 15 russ mould investment director at aj bell says many of these companies do not offer dividends that in terms of yield are going to set income investors pulses racing but he says investors should not be put off mould adds history suggests it is not the highest yielding stocks which prove to be the best long term investments defending a high yield can become a burden for a business and the strongest long term performance often comes from firms that have the best long term dividend growth record by way of example he points to safety equipment manufacturer halma which is among the 15 dividend aristocrats listed in the table it has increased dividends in each of the past 42 years always by at least five per cent last year the dividend totalled 17 65pence a share a seven per cent increase on the year before with a share price above 27 the dividends equate to a yield of just 0 6 per cent mould says halma s share price was 1 9pence at the start of 1979 when its dividend growth streak began so this year s forecasted dividend of 18 5pence looks pretty good against that its current share price represents an astonishing capital return over the past 40 years and shows how well run well financed companies can reward truly patient investors with a combination of capital gains and income growth and don t forget investment trusts among aj bell s ftse100 dividend aristocrats is scottish mortgage the country s largest investment trust managed by edinburgh based baillie gifford it has delivered 39 years of dividend growth although this aspect of its investment armoury often goes unnoticed by investors who get drawn into it because of its extraordinary investment record over the past year its share price has increased by nearly 44 per cent 144 per cent over three years yet scottish mortgage is not the only stock market listed investment trust to have a record of sustained dividend growth it is one of 18 which have grown their income to shareholders for at least 20 years top of the tree are alliance bankers caledonia and city of london which have all increased dividends for 54 years one final thought on sin stocks and income investment expert rachel winter believes that investors should not automatically snub all sin stocks when searching for income she says many such companies are striving to change the focus of their businesses to become more eco friendly others are involved in industries which are supplying the materials necessary to reduce the world s reliance on fossil fuels winter an associate director of stockbroker killik says yes tobacco companies are sin stocks but it all becomes a bit more subjective when you look at other businesses such as mining take rio tinto for example yes it has been involved in some big environmental controversies but through its mining of copper it is playing a key role in facilitating the growth of the eco friendly electric car similarly while bp and shell are still dependent on oil production they have outlined plans to become net zero emissions businesses by 2050 winter s preferred eco friendly income stock is energy supplier sse which is busy building the world s largest offshore wind farm at dogger bank in the north sea its dividend is equivalent to more than five per cent a year
fund giant m g has slammed company board directors for selling off stock market listed businesses too cheaply in an outspoken attack m g which looks after more than 3 5billion of savings for almost 5 5million customers warned that british investors are losing out because boards are too ready to accept low priced offers from overseas predators michael stiasny head of equities at m g told the mail on sunday that directors were taking too much of a short term view of listed companies whose share prices have the potential to soar stiasny said that even if predators offer 30 to 40 per cent above the current share price in many cases investors would be better served in the long run if the company board rejected the offer he explained that this is because the uk stock market is currently undervalued so share prices in many british takeover targets have the potential to rise significantly m g s warning shot comes amid a flurry of takeover deals and approaches for uk companies mostly from american buyers in the past eight months alone more than 30 listed firms have been snapped up in transactions worth almost 30billion nearly 30 more are waiting in the wings including the controversial 6 3billion offer for supermarket group morrisons from a consortium of us and canadian bidders the morrisons board has accepted the offer but several investment firms have expressed concerns about the bid m g said it is keeping a watchful eye on the deal and has pledged to speak out if it believes that shareholders interests are at risk stiasny said boards play a very important role in takeover processes they are the first line of defence against bidders and they can sometimes take too much of a short term view when uk companies are sold off too cheaply uk savers lose the opportunity to benefit from the long term returns that these businesses could generate if you want to grow your isa or pension for the future being able to invest in good quality companies over the long term is vitally important particularly in an environment where inflation is outstripping interest rates the spate of takeover proposals follows a prolonged period during which the uk stock market has performed less well than overseas markets this has created a huge gap between the way that british quoted companies are valued compared with their peers elsewhere particularly in america at the same time the pound has fallen against other currencies making it even cheaper for foreign bidders to swoop m g maintains that this makes uk firms especially vulnerable to low ball bids stiasny said most bidders offer shareholders a 30 to 40 per cent premium to the prevailing share price and they think that they are offering fair value but they aren t because the uk stock market is trading at a discount with investors savings at risk from such deals m g says boards should take a long hard look at the long term prospects of their businesses and should not be afraid to reject offers that do not offer long term value the investment firm also believes that big institutional investors have a responsibility to speak out when they think takeover bids are too low calling on fellow fund managers to resist being seduced by short term gains stiasny said it is important that investors step up when we see companies being sold at what we think are too cheap valuations we need to be willing to say no m g has spoken out against several takeover deals in recent months including the 2 9billion acquisition of betting group william hill and the 4billion takeover of defence group cobham both by american buyers m g is currently fighting a 2 8billion bid for udg healthcare group the offer from another us private equity firm has been recommended by the udg board but m g believes it is too low in 2014 m g spoke out when us pharmaceutical group pfizer made a 69billion bid for astrazeneca valuing each share at 55 the offer was rejected and today astrazeneca shares are worth more than 85 while investors have received dividends worth about 12 a share during that time it s really important to look at equities as long term investments stiasny said today the equity market can sometimes be seen as a short term cash machine but the astrazeneca example shows that companies can often deliver more value if they remain independent

presents a more gruesome alternative understanding this frenzy of intricate chacoan construction the hopi ute shoshone navajo and the contemporary puebloans all share some degree of ancestral history with this region the navajo and ute refer to the inhabitants of the great houses as the anasazi which means ancient enemies or ancient ones contemporary puebloans do not appreciate this term although some modern navajo ute and hopi refuse to relinquish its use conscientious experts have attempted to circumvent this awkward tension by referring to these people and this culture by the name chacoan whoever these people were exactly they completed a precise survey of the landscape upon their arrival and initiated a frenzy of intricate building projects they dealt with the problems of the inhospitable land by establishing a cult which involved periodic pilgrimages and the delivery of offerings to these sacred sites the raw materials used to create these astro temples were not readily available and so sandstone and timbers were transported from great distances massive timbers were necessary to line the rooftops of the kivas these large timbers were harvested so far away that archaeologists remain unsure as to their origins small springs were utilized but it seems the inhabitants were dependent on and controlled a network of offerings that flowed from the north and south meanwhile archaeological evidence has only uncovered several hundred strange burials some great house chambers that seem to be rooms at first glance show no evidence of habitation these rooms often have no exit or light and are too tightly enclosed even to have a fire within experts theorize that the grandeur of the building itself was the purpose and these rooms are actually just fortified spaces used to add size and visual imposition digital reconstruction of ancient pueblo bonito at chaco canyon in new mexico before the site was mysteriously abandoned public domain the native american narrative and mandatory chaco mysteries today archaeologists and anthropologists work together with native americans who have ancestral ties to the ruins but despite this cooperation there remains lingering elements of tension taboo and secrecy some natives from the region refuse to discuss the ancient culture entirely even among themselves and those who do openly speak of it do so with extreme caution gentleness and even with a twinge of fear they tell of people in ancient times who had great spiritual power over animals the weather and human beings they vaguely suggest that the natural order of things may have somehow been tampered with in some cases they will politely explain that some of their traditions are not meant to be retold over and over especially to europeans or that they have migration traditions that they themselves do not entirely understand but virtually all the traditions hold that their ancestors emerged from the underworld and guided by their ancestral demigods deities and spirits went on a series of epic migrations speaking of things that defy understanding there are some strange elements of chacoan archaeology that should be pointed out this ruling elite of religious specialists had abnormal genetic traits which were revered in a 2016 national geographic article aaron sidder explored the odd reality that the ruling elite of chaco culture had six fingers and toes we found that people with six toes especially were common and seemed to be associated with important ritual structures and high status objects like turquoise summarized sidder when discussing her team s discoveries at chaco canyon there is also a gruesome element to this culture one that perhaps is related to the abandonment of the sites cannibalism in january of 2000 scientists billman lambert and banks published an article by way of cambridge university press regarding mesa verde another chacoan site in southwestern colorado cut marks and percussion scars implicate humans in the disarticulation and reduction of these bodies explained the article in its reporting of the discovery of cannibalism evidence of heat exposure on some bone fragments and laboratory analyses of human coprolite recovered from one of the pit houses support the interpretation that people prepared and consumed human body parts distribution of the great houses in chaco canyon wills et al pnas the obsolete drought deforestation collapse narrative regional climate change deforestation topsoil erosion and prolonged periods of drought are generally cited as the main factors that lead to the abandonment of great houses and the extinguishing of chacoan culture geologists have determined that there was indeed a fifty year long drought that began around 1130 ad it is also commonly theorized that the thousands of large timbers required to roof the kivas and pit houses were over harvested which in turn exacerbated the acute arid conditions this is then interpreted as writing on the wall regarding unsustainable land use practices however discerning scholars have pointed out that the popularity of such theories emerged in perfect alignment with modern campaigns regarding our own unsustainable land use practices suggesting a lack of objectivity wills drake and wetherbee recently published their findings with the proceedings of the national academy of sciences of the united states of america pnas there is no direct evidence for human impacts on local woodlands during the bonito phase no indication that agricultural fields were destroyed by deforestation or any other process and surprisingly no conclusive information about the amount and sources of archaeological wood wrote the researchers in their perspective report indeed chaco residents had available sources of timber and other natural resources that certainly were less costly than those indicated in chaco canyon collapse models construction patterns indicate that overall energy investment in chaco great houses began to decline dramatically in the late ce 1000s before the onset of any documented drought periods and immigrants appear to have arrived in chaco during the 12th century drought archaeologists are reaching new conclusions through analysis of remains at the great houses at chaco canyon kojihirano adobe stock alternative conclusions uncovering clues clues at chaco canyon the abandonment of the chacoan great houses at chaco canyon did leave a few interesting clues behind for example it is certain that the huge timbers that roofed the kivas were deliberately and individually removed this may sound like a relatively easy task but the systematic removal of all these massive timbers must have been a tremendous labor project roughly equivalent to some of the constructions it s also important to note that the entrances to the kivas were bricked up which is strange because with the roof timbers removed sealing up the doorways hardly prevents access to the structure maybe the most fascinating clue is in that only some of the great kivas where the ruling elite of cannibalistic polydactyls dwelled are scarred with fire damage the fire damage the dependence on offerings ritualized murder and high degree of social stratification may point to a popular chacoan revolt as the cause of the collapse when a small group or clan of despotic rulers is dependent on and controls a population of common people conflicts will inevitably erupt between the two starkly divided classes this is particularly common when the majority population becomes stressed and greatly outnumbers their oppressors the local tribes may have been subjected to relentless demands of goon squads who operated under the deception of religious obligation this combined with a harsh environment makes it only a matter of time until the exploited caste reaches a breaking point imagine people at the time not having enough food to eat water to drink and on top of these hardships being commanded to participate in building projects while their loved ones were abducted butchered and devoured it is not difficult to imagine that after generations of hardship and suffering these oppressed classes at chaco canyon violently revolted against their cult leader overlords dismantled their sacred spaces and set fire to the great kiva never to return top image the

perspective by stephen bello clashes between farmers and herders in nigeria has become a recurring incidence and the rate seems to be in the increase in recent times it appears the word forgiveness is not in the dictionary of both parties hence the almost vicious cycle of attacks and counter attacks this prompted the historic meeting of southern governors in asaba recently it is a pointer to the gravity of the problem and the desperation by everybody to find a permanent and lasting solution to the problem the governors took a decision to ban open grazing in their states this is in tandem with an earlier northern governors declaration that open grazing has outlived its usefulness that is an indication of a de facto consensus however the federal government according to the president s aids has preference for grazing reserves even though we did not hear it from the horses mouth well whether it is ranching or grazing reserve the important thing is that both parties have now agreed that this is the beginning of the end for open grazing in nigeria the two methods can co exist seamlessly in the country and it is now a matter of preference by individuals or groups a state may even decide that both ranching and grazing reserve can co exist side by side as the hausa saying goes kowa da nasa ai ba fada definitely there is light at the end of the tunnel if this matter is finally resolved in the next few months muhammadu buhari will forever be remembered as the president in whose time the problem of herders farmers clash was finally resolved just as olusegun obasanjo is today being remembered as the president that gave nigerians telephones my main aim in this write up is to suggest the various legal instruments and regulatory provisions that should be put in place in order to actualise this historic consensus and agreement on how to resolve our common problem i have been involved in regulation for several years and i know the importance of these things most countries in the world try to rear cattle in areas where it is most efficient to do so i remember my geography lessons in kufena college zaria in the 60 s two of such places are the prairies in the american midwest and the pampas of argentina america employs two methods of cattle breeding an enclosed ranch in which the cows don t move around but are supplied with special animal feeds consisting mainly of maize and soya beans in a recent documentary on dstv i saw a ranch in the kentucky state in which 50 000 cows were kept in an enclosed area of about 5 acres or so real high density breeding the method used in texas is very different because of availability of land and low population density ranches there consist of open grasslands five kilometers in length cowboys on horses drive the cows in open fields where they feed on natural grass and no arable farming is allowed in such areas this method is also used in argentina australia and scottish highlands in uk my suggestion is that nigeria should adopt both methods of cattle farming where land is scarce enclosed ranches supplied with animal feeds should be used and where there is surplus land open grazing with natural raw grass can be used this flexibility will enable a compromise to be achieved and also accommodate all shades of opinion and preferences where there is a will there is always a way let us now look at the various legal and regulatory issues that should be addressed in order ensure successful implementation of the compromise solutions proposed above in his recent comment a senior advocate of nigeria advised that all 36 state houses of assembly in the 36 states must enact a law to back up the policy regarding the phasing out of open grazing in their respective states thereafter they should specify the approved method of cattle rearing that can be used either ranches or open grazing or both below are my suggestions on certain issues that must be addressed by these laws among others definition of terminologies the act must fully define all major terminologies used in order to avoid ambiguities for example the words ranch and open grazing must be well defined in order not to confuse the two a ranch is an enclosed cattle breeding industry in which the animals don t move around to source food and water for themselves but are fed by human beings with specially prepared animal feeds or natural green grass or hay dry grass the size of a ranch can vary from one acre of land to 3 or 4 acres the maximum size of a ranch must be specified in the act a grazing reserve is a cattle breeding industrial location in which the animals are allowed to move around and source food and water for themselves from natural vegetation without human assistance or human intervention the size of a grazing reserve can vary from about one square kilometre to about 25 square kilometres ie 5km by 5km reserves normally have multiple tenants and are usually established by government other provisions of the law must include the following effective date of the law those responsible for enforcing the law appropriate courts for tryingoffenders what constitutes an offence and penalty for the offence who has authority to grant land for ranches governor or lga chairman tenure duration tenure renewal rights privileges of cattle farmers offences that may lead to land revocation need to pay token land rent amount in regulation need for a secured fence for ranches method of demarcating and protecting grazing reserves minimum distance between a ranch and nearest human settlement right of government to inspect ranches and reserves etc a department in the ministry of agriculture or an independent parastatal that will register monitor regulate the ranches or grazing reserves professional lawyers will know additional issues that should be addressed by the law enacting a law is the first step in the process however laws should be supported with subsidiary regulations regulations help to achieve two purposes they help to avoid misinterpretation and misapplication of parent laws enacted by parliament secondly they contain and disseminate lighter conditions and rules which may require frequent changes today because of historical antecedents legacy issues and unpleasant precedence most villagers and rural land owners are reluctant to lease their land to non natives their fear is that the land may be turned into a settlement and after two or three generations the settlers may claim ownership of the land or appoint a king bale eze or sarki in some cases they may even agitate for their own local government area such cases have led to serious communal clashes and a thorn in the flesh of national boundary commission to avoid such fears i am recommending provisions in the subsidiary regulationand safeguards that will pre empt such developments and give the land owner and communities assurance that they will not forfeit their land nor will the land be turned to an illegal satellite village hence the regulation should contain the following provisions 1 no residential building should be erected on a ranch or grazing reserve all employees of the ranch or reserve should live in the surrounding villages or cities and transport themselves to the ranches when reporting for duty gate houses and security post can however be built to provide shelter for the security personnel in case of inclement weather government regulatory agency for ranching will have the right to demolish any structure that violates this condition and repeated breach of this condition will constitute a ground for revocation of land permit for the ranch or expulsion from the grazing reserve 2 structures erected as cattle sheds or milking areas can only have permanent wall that are not more than 1 meter in height that is in addition to the roof supporting pillars such structures will be subject to approval by the regulatory authority stores or cattle sheds made of temporary architectural material such as tents canopy or prefab may be allowed subject to approval and on condition that they will not be turned into accommodation for human beings 3 all ranches must have a fence along their perimeter strong enough to prevent cattle from breaking through and straying into residential areas or surrounding farmlands also all grazing reserves should be demarcated by an untarred road around its perimeter and planted with suitable vegetation that can stop cattle from straying outside the grazing reserve an earth moat or a trench can also be used for the demarcation all roads crossing the grazing reserve boundary must have manned security gates to check unauthorised exit by cows or unauthorised entry by cattle rustlers 4 a buffer zone of 50 meters round should separate a ranch from the nearest residential area or farmland the perimeter road will act as buffer for grazing reserves the road must not be used as a public highway 5 prior to a land revocation order the cattle rancher or tenant in a grazing reserve must first be informed about any breach of regulatory conditions and given opportunity to remedy the breach failure to make changes after two reminders within a three month interval will lead to a revocation notice this is to protect the investor against arbitrary revocation orders as a result of political bias or other frivolous reasons 6 all land leases for cattle breeding must be supported by a standard contract that guarantees protection for the land owner and the cattle farmer alike the above laws should apply to both lease hold and free hold premises use for cattle farming economic financial aspects of cattle breeding now that conditions for smooth acquisition of land for cattle farming is understood we can now turn our attention to another critical success factor which is finance there is always a cost associated with every law or regulation that requires compliance therefore those who make laws or draft regulations must put the cost of compliance into consideration when enacting laws from an economic point of view cattle farming is a world wide multi billion dollar industry there are approximately 1 5 billion cattle in the world out of which about 12 million are in nigeria according to statista com in comparison there are 3 billion pigs and 6 billion chickens world wide india with 305 million cows has the highest number of cows in the world followed by brazil china usa and argentina in that order five countries new zealand argentina australia brazil and uraguay have more cattle than human beings about 25 per cent of the grains produced in united states are used for feeding animals animal farms also occupy about 30 per cent of world agricultural land a cow requires about 30 gallons of water to produce 1 one gallon of milk a cow needs to eat at least 15 kilograms of grass in order to produce 1 one kilo of meat so a lot of resources are required for cattle breeding and these include land food and water a cattle ranch or grazing reserve will require a borehole with stand by generator or a water tanker to transport water from the nearest water source to the ranch or reserve a water pipeline may be the best solution for a grazing reserve covering an area of say 10 square kilometres the vicinity of lakes dams or medium size rivers are good locations for cattle farming in order to minimize cost of production cattle ranchers will have to buy food for their animals or set up subsidiary grass producing farms to supply food to their cattle in sudan a large portion of which is desert farmers grow a protein rich grass called alfa alfa along the banks of river nile and transport it to cattle ranches in other parts of the country consequently transition from open grazing to ranching or grazing reserves will involve an initially high capital outlay and a moderate increase in running cost thereare three major implications of these requirements 1 cattle farmers will need to raise finance to implement the new arrangement 2 they will need some time to raise funds acquire land and put necessary infrastructures in place in order to comply with the ban on open grazing a time frame of 6 months to 18 months might be required however the time frame can be shortened to 3 to 6 months if central bank and state governments raise special intervention funds single digit loans to accelerate the process kano state has promised land to cattle farmers wishing to invest in the state other states can provide incentives to attract those who want to invest in cattle ranching as that will boost the economy of the state through employment creation and other direct economic benefits those with large herds can sell part of their cattle stock to raise fund for the infrastructure they require the above factors must be put into consideration as the various houses of assembly begin to put the necessary laws in place to end open grazing in nigeria 3 at the end of the transition changes to the price of cattle or meat will be inevitable in the immediate term the price of cow or meat will increase so consumers of meat must be ready to pay more for the meat they consume an average cow that costs 150 000 naira today may rise to 180 000 or more because of the higher cost of inputs on the other hand if ranching is well managed and efficiency increases in the cattle industry the long term effect is that prices will fall below present rates nigeria can in the near future begin to export meat to other countries infact brazil exports 12 billion dollars worth of meat to russia every year nigeria can achieve the same feat in a few years in conclusion it is clear that the economic benefits of ending open grazing in nigeria far outweigh the extra cost to be incurred in setting up ranches and grazing reserves the plan if fully implemented will increase crop farming 5 fold as more farmers will be able to go back to the farm without the fear of ak47 also food prizes will drop to half or even one quarter of current prices as at june 2021 apart from the lives of herders and farmers that will be saved since clashes between them will be eliminated cattle rustling will reduce drastically or even disappear altogether also cattle farmers will benefit from increase in meat and milk production and higher income and wealth each state government and aso rock should pursue their preferred solution to the overall benefits of the nation long live nigeria stephen bello was ag evc nigerian communications commission
we ve got peace like a river as the old church hymn goes in fact we have peace on the river northern middle tennesseans are lake dwellers it s in our dna it s our way of getting back to reality to that which makes us whole in our natural habitat we are a population subset some of my fondest memories of living in this area from childhood until now have included navigating the cumberland and tennessee rivers and their creeks and tributaries in the summertime especially summer means vacation season for most of us and people travel from all over the world to see our lakes and countryside summer activities summer is here and activities have returned here are some fun things to do in clarksville through the years my family like most families here has traveled to other places in the region when i was a kid we often were drawn to the mountains in the summertime i know the great smoky mountains like the back of my hand and we also loved to go into the ozark mountains of arkansas and missouri seeing nature outdoor amphitheater plays indigenous to these areas side trips to theme parks these were some of the places the settle family headed to on weeklong or weekend vacation trips one summer though we had a memorable vacation that involved traveling about 10 minutes from our house we spent a week on kentucky lake getting to know every cove and bay from leatherwood marina up to short creek over to paris landing and danville and occasionally further out if we felt so inclined it was a weeklong fishing staycation at home not only were we enjoying the lake time but we were also on a mission to stock the freezer with catfish and crappie for the true lake dweller that is the starting point of a meal fit for royalty early each morning we d rise my dad sister and me we were serious fishing pros that week getting to the lake while the fish were biting we d stay all day on the quiet peaceful lake it s a place i actually saw all the time and probably somewhat took for granted as a kid but as we slowly trolled along between the main river channel and shaded shorelines i learned to look at these waters reflectively and respectfully in a uniquely concentrated up close and personal kind of way not only were we reeling in the fish but to add to each day s catch dad put out trotlines with large baited hooks and they snagged some good sized catfish to take home and show off to mom we even gathered much of our fishing bait ourselves seining minnows from standing rock creek near its mouth at the lake that summer i think dad just wanted us to have the total raw experience of fishing as he himself grew up knowing it we truly did to be clear that s certainly not the only time i ve fished the lakes and streams around northern middle tennessee but it s probably the most memorable everything about that week was about creating a lasting memory hundreds of thousands of people create similar memories each year along the cumberland and tennessee rivers as long as people inhabit the cities and towns along these rivers those who reside along the shores are charged with protecting the land and water which are designed to live in sync with each other for northern middle tennessee this is critical to the circle of life happy summer reach jimmy settle at jimmysettle theleafchronicle com or 931 245 0247 to support his work sign up for a digital subscription to theleafchronicle com

by jonathan ingram senior writer racintoday com hampton ga the atlanta motor speedway is one of stock car racing s legacy superspeedways together with daytona and charlotte the atlanta oval helped established big bill france s nascar series as the place to race even those not interested in racing began taking notice once these three tracks increased speeds on high banks in major markets in the southeast now they re getting ready to tear up the 1 54 mile oval in atlanta still one of nascar s largest metropolitan markets one more time in place of the high wide and handsome expanse of asphalt in the corners which survived the first makeover a two lane superspeedway with an additional four degrees of banking will be installed will it help re shape the nascar of the future everybody involved should be worried about a future where tv money is likely to decline and a dependence upon attendance is likely to increase this dilemma is driving more experimentation by nascar with its schedule such as more road circuits and a slam bang appearance by the camping world truck series on the dirt of knoxville speedway and it s been driving speedway motorsports to race on dirt at bristol and add road races in charlotte and texas given the declines in attendance and the loss of tv ratings at all of nascar affiliated tracks there s little to lose with relatively radical moves when a longtime committed racer like chip ganassi elects to sell his nascar cup team and focus on his deals with honda in indycar and cadillac in imsa at likely at le mans it tells you that tough sledding is ahead for stock car racing when it comes to revenue one assumes that ganassi decided the value of a nascar team is at its peak given that the current tv contract which pays 25 percent of prize money is scheduled to end in 2024 while the pandemic has already suggested ways to slash budgets with shorter race weekends and fewer traveling crew only so much can be accomplished on the savings side speedway motorsports and coo marcus smith are committed to the long haul and the legacy of smith s father bruton the ceo one of those rival series promoters that france pushed aside by building daytona bruton smith responded by building the charlotte motor speedway and eventually the first successful publicly traded speedway conglomerate a hard driving racing entrepreneur when faced with a worker strike during the construction in charlotte smith famously held the hired help at gunpoint so that the track could open on time in 1960 the same year as atlanta and one year after daytona currently nascar s drivers that are the ones being held hostage by changing financial prospects as evidenced by the race on an extra wide dirt surface at the bristol motor speedway drivers would likely have requested a configuration that gives them more leeway but the track owners have decided less leeway is needed in atlanta despite the highest speeds in nascar absent restrictions used at daytona and talladega since the new pavement was put down in 1997 when the pole speed exceeded 197 mph the time worn surface and the wide open spaces in the high banks have drawn high praise from drivers they like the challenge of finessing more speed and better tire wear from their cars through driver inputs the new layout will be less finesse more split second decision making and inevitably more crashing newer school in place of the current old school as usual driver input through traditional and social media will have an influence it remains to be seen what configuration of nextgen cars will be race in atlanta when it comes to horsepower and aerodynamics it s not as if they ve been showing up in droves lately to see races on the current oval a smattering of fans looked on from the cavernous grandstands to watch saturday s xfinity race well known to be the last in the series for kyle busch which surely should have been a draw but the current situation is merely another low point for a track with a star crossed history including one bankruptcy in the 1960s and 1970s the track was unofficially known as the atlanta international rainway due to so many weather problems in 2005 it became one of the few cup series tracks to be hit by a tornado but the track has always been resilient despite the pandemic for example the atlanta motor speedway has never been busier than in the last 12 months thanks to legends racing drag racing high school graduations open air car shows and a second cup date not incidentally atlanta has been the scene of outstanding racing in the go go years of the 1960s atlanta had only five races decided by a margin of one lap out of 21 events during an era when races were often won by more than a lap seven of those races in the 1960s were won by five seconds or less this goes back to the wide open high banks that allow drivers to find speed behind the wheel a tradition that continued despite cars that became more sophisticated and considerably faster the 1992 season finale where alan kulwicki and bill elliott fought for the winston cup championship was a classic duel on the atlanta high banks watched by an overflow crowd it still ranks as nascar s greatest race in the minds of many emblematic of the influence of drivers individual efforts on the outcome of a race and a narrowly decided championship but when the great recession hit a decade and a half later no track lost more fans than atlanta whose following was generally older legacy fans younger people in atlanta meanwhile lived in a metropolitan area with burgeoning entertainment options the diehard fans were soon alienated when smith decided to move one of the two annual dates to other tracks in his empire that decision was hastened by the fact smith didn t have a mortgage to pay at the atlanta track after buying it for a relative pittance 20 million a decade ahead of the bidding wars that raised prices at tracks hosting cup races to more than 100 million per date the first time atlanta s true oval with four distinct turns was reconfigured came in 1997 when a bend was put into the former back straight to create a so called quad oval dogleg that enabled smith to install a huge new array of grandstands put in a grassy area between the front straight and pit road for pre race shows and to build signature condos in effect smith recreated the same configuration he first established in charlotte this time under his son marcus iracing and other computer based models were consulted for the new layout to be installed after this weekend s xfinity and cup series races in preparation for next season forcing drivers to work around each other on a narrow racing surface at high speed in place of using various lanes and lines on the high banks is far more consistent with the experience of younger people interested in racing on computers before they even have a driver s license it s also consistent with the racing at daytona or talladega two tracks that continue to draw fans from atlanta speedway motorsports is gambling the future for stock car racing on intermediate superspeedways will first appear in atlanta given the success of an added emphasis on road racing first introduced in charlotte i wouldn t bet against the smith family s latest gambit it if works look for similar changes elsewhere editor s note jonathan

in march 1974 roger trenton davis was sentenced to 40 years in prison for 9 ounces of marijuana an unusually harsh punishment that would make him nationally known as the marijuana martyr today possession of small amounts of marijuana is legal in virginia davis is a free man and the southwest virginia native now 75 is making the best of both things that martyr that s who i am davis said in an interview thursday i believe that every person on the face of the earth should be allowed to enjoy god s herb davis spent hard time in prison for possessing an amount of marijuana that under laws that took effect july 1 in most circumstances would be punishable by no more than a 25 fine he hopes to use his story which began in the 1970s when he was portrayed by rolling stone high times and playboy magazines as a martyr for his cause to help spread the word it s knowledge that i can pass along to everybody else he said the governor of virginia for one is listening davis was invited to richmond earlier this year to witness gov ralph northam sign a bill that made it legal for adults to possess an ounce or less of marijuana for amounts of up to a pound the penalty was reduced to a civil fine of 25 black people use marijuana at the same rate as whites yet are three and a half times more likely to be charged according to alena yarmosky a spokeswoman for northam davis is a black man roger trenton davis is one of the many individuals whose life was upended by the disproportionate enforcement of marijuana laws and we felt it was important he have the opportunity to join us as we put a stop to it yarmosky wrote in an email in his first public interview since the law was passed davis wore a free the weed t shirt and his hair pulled back in long grey dreadlocks he was quick to smile when talking about his experiences under the old law and just as quick to point out problems with the new one more needs to be done he said for example a portion of the law that allows home cultivation of up to four marijuana plants does not apply to residents of public housing complexes and subsidized housing which fall under federal regulations that still forbid marijuana a disproportionate number of those residents are black and would remain disenfranchised he said black people have to have an opportunity he said it should be equal and equitable to everyone and if it s not what do i say to that get your knee off of my neck give us the same opportunity to come up hell we re 400 years behind the legalization of cannabis is like a silicon valley or apple computer or a brand new stock a brand new economic avenue well you can t close those doors on black people we ve suffered for too long and too hard to be told no on something that god gives us the wrong place at the wrong time davis grew up in rural retreat a predominantly white community in wythe county by most accounts he got along well with others he s one of those people who is very charismatic by nature said art strickland a roanoke attorney who would later represent him people couldn t help but like him davis began to dabble with drugs in high school he later married a white woman fueling speculation by him and others that resentment was building against him in the more conservative circles of the county drugs and pornography were the worst problems of the day the county sheriff proclaimed in 1973 according to a rolling stone article that described davis and three others who encountered similar experiences in different parts of the country as marijuana martyrs an editorial in a local newspaper stated that young americans who smoke grass are of tremendous help to the communists this nation can very easily crumble and fall like a tree with a rotten heart destroyed by termites the magazine reported it was in those times that davis then 28 was charged with distribution of marijuana and possession with intent to distribute roger was in the wrong place at the wrong time and he committed the wrong crime and it sort of followed him strickland said a jury in wythe county circuit court convicted davis of both felonies in 1974 and sentenced him to 40 years in prison from a legal standpoint it would have been better if davis had been a child molester the rolling stone article stated then by virginia law the maximum sentence he could have received would have been five years in a petition filed in u s district court davis claimed he was a victim of cruel and unusual punishment judge james turk agreed in throwing out the sentence three years later turk noted that the average punishment for dealing marijuana at the time was three years and two months the case went all the way to the u s supreme court in january 1982 the high court ordered the 40 year sentence be reimposed saying the federal courts should be reluctant to intervene when a state inmate complains of cruel and unusual punishment davis was returned to prison several months later in may 1982 then gov charles robb rejected a pardon request but reduced his time to 20 years two years later he was released on parole in his interview last week davis declined to talk in detail about the case saying he was more focused on the future i m not trying to look back 40 some years ago he said but in 2014 following the death of turk davis called him a dear friend not just to me but to justice itself he was a dear friend to many of society s enemies davis wrote in an opinion piece published in the roanoke times why because he truly believed in the redemption of the spirit and also the rehabilitation of a fallen man striving for equality marijuana and the money it makes are two separate things the way davis sees it money is what makes the world go round he said it s not smoking a damn joint i ve been doing that all my life and it hasn t done a damn thing for me i m broke as s while it remains illegal to buy or sell marijuana in virginia the general assembly is expected to continue to to decriminalize a drug that under federal law is listed as a schedule 1 controlled substance that means it has no accepted medical use and carries a high potential for abuse at least in the eyes of the u s government under current plans for virginia retail sales of marijuana are expected to begin jan 1 2024 the law also creates two state panels that will work to include minorities in the marijuana industry davis case like so many others not only demonstrates the gross disparity in which marijuana laws have historically been enforced throughout virginia but also highlights why the commonwealth is reexamining the failed and unjust policy of prohibition jenn michelle pedini head of the virginia chapter of the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws wrote in an email putting things more bluntly davis said he wants to make sure the black people of virginia don t get f ed out of an opportunity gov northam god bless him a wonderful man he s not giving us pot he s giving us all an equal opportunity he don t care if you grow that s or smoke it or what but he does care about everybody being treated equally many people carry a criminal record for what is now or soon will be legal and once your record is screwed up with a felony it s screwed up forever you can t do s you can t get a job davis said that s has to cease virginia s new marijuana laws lay out a timeline for the sealing of marijuana related criminal records starting july 1 all records of misdemeanor possession with intent to distribute will be automatically removed from public view in state police records simple possession charges were sealed last year down the road virginians will have the opportunity to petition a court to seal felony records a state website explaining the law www cannabis virginia gov says that these criminal justice reforms will modernize the commonwealth s criminal record keeping systems and remove barriers for virginians seeking employment housing and education this is a beautiful time davis said not just for black people but for everybody a life of drug dealing there s more to davis s drug history than a single case that drew a 40 year prison sentence at the time of his arrest in 1974 he was free on bond while appealing a five year sentence he d received for selling 10 worth of lsd to a police informant following his release in 1984 he was convicted two more times of possessing marijuana in roanoke where he had moved and was living with his wife and daughter commonwealth s attorney donald caldwell readily admits that davis was treated harshly in 1974 but the celebrated title of marijuana martyr rings a bit hollow in light of the subsequent charges he said caldwell also pointed to the risks of applying modern day views to long ago cases laws change and societal attitudes change he said but as a citizen of this country you are subject to the laws at the time and if the laws change down the road you might be right in terms of what society thinks at this time but you weren t right at the time of the crime about five years ago caldwell s office all but eliminated the prosecution of simple possession of marijuana cases while he has no problem with the state essentially doing the same thing the prosecutor worries that the reform of cannabis laws will mean that police will no longer be able to cite the drug s pungent odor as probable cause to search cars and homes which often leads to the filing of more serious charges one of my concerns is that not every marijuana user ends up as a heroin meth or cocaine addict he said but an awful lot of heroin meth and cocaine addicts started out using marijuana and davis would later turn to cocaine on a mission from god in 1991 davis was charged with selling a kilogram of powder cocaine to undercover agents at a roanoke golf course in an unusual move he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity then 48 years old davis told a jury in u s district court that he sold the drug to deliver a message from god that white america is systematically killing black people by first allowing the spread of deadly cocaine into their neighborhoods then by bringing charges like the ones against him defense attorney david damico said recently that davis seemed very traumatized by the racial elements that he believed began with his case in 1974 a psychologist testified for the defense that davis was legally insane a second expert called by the government said he was not the jury convicted davis and imposed a 20 year sentence now retired assistant u s attorney joe mott was well aware of davis celebrity status i was a rolling stone subscriber back in the day he said but didn t see that as a factor in the prosecution rather it was the large amount of cocaine involved davis past criminal record and a mandatory minimum sentence imposed by federal law that drove the 20 year sentence he said in 2011 davis was again released on parole he found work for a roanoke construction company at the age of 75 he does manual labor because as a former convict my 401 k is kind of f ed up the making of a criminal although davis declined to talk in detail about his past in a recent interview with the roanoke times it is the subject of a book he has written the making of a criminal a manuscript contains stories and insights that he doesn t want to disclose for free while he searches for a publisher but in a book proposal that he shared davis wrote that it is about all that america wishes to conceal but above all it is about redemption and truth are men born criminal or is there something set up within the system specifically to make one such he asks either way we do exist each one of us must take a walk through our own destiny and determine who and what we are in the book i have not kissed anyone s ass i don t have to please anyone he wrote i do have to tell the truth that truth is unvarnished much like davis interview which was sprinkled with obscenities the words were not spoken in anger rather they seemed to be a genuine reflection of who he is which includes injecting a healthy dose of humor in what could be a tragedy davis was asked at one point whether his write up in rolling stone made the front of the famed publication it did not

scuttled listings and share prices hammered by official threats beijing has launched a withering and very public assault on some of china s biggest tech names the travails of ride hailing giant didi chuxing this week carried a cautionary tale for digital big hitters what goes up can come down and fast days after a new york ipo that raised 4 4 billion didi s app was banned from stores in its vast chinese market over data collection issues prompting shares to tank and lawsuits from furious investors similar cybersecurity investigations were announced on platforms of two more us listed chinese firms a day later motivated by monopoly and data fears or national pride and the control reflexes of the all powerful chinese communist party beijing is wounding its own firms here are a few reasons why at face value the aim is to tidy up a once freewheeling space where companies holding big amounts of sensitive user data blossomed in an enormous domestic market with little regulation more recently beijing has beefed up its network security regime while expressing concern over excessive data collection ostensibly to protect users from abuse mirroring us worries over popular chinese apps but analysts say deeper forces are also at play there s nothing the party likes less than things getting out from under their control said kendra schaefer of consultancy trivium china referring to the ruling communist party the aim appears to be establishing a control mechanism and one potential outcome is a cybersecurity review that could allow authorities to put the brakes on ipos while beijing has encouraged firms to go global a rush of tech firms listing abroad likely caught regulators eye these ipos are happening without sufficient regulatory clearance schaefer told afp at least in the view of chinese regulators as china s tech giants gain troves of personal data on every aspect of life from transport habits to payments there is growing unease in president xi jinping s government over who controls it the concern partly stems from whether key data could leak beyond the country s borders in an unusual move china s internet watchdog cited national security for its recent probe on didi eventually deeming its collection of personal data a violation of regulations the company s shares tanked 24 percent tuesday after an ipo initially met with fanfare now us shareholders are suing didi for failing to disclose ongoing talks with chinese regulators the screws have been tightening across china s tech architecture with over 100 apps in may ordered to rectify problems with data collection including prominent names like bytedance s douyin last year alibaba s financial arm ant group had its 34 billion ipo sunk preceding an anti monopoly probe into the tech behemoth before this we saw government intervention in the ant group listing it s very difficult to say why the timing is as such but they are all data related said hong hao of financial services firm bocom international authorities have since expanded their antitrust crackdown beyond alibaba with top policymakers vowing to curb monopolies and prevent the disorderly expansion of capital companies including tech giant tencent have been penalised over business deals that allegedly violated anti monopoly regulations while alibaba in april received a record 2 78 billion fine the e commerce firm had come under fire for forcing the practice of choosing one of two compelling merchants to work only with one platform and not its rivals while such infractions had long been a feature of the industry companies have since pledged to abide by anti monopoly guidelines including not to behave unfairly the damage is more than cosmetic chinese internet companies will officially bid farewell to their stage of barbaric growth said former entrepreneur and zhejiang university expert fang xingdong in a commentary he said establishing a sense of compliance will become an important strategy for such firms going forward for now beijing has pledged to step up supervision of chinese firms listed abroad and strengthen management of cross border data flows it did not provide details but in an early indication of action to come bloomberg news reported that regulators were planning to revise foreign listing rules to close a loophole used by tech giants to attract foreign capital the changes would allow authorities to block a chinese company listing overseas even if the unit selling shares is incorporated abroad chinese companies could play safe by listing closer to home in the near term given that the regulatory space is extremely volatile and uncertain said schaefer of trivium but this trend may not persist in the future she said this week us listed electric vehicle company xpeng started trading in hong kong companies including bike sharing platform hello inc and audio service ximalaya appear to have put us listing plans on hold bloomberg reported but others like convenience store bianlifeng are pushing ahead hong of bocom international believes a hong kong listing could hedge against regulatory pressures from beijing and washington last year was a big year for many of these us listed chinese companies coming back to hong kong and this year i think the process is actually accelerating he said

i do not expect any of my fellow liberal progressive democrats to share my concern here but because i believe that it will be very difficult for the democrats to retain the pesidency in 2024 and to retain control of congress in 2022 because of republican state legislatures wanting to make it hard for many democrats to vote i want whoever the republicans nominate for president in 2024 to be a high quality person such as carly fiorina who voted for biden harris in 2020 i like it that she is widely known to be a very sensitive empathetic and compassionate person on

as my wife and the boys prepared for their usual summer trip to lebanon few days ago i noticed that the number of luggage has almost doubled this time i counted four large suitcases and three smaller ones in addition to the carry on handbags i opened one of the newly bought suitcases which looked overstuffed and as i suspected found that there were no clothes or shoes or the usual trivial personal items we carry in our travel the bag was full of groceries that is right a couple of nestlé s nescafe the pink coffee mate several cases of panadol and other medicines several jars of creamy cheese and strawberry jams boxes of cereal and oatmeal sunscreen and many other things stuffed neatly beneath i couldn t help thinking as i closed the bag about the sorry state that lebanon has so much degenerated into that one would have to stock on food and medicine when traveling there all travellers to lebanon today do exactly as my wife a nation in distress life in that country as described by their families is absolutely petrifying long lines and skirmishes at the few gas stations that still have fuel and the empty shelves at the supermarkets as almost all imported groceries such as the cereals and my wife s favourite coffee nescafe disappeared many pharmacies closed because they have no stocks and whatever is available has become beyond the reach of the average person because the prices have skyrocketed as the lira the lebanese currency that is pegged to the dollar has lost more than 90 percent of its value inflation has gone over the roof and according to a recent world bank report more than half of the families are now officially under the poverty line welcome to a lebanon unlike the lebanon we used to know and love in his book my story 50 stories in 50 years his highness sheikh mohammed bin rashid al maktoum had a chapter titled beirut he recalls his early and fond memories of the 1960s lebanon when it was called the switzerland of the middle east and beirut was the region s paris my first memories of beirut date back to the early 1960s when i came from the desert of dubai with its mud houses sandy streets and palm covered markets i travelled to beirut with my family passing through on our way to london beirut amazed me as a child and i fell in love with it as a young man but it would break my heart as an adult lebanon of yore is gone tragically the lebanon that amazed sheikh mohammed and millions of arabs in those days no longer exists decades of civil war israeli occupation and frequent attacks rampant corruption power struggle and management failure left the once prosperous country fragmented land ruled by selfish sectarian and communal chieftains beirut today is merely a ghost of what was once the jewel of the arab world until recent years the arab world s health was measured politically economically and culturally by the condition of certain cities mainly the four civilisation centres cairo baghdad damascus and beirut these cities are some of the oldest cities in the world cairo s history goes back 5 000 years ago the days of the ancient egyptian capital of memphis near the head of the nile delta south of the present capital of egypt the current city though was established by the fatimid military commander jawhar al seqelli in 969 ad for centuries it was the centre of learning wealth and political power in the arab world modern baghdad was founded in 762 ad as the capital of the abbasid state and for 500 years thereafter was the most significant cultural centre of arab and islamic civilisation it lies in the heart of ancient mesopotamia the cradle of human civilisation that thrived almost 7 000 years ago founded in the 3rd millennium b c damascus was an important cultural and commercial centre by virtue of its geographical position at the crossroads of the orient and the occident between africa and asia it is considered to be among the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world evidences of the subsequent civilisations hellenistic roman byzantine and islamic are prominently visible around the city which was until a decade ago one of the central power centres in the region beirut meanwhile was founded as early as 3 000 bc before jerusalem athens damascus or any other current capital according to the encyclopaedia britannica the first historical mention of beirut is found in the ancient egyptian tell el amarna letters dating from the 15th century bc beirut city image credit shutterstock take a look at these four cities today they don t resemble at all the cities they used to be ravaged by either war civil strife mismanagement neglect each of these historic capitals has become a case study for self destruction take beirut for example since its founding beirut nestled between the eastern mountains and the mediterranean sea to the west has played an important role as a trade gateway between the middle east and the western world lebanon has faced and overcame endless campaigns by foreign invaders and occupiers the romans the crusaders and then the ottomans followed by the french and more recently the israelis its most notable period of prosperity began in first half of the 20th century with the oil boom in the region coupled with the start of tension and war in it surrounding areas the palestinian nakba in 1948 the successive regime changes in syria and iraq as it became safe haven for money politics culture and art its banking sector was then the most active in the region and beirut became the preferred destination of the rich arabs seeking both business and pleasure and also the latest fashion venal politicians and petty squabbles it was also the attractive spot for arab gulf vacationers with its white beaches beautiful countryside and stunning mountain homes beirut housed the largest number of publishing houses in the middle east and its airport was the busiest in this part of the world the preferred transit link between this region and the rest of the world that unfortunately lasted only a couple of decades as its people decided one day to sink it in the overly complicated maze of regional politics lebanon s main problem is that some of its politicians and warriors thought that lebanon was too small for their own ambitions people like riad al solh camille chamoun suleiman frangieh kamal jumblatt the leaders of the civil war militias and currently hezbollah and instead of lebanon being the jewel of the middle east which it should be it has become the preferred arena of the arab wars and dirty politics the lebanese people certainly bear the ultimate responsibility for the destruction of their country that began with the start of the civil war in 1976 today lebanon is officially a failed state on the brink of a total political economic and social collapse the political parties and the ruling class have failed for almost a year to agree on a new government because of their petty quarrels over ministerial quotas lebanon does not lack human resources at all the lebanese are known for their skills in all fields they are a worldly educated and talented people open minded and fast leaners the country s predicament is its overpoliticisation too much politics at play that and of course a selfish political elite that doesn t care at all about the national interests their loyalties lie elsewhere in a superbly composed 3 000 essay published in the london review of book 4 july 1985 titled the fall of beirut the late great arab american intellectual edward said had this to say about lebanon s political leaders i have almost given up trying to plot the changes and the turns each of them denser and more complicated than the preceding each of them reminding me of lebanon s astounding capacity for money making conspiracy and individual as well as mass murder yet the so called traditional leaders and their variously mediocre progeny remain unchanged as they forge and almost immediately betray alliances with each other as well as with the syrians palestinians iranians americans israelis and saudis there is literally no one to admire or trust in this too long and too sordid spectacle of idiotic violence and limitless corruption even the innocent civilians who have gone on and on with their brave routines their ability to rebuild and restart their lives a dozen times their courage under fire must have secretly connived one feels with the leaders who have kept the war going otherwise how could it have continued for such a long time many lebanese claim phoenician roots they believe their country is the living embodiment of the mythical firebird the phoenix the legendary phoenix is a supernatural bird which lives for 500 years once its life span is over the phoenix builds its own funeral pyre and throws itself into the flames as it dies it is reborn anew and rises from the ashes to live another 1000 years

and has helped to address the timber frame shortage making strategic decisions like this one provides assurance for the 2 500 people who work with us and the people who will go on to live in a barratt home my continued focus is in promoting a planning system that will secure land for the provision of new homes throughout scotland advertisement hide ad advertisement hide ad how has barratt adapted to the pandemic you ve not laid off any staff and repaid all furlough support for example but also what challenges have the outbreak posed we adapted to the challenges very quickly the first one was to get all the it equipment needed to enable our office staff to work from home the next big challenge as we prepared to come out of lockdown was to get our sites and sales teams trained and ready to work in a safe environment with safe operating procedures it was crucial that we got this right because our number one priority was to provide a safe and secure working environment for all our colleagues this we managed thorough forward planning following health and safety along with scottish government guidelines as well as the physical wellbeing we knew it was equally important to consider the mental wellbeing of our employees i am proud that we already had a team of people who were trained in mental health first aid mhfa before the pandemic hit we have grown this team fivefold and they have supported our people throughout lockdown encouraging them to take breaks talk to each other and embrace light exercise we now have 50 trained mhfas working across our scottish business there is at least one mhfa on every site the next challenge is to help our teams transition back to working in an office environment on a rota basis we have allowed staff to return to offices up to a 20 per cent maximum capacity over the last 16 months the way in which people work and indeed expect to work in the future has changed as we encourage people to return to the office we shall ensure that they feel safe and comfortable to do so for the re opening of offices we are following health and safety along with scottish government guidelines which shall be developed to enable greater flexibility for working a focus i have is to ensure that we provide the best opportunities for our employees and trainees to gain experience in our business whilst we have provided online and remote training during the pandemic this is no substitute for working alongside colleagues which is key to their development and success the snippets of information acquired from being in the office are crucial for their development can you characterise the way lockdowns have changed what homebuyers are looking for and how that is affecting your bottom line advertisement hide ad advertisement hide ad most people are looking for larger houses for home working which has helped stimulate the housing market the concern we had coming out of lockdown was the uncertainty of what the future would hold people were worried about their future and buying a new home was understandably not a priority at that time however since coming out of lockdown the market has been very strong and is thriving during lockdown we also had people view and purchase their home entirely by a virtual experience which demonstrates the importance of technology and the part it has played in the past year now we re welcoming them back to our show homes we have also been recruiting we have taken on 25 apprentices this year and last as well as five graduates and we are looking to hire more as well as the oregon timber acquisition and invested 500 000 in new plant and equipment to support future growth do you have plans to make more such moves including further potential acquisitions we have no plans for future acquisitions as part of the acquisition of oregon the challenge was to integrate it fully into our business and provide timber kits for all of our sites this was realised through creating efficiencies in the design we have now increased our capacity and extended our geographical area of operation to supply kits to north east england and yorkshire you joined the group in 1974 what led you to join the business and how did your career progress to your current role i worked in an office and when the barratt job came up i saw it as an opportunity to go to an organisation that had a more hands on approach and was multi disciplined it was also a chance to learn and grow my first role at barratt was as a quantity surveyor then i was promoted to chief surveyor then technical director followed by managing director and finally regional managing director for scotland the year you started at barratt the average price of a uk home in the second quarter was 10 027 but in the same period this year it was 242 709 according to figures from nationwide what is barratt doing to help first time buyers get onto the ladder and how can the problem of affordability be addressed more broadly advertisement hide ad advertisement hide ad barratt has designed a range of homes well suited to first time buyers 25 per cent of the homes we build are affordable and suit them we do have various incentive schemes to encourage first time buyers into the market including golden share which is backed by city of edinburgh council and is an affordable housing scheme for eligible first time buyers and existing homeowners which allows them to purchase a new home at only 80 per cent of its market value we also have the armed forces deposit contribution scheme which is an exclusive deposit scheme for servicemen and women and their families offering them a 5 per cent deposit up to 15 000 we also run development specific schemes such as 5 per cent deposit boosts which allow people who have saved 10 per cent to reduce the overall cost of borrowing to assist first time buyers if more land was released through the planning system this would reduce the cost of new homes barratt has said it fully expects the business to return to pre covid levels by the end of the 2021 22 business year how does it aim to achieve this and mitigate rising build costs that it flagged in may our first step was to secure the land to enable us to build the volume of new homes at pre covid levels we have improved the design of our timber kits and our homes to provide efficiencies and this has been completed in collaboration with oregon which has helped reduce the impact of rising material costs our timber kit homes are more sustainable and well insulated lowering the running cost for the homeowner a message from the editor thank you for reading this article we re more reliant on your support than ever as the shift in consumer habits brought about by coronavirus impacts our

phone s ping announces its toddler like demand for attention there s a voicemail i listen and feel my heart take the express lift down 20 floors to my needy stomach the restaurant i had booked for lunch in manchester the one this train is now transporting me towards has been told by nhs test and trace that it must close temporarily therefore with regret my lunchtime booking is cancelled and so on seriously that booking the one that s just been cancelled was a replacement for the previous one in manchester that had also been cancelled i awoke a few days before to a text baldly announcing the fact and telling me to check my email it turned out they too had test and trace issues that had forced them for staffing reasons to close at lunchtimes for the sake of doubt my main sympathies here are with the restaurants it s your classic scream by munch with a side dish of blood drenched carrie nightmare god just surviving the lockdowns of the past 18 months has been hard enough but to reopen only to be forced to close again is a bespoke kind of cruel some will argue there is a simple moral to this story i shouldn t be travelling to restaurants to review them on this i don t think i can win others complain i haven t left london recently my view is that restaurants are open that i am double jabbed and that i should simply get on with it view image in fullscreen crackling like glass and the softest of fat pork belly photograph shaw shaw the observer of course that s easier said than done when the restaurants keep cancelling so let me say that my subsidiary sympathies are with myself poor me as my train barrels through milton keynes i fire off messages to my friends in manchester seeking recommendations for somewhere for lunch that is a noteworthy and b open and able to take a table for two at roughly 90 minutes notice which is how i find myself on the familiar walk from manchester piccadilly station to the tight knot of streets that makes up the city s chinatown there just 100m or so down faulkner street from the bold flourish of the chinatown arch is pho cue it s a simple cafeteria space with fake whitewashed brick walls and a fake vertical garden the restaurant s name glaring out in white neon from amid the plastic flowers say that name out loud say it quickly if you fancy make a stab at pronouncing pho correctly so it sounds closer to fur i can wait yeah i know now let s move on view image in fullscreen the nearest thing to slightly arch innovation vietnamese tacos photograph shaw shaw the observer the owner cue tran can of course say he was merely putting his first name above the door but he s savvier than that he knows how to work the angles i know it tastes good he said of their food in an interview last year with the website manchester confidential when they had just opened it tastes like home it s not just my name above the restaurant but the legacy of my family as long as the methods are there then you bring it up to date and make it look instagram worthy pho cue may indeed be a bright modern presence on instagram but it hums with history cue s family escaped vietnam during the war in a dinghy joining the other boat people in their search of safety he was just a baby at the time now here is that family making a statement about who they are and where they have come from one brisk vibrant dish at a time in the kitchen tran is often accompanied by his father and uncle all the classics are present and correct and all are seriously good value small dishes are around 6 very few of the larger dishes make it into double figures we see summer rolls sliced in half and standing to attention in their silky white skins pass us by there are deep fried spring rolls both come with pungent dipping sauces there are of course banh mi those huge lengths of over stuffed slightly sweet baguette a legacy of the former french colonial power now transferred to manchester view image in fullscreen its rich savoury depths are profound and restorative pho with beef and noodles photograph shaw shaw the observer we have soft shell crab broken up and lightly battered in a big dry mess of onions garlic chilli salt and pepper with just a touch of sugar it s a bowl of pow and gosh and do you mind if i finish this the nearest thing to slightly arch innovation is what they call vietnamese tacos the wheat or corn flour tortilla replaced by hand sized deep fried pancakes lined with iceberg lettuce then filled with a sweet sour tumble of fresh tomatoes bean sprouts fried shallots and in our case roasted pork it s a messy encouraging handful ask for extra napkins the pho is everything it should be a huge bowl steaming with the sort of 24 hour simmered stock that helps you conclude everything is right with the world its rich savoury depths are profound and restorative and all consuming ours has thin slices of beef poached from raw in the liquor along with handfuls of fresh mint coriander spring onions and beansprouts at the bottom is a big old tangle of slippery rice noodles it is a dish to which you could return time and again it is lunch by itself and at 9 30 a damn reasonable one view image in fullscreen it s a bowl of pow and gosh and do you mind if i finish this soft shell crab photograph shaw shaw the observer we have a plate of their crispy pork belly with crackling like glass and the softest of fat under a snowfall of sliced spring onions and more golden fried shallots there is a sweet and vinegary crisp and crunchy salad of papaya and king prawns and carrots and peanuts like so much here it simply makes you feel like you are being good to yourself i ask if there is a dessert menu more out of professional duty than desire i am told that there is not so we return to where we began and order a second plate of the soft shell crab just to check it really was as good as we thought the first time round you ll be relieved to know it was eventually we down the chopsticks and chase the last fragments around the bowl with a spoon the widely distanced tables are filled with mostly asian families this lunchtime all having a very good time i am no less sympathetic to the two manchester restaurants where i wasn t able to eat today i want them to get back to being fully open as soon as possible i still want to eat at both of them but i can t pretend i am grateful that

i do not expect any of my fellow liberal progressive democrats to share my concern here but because i believe that it will be very difficult for the democrats to retain the pesidency in 2024 and to retain control of congress in 2022 because of republican state legislatures wanting to make it hard for many democrats to vote i want whoever the republicans nominate for president in 2024 to be a high quality person such as carly fiorina who voted for biden harris in 2020 i like it that she is widely known to be a very sensitive empathetic and compassionate person on
port hawkesbury paper recently added a third sennebogen log handler to its fleet after the first two accumulated a total of 100 000 service hours the port hawkesbury mill site has a long history of positive contribution to the eastern region of nova scotia the mill was first developed in 1962 as a sulfite pulp mill and expanded into manufacturing newsprint and pulp for the next three decades in 1998 the port hawkesbury site expanded again by investing in a supercalender sc paper machine in 2012 the mill at port hawkesbury was reopened by stern partners as port hawkesbury paper and today continues to operate as a world class high tech paper manufacturing facility according to mark farrow the same can be said of the mill s wood yard in 2012 when stern partners purchased the mill they reopened it with 5 million worth of new processing equipment and facility upgrades one of the upgrades was a new live log deck loading heights averaged over 22 ft 7 m beyond the reach of their legacy log handling machines the need for higher loading capability led the mill to its first sennebogen 830 m t purpose built log handler 830 m t can do it all the 830 quickly proved its value loading directly from incoming trucks up to the feed deck the elevating maxcab brought the operators eye level up above the deck for a clear view into their work zone with its specially designed undercarriage the log handler also came through with the strength to fill and pull 80 000 lb trailer loads up and down a 40 ft 12 m rise to the site s upper wood yard the 830 could do it all without relying on other machines to help it stack load or pull in due course as the mill s success led to full production and round the clock shifts a second 830 m t was added to the yard fleet port hawkesbury now represents approximately 20 percent of north america s capacity for sc papers capable of delivering 400 000 tons of sca sca and sca papers annually recently port hawkesbury paper commissioned its third 830 m t and that first unit purchased almost nine years ago is still on the job this is a tough machine farrow said he is the mill s mechanical maintenance planner supervisor and he has been on site there since its reopening it s mechanically sound and gives us great runnability for our operation the first one is up to 58 000 hours now our technicians gave it a new engine two years ago at 42 000 hours it was still working fine we just wanted to be proactive and head off any risk of it going down we didn t want to be down to one machine now the second unit is up close to 48 000 hours and it has a new engine too it s quite the machine all around the secret to machines longevity farrow said that the only time his 830s stop is when they have to refuel between unloading trucks feeding the deck and picking logs from the stockpile the 830s are always moving all over the yard conditions can be difficult and he said some spots can get wet it s rough there are slight hills in the yard but we ve never had an issue with towing anything anywhere in the yard they handle everything we throw at them the sennbogen equipment is clearly built for durability and reliability based on sennebogen s material handler platform the undercarriage of the 830 m t is specially engineered for the stresses of log yard duties reinforced to handle heavy pulling stresses it also features dual transmissions serving each axle to pull through muddy spring yard conditions and challenging grades but farrow said the secret to his machines longevity is the people who look after the machines we have four service techs on staff who keep them running effieciantly he said these guys are professionals at what they do and all work as a team the techs here are very involved in the operation and are a key factor in why these machines keep running the way they do factory training builds trust all four techs on the service team have completed sennebogen s week long level 1 factory training program provided at no cost at the firm s training center in stanley n c plans were in place for them to also attend the level 2 training school for advanced troubleshooting however covid 19 forced a postponement but according to farrow it is on the books to get them there as soon as they can i m a very trustworthy supervisor with them farrow said we use the computerized maintenance management system avantis at php they know the system they know the equipment they re computer savvy they monitor all pms and control the work order flow along with all the other equipment they keep things in order and enter important data when closing work orders for future reference a highly skilled and self reliant group of guys for sure farrow also credits the strong working relationship between the technicians and the operators in the yard our operators have respect for their equipment they take good care of the machines they report to the operations manager at the end of every day so any little thing that comes up the techs can pick it off quickly the technicians and operators all know each other too they are in touch using two way radios if there s something the operator needs looked at right away one of the techs can get into the service truck and look after it right onsite design for parts availability located on cape breton island port hawkesbury s only connection to the canadian mainland is through a causeway landing 5 miles up the road however the mill has had no problem ensuring that its technicians have a steady supply of parts we have a good relationship with all the people at strongco we keep a lot of parts here in our own inventory we stock the service kits that sennebogen packages up for our machines sennebogen also uses a lot of standard non proprietary parts that we can buy locally even our hoses we get them made up locally and coded for each machine and we can make some of them here in our shop when we planned to exchange the engines they were here quickly only a week out and they could have been faster if we had needed them the next generation last year the management team decided to bring a third sennebogen 830 m t to the wood yard this is port hawkesbury s first machine in the new e series lineup the big change is in cab comfort said farrow the operators really like it they can work comfortably whether they are up high or down low moving or loading through long shifts we re saving with the new cummins t4f engines as well sennebogen s eco mode reduces the rpms automatically to save fuel when they re idling based on results with the first two sennebogens there was never a question of which new log handler to purchase the techs are so familiar with these machines they can hear a noise from the machine when they re walking across the yard and they know what s wrong with the factory training they got along with the serviceability and reliability of these machines choosing a sennebogen was the best business decision for

decades after burnishing his reputation as a wealthy daredevil mogul in a series of boating and hot air balloon expeditions richard branson is poised to promote his burgeoning astro tourism venture by launching himself to the final frontier branson s virgin galactic holding inc spce n is due on sunday to send the company s passenger rocket plane the vss unity on its first fully crewed test flight to the edge of space with the british billionaire founder among the six individuals strapping in for the ride the gleaming white spaceplane will be borne by a twin fuselage carrier jet dubbed vms eve named for branson s mother to an altitude of 50 000 feet where unity will be released and soar by rocket power in an almost vertical climb through the outer fringe of earth s atmosphere at the apex of its flight some 55 miles 89 km above the new mexico desert the crew will experience a few minutes of weightlessness before making a gliding descent back to earth if all goes according to plan the flight will last about 90 minutes and end where it began on a runway at spaceport america near the aptly named town of truth or consequences virgin s unity 22 mission marks the 22nd test flight of the spacecraft and the company s fourth crewed mission beyond earth s atmosphere but it will be the first to carry a full complement of space travelers two pilots and four mission specialists branson among them milestone and publicity although the mission is seen as a potential milestone in helping transform citizen rocket travel into a mainstream commercial venture spaceflight remains an inherently hazardous endeavor an earlier prototype of the virgin galactic rocket plane crashed during a test flight over california s mojave desert in 2014 killing one pilot and seriously injuring another if successful sunday s flight will also give branson bragging rights to besting rival jeff bezos and his space company blue origin in what has been popularized as a billionaire space race bezos founder of online retail giant amazon com is slated to fly aboard blue origin s suborbital rocketship the new shepard later this month branson s official job on his flight is to evaluate the private astronaut experience and his observations will be used to enhance the journey for all future astronaut customers according to virgin s press materials sir richard branson stands on the floor of the new york stock exchange nyse ahead of virgin galactic spce trading in new york u s october 28 2019 reuters brendan mcdermid but marco caceres a senior space analyst for the virginia based consulting firm teal group said the branson and bezos ride alongs were each a bit of a publicity stunt if they succeed their ventures will be taken more seriously caceres said there s plenty of multimillionaires in the world that would like to go up on an adventure so long as they see it as relatively safe virgin galactic and blue origin along with fellow billionaire entrepreneur elon musk s spacex are competing head to head in the emerging business of space tourism though musk has a big head start spacex which plans to send its first all civilian crew without musk into orbit in september has already launched numerous cargo payloads and astronauts to the international space station branson 70 insists there is plenty of demand from wealthy would be citizen astronauts to go around and that he had no intention of trying to upstage bezos not a race it s honestly not a race branson told reuters in an interview earlier this week if it s a race it s a race to produce wonderful spaceships that can make many more people be able to access space and i think that s both of our aims the spaceplane s two pilots dave mackay and michael masucci will control the ignition and shutoff of the ship s rocket engine and activate the vehicle s feathered tail maneuver for re entry the three other mission specialists are beth moses the company s chief astronaut instructor virgin galactic s lead operations engineer colin bennett and sirisha bandla a research operations and government affairs vice president the virgin brand including branson s airline and former record label has long been associated with exploits of derring do by its flamboyant founder branson set a new record for the fastest boat crossing of the atlantic in 1986 a year after his initial attempt ended with a royal air force helicopter rescue when his vessel capsized in 1987 he made a record breaking atlantic crossing by hot air balloon though again he had to be rescued from the sea he went on to break at least two other air balloon speed records but failed to complete any of three bids to circumnavigate the globe by balloon as for sunday s flight branson said this week that he is excited and i really don t think there s anything there to be scared about assuming the mission goes well virgin has said it plans two further test flights of the spaceplane before beginning commercial service next year the company has said it has received more than 600 flight reservations priced at around 250 000 per ticket but hopes eventually to slash the cost of each seat to 40 000 reporting by steve gorman in los

at a recent seminar by online trading academy ota titled navigating the everything bubble bachir chaaya gave a particularly enlightening talk he began by posing three questions are we going to continue to see the inflation going forward or is it transitory are we in an overvalued stock market what should we do about these things he then launched into some history to give a deeper understanding of the situation regarding inflation going back to germany in 1923 we see germany s papiermark their currency at the time becoming entirely worthless in hungary in 1946 just after world war ii the government began recklessly printing money which was coupled with a great deal of borrowing this led to prices doubling as fast as every 15 hours in the local currency in 1994 after the dissolution of the soviet union the same thing happened in yugoslavia the 1990s saw zimbabwe making some poor decisions which led to hyperinflation by 2008 the government ran out of paper to print money with and prices doubled every 24 hours this is a story we saw repeated in 2009 north korea 2016 in venezuela and most recently in lebanon in 2020 is the united states next there were three things in common with all of the above stories they include excessive money printing excessive borrowing reduced production after he discussed the history chaaya took a look at historical charts in order to assess where we are now this included a chart of the overall m1 money supply which shows a marked jump due to the stimulus payments next was unemployment which while having dropped significantly since the depth of the pandemic has still not achieved pre pandemic levels this could lead one to conclude that though there is a lot of money in the market this increase may not be due to increased production the next chart chaaya looked at was personal income this has also seen a marked increase but it too may not have been due to increased production once a salary goes up it can be difficult to bring it down meanwhile commodities prices have risen 50 since the stimulus package began are these causal that s unclear but commodities have risen a great deal chaaya also took a look at the breakeven inflation rate this can be a great predictor of future inflation and right now it s predicting inflation may rise it calculates the difference between the yield on 10 year non protected treasuries and 10 year treasury inflated protected securities tips the higher that number the more likely inflation is and the number is going up and right now the actual inflation rate is the highest it s been since 2008 there is another major variable at play here which is the velocity of money this shows that all of the money that has been pumped into the economy may not have been used for consumption of goods and services but perhaps rather towards saving this would mean that there is a lot of money in the economy that is not circulating what evidence is there of higher inflation going forward chaaya summarized the main evidence pointing to the possibility of higher than normal inflation in the future because of the following higher wages without higher production reduced economic output higher breakeven inflation rate inflation at its highest value in 13 years is the stock market overvalued to answer this question chaaya first looked at the shiller price earnings pe ratio this is usually used to measure the ratio of the market caps of the stocks in the s p 500 versus their average earnings for the past 10 years adjusted for inflation right now we are experiencing a shiller pe ratio that is the highest it has been in the twenty years this is a possible indication that the stock market might be overvalued but this does not necessarily indicate a change is on the horizon soon while it is necessary to protect against the results of overvaluation it s also important to understand that it could continue the price to book ratio which compares the market value of a company to its book value their assets minus their liabilities is the highest it has been in nineteen years this indicates that things are becoming more expensive in an environment with reduced economic output which could be a cause of problems in the future finally chaaya looked at the market cap over gross national products gnp aka the buffet indicator when used with the gdp this is an indication of possible overvaluation in the stock market as well indicating that things are becoming more expensive especially when there may be a lack of production to support it these indicators all lead to some major questions the big questions will the future be inflationary at least two of the three major factors for possible inflation are currently present the government is injecting a lot of money into the economy and printing a great deal of money while users are engaging in a great deal of borrowing on the brighter side while there has been a drop in production it is not stagnant there is production and movement which the real gdp figures reflect an argument for inflation is all those higher wages which are hard to roll back this means that we might see a continuation of rising consumer prices on the other hand you have the velocity of money which has been hoarded with the end of the pandemic we may see a lot more consumer demand which might cause that money to flow back into the economy is hyper inflation a probability chaaya believes that hyper inflation or the massive devaluation of the united states dollar while possible is an unlikely event this is in part because as long as it s the most widely held reserve currency in the world it will continue to act as an international medium for exchange in parallel to local currencies chaaya believes that while possible the international demand this creates makes the dollar an unlikely candidate for hyper inflation is deflation a probability oftentimes when deflation is talked about the lost decade 1991 2001 in japan in mentioned up until the late 80s japan experienced an unbelievable bull market culminating in consumer goods becoming astronomically expensive when things became too expensive people saved more and wouldn t spend this led to deflation there are several similarities between our current situation and japan in the late 80s one big similarity is how the fed is responding however there is a major difference in that the united states has much more of a consumer culture as opposed to japan s saving culture another argument against future deflation is the rise of technological innovation which will allow for increased production to meet demand especially that which might occur at the end of the pandemic so overall while possible the likelihood of deflation is low in chaaya s opinion is the market overvalued and due for a correction many market valuations indicators are saying that the market might be overvalued from the shiller pe at an all time high to the price to book ratio the current high stock market valuation is largely being driven by share buybacks and higher than expected earnings however it is important to remember that these are made possible by the ability to borrow or refinance debt at cheaper than normal historical rates companies are richer because they are being given money and while this is allowing them to be more productive what happens when the cheap money spigot is turned off companies that are relying on debt to generate profits are likely to feel this in a big way even if the feds raise market interest rates very gradually the market is likely to react and could possibly overreact that could be a catalyst for a major correction how should i position myself right now the fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place if it leaves the interest rates low then inflation is likely to soar but if they correct that by raising rates it s likely the market will overreact this leaves them trying to strike a difficult balance and communicate without triggering an event in the face of such uncertainty one way to position yourself is by identifying those companies with healthy balance sheets this requires being able to read the financial statements of companies it also means being able to build an adequately diverse portfolio not just a 60 40 equities to bonds a truly diverse portfolio is one of the best ways to shelter against the uncertainty of the future those companies that are the most likely to weather inflationary pressure are those with zero to low debt levels companies that have the cash can survive troubles better than a company with high income and high debt other companies to look for are those that may benefit from the lift of the lockdown like starbucks as investors it s important to assess a company s intrinsic value with anticipated trends in the future a diversified portfolio because a diversified portfolio is so central to a sound strategy dealing with the uncertain future of the stock market chaaya took some time to delve deeper into this topic laying out the criteria which a diversified portfolio needs to meet allowing for a continued growth in equities we could be wrong about all of this and the market could continue on a bull run this would include a blend of small mid large companies domestic and international value and growth allowing for participation in the rise of the commodities market this allows the investor to take advantage of the possibility of rising prices of commodities allowing for the possibility of a major correction if interest rates go up this means investing in possible inflation protected securities investing in companies that may benefit from the end of the lockdown and be better positioned for inflation due to pricing power overall it is critical to identify the companies and the funds to build a truly diverse portfolio as well as to balance how to allocate funds to each of them it is also important to have a clear approach as to what the long term investment plan is chaaya concluded his talk by sharing the extensive outline for his course prime your portfolio designed to help you diversify and build a portfolio that could be better able to weather a storm the talk which bachir chaaya delivered for the navigating the everything bubble seminar is just one small example of the fine education

cattle rancher janie vanwinkle seen standing near a reservoir on her colorado ranch during a record hot summer says drought is only one problem facing fellow ranchers grand junction united states afp the grass should be up to here janie vanwinkle says holding a hand next to her knee above the scant growth on her ranch in colorado which just as in 2020 and 2018 is again being hit by devastating drought here we are again she says wearing a checkered shirt and a persistent smile that belies her ranch s woes at a time when record high temperatures have been scorching much of the us west the soil moisture is just completely depleted you can dig down four feet and there s no moisture in the dirt so that s the cumulative effect that makes it tougher than previous droughts but the drought is only one of many challenges facing ranchers not only in mesa county where she lives but across the west the drought s right here in your face you never get away from that she says so it feels like we are always under attack whether it s fake meat wolves animal rights environmental issues you name it colorado provides a case study of the modern tensions between cities and the countryside between the metropolis of denver a haven for digital start ups and progressive movements and sparsely inhabited regions where ranchers spend hours on horseback checking on their grazing herds janie vanwinkle her husband howard and their son dean own about 450 head of cattle after selling 70 last fall in expectation of the coming drought and 35 in june as their hay stock began to run low they are constantly juggling between buying more feed as its price rises and selling more cattle while the survival of the ranch is not immediately threatened this will be a bad year janie vanwinkle estimates that her cattle will weigh 100 to 120 pounds 45 to 55 kilograms less than usual when they are sold to feedlots in the fall emotional cost looking ahead the most likely scenario is that these drier conditions will be the norm said russ schumacher a professor of atmospheric science at colorado state university it will take years of above normal precipitation not just one year to get out of these conditions he added the higher temperatures brought on by climate change are magnifying the consequences of low rain and snowfall schumacher said when her son came home from college janie vanwinkle recalled dean was like you guys need to be irrigating but we are we have been she said it s just not doing anything because it s been so hot she worries about what the future holds for her son the fifth generation of ranchers in the family not just because of the drought but because of an increasing tangle of societal pressures in march colorado s democratic governor urged people to observe a day without meat the state voted in 2020 to reintroduce wolves which prey on cattle and real estate developers and tourism promoters keep buying up prime ranchland an ngo that campaigns against animal cruelty recently sought to organize a statewide referendum that would have banned artificial insemination and the slaughter of cattle less than five years old instead of the more typical age of less than two years all of these things come together and it does create a huge emotional toll on our ranchers and our livestock producers it s brutal said vanwinkle who was the previous president of the colorado cattlemen s association in the long run social perception is going to change things more than drought she said it s sometimes just totally overwhelming biggest upcyclers dean vanwinkle who recently completed his college studies in animal science remains convinced that the cattle ranching industry can adapt and survive even flourish while respecting the environment cattle are the biggest upcyclers really that there is he said referring to their ability to transform hay into protein ultimately he added cattle themselves are pretty much climate neutral that claim is widely disputed worldwide cattle are responsible for 14 5 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions behind climate change according to the united nations the rate in the united states is lower however four percent according to the us environmental protection agency the american industry boasts that it produces as much meat now as in 1977 but with herds that are 33 percent smaller owing to progress in genetics and nutrition the producers are extremely adaptive said kim stackhouse lawson who heads a sustainable livestock initiative at colorado state university in collaboration with the industry among possible developments she mentioned breeds better adapted to different climates new technologies like drones or computer linked necklaces to guide cattle and diversification by ranchers into eco tourism or hunting expeditions i believe that the future is bright said brackett pollard who wears two hats as a rancher and a banker we ve learned through the pandemic where prices were exceptionally high that people are willing to pay a lot for our product said pollard who raises several hundred head of cattle at his ranch near the town of rifle we ve got social pressures he added but the demand for beef has never been higher

bloomberg bloomberg you can now subscribe to our you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel it was the kind of brazen pr stunt that jack ma might have dreamed up but this wasn t the flamboyant chinese billionaire who disappeared from public view eight months ago it was mark zuckerberg bobbing up and down on a hydrofoil surfboard clutching an american flag and exuding all the confidence of a man worth 130 billion the contrast between the social media mogul s july 4th instagram video and the day s big event in china could hardly have been starker regulators in beijing had just hours earlier banned didi global inc s ride hailing service from app stores delivering their latest hammer blow to an entrepreneurial elite that once seemed destined to challenge zuckerberg and his u s peers at the top of the world s wealth rankings the age of unfettered gains for china s ultra rich now appears to be coming to an abrupt end even as the world s 10 wealthiest people added 209 billion to their net worth in the first half of 2021 china s richest tycoons in the bloomberg billionaires index saw their combined fortunes shrink by 16 billion shares of their flagship companies sank by an average 13 during the period the first time in at least six years they ve recorded declines when the broader chinese equity market was rising didi s stock has plunged 14 since its june 30 debut on the new york stock exchange slashing the wealth of the company s co founders by almost 800 million behind the losses is a crackdown that has only intensified since november when ma s ant group co was forced to pull its blockbuster initial public offering at the last minute policy makers are tightening regulations on some of the most important facets of asia s largest economy from financial services to internet platforms and the data that underpins most big businesses in modern china in the latest salvo regulators unveiled new draft rules on saturday that would require nearly all domestic companies to undergo a cybersecurity review before listing in a foreign country beijing s motivations for the crackdown are varied they include concerns about anticompetitive behavior in the tech industry risks to financial stability from lightly regulated lending platforms and the rapid proliferation of sensitive personal information in the hands of large corporations but another undercurrent running through many of the government s latest initiatives is a not so secret desire to rein in the power of china s tycoons some of whom have amassed an enormous amount of influence over the 14 trillion economy as one government official familiar with the leadership s thinking described it beijing wants to prevent its billionaires from becoming a force as strong as the family run chaebol that dominate south korea s economy and many aspects of its politics adding to beijing s resolve is the chinese public s growing concern over rising inequality at a major speech on his economic plans in october president xi jinping acknowledged that the country s development was unbalanced and said common prosperity should be the ultimate goal the upshot is a new era for the country s billionaires and the investors who back them gone are the days when tycoons like ma could confidently bend the rules to supercharge their companies growth and challenge entrenched interests like state owned banks outsized public personas long seen as an asset for tech company founders now look like a liability the new playbook for china s ultra rich calls for more deference to the communist party more charitable donations and more focus on the wellbeing of rank and file employees even if it hurts the bottom line some of the tech companies became larger than life said allan zeman a property tycoon who gave up his canadian passport to become a naturalized citizen of china in 2008 one big lesson from the crackdown don t get bigger than the government zeman said shortly after attending the communist party s 100th anniversary celebration in beijing on july 1 didi notwithstanding the message appears to be getting through ma who criticized chinese financial regulators in his last public speech before ant s ipo was abruptly suspended has since resurfaced only a handful of times in carefully choreographed appearances colin huang whose e commerce giant pinduoduo inc has come under scrutiny for its relentless working schedules has given up his roles as chairman and ceo and donated shares worth billions of dollars bytedance ltd founder zhang yiming said in may he would step down as ceo and spend more time on educational charity wang xing the chairman of food delivery giant meituan has mostly steered clear of the public spotlight since he posted a 1 100 year old poem in may that some regarded as an implicit criticism of the government wang who later issued a clarification saying the post had been targeted at the shortsightedness of his own industry was advised by beijing officials to keep a low profile according to people with knowledge of the matter the new environment will fundamentally change china s tech sector partly because investors will become more wary of funding entrepreneurs who could end up on a collision course with beijing said eric schiffer ceo of patriarch organization a los angeles based private equity firm u s president joe biden has also taken aim at the billionaire class calling for increased taxes on the rich and signing an executive order on friday that aims to weaken dominance of america s biggest companies the move echoed an ongoing antitrust campaign in china that has ensnared giants including alibaba group holding ltd and arch rival tencent holdings ltd one key difference is that chinese authorities unrestrained by western style checks and balances can act more forcefully than their u s counterparts said angela zhang director of the centre for chinese law at the university of hong kong and author of chinese antitrust exceptionalism zuckerberg s hydrofoil joyride came just a few days after a judge dismissed two monopoly lawsuits against facebook inc that had been filed by the u s government and a coalition of states in the case of china the pendulum swings very quickly zhang said beijing has a variety of tools for reining in billionaires including detention in the most extreme cases an internal disciplinary process for party members known as shuanggui has been used for some tycoons in the past investigations by antitrust cybersecurity and other regulators are more common ways to influence the behavior of tech giants the government also uses soft methods including state media campaigns zhang said in the days after regulators halted ant s ipo xi visited a museum in the eastern city of nantong that was created by zhang jian a 19th century capitalist the chinese president described zhang as a patriotic nation builder and philanthropist rather than disrupt the financial system with unregulated loans he built factories and hundreds of schools when you see a virtuous person follow his example xi was quoted as saying by chinese media calling on private entrepreneurs to strengthen their feelings for the country and assume social responsibilities while china s crackdown has been most visible in the tech industry the country s property billionaires have also come under increased pressure in recent years authorities have steadily restricted the industry s access to funding in an attempt to rein in home prices and reduce systemic risks to the financial system china evergrande group chairman hui ka yan has been among the biggest casualties of the campaign this year losing 6 7 billion or nearly 30 of his fortune as evergrande s stock tumbled on concerns the company faces a liquidity crunch a more subtle sign of billionaires waning influence can be seen in their shrinking share of political appointments data from the hurun report which produces wealth rankings shows that rich entrepreneurs accounted for 5 8 of delegates in the chinese people s political consultative conference and the national people s congress the lowest in at least eight years and down from 15 3 in 2013 there is an evolution in the thinking of which type of people should be within the mix said rupert hoogewerf the hurun report s chairman it s becoming much harder for entrepreneurs the big question is whether all of this will be good for china in the long run one risk is that the onslaught of regulatory probes and rule changes undermines investor confidence hku s zhang said that could make it less likely that the entrepreneurs behind the next potential alibaba or tencent get the funding they need to make their ideas a reality global venture capital firms will likely think twice about investing in chinese companies if beijing prevents them from listing overseas a crucial exit route for early international backers yet some of beijing s new policies may foster competition in the oligopolistic tech industry clearing the way for a new class of billionaires to rise stricter regulations on fintech firms will help reduce systemic risks even if they slow down innovation china s crackdown on ant won praise last month from berkshire hathaway inc vice chairman charlie munger who said in an interview with cnbc that the communists did the right thing by letting ma know he couldn t wade into banking and just do whatever he pleased either way china s entrepreneurs will have little choice but to embrace the new normal said chen long a partner at consulting firm plenum the good old days of savage growth are gone with assistance from pei yi mak adrian leung and jane pong

production in 2020 and higher disease losses this past winter the hog supply has taken a hit this will then drive prices higher amid the increased demand for pork products the decline means retailers

parts ranging from tires to water pumps can be hard to come by if you don t know where to look supply chain and building material constraints have hampered new truck builds for much of the year but a similar effect is also being felt by fleets who simply want to service the trucks they already have volatility in steel and rubber prices has impacted the availability of tires and forged parts like blocks and housings and lead times for parts that used to be a few days can drag on for weeks every day we realize something else is hard or impossible to get said brent edmonson an ontario canada based truck technician with l f mattice farms trucking bulk 10w30 isn t currently available in our area and barrels or pails are about a month wait edmonson noted he had to wait a week for 18 inch brake chambers and several weeks for stainless flange covers for taillights nox sensors and dpf exhaust gaskets clamps are unattainable he said dealers called the fleet shop i m at begging to buy ours back in the spring filters have especially been hard to come by edmonson suspects parts sourcing in canada has been at least marginally more difficult than it has in the states especially for carriers who have the ability and forethought to place orders in advance we ve been buying parts from american peterbilt dealers over the phone when the local dealers say they re not available he said we then have our own trucks bring the parts back home in the sleeper during the first quarter last year southeastern freight lines ccj top 250 no 31 director of maintenance lee long said the lexington s c based carrier evaluated its usage of key parts and ordered its most common used hard parts like water pumps engine sensors and turbos that proved successful as we were able to maintain our fleet through the supply chain disruptions due to covid he said as the market constricts further we have still been able to source parts but some with extended lead times some parts long said continue to prove scarce at times but sefl s corporate parts manager has a knack to find those parts that are not available through the good and bad times our key relationships have allowed us to weather these opportunities he added being proactive at this time is the best method to insure shortages are held at bay similarly the parts department at little rock arkansas based maverick transportation no 79 has been able to source providers and find parts without what director of maintenance brent hilton called long delays however he added it is getting tougher and tougher each day we are having daily issues finding parts anything from brake parts to sensors tight parts supplies have been caused by a combination of things not only raw material limitations but also a self inflicted surge in demand due a perceived shortage or potential shortage that darry stuart ceo and president of dws fleet management services said has prompted manufacturers to raise prices stuart noted some fleets have been placed on allocation for some essentials like lubricants and added a lack of labor is likely contributing to the availability of some hard parts as some oems don t have enough employees to manufacture them to meet demand even if they have the steel and other raw materials sensors are difficult to find egr coolers are difficult def heads are difficult nox sensors awful stuart said noting some oem parts houses have been capped at how much they can order of a given part at a time and adding that oem retailers often lack the resourcefulness and connections to find needed components in some cases stuart said oem parts are more scarce because the aftermarket parts guys are more creative he said noting the drawback to using an aftermarket part is that they often aren t covered under warranty so finding them can be a double edge sword transervice shortage hits service providers as well third party service providers face the same shortages as fleet shops but size and scale of the operation can mitigate the effects generally we have seen some supply shortages with certain parts oil and tires said tina arundel director of communication for travelcenters of america adding the company has been able to leverage relationships with its suppliers nationwide allowing it to predict where geographically there may be possible supply issues and proactively work to ensure stock supply at our sites is minimally impacted claude ricciardi purchasing director for transervice no 220 a provider of customized fleet maintenance and transportation solutions said he s found some dealers while they may have a hard to find part in stock are not willing to sell it over the counter they are keeping them for their own customers i have had that situation happen a couple of times where their system showed a quantity available but when i called the dealer he said i have one but it is already spoken for he said i am seeing that developing within the dealer network marc scibilia director of safety and maintenance for taylor michigan based private carrier adica trucking company and fleet services said his parts team has been searching countrywide to find parts adding we try to explain to our customers when there is a delay in getting parts and for the most part they are understanding we have found that some of the hardest parts to source are the emission parts egr coolers sensors and so on he said there may be a three to five day lead time depending on where they are coming from we are also seeing issues with shipping the vendor may have a part but the shipping is very slow ricciardi said his company is experiencing parts shortages with most components that incorporate some sort of an electronic or chip but is also seeing a shortage with some harder components right now we are seeing a shortage of water pumps with the detroit engines he said they are just not available anywhere it is probably due to the shortages of raw material and of labor stuart said he s advised his clients to source parts from all over the u s even it means having them shipped coast to coast that s a strategy ricciardi said he s deployed as well i am looking anywhere across the country the initial step obviously is our facing dealers but when they don t have the part it is my job is to do research and try to find it somewhere i do not limit myself to any geographical areas i go anywhere there is a dealer whether it be freightliner or international or paccar or whatever he said i make phone calls and log on to websites to see if they are showing the part and in many cases i will even look at used components lkq usually has a pretty good cross section of used truck parts however the last time i was looking for this water pump i called lkq and the guy says to me you are about the 200th person who called me looking for the water pump without necessary repair parts ricciardi said the company has had to put in a number of truck down labels at the dealer calling for the part to be shipped whenever it becomes available but he said it creates a problem because that translates into some extensive downtime if the truck is down and it needs a water pump you can t run it so it just sits there he said for example this water pump i am talking about is not scheduled to become available until august now you are looking at equipment being down for over a month it is a very serious problem that i think is going to continue to haunt us for a while ricciardi said his company hasn t changed its inventory levels preferring to keeping an eye on the situation and if we do start to see signs of shortages in our normal wear and tear components he said then of course we will increase our inventories accordingly to compensate the last thing we want is to have a truck down because we can t get brake shoes it keeps me very busy trying to find all these parts that are not available joe puff vice president of truck technology and maintenance nationalease said the lease and service provider has also experienced some parts shortages and delays in various categories however the large majority of parts are available adding just certain parts are affected i m hearing the reasons for delays vary from raw materials to labor shortages to production problems to extremely high demand kind of a perfect storm he said some parts delays can be quite long which is just not tolerable imagine a parts delay for a 300 part and the downtime cost is around 9 000 unprecedented shortages require non traditional solutions puff said such as temporarily using aftermarket sources remanufactured parts utilizing machine shops and metallurgists to make temporary repairs and where warranted the use of salvage yards until new parts can be procured we can t have trucks sitting for extended periods and waiting for parts he said at nationalease we are leveraging our supplier relationships and examining all options to procure and repair parts as necessary

my earliest recollection of west african food was during the early 60 s when my father was uganda s ambassador and permanent representative to the united nations in new york city admittedly being in my late teens i was but a mere tenderfoot in culinary matters nevertheless owing to my father having married althea hawkins born of trinidadian and tobago parents whose father chef henry hawkins was an unrivalled chef of great renown the man became my greatest hero it is to chef hawkins that i owe my love and admiration for cooking but getting back to jollof rice it so happens that dad s ghanaian counterpart at the united nations was the rather suave erudite and debonair gentleman by the name of alex quaison sackey who sadly passed on at the relatively young age of 68 back in 1992 his wife elsie was a great pal of my stepmother althea and my first taste of jollof rice was compliments of elsie who passed on in 2003 as elsie was oft keen to remind americans who were new to ghanaian cuisine jollof is a fiery and piquant seasoned rice dish that is a mélange of rice tomatoes and spices in ghana and west africa it is usually eaten as a main dish and is also a staple at parties and family gatherings at the base of any jollof is stewed rice with tomatoes onions vegetable oil habanero or scotch bonnet pepper tomato puree stock cubes thyme curry powder ginger and garlic spices ingredients and cooking methods slightly vary between households but the basic elements of rice tomatoes and onions remain constant however there is a lot more to jollof than its ingredients the cooking process is not only intricate but to any novice arcane to say the least the order in which you add the ingredients matters actually it is not farfetched to draw a parallel to the craft of making ugandan pilao jollof is robust and hearty with a mellow texture and blend of spices that gives it a savory taste with an unmistakable and unique hearty pungency if one is making meat jollof then the first order of business would be seasoning the meat with the meat stock determining the eventual flavor and taste of the rice while cooking methods vary between nigerian and ghanaian jollof rice in the old days the main difference between the two would be the type of rice that was used nigerians had a preference for long grain while the ghanaians preferred basmati suffice it to say that nowadays basmati is the universal choice the rising popularity of rice introduced into the region from asia but now grown locally led to the spread and adaptation of the recipe as new cultural enclaves emerged across the west african region so did different jollof interpretations with renditions that have evolved into their own being in a manner of speaking cooking is evolutionary and by no means static i have read about jollof rice with coconut milk which does not make it any less good than otherwise yes even irish potatoes cooked in jollof rice is acceptable what is not omissible in any rendition of jollof is rice stock onions garlic ginger and tomatoes galore and above all the irrepressible and wondrous scotch bonnet chilies today every west african country has some variation of the dish the similarity between the nigerian and ghanaian recipes is a symptom of the fluidity or the porous nature of west african borders and overlapping cultures that can be traced back to the same origins jollof rice jollof rice is a typically west african one dish entrée that uses meat and is somehow akin to our pilao again as is the case with pilao one can feel free to omit the meat and simply use vegetables whereupon it becomes vegetable rice jollof ingredients serves 8 4 breasts of chicken cubed ½ kg of boneless pork cubed 3 to 4 large chopped onions 10 to 12 chopped tomatoes 6 to 10 scotch bonnet chilies 1 cabbage cut into wedges 1 kg basmati rice 2 liters chicken beef stock salt and pepper to taste 4 tbsp tomato paste or more 2 bay leaves vegetable oil 4 cloves chopped garlic 2 tsp chopped ginger method sauté the chicken breast in some vegetable oil until it has nicely browned remove and do likewise the pork while it is sautéing you can brown the onions garlic and ginger and set them aside until they are ready in a saucepan that is large enough to hold the meat and the rice add the pork and the onions garlic and ginger over low heat continue cooking them and add the tomatoes the tomato paste chilies and the bay leaves cook for about five minutes and then add the chicken stock and reduce and simmer covered until the pork is done add salt and pepper since the breast of chicken does not take much time to cook it will go in with the rice
gold ended the week bullish and that counts as the third straight weekly gain for the yellow metal the safe haven asset has returned above the 1 800 trading zone which is considered a crucial support area however the outlook for gold remained unsure as a result of the uncertainty on how long it will take for the much touted u s inflation to accelerate its gains the benchmark gold futures has gained over 40 representing a 2 69 growth since its last negative weekly close that occurred a month ago when it declined to a two month low of 1 761 20 the gains recorded on gold is a result of a weaker u s dollar and u s treasury yield rate the pair usually move inversely against the yellow metal since january gold has been on an undecisive ride the yellow metal started the year around the 1 951 trading zone and has been on a decline ever since it reached its lowest point in march trading at 1 685 but the yellow metal started a recovery bull run to 1 907 in june this recovery was short lived when the price of gold fell by over 140 over the news of the federal reserve s expedited timetable for rate hikes and stimulus tapering the u s federal reserve has indicated that it expects two hikes before 2023 that will bring interest rates within a range of 0 5 to 0 75 from a current pandemic era super low of zero to 0 25 they have also not set a timetable for the tapering or complete freeze of the 120 billion in bonds and other assets it has been buying since march 2020 to support the economy through the covid crisis even though the federal reserve has not set the timetable for tapering it has not stopped senior bankers from commenting on it at the federal open market committee fomc meeting talking about the likelihood of a taper or rate hike in their public speeches typically any speech on tapering or rate hike by a fed official ends up affecting the price of gold what they are saying ed moya head of u s research at oanda an online brokerage firm stated gold is tentatively stabilizing above the psychological 1 800 level and that could open the door for a stronger rebound next week yet there was no certainty about how much impact current inflationary trends in the united states will have on gold which is generally branded as a hedge against rising pressure prices investors will closely await tuesday s inflation report and kickoff the earnings season he also referred to the june update for the consumer price index which hit a 13 year high of 5 in the 12 months to may what to expect as the inflation rate picks up investors would expect the price of gold to appreciate but all scenarios are possible as the federal reserve s decision around asset tapering will determine the u s inflation outlook for the rest of the year gold is an asset that is said to be a hedge against inflation but so far the u s stock market has been breaking all time highs which is more attractive to investors to mention other countries are acquiring gold central banks from serbia to thailand have been adding to their gold holdings also in ghana the country recently announced plans for purchases as the worry of accelerating inflation looms and a recovery in global trade provides the firepower to make purchases if other countries follow this trend price appreciation for gold is set to happen gold is trading at 1 808 55 an ounce gaining approximately 1 42 for the week
greg ganske guest columnist in 1992 the national debt was 4 trillion and 62 of the gross domestic product the nation was riveted by ross perot s 30 minute tv infomercials during his run for president on the perils of the largest national debt percentage of gdp since world war ii and his folksy sayings like the debt is like a crazy aunt we keep down in the basement all the neighbors know she s there but nobody wants to talk to her he sold me i put aside my surgical practice to run for congress in 1994 because i feared that runaway spending and a burgeoning national debt was a danger to our children s future i came out for a balanced budget amendment and this was the cornerstone of the contract with america which along with welfare reform were reasons the republicans took the majority in congress for the first time in 40 years but the national debt was not just a republican concern bill clinton also ran for president in 1992 on balancing the budget and welfare reform both republicans and democrats thought a rapidly rising national debt was a danger to our nation s future on jan 26 1995 i delivered the final argument on the floor of the house of representatives in favor of the balanced budget amendment it passed the house 300 132 with 10 votes more than the two thirds majority needed to pass a constitutional amendment on march 2 every republican senator except one and 14 democrat senators voted to approve the balanced budget amendment but this was one vote short of getting the necessary two thirds majority and the balanced budget amendment failed action to reduce the deficit was bipartisan there are arguments for and against such an amendment but my point is that members of both parties were rightly concerned there were deficit hawks on both sides of the aisle for the next four years the republican congress battled clinton on spending it seemed like every day constituent groups would come to my office and say that they too knew the need to reduce spending just don t cut mine we weighed priorities of spending from a cost benefit analysis there are always ways to spend taxpayer money if the coffers are full but it is very hard for politicians to say no to spending by reducing the rate of increases in spending clinton and the gop congress managed four years of budget surpluses and reduced the national debt by about 560 billion the only time that had been done since long before world war ii and never since we spent less than the government was collecting and this fiscal restraint helped the economy grow in addition to the discretionary budget there was also concern about the viability of entitlements like medicare and social security ross perot helped to inform the public that the trust funds were made up of government bonds that were in effect subsidizing the total budget because their incoming revenues were higher than outlays until the baby boomers began retiring see it national debt per american piles up after coronavirus great recession and tax cuts clinton set up the bipartisan commission on entitlement and tax reform and speaker newt gingrich named me to the committee nearly everyone on the commission agreed that entitlements were on an unsustainable path with the retirement of the baby boomers we are now much closer to the time when we will face significant tax hikes and or decreases in benefits unfortunately consensus reforms of those popular programs are very difficult and the commission failed the budget situation of 1995 pales in comparison to today s when the nonpartisan congressional budget office in january 2020 estimated annual deficits of 1 trillion and that debt would more than double as a share on the economy in the next 30 years then covid 19 hit and our national debt is now already over 28 trillion that isn t even taking into account our real national debt which includes entitlement unfunded liabilities that push the actual debt to about 130 trillion today the interest payment on the debt is the fifth largest budget item if the average of interest rates rise by only a few percent we could easily see interest payments consume nearly 50 of federal revenue in the next decades and that isn t taking into account cashing in those lock box social security trust funds the issue seemingly isn t taken seriously anymore what is the difference when i served in congress and now today it seems that no one is concerned about the debt there is plenty of blame to go around we have seen both democrat and republican administrations ignore the growing national debt under president donald trump the national debt aided by covid 19 hurting the economy grew from 76 of gdp to 100 president joe biden s first proposed budget grows the debt to 117 of gdp even with optimistic economic projections why does this matter the ever rising u s debt will eventually cause investors to question the government s ability to repay its debts the government will have to raise its rates to get investors to buy riskier debt bonds and surging rates will compete with private sector investment decreased private sector investment results in decreased productivity and a vicious cycle develops if interest rates rise too fast the government might even find it difficult to pay those interest payments some economists just say print more money and that may hold true for a short time but inflation hurts those on fixed incomes the most and printing money only works if inflation is low we had a financial crisis in 2008 and are just coming out of one caused by covid the government can deficit spend to stimulate the economy in times of crisis if the national debt is not too high however the current huge increase in debt to gdp now hampers our ability to do that in the future is it time for another budget commission well perot didn t have a very high opinion of commissions if you see a snake just kill it don t appoint a committee on snakes and partisanship in washington is now much worse than when i served the only thing that is going to get us back to more sustainable debt is to elect politicians who can take the heat and spend less than the government takes in tax revenue politicians who keep their promises to reduce the debt and a public that holds them accountable if they don t in the short term a very contentious debt ceiling increase fight is near congress must authorize a debt ceiling increase by aug 1 or default congress has few legislative days scheduled the debt ceiling increase is subject to the filibuster if senate democrats want 10 republican votes a compromise on democrats big spending increases in non traditional infrastructure for example will be necessary trying to pack a debt ceiling increase into an infrastructure bill is risky if the bill stalls in the longer battle to reduce national debt recent polls show a growing awareness that too much debt can hurt the economy however it is easy to blame fearful legislators that we don t support

bimetallic strips have commonly been used in thermostats to flag a potential overheating of air conditioners geysers refrigerators and circuit breakers before the occurrence of potential mishaps they operate on the principle of two dissimilar metals behaving differently when subjected to thermal stress tempting us to apply a similar principle and build our own financial bimetallic strip to detect potential overheating of the financial market writes chiro gosh vice president financial institutions research sico our first metal is dr copper one of the most widely used industrial elements making its price movement a fairly reliable indicator of the current state of global economic health however the challenges posed by the current unprecedented infusion of stimuli and liquidity pumping by both fiscal and monetary authorities alike present difficulties in ascertaining whether the 55 surge in the orange metal prices over the past one year can completely be attributed to only fundamental reasons it therefore warrants a comparison with the other metal of our financial bimetallic strip mr gold an element historically perceived as a safe haven by skeptical investors in an inflationary environment consequently we analysed the movement of copper prices versus that of gold and observed a fairly cyclical trend every four to five years we define the ratio as bimetallic strip ratio bsr that is copper price to gold price wherein a surge in the ratio indicates the emergence of an economic upcycle followed by a tapering down as the economy matures and inflationary pressure kicks in in order to understand the monetary authorities reaction to various economic cycles of the past we compared this bimetallic strip ratio to the long term risk free rate and found a surprisingly strong correlation to summarise when bsr rises perceivably an economic upturn cycle monetary authorities take steps to increase the interest rate to stabilise the growth an understandable action by central banks considering an elevated bsr in addition to a favorable economic environment also warns of a potential pick up in inflation since the onset of the pandemic last year the bsr with long term yields has decoupled despite both initially correcting and moving in a similar direction the bsr has witnessed a sharp revival reaching close to its pre pandemic highs while on the other hand the ten year bond yield is still struggling to reach even the lowest end of the yield cycle witnessed before the covid 19 turmoil in a normal scenario the rise in the bimetallic strip ratio is still fundamentally a favourable time to invest in the stock market yet the suppressed yield is cause for concern this time it is different is the most overused cliché in the investing world and eventually normalisation will persist with the ratio moving in line with the long term yield it could be driven by the cooling off of economic activities a rise in inflation or fed increasing the interest rate cycle sooner than expected under any of the above scenarios we may see the equity bull dragging its feet and ceasing its run leading to a market correction to our dismay we are witnessing evidence of all of the above taking place copper prices are already moving into contango a scenario where future prices are higher than spot prices an indicator of a pricing pressure fed has guided at an inflation expectation rate of 3 4 much higher than its comfort zone of 1 5 2 5 with fed members voting for a couple of rate hikes in 2023 compared to the previous guidance of no hike until 2024 our hypothesis may not materialise immediately however the looming inflationary pressure will only rise unless corrective actions are taken something which fed may also be aware of every story usually has a flip side and deserves to be covered our counter thesis is that the high commodity prices are a result of global lockdowns of various degrees leading to supply disruption from south american producers further aggravated by the surge in shipping costs undoubtedly it is less concerning if fed believes it is more due to supply constraints and are likely to give us more time before they look to tighten the liquidity tap whether it is supply based or demand based or most likely a combination of both it is undoubtedly inflationary and central banks will have to eventually shift towards a hawkish gear a prompt action by the central bank would see higher interest rates and liquidity tightening which would be negative for the capital markets while a delay by them would still be inflationary in turn capping economic recovery thereby leading to a similar consequence tradearabia news service
there are about 22 million millionaires in the u s here s how to become one of them there are 21 951 202 millionaires in the united states according to credit suisse that s a huge number which means that it can happen to anyone but how can you get there three motley fool contributors outline the steps necessary to help you join this elite crowd they re not hard to follow and with a little discipline and smart investing moves you can become a millionaire too save automatically in your 401 k chuck saletta your 401 k can be a wonderful place to reach 1 million in retirement savings most importantly once you sign up to start contributing and investing the money you invest comes out of your paycheck automatically aside from reviewing your choices periodically to make sure your investments still make sense given where you are in life your journey to a 1 million retirement can then pretty much run on autopilot if you re at least age 50 you can generally contribute up to 26 000 per year 2 166 66 per month to your 401 k if you re under 50 your typical annual limit is 19 500 1 625 per month the table below shows how many years it will take to reach a 1 million nest egg based on how much you contribute each month and what rate of return you earn along the way monthly investment 10 annual return 8 annual return 6 annual return 4 annual return 2 166 66 15 8 17 6 20 0 23 3 1 625 18 2 20 4 23 5 27 9 1 500 18 9 21 3 24 5 29 3 1 000 22 4 25 5 29 9 36 7 500 28 8 33 4 40 1 51 0 300 33 7 39 4 48 0 62 5 150 40 5 47 9 59 1 78 8 depending on how long you have before you retire and what rate of return you earn along the way it s possible to become a millionaire retiree based on your 401 k balance alone indeed if you re brand new in your career you might even get there on 150 a month or around 5 a day add an employer match and a potential tax deduction to the mix and your out of pocket contribution could be even less to get to that same 1 million retirement nest egg that s an amazingly powerful outcome that you may very well achieve just by making the one time choice to start contributing and then just letting the contributions continue a magic way to earn millions eric volkman so you want to end your working days as a millionaire eh well then please allow me to introduce you to the wonderful world of compound interest yes the term compound interest sounds like the dullest of the dull finance wonk jargon yet this boring phrase obscures a concept that s almost magical in its power and simplicity and can really bulk up an investment over time in the long run this is far more powerful than simple interest in which a particular interest rate is paid on a principal amount of an investment traditional bonds are a good example of simple interest but with compounding the interest you earn also earns interest essentially it is reinvested into your principal and that total amount keeps earning the posted interest rate the difference between the two becomes increasingly dramatic over time in this table compiled by fellow motley fool contributor matthew frankel a 10 000 investment earning annual compound interest of 10 would grow to 67 275 after 20 years more than double the pile you d have in an investment of the same amount that only clocks simple interest at a matching rate after 30 years that difference would be even more stark at a respective 174 494 and 40 000 when evaluating investment vehicles with compounding interest it s important not only to look at the interest rate on offer but also the frequency of the compounding the standard flavors of frequency are annual semiannual i e twice per year and quarterly four times per year at the risk of stating the obvious all things being equal would be millionaires are better off with more frequent compounding there are several types of investments you can put your money into to get the compound interest ball rolling the good old bank savings account is one many of them compound interest daily so it pays to shop around if you go this route though do resist the temptation to draw from such an account remember the object is to save good compounders can be found among money market accounts the most popular savings bonds issued by our government also compound happily they re also considered among the safest investments in the world dividend reinvestment programs drips aren t technically compound interest vehicles but since they yes reinvest dividend payouts into the purchase of more stock they act in a similar way no panicking allowed barbara eisner bayer on the path to becoming a millionaire there are lots of things you can control contributions to retirement plans funneling money into an emergency fund keeping a balanced portfolio and choosing investments in line with your risk tolerance and goals however there are things you can t control like economic crises rising and falling interest rates and day to day news on the companies you own but if you want to become a millionaire you ll need to ignore all that i always thought that if i had a crystal ball i d go back to the 1990s and buy apple microsoft and amazon and never sell a single share then i d surely be sitting on a small fortune oh wait i did own those three stocks back then but guess what i sold most of them during the tech meltdown in 2001 as a result i have nothing to show for my early brilliance luckily though i bought back in once the crisis subsided but this time i didn t sell even through the mortgage crisis and covid 19 crash apple and amazon are still shining stars in my portfolio with significant gains and i have no plans to ever sell those shares lesson learned don t panic sell the other way to derail your path to becoming a millionaire is to try to time the market an optimal investment strategy would be to sell a stock when it reaches its highest point and then buy back in when it reaches a low only problem is how will you know when that is even psychics can t predict when that will happen if they could they d be so rich their storefronts would be mansions and they wouldn t need to sell their prognostication prowess since you can t time the market the best way to become a millionaire is to buy solid companies with strong fundamentals great management and a strong moat around them so they can stay ahead of their competition and then hold hold hold even through bad news as long as they are short term problems look no company is going to avoid challenges throughout the years but what s important for investors is to realize most of these challenges are just blips and strong management can guide great companies through any temporary hazardous conditions becoming a millionaire retiree is within your grasp just make sure to stay the course and not panic sell along the way and you can become millionaire no 21 951 203
tommy williams most of the relevant financial news now revolves around the obligatory half time reports the 2nd quarter ended somewhat uneventfully with markets continuing to hover at or near all time highs according to cnbc even crude oil jumped to a six year high topping 76 barrel to the delight of local producers as the opec oil cartel cannot get its act together one can assume that the price will not hold it seems saudi arabia and the united arab emirates cannot come to an agreement about production levels due to abundant supply the all important natural gas prices seem to have hit a ceiling just under 4 million cubic feet according to the department of energy i m writing to you this week from chesapeake virginia home of my daughter and 6 year old grandson jack he has tried in vain this week to teach me to work the smart television and various devices i am in need of some remedial work my guess is that most of you reading this can relate i did fly up here for that handful of you who did not travel just prior to the 4th of july holiday let me give you a brief account just like your news reported the planes and airports were packed america is truly on the move everyone wore their masks on the planes and thankfully no one picked a fight with the flight attendants as far as i can tell the opening of the economy is proceeding full steam ahead most notable was the number of cars in front of the shreveport airport many many more than i ve ever seen dropping off passengers and blocking other cars from passing through it was a jungle but great to see the contrast from last year most of you do not know adam crisafulli author of vital knowledge he wrote the industry leading market intelligence commentary at j p morgan for over ten years before venturing out on his own to form vital knowledge media for a reasonable monthly subscription fee he will deliver a comprehensive report via email to you about 4 30 am every morning he must work all night and sleep a little during the daytime as he provides relevant articles and data from every imaginable source the hill the new york times wall street journal politico financial times reuters bloomberg barron s you name it it s in there every morning he began this week with the recognition that investors are mostly now waiting for the upcoming 2nd quarter earnings season which kicks off july 13th despite a recent very solid employment number released he contends that the peak everything thesis remains in effect economic growth government stimulus reopening of the economy are all peaking or have already peaked that was likely a major factor causing volatility in the latter part of this week it could cause most stocks from rising dramatically in the second half of the year this sounds very favorable to me according to the yahoo finance the s p 500 is up about 17 already this year if we can simply hang on to that i think we d have to call it a successful year on the ongoing subject of public enemy number one the pandemic crisafulli suggests that the initial flurry of concern around the delta variant is fading at least in the eyes of the u s stock market the issue is one of getting enough people vaccinated to combat transmission and not one of the variants overcoming the vaccines if it was the other way around investors would be concerned perhaps it is noteworthy that though pfizer s vaccine is only 64 effective in blocking transmission of the delta variant it is still highly effective at preventing serious illness and hospitalizations perhaps you can stop checking your account every day now the death count continues to climb as we trudge slowly toward the 610 000 mark 6 the pace has definitely slowed and we should celebrate that we can only hope the trend continues downward as the results of massive gatherings on july 4th show up in a couple of weeks it certainly seems that efforts to slow the virus are paying off this reminds me once again of sir winston churchill s quote

they are some of the biggest names in the industry and they already have presences in the state last month connecticut became the 19th state to pass legislation to permit recreational marijuana use and sales could commence by may of next year in a few years the market could be worth over 700 million and while it likely won t be anywhere near the size of the markets in nearby new jersey or new york it s still an attractive market in the northeast u s many multistate operators msos are already active in connecticut and could be ready to go when the recreational market officially opens up including green thumb industries gtbif 3 22 curaleaf curlf 2 79 and trulieve tcnnf 2 97 here s a look at how big of a footprint each company has in the state 1 green thumb industries green thumb first entered the connecticut market in 2019 through the acquisition of grower processor advanced grow labs today it has two locations in the state under its bluepoint wellness brand which focuses on compassionate care and providing consumers with a safe clinical setting the dispensaries are located in brantford and westport although connecticut isn t a huge market for green thumb its flagship retail brand rise doesn t have any stores there the company has been targeting new markets and it wouldn t be a surprise if it made more moves to expand its presence there even further virginia for example passed legislation in april to legalize adult use pot and by may green thumb had announced it would be entering the market there through the acquisition of dharma pharmaceuticals the company moves fast and green thumb s latest earnings report next month may provide an update on its plans for connecticut now that legalization is on the horizon for the period ending march 31 the company s sales grew by 90 year over year to more than 194 million green thumb generates revenue in 12 markets including connecticut and the stock could be a great buy for investors who want to tap into a company with a presence in some attractive states including new york and new jersey which also legalized recreational marijuana this year 2 curaleaf curaleaf is an even larger mso and is active in 23 states across the country including connecticut where it has four dispensaries located in groton hartford milford and stamford its presence in the state goes back to 2014 which is when it first began cultivating there connecticut legalized medical marijuana in 2012 in june 2020 the company expanded its popular select brand into the state curaleaf acquired select in february of that year and has made it part of its aggressive growth strategy ever since in march the company also launched one of its newest products select squeeze which is a tetrahydrocannabinol thc beverage enhancer in connecticut and other markets products that focus on thc which is the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis can help medical marijuana customers but might have even more potential in the recreational market like green thumb curaleaf will also report its latest results next month in its most recent quarter representing the first three months of 2021 sales of 260 million represented mammoth growth of 170 year over year and while management didn t single out connecticut as a big part of that growth they did mention raising 300 million in capital to scale into new recreational markets with connecticut now included in that list investors should look for curaleaf to potentially spend even more to boost its presence in that state as well if you re a growth oriented investor curaleaf is a stock you won t want to overlook it could be among the most aggressive in connecticut as well as other new recreational marijuana markets 3 trulieve trulieve is the least aggressive mso on this list but it too has a presence in connecticut one location in bristol the company acquired the healing corner in 2019 which helped it expand into the state at the time connecticut marked the fourth state the florida based marijuana company had entered though it has expanded into more markets since then the move was an important one for the company as ceo kim rivers sees expansion beyond florida where the bulk of its dispensaries are located as crucial in developing a greater presence across the country the new england market has been a key target for trulieve it has recently begun cultivation activities in massachusetts and expects its first harvest there later this year although trulieve hasn t expanded its position in connecticut since that 2019 acquisition the company is known for taking a slower more methodical approach to its expansion than some of its peers but now that the opportunity there has become much more attractive it wouldn t be surprising if trulieve were to focus more of its efforts in that state it has been more aggressive of late most notably with the 2 1 billion acquisition of arizona based harvest health recreation earlier this year trulieve is getting much bigger and more moves could be ahead for the period ending march 31 sales of 194 million doubled last year s tally of 96 million it was also the 13th straight period in which the company posted a profit for investors looking for a more conservative growth strategy from a cannabis company that is focused on maintaining a strong bottom line trulieve may prove to be a great investment

this season the b r dairy bar in gray traded its frozen yogurt for 30 flavors of vegan soft serve including german chocolate cake peanut butter pistachio java frappe and blueberry and sales exploded the response has been pretty incredible according to tom murray who s owned the 50 year old business for the past five seasons with the yogurt i d order five to seven cases a season i ordered 16 cases of the dairy free and i sold it in a month murray predicts that by the end of this season half of his business could be vegan flavors i have people who haven t been able to have ice cream in 20 years and this tastes just like ice cream murray said b r stocks the most vegan ice cream flavors that i ve discovered in maine yet across the state vegan ice creams have multiplied at scoop shops this is a change from 2015 when i reported that more maine ice cream stands were providing vegan options but i noted most are technically sorbets and while sorbets are delicious and refreshing they are not the same as ice cream these new creamy vegan choices are made from plant based milks such as oat coconut or almond the state s best known vegan ice cream maker is sticky sweet which sells its pints wholesale and also operates an ice cream stand in portland they were joined earlier this summer by the all vegan curbside comforts food truck which sells vegan soft serve last year the national chain dairy queen launched its vegan dilly bar advertisement the wider availability of vegan flavors is driven both by a desire to appeal to people who avoid cow s milk and by the appetite of ice cream eaters for something new for scoop shop owners vegan ice cream is a solution to a situation that has become more obvious in recent years joe holland who has owned the jefferson scoop in jefferson for 22 years considers himself a problem solver one problem he s faced more often the last few seasons is customers who don t want traditional ice cream if someone in a family or group comes to our shop and can t order with their family i see that as a problem holland said more often than not the problem would be that they could not eat our premium line of ice cream the solution was to bring in the dairy free vegan ice cream the jefferson scoop added vegan ice cream in 2020 and now offers three flavors oreo chocolate chunk and vanilla holland said that finding a vegan ice cream wholesaler was difficult and its higher price has an impact on his bottom line since holland charges the same price for vegan and non vegan flavors it s not quite mainstream yet with distributors and large manufacturers across the board holland said it took some research and some help along the way to make it happen but the vegan ice cream helps attract customers offering the dairy free line has brought in enough customers to offset the smaller profit margins he said we have seen a bump in business with more new faces and returning customers who choose the dairy free vegan ice cream option the vegan flavors at hallowell ice cream shop the local scoop which opened this season under the new ownership of tom hanson and his daughters brittany and ashley hanson have also proven popular they include chocolate chip cookie dough coffee fudge swirl and cookies and cream advertisement we use planet oat pints and we keep four or five different flavors on hand so that our friends that have allergies and our friends that are vegan can have ice cream with their families said brittany hanson oat milk seems to be safest for people with allergies we go through the pints really fast there s a huge need for it hanson told me she d heard maine based gifford s where the shop buys its conventional ice cream was planning a vegan line hanson was excited because she expected that would make it easier to buy in large quantities i m sorry to break it to her but unfortunately it s a rumor gifford s spokesperson kelsey matheson said there s no vegan ice cream coming out too bad as it s clear a market for it exists bresca the honeybee located at outlet beach on sabbathday lake in new gloucester has been serving housemade vegan ice creams since 2015 but recently i have come up with a formula that is better than where we started said owner krista kern desjarlais so as of 2020 we have been offering a new and improved formula and more choice for vegan flavors desjarlais now uses a pea protein milk as a base and creates flavors that include rocky road mint chocolate chip fig leaf with raspberry swirl and coffee with crispy hazelnut praline all the flavors are also gluten free each day bresca the honeybee offers at least three vegan ice creams in addition the ice cream stand stocks vegan whipped cream vegan pizzelle cookies vegan dark chocolate shell and vegan sprinkles i have been working hard to make choices for everyone and have it be super tasty so no one feels they have just settled for a dairy free or vegan option that is less than what you can expect from traditional ice creams said desjarlais a professional pastry chef who is herself lactose intolerant advertisement the ice cream is also made by hand at the two downeast ice cream factory locations in boothbay harbor in 2020 they made their own vegan ice cream for the first time last year we did a coconut base and people said the flavor was too strong and it wasn t freezing well manager toni facciponti said over the winter i was comparing lots of things then i found this brand in chicago called temptation which makes a base meant for soft serve but we ve been using it as hard serve with add ins it s an oat milk base and it s more neutral the result is happy customers and a rotating selection of at least three vegan flavors each day such as birthday cake midnight moose tracks black raspberry and peanut butter wafer even among people who eat ordinary ice cream there s a lot of demand for dairy free downeast owner bob bua said people are looking for something a little more exciting and creative our ice cream makers tend to be on the younger side so they appreciate making the dairy free vegan flavors the staff have really embraced the new vegan line facciponti agreed since her own brother is allergic to cow s milk it s been exciting for me to look up flavor ideas she said i m aware of how dietary allergies can mess with a family gathering but with more and more maine scoop shops adding dairy free flavors the summer of 2021 will see fewer left out family members and a lot more smiles frosted with vegan ice cream avery yale kamila is a food writer who lives in portland she can be reached at

july is slipping away and sept 6 the 13th anniversary of the federal takeover of fannie mae and freddie mac is on the way mark your calendars and marvel at the permanence of what was supposed to be a temporary measure to keep these government backed housing finance giants from going bankrupt amid financial panic in 2008 the latest institution to weigh in on this situation was the supreme court which ruled against opponents of the federal takeover late in its just completed term before 2008 private shareholders owned and profited from fannie and freddie which nevertheless enjoyed various congressionally conferred advantages because of the public purpose of their business providing liquidity to the market for 30 year home mortgages by packaging them as securities for sale to investors implicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the united states the two companies could and did take risks in pursuit of shareholder gain leading to distress when housing prices crashed necessitating a bailout cum takeover by the federal housing finance agency fhfa at issue in the supreme court was a 2012 government policy under which the fhfa continued to send all fannie freddie profits to the treasury long after the pair had recovered and paid back a federal cash injection estimated at 187 billion the plaintiffs opposing it were hedge funds that had bought the companies beaten down stock and would make a killing if the firms weresuddenly required to share cash with private investors again in fact the plaintiffs argued that they were entitled to 124 billion fannie and freddie had allegedly overpaid the treasury fortunately the justices ruled that the government s profit sweep was fully authorized by a 2008 statute that created the fhfa this was correct both legally and common sensically a taxpayer funded speculator windfall would have been a deeply unjust conclusion to this saga advertisement not that this result is necessarily the happiest possible ending assuming it is an ending in terms of public policy the government will continue to bear the downside risk of backing nearly half of the united states 11 trillion in mortgages while also reaping the profits that s an improvement over the pre bailout situation in which taxpayers bore the risk but shareholders got the upside but it s still far from optimal under the fhfa during both the obama and trump administrations fannie and freddie took incremental steps toward greater transparency and reduced risk nevertheless the country could benefit from a more fundamental overhaul of its mortgage finance system bipartisan coalitions repeatedly tried to craft one in congress without success this failure of governance was a victory for housing lobbies that benefit from the status quo follow this author editorial board s opinions follow president donald trump placed mark calabria a free market advocate of privatizing the companies in charge of the fhfa but the court s opinion in a separate holding on the executive s power to hire and fire agency directors enabled president biden to dismiss mr calabria an end to government control for which mr calabria had prepared the companies by modifying the 2012 policy and letting them retain profits as a capital base is therefore seemingly off the table the risk is that the status quo develops even more inertia mr biden replaced mr calabria with sandra l thompson on an acting basis but must soon make a permanent choice he should use the pick to advance the cause of reform read more
china s assertive nationalistic behavior known as wolf warrior diplomacy has come to the financial markets this week beijing punished a chinese tech company that listed on the new york stock exchange and announced rules to govern all chinese companies listed abroad consider this part of the chinese communist party tightening its grip on power at home and closing its doors power from abroad this is an opinion column the thoughts expressed are those of the author see more stories on insider s business page it was only a matter of time before beijing s heightened nationalism came to wall street this week chinese authorities punished didi a ride sharing company for its june 30 public debut on the new york stock exchange shortly after the didi crackdown beijing announced new measures that could restrict chinese companies going public abroad advertisement advertisement what all this is telling us is that beijing is no longer going to tolerate its tech stars making foreigners rich on

company then signs an agreement that gives control and profits to the cayman entity from which money is distributed to shareholders and the company back in china for years beijing generally looked the other way when it came to vies now according to bloomberg beijing s new regulations are designed to limit the ability of chinese companies to set up these entities the proposed rules would govern what data can and can t be shared abroad target illegal securities activities and set up extra national laws chinese companies would have to follow regardless of where they are listed advertisement

market cap listed on major us exchanges should all be watching their backs china is closing there are two main reasons for this seemingly sudden crackdown one is china s increasing antagonism with the west and the other is the chinese communist party s own desire for power and self preservation together they amount to the reality that china is once again closing its doors to the world reversing the opening that began in the 1970s advertisement advertisement as part of a larger crackdown on civil society the chinese communist party has been tightening its control over any sources of power that might challenge it at home that includes tech billionaires like alibaba founder jack ma who has recently been publicly brought to heel by beijing and it includes tech companies like tencent and

technologies and financial centers in some ways because the two powers have become so antagonistic this is already happening domestically beijing has been investing in technological advancements with the hopes making the country a techno superpower by 2025 now it s calling its companies home what s doubly important is that none of the above is primarily about making china rich it s all about hoarding power for the ccp under president xi jiinping that has become beijing s motivation above all else and we should all expect it to act accordingly even when it means hurting its own domestic

it was the kind of brazen pr stunt that jack ma might have dreamed up but this wasn t the flamboyant chinese billionaire who disappeared from public view eight months ago it was mark zuckerberg bobbing up and down on a hydrofoil surfboard clutching an american flag and exuding all the confidence of a man worth 130 billion the contrast between the social media mogul s july 4th instagram video and the day s big event in china could hardly have been starker regulators in beijing had just hours earlier banned didi global inc s ride hailing service from app stores delivering their latest hammer blow to an entrepreneurial elite that once seemed destined to challenge mr zuckerberg and his us peers at the top of the world s wealth rankings the age of unfettered gains for china s ultra rich now appears to be coming to an abrupt end even as the world s 10 wealthiest people added 209 billion to their net worth in the first half of 2021 china s richest tycoons in the bloomberg billionaires index saw their combined fortunes shrink by 16 billion shares of their flagship companies sank by an average 13 during the period the first time in at least six years they ve recorded declines when the broader chinese equity market was rising didi s stock has plunged 14 since its june 30 debut on the new york stock exchange slashing the wealth of the company s co founders by almost 800 million behind the losses is a crackdown that has only intensified since november when mr ma s ant group co was forced to pull its blockbuster initial public offering ipo at the last minute policy makers are tightening regulations on some of the most important facets of asia s largest economy from financial services to internet platforms and the data that underpins most big businesses in modern china in the latest salvo regulators unveiled new draft rules on saturday that would require nearly all domestic companies to undergo a cybersecurity review before listing in a foreign country beijing s motivations for the crackdown are varied they include concerns about anticompetitive behavior in the tech industry risks to financial stability from lightly regulated lending platforms and the rapid proliferation of sensitive personal information in the hands of large corporations but another undercurrent running through many of the government s latest initiatives is a not so secret desire to rein in the power of china s tycoons some of whom have amassed an enormous amount of influence over the 14 trillion economy as one government official familiar with the leadership s thinking described it beijing wants to prevent its billionaires from becoming a force as strong as the family run chaebol that dominate south korea s economy and many aspects of its politics adding to beijing s resolve is the chinese public s growing concern over rising inequality at a major speech on his economic plans in october president xi jinping acknowledged that the country s development was unbalanced and said common prosperity should be the ultimate goal the upshot is a new era for the country s billionaires and the investors who back them gone are the days when tycoons like mr ma could confidently bend the rules to supercharge their companies growth and challenge entrenched interests like state owned banks outsized public personas long seen as an asset for tech company founders now look like a liability the new playbook for china s ultra rich calls for more deference to the communist party more charitable donations and more focus on the wellbeing of rank and file employees even if it hurts the bottom line some of the tech companies became larger than life said allan zeman a property tycoon who gave up his canadian passport to become a naturalized citizen of china in 2008 one big lesson from the crackdown don t get bigger than the government mr zeman said shortly after attending the communist party s 100th anniversary celebration in beijing on july 1 didi notwithstanding the message appears to be getting through mr ma who criticized chinese financial regulators in his last public speech before ant s ipo was abruptly suspended has since resurfaced only a handful of times in carefully choreographed appearances colin huang whose e commerce giant pinduoduo inc has come under scrutiny for its relentless working schedules has given up his roles as chairman and ceo and donated shares worth billions of dollars bytedance ltd founder zhang yiming said in may he would step down as ceo and spend more time on educational charity wang xing the chairman of food delivery giant meituan has mostly steered clear of the public spotlight since he posted a 1 100 year old poem in may that some regarded as an implicit criticism of the government mr wang who later issued a clarification saying the post had been targeted at the shortsightedness of his own industry was advised by beijing officials to keep a low profile according to people with knowledge of the matter the new environment will fundamentally change china s tech sector partly because investors will become more wary of funding entrepreneurs who could end up on a collision course with beijing said eric schiffer ceo of patriarch organization a los angeles based private equity firm us president joseph r biden has also taken aim at the billionaire class calling for increased taxes on the rich and signing an executive order on friday that aims to weaken dominance of america s biggest companies the move echoed an ongoing antitrust campaign in china that has ensnared giants including alibaba group holding ltd and arch rival tencent holdings ltd one key difference is that chinese authorities unrestrained by western style checks and balances can act more forcefully than their us counterparts said angela zhang director of the centre for chinese law at the university of hong kong and author of chinese antitrust exceptionalism mr zuckerberg s hydrofoil joyride came just a few days after a judge dismissed two monopoly lawsuits against facebook inc that had been filed by the u s government and a coalition of states in the case of china the pendulum swings very quickly ms zhang said beijing has a variety of tools for reining in billionaires including detention in the most extreme cases an internal disciplinary process for party members known as shuanggui has been used for some tycoons in the past investigations by antitrust cybersecurity and other regulators are more common ways to influence the behavior of tech giants the government also uses soft methods including state media campaigns ms zhang said in the days after regulators halted ant s ipo xi visited a museum in the eastern city of nantong that was created by zhang jian a 19th century capitalist the chinese president described zhang as a patriotic nation builder and philanthropist rather than disrupt the financial system with unregulated loans he built factories and hundreds of schools when you see a virtuous person follow his example xi was quoted as saying by chinese media calling on private entrepreneurs to strengthen their feelings for the country and assume social responsibilities while china s crackdown has been most visible in the tech industry the country s property billionaires have also come under increased pressure in recent years authorities have steadily restricted the industry s access to funding in an attempt to rein in home prices and reduce systemic risks to the financial system china evergrande group chairman hui ka yan has been among the biggest casualties of the campaign this year losing 6 7 billion or nearly 30 of his fortune as evergrande s stock tumbled on concerns the company faces a liquidity crunch a more subtle sign of billionaires waning influence can be seen in their shrinking share of political appointments data from the hurun report which produces wealth rankings shows that rich entrepreneurs accounted for 5 8 of delegates in the chinese people s political consultative conference and the national people s congress the lowest in at least eight years and down from 15 3 in 2013 there is an evolution in the thinking of which type of people should be within the mix said rupert hoogewerf the hurun report s chairman it s becoming much harder for entrepreneurs the big question is whether all of this will be good for china in the long run one risk is that the onslaught of regulatory probes and rule changes undermines investor confidence hku s zhang said that could make it less likely that the entrepreneurs behind the next potential alibaba or tencent get the funding they need to make their ideas a reality global venture capital firms will likely think twice about investing in chinese companies if beijing prevents them from listing overseas a crucial exit route for early international backers yet some of beijing s new policies may foster competition in the oligopolistic tech industry clearing the way for a new class of billionaires to rise stricter regulations on fintech firms will help reduce systemic risks even if they slow down innovation china s crackdown on ant won praise last month from berkshire hathaway inc vice chairman charlie munger who said in an interview with cnbc that the communists did the right thing by letting ma know he couldn t wade into banking and just do whatever he pleased either way china s entrepreneurs will have little choice but to embrace the new normal said chen long a partner at consulting firm plenum the good old days of savage growth are gone bloomberg
with san diego s proposition b pension cuts officially nullified by the courts city officials are ready to start awarding pensions to all new hires again this month after a nine year period when only new police officers got pensions city officials also are tackling the complicated problem of how to compensate employees who got 401 k style retirement plans instead of traditional pensions because they were hired after voters approved proposition b in 2012 estimates of how much that will cost the city which ranged from 20 million to 100 million during the legal battle over the measure now seem likely to be closer to the high end of that range advertisement the number of affected workers has risen from an estimated 4 000 to more than 5 400 since city officials began examining the issue more closely this spring more affected employees means higher costs for the city in addition in recent years the city s pension system has adopted more conservative assumptions about how long employees will live and how well the pension system s investments will perform long term the goal of those more conservative assumptions is putting the pension system on much more sound financial footing long term but those assumptions also increase the cost of the pensions the city will have to retroactively create for thousands of workers affected by proposition b that s because assuming workers will live longer means the city must plan to make pension payments to those workers for longer and lowering projected investment returns reduces how much of the long term costs of pensions will be covered by investment gains while increasing how much taxpayers will have to cover some good news for the city is that workers given retroactive pensions will receive much less generous pensions than those awarded to most city workers hired before 2012 that s because of pension reforms adopted in 2009 by then mayor jerry sanders and the city council that increased the retirement age for workers hired after that point and cleaned up loopholes that had spiked some pensions without that reform the city s costs to create thousands of retroactive pensions would be much higher another factor helping the city is that court rulings that overturned proposition b say the city gets financial credit for providing employees with the 401 k style retirement plans those retirement plans have surged in value because stocks have done so well during the last nine years increasing how much financial credit the city will get for the 401 k style plans and shrinking what the city will owe to create pensions for the workers negotiations about exactly how to handle those calculations are ongoing between city officials and the city s labor unions another issue requiring negotiation is a 7 percent penalty courts have ruled the city must pay to affected workers for illegally implementing the pension cuts it s not clear whether those penalties must be paid to employees not represented by the unions that filed suit to overturn proposition b the end of the legal fight comes nearly three years after the state supreme court ruled proposition b was illegally placed on the ballot because san diego officials had skipped key steps such as negotiating the pension cuts with labor unions because the state supreme court declined to take the additional step of invalidating the measure when it made its ruling in august 2018 the issue was kicked back to superior court where judge richard strauss ruled in january that proposition b must be invalidated when supporters of proposition b decided not to appeal strauss s ruling city officials began the process of restoring pensions for new hires and tackling how to handle workers hired during the nine year interim the city council approved two ordinances last month that re open the pension system to all new employees not just new police officers those ordinances will take effect in late july 30 days after mayor todd gloria signed them in late june when they take effect all employees hired on or after saturday july 10 will be put into the city s pension system during the early stages of the legal fight there was speculation that if proposition b was overturned the affected workers would be given a choice between entering the pension system or just sticking with the 401 k style plan that would give an important option to the many workers who prefer the 401 k style plan because they don t plan to stay with the city long enough to ever collect a pension but under federal tax law all workers must be required to have pensions in order for a city s pension system to maintain its tax exempt status which is crucial to the city s funding strategy for its pensions without tax exempt status investment gains by the pension system would be taxed sharply decreasing how much they would help reduce the costs of city pensions to taxpayers that issue is among the many points of negotiation at city hall city and union officials must first agree about what their options are legally then decide what each side wants in the negotiation and then broker a deal that both sides can accept with so many issues to negotiate a resolution on how to handle the 5 400 affected workers could be several months away of the 5 400 affected workers more than 3 800 still work for the city and nearly 1 600 no longer work for the city once negotiations conclude officials will have to contact each of those departed workers and explain their options it s not clear how the city s pension debt will be impacted by re opening the system to all new hires and creating retroactive pensions for thousands of workers the debt which has climbed from 1 2 billion to 3 34 billion since 2007 is a projection of how much the city will owe retired employees long term versus the projected value of the assets the city has set aside to cover those payments the changing assumptions about employee longevity and investment returns have spiked the city s annual debt payment in recent years by about 100 million from about 250 million a year to about 350 million a year the payment went up another 49 3 million during the fiscal year that began july 1 from 365 6 million to 414 9 million that increase was based on employee pay raises and additional assumption changes about longevity and investment returns the city s pension system the san diego city employees

cryptocurrency by market cap the 50 billion market capitalization makes it resistant to dangerous market dips and volatility cycles this is the kind of stability that investors look for we all want to invest in a stable asset that will stick around long enough to get our money back and with good revenues while a certain level of volatility is desirable you should avoid extremely volatile assets that take your emotions on a roller coaster a big market cap such as that of ripple is a solid sign to fuel investor confidence xrp s future is pegged on whether or not banks and other financial institutions will adopt it stability here is hence a big deal banks will not be comfortable holding a coin that is ever racing against its own price in fact of all the desirable qualities of money stability is the most essential the value of money cannot keep on changing rapidly otherwise it will fail to function as a measure of value more partnerships from banks will raise investor confidence

the us ripple is not decentralized the main goal for the creation of ripple was to create a better way of transacting in the banking industry blockchain die hards find ripple unattractive because it is not decentralized like bitcoin and other cryptos it may fail to get as much demand as other decentralized cryptos affecting how far its prices can go most cryptos gained inspiration from bitcoin the first ever definition of cryptocurrencies also came from the ancestor of all cryptos bitcoin ripple gained popularity under the shadow of bitcoin yet it was not created to be a coin or even a normal currency some members of the crypto community have refused to consider xrp coin a real cryptocurrency ripple lacks a wallet and mining like traditional cryptos which throws a wrench into any demand that would have been created by traditional crypto investors ripple owns many xrp coins ethereum is limitless but ripple has a limited supply of coins so there won t be any more new xrps being mined in the future as the demand for this coin races against its supply prices will skyrocket the most dangerous thing that can happen to investors at such a time would be price manipulation close to 20 of xrp coins are in the hands of chis larsen ripple ceo and other board members also hold a significant amount of the coins there s a high chance of manipulation since xrp is concentrated within a few people this raises a safety concern considering that the company could decide to play tricks on investors when it wants to raise quick funds ripple is running against the concept of centralization by being the single largest owner of the xrp coins if the sellers one day decide to sell off all their coins they will leave irreparably consequences on the value of xrp intense competition ripple

banking industry in the crypto world stellar might just be the biggest competition for this company stellar comes with fast and cheap transaction processing stellar boasts of under three seconds settlement time and an insignificant cost of 0 01 for completing 100 000 transactions it is already partnering with ibm and klickex to expedite the processing of cross border payments while no one is

analysis should i buy xrp xrp has had a relatively stable price over the past few years 2020 started with a slight pullback that ended in may before we saw a consolidation marking the beginning of an uptrend up to the year s maximum price of 0 76 xrp price is 1 16 currently with a 24 hour trading volume of 4 746 344 952 if you re wondering why this coin s price seems to be going up and down you need to know that the xrp trend has a positive correlation with bitcoin so even a 5 change in the price of btc can affect xrp other events have also affected the price of xrp in the past few years like any other asset investor sentiments play a significant role in the price direction of this coin we cannot ignore the supply and demand of xrp in april 2020 there was a robust bearish price after one of ripple labs co founders jed mccaleb cashed out 54 million worth of ripples excess supply pushes prices down while too much demand raises prices new partnerships with financial institutions are among the key drivers of xrp prices for example when coinbase and binance drummed up their support for the flaire airdrop of spark tokens in december 2020 the value of the xrp shot higher this bullish trend is likely to get stronger as the company gets into much stronger partnerships in the future xrp value will respond by surging higher every time a major financial institution agrees to use its network for cross border settlements the most significant event that is currently affecting xrp is the sec suit when the stock market watchdog assaulted ripple in december 2020 prices fell by over 50 in just two days to just under 30 and further dropped to a minimum of 0 17 by the end of the year the coin also ranked lower from third place to fourth place it is now the seventh most important cryptocurrency since april 2021 the value of xrp has been on the increase 14th april 2021 saw the price hit a high of 1 7 it later rose to hit 1 96 but failed after testing the 2 0 level this became our new resistance bears then gained momentum and pushed the price up to around 0 6 before a moderate bullish push came in this represented a 70 decline with all indicators pointing to a bearish trend based on these pointers price we consider any price below 60 bearish xrp has since then defended this critical price level that might determine whether it will trade lower will go lower or skyrocket the extended price swings could be explained by the sell off caused by the legal tussle between ripple and the regulator and demand brought in by optimistic investors as of november 2021 xrp price seems to remain in an accumulative phase perhaps in preparation for a positive conclusion to the sec lawsuit even during the ongoing lawsuit ripple continues to march on releasing its latest product the liquidity hub a product that allows financial services firms to offer their customers access to cryptocurrencies our xrp price prediction suggests that xrp could reach as high as 2 before 2023 if

while trash and recycling are a steady business model that tends to perform in good times and bad waste management generates a substantial amount of revenue from its industrial and commercial clients as business slowed during the pandemic these businesses naturally produced less waste which presented a challenge the company responded by implementing cost cutting measures many of which it expects

to support its dividend the company just raised its dividend for the 18th consecutive year and instituted a new share buyback program all told the company plans to distribute nearly 1 billion in dividends and buy back up to 1 35 billion in stock this year waste management has the potential to combine its stable and recession resilient business model with the upside of environmentally

the past few weeks and is charging higher in fact shares of nio soared nearly 38 in june while the s p 500 crept more than 2 higher and there s plenty of reason to believe that this ev manufacturer

the first quarter of the new year representing year over year growth of 490 but the record was short lived last week nio announced that it delivered 21 896 vehicles a year over year increase of 112 in

stations yet management forecasts expanding this to over 700 stations by the end of the year in addition the company which had 146 charging stations in its network at the end of march plans on growing
