concerned about rising inflation in the us although federal reserve chairman jerome powell stated that high inflation is temporary other members of the fed do not necessarily agree bullard believes that inflation should stabilize by q1 of next year and if it s still running high the fed will need to use aggressive tactics bullard also noted that the markets are already factoring in a forthcoming tapering program for the fed s 120 billion monthly buying program at this point i m not sure these purchases are really doing anything helpful at this stage of the recovery because we do have this incipient housing bubble here and we don t want to be feeding into that bullard told reporters brazil s supreme court upheld a ruling that the central bank will remain autonomous from the government

barbara nelson and her son dylan at their apartment in phoenix nelson at one point was 5 500 behind on rent and she faces eviction when the federal moratorium on evictions ends photo by kylie graham news21 barbara nelson likes to watch her phoenix neighborhood from her south facing window where grayish stucco and sturdy tile roofs give the buildings a clean facade but the view inside her home is much less tidy nelson who has lived here a year is one of several residents at the complex who have risked eviction during the pandemic the gentleman across the way he works and he takes care of his daughter he s a single dad nelson said and my neighbors that have the twins and their other daughter that s the same thing they pay as much as they can but they re facing eviction too nelson lost her job in march when her 11 year old son contracted covid 19 and while she got her real estate license to make ends meet she couldn t show homes to clients after her truck broke down june 11 at one point nelson said she owed more than 5 000 in back rent and almost was out of options to pay it across the country as many as 1 in 5 renters say they have fallen behind on rent during the pandemic for families who have no financial safety net to fall back on the economic consequences of the pandemic have pushed them to the precipice of homelessness the biden administration expected the 46 5 billion emergency rental assistance program launched by congress in december and march to stave off the impending eviction crisis but only about 5 1 billion had been distributed to americans by states and localities through the end of july the administration had hoped a new federal moratorium on evictions would buy states and localities time to get the funding into the right hands but the supreme court on aug 26 rejected the extension clouding the future for tens of thousands of renters nelson has been approved for rental assistance through wildfire an organization partnering with phoenix to distribute emergency rental assistance funds but the organization was slow to get the check to her landlord it s easy for you to say try calling that number try waiting on hold for an hour calling back in another hour calling back the next week calling unemployment twice a week nelson said it s all just been a struggle according to the center on budget and policy priorities even before the pandemic 3 in 4 families were unable to get a section 8 housing voucher which is paid directly by a local housing authority because of rampant underfunding the pandemic put a spotlight on our nation s housing challenges in a way that no other crisis in recent memory has said ann oliva a senior fellow at the policy center and while newly funded eviction prevention programs are now getting fully underway it is taking some time to get those funds into the hands of households and landlords who need it a worsening housing crisis when jeff yungman went to law school in 2004 he had big plans for his future legal clinic there wasn t a person there at school i didn t tell of the faculty or staff i m here at school because i m going to start a legal clinic at one80 place he said so everybody knew why i was there and what i wanted to do one80 place is the only full service homeless shelter in charleston south carolina where it opened in 1984 under the name crisis ministries now yungman s colorful office sits in a converted 1950s home adjacent to the shelter where he has worked for more than two decades despite the increase in demand for help shelters nationwide operated at limited capacity to follow the safety guidelines set by the centers for disease control and prevention capacity at one80 place has been capped at 50 since the beginning of the pandemic although yungman said he has seen fewer people staying at the shelter more people are coming in for legal concerns than ever before according to oliva for the first time since the center on budget and policy priorities started gathering data on the number of homeless americans more people are living on the streets than in homeless shelters we have a renewed sort of outreach to try to reach people that need legal services that aren t staying in one80 place because of the fact we can t keep as many people yungman said yungman helps homeless charlestonians with a variety of legal issues such as securing federal identification attaining disability and unemployment benefits and overseeing legal cases dealing with housing concerns one of his clients has been paying 650 a month for her trailer which was condemned by charleston county building inspectors months ago the u s department of housing and urban development defines any household that spends more than 30 of its annual income on housing and utilities as cost burdened sc housing the state agency for affordable housing opportunities found nearly a quarter of south carolina s renters spent at least half of their income on housing and utilities as of march 2021 pre covid people would come in 70 of their income was going to rent yungman said we all would try to tell them you know we can get you maybe a plan to move out at a certain time and not have an eviction on your record but you can t afford to stay where you re staying zillow found that the average rent across the nation rose by 2 3 from april to may of 2021 to 1 747 a month oliva said experts knew a housing crisis was coming as early as january 2020 just as covid 19 began to spread across the country she said lockdowns and stay in place orders reduced opportunities for work and accelerated the oncoming housing crisis ian watterson a housing lawyer and landlord for several small rental units in charleston said that for many mom and pop landlords the pandemic related economic downturn has made it much more difficult for them to maintain their rental properties if they all get foreclosed on it s just going to reduce the rental stock and drive rents up further he said a lot of people are not renting anymore they ll sell the house or whatever so when this is all over you re going to see a lot less rental units and higher rents emily blair the executive vice president of austin apartment association a texas organization helping landlords said that the increase in operational expenses related to covid 19 and the lack of revenue due to the eviction moratorium has put landlords in a sticky spot that takes away rental housing units from the community which is not a good thing blair said we want rental housing to be fully available for those who need it and who need that flexibility who need that coming into a new market who need that for affordability purposes the lack of safety nets essence harrison s apartment on gale street in north charleston is barren except for the child s bedroom that sits down the hall behind the first door on the right i m not good at decorations it s not my forte said harrison who has lived in the two bedroom rental with her daughter amiya belton since march but yeah her room was the first room that i put up i guess as soon as i got this place i was so excited for just her to have her room finally i put her bedsheets her trolls her table her toys it took harrison more than five months to find a home where she could afford to raise her 3 year old the two bedroom rents for 900 a month the cheapest she could find when harrison fell behind on the rent for the apartment where she had lived in june 2020 the federal moratorium did not save her from eviction she spent four months living in hotels and taking uber cars to work before an employee at one80 place stepped in to help even before the pandemic was declared in 2020 north charleston had the highest eviction rate in the country with 16 of tenancies ending in the renter s removal in 2020 the neighborhood had a poverty rate of about 21 more than twice as high as the national average as calculated by the urban institute the poverty rate is even higher among north charleston s black residents who are the majority in south carolina s third largest city according to the world population review the poverty rate among black residents in north charleston is about 27 it is more than 10 among the city s white residents during the course of the pandemic we ve seen the housing crisis really deepen in communities that have been historically marginalized said alieza durana narrative change liaison at the eviction lab at princeton university according to a study focused on discrimination in evictions people of color make up 80 of those facing evictions even controlling for all other factors income the home value and various other things you might sort of anticipate would be important factors race was twice as impactful as any other factor said kathryn howell co director of rva eviction lab in richmond virginia harrison was scheduled to start a new job managing a gas station two days after getting a positive test result for covid 19 in july 2020 the company ultimately did not hire her without savings or generational wealth to fall back on she said healing financially from her losses took much longer than recovering her health you don t have anything to fall back on when you use all your savings trying to stay afloat while you re sick she said and then you re not sick anymore that catchup is impossible there s nothing you can do harrison did not know where to start when it came to filling out paperwork and making phone calls she tried to apply for unemployment food stamps and covid 19 relief but was told she was ineligible because she had made too much money the previous year there were several notices before harrison s landlord posted the final eviction date on her door by then she was 3 967 behind on rent just getting that last paper of them telling you what day you have to leave i think that s the hardest part of the eviction process she said and what it feels like is just it s like drowning like drowning in paperwork she said she didn t try to fight the removal because she doubted she had legal grounds it s intimidating to have a company of any kind to send you a court paper harrison said i can t afford to get anybody to defend me or who knows and i probably don t even have all the paperwork that they need for me to go to court so i honestly didn t even think about challenging them i just left i just did what i was told it is common for tenants to self evict or willingly move out instead of appearing in court in south carolina tenants being evicted are not automatically scheduled for a court hearing instead they must call themselves with landlord tenant laws a tenant is at a disadvantage because the landlord is the person bringing the action against the tenant and more often than not a tenant does not know their rights all they know is that their house where they live is in jeopardy magistrate ellen steinberg said a battle to prevent eviction brandon harris wore his best suit to court on a thursday morning in early july its bold plaid pattern he said boosted his confidence he needed this hearing to go well harris had already been planning on moving when he received an eviction notice from his corporate landlord he was supposed to pick up the keys to his new apartment the day before his court date due to the pending eviction his new landlord refused to hand them over it s just just some difficult times i got behind on rent i was on disability leave without paying and i just i wasn t able to maintain the bills he said harris landlord claimed that other people were living in his apartment against the specifications of his lease but harris was several months behind on his rent he had to leave his job at t mobile during the pandemic because of his chronic bronchitis which puts him at increased risk for covid 19 ian watterson was the pro bono lawyer appointed by the housing court to represent harris in court that morning watterson and a representative for the landlord were able to agree on a date for harris to move out without carrying out the eviction i m actually going to reach back out to that new landlord to have him call up here and let them know that everything s settled harris said we reached an agreement so it s a very promising place i m excited i think i ll be able to move in there watterson said harris case is similar to many he sees usually he added landlords and tenants are able to reach an agreement without carrying out the formal eviction there s no great magic to this it s just negotiating and helping people through things watterson said we have a pretty darn good success rate we have learned a lot and are better at either mediating them or if there s a hearing winning them housing court is a collaboration of legal aid organizations in charleston that provides legal representation to tenants facing eviction the idea came from jeff yungman in the fall of 2018 as legal director of one80 place legal services yungman had seen firsthand the effects of eviction and the lack of legal representation for tenants losing their homes the first housing court session took place in october 2019 since then housing court has expanded into four magistrate courts including steinberg s with plans to add two more landlords often do not want to evict their tenants steinberg said the process is tedious court hearings painting repairs and it s often easier for everyone to keep tenants in their homes he said at first landlords were hesitant to embrace the idea of housing court feeling it offered an unfair advantage to tenants the judge said but over time they ve come to recognize its ability to foster conversation landlords recognize that it works when parties speak to each other steinberg said but yungman says that legal representation is not enough to alleviate the consequences of evictions he wants to emphasize that the root causes of homelessness need to be addressed to mitigate the worst outcomes of the pandemic coming to terms with that he said the government has to provide some help for people in order to be able to afford the housing that s available unknown territory ryan harvey who lives across the hall and up a floor from barbara nelson has noticed changes at his phoenix apartment complex moving trucks in the parking lot and orange stickers from the constable s office on neighbors doors have become frequent over the past two months people he said were preparing for the ax to come down everybody knew the moratorium was getting ready to expire harvey said everybody s aware that you know the safety net s being pulled the newest moratorium replaced a broader one that had been in place since sept 4 2020 and expired july 31 the new moratorium originally set to run through at least oct 3 was to prevent evictions due to covid related nonpayment of rent in counties with high transmission of the delta variant which is about 90 of the u s with the additional two months states would have had more time to distribute the 46 5 billion allocated by congress for the emergency rental assistance program which has been tied up in bureaucracy while some gains were made the supreme court ordered the moratorium last week harvey and his family were able to secure rental assistance from wildfire but the check has not been sent to his landlord yet phoenix was allocated 51 1 million to begin the emergency program on march 8 but as of aug 3 a little under half that amount had made it into the hands of renters the slow processing of rental assistance applications can be attributed to several factors said a july 27 report from the aspen institute including high documentation burdens long payment timelines and insufficient infrastructure for rental assistance support in the same report the institute estimated that 15 million renters owed more than 20 billion to their landlords but yungman and some other experts said there are reasons to be hopeful my assumption is that if a tenant has applied for erap funds and is still in the process of trying to get those funds given everybody knows of course that that process is taking much longer than it should yungman said i don t think any of the four judges are going to evict somebody when there s financial assistance pending but despite receiving rental assistance harvey said he s unsure what the coming weeks will bring take one step forward you re taking 10 backwards you know so it is unknown territory he said i can t tell you what the next month is going to look like all i can say is we have to do the best we can day by day we take it one day at a time this report is part of unmasking america a project produced by the carnegie knight news21 initiative a national

97 treated patients over age 65 suggesting the potential need for more prolonged or higher dosing of anti inflammatory therapy in these patients who may have a more exuberant inflammatory response associated with defective immune mediated viral clearance mechanisms mesoblast plans to move forward with an additional phase 3 trial in covid 19 ards with the next step being to agree with the fda the final protocol and potency assay inflammatory bowel disease crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis a randomized controlled study of remestemcel l delivered by an endoscope directly to areas of inflammation and tissue injury in up to 48 patients with medically refractory crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis commenced at cleveland clinic in october 2020 the investigator initiated study is the first in humans using local cell delivery in the gut and will enable mesoblast to compare clinical outcomes using this delivery method with results from an ongoing randomized placebo controlled trial in patients with biologic refractory crohn s disease where remestemcel l was administered intravenously rexlemestrocel l chronic heart failure the results from the landmark dream hf randomized controlled trial in 537 treated patients with chronic heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction hfref who received rexlemestrocel l revascor or control sham demonstrated that a single dose of rexlemestrocel l resulted in substantial and durable reductions in heart attacks strokes and cardiac deaths the trial s primary endpoint of reduction in volume overload related hospitalizations was not achieved the results of this trial identify new york heart association nyha class ii hfref patients as the optimal target population for greatest rexlemestrocel l treatment effect and therefore a focus for developing rexlemestrocel l in the largest market in heart failure the incidence of heart attacks and strokes were reduced by 60 over a median follow up period of 30 months following a single dose of rexlemestrocel l in the entire population of 537 treated patients the incidence of death from cardiovascular causes was reduced by 60 in the 206 patients with nyha class ii disease a significant reduction which was evident in both ischemic and non ischemic subgroups as well as diabetic and nondiabetic patients the results also show that the nyha class ii patients in the control group following an initial period of approximately 20 months of disease stability progressed to cardiac death rates in line with nyha class iii patients nyha class ii patients treated with a single dose of rexlemestrocel l did not show such cardiac death progression the combination of the three pre specified outcomes of cardiac death heart attack or stroke into a single composite outcome called the three point major adverse cardiovascular events mace is a well established endpoint used by the fda to determine cardiovascular risk rexlemestrocel l reduced this three point mace by 30 compared to controls across the entire population of 537 treated patients in the nyha class ii subgroup of 206 patients rexlemestrocel l reduced the three point mace by 55 compared to controls mesoblast expects feedback from the fda in the next quarter on the potential pathway to us regulatory approval for rexlemestrocel l in patients with chronic heart failure chronic low back pain due to degenerative disc disease the results from the randomized controlled trial of its allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cell mpc therapy rexlemestrocel l in 404 enrolled patients with chronic low back pain clbp due to degenerative disc disease ddd refractory to conventional treatments indicate that a single injection of rexlemestrocel l hyaluronic acid ha carrier may provide a safe durable and effective opioid sparing therapy for patients with chronic inflammatory back pain due to degenerative disc disease and that greatest benefits are seen when administered earlier in the disease process before irreversible fibrosis of the intervertebral disc has occurred the trial s composite outcomes of pain reduction together with functional responses to treatment were not met by either mpc group the rexlemestrocel l ha treatment group achieved substantial and durable reductions in clbp compared to control through 24 months across the entire evaluable study population n 391 compared with saline controls greatest pain reduction was observed in the pre specified population with clbp of shorter duration than the study median of 68 months n 194 and subjects using opioids at baseline n 168 with the rexlemestrocel l ha group having substantially greater reduction at all time points 1 3 6 12 18 and 24 months compared with saline controls there was no appreciable difference in the safety of mpc groups compared to saline control over the 24 month period of follow up in the entire study population in subjects using opioids at baseline the mpc ha demonstrated a reduction in the average opioid dose over 24 months while saline control subjects had essentially no change there is a significant need for a safe efficacious and durable opioid sparing treatment in patients with chronic low back pain due to severely inflamed degenerative disc disease mesoblast has filed a request and expects to receive feedback from the fda on the pathway to us regulatory approval in patients with chronic low back pain due to degenerative disc disease intellectual property mesoblast has an extensive patent portfolio with over 1 000 patents and patent applications across 77 patent families and

source sewcream adobe stock this summer we partnered with harris polls to discover whether the covid 19 pandemic affected the use of supplements or over the counter vitamins in this country to this end we surveyed 2 053 adults above the age of 18 the results were astounding supplement use in this country is up 29 with an estimated 76 of americans now taking at least one supplement a day we found this increase especially prevalent among men aged 35 44 hispanics and parents with children under 18 the truth is that supplements can be a crucial part of becoming and staying healthy the other truth is that even something intended to improve health can have dangerous side effects particularly if they interact poorly with another medication it is important to be aware of the risks associated with supplements especially if you re on other prescription medication why are we suddenly taking more supplements in recent decades the medical community has embraced the use of supplements as part of a health routine in fact many supplements are recommended to address a common deficiency such as vitamin d typically discovered during a routine check up but the options have expanded today patients can choose from many supplements including nutritional powders gummy vitamins cbd products etc for mental health supplements can be used to complement cognitive behavioral therapies and prescription medications for example i often recommend that patients with anxiety try ginkgo biloba or lavender supplements or suggest folic acid and lavender for patients struggling with depression our survey found that 41 of americans take supplements such as melatonin or aroma therapies to help them sleep while 57 do so to improve their overall health and immunity it is important to note that supplements are an essential part of an integrative health approach that considers and treats a whole person by combining conventional medicine with evidence based complementary and alternative therapies lifestyle and self care while their usage should not be discouraged you must have all the information needed for you and your provider to make an informed and safe decision on your future care can supplements protect you from covid 19 although 36 of americans surveyed admitted to taking supplements to boost their resistance to covid 19 it is important to stress that there are no supplements that can substitute for getting vaccinated or wearing a mask that being said there is some evidence to suggest that people with low vitamin d and zinc may be at greater risk for contracting the virus either way both supplements can be used to enhance one s natural immune system always speak with your provider first even though supplements are readily available over the counter or for purchase online it is important to always consult your provider before introducing supplements into your health regimen we were most disturbed to discover that only 47 of the 76 of americans taking supplements first discussed usage with their provider the reasoning for this varies 35 indicated that they did not think their provider would be interested and 32 did not feel their provider had sufficient knowledge of supplements in addition we heard that 87 of supplement takers are confident the supplements they are taking are safe for them the truth however is that although 52 of those surveyed believe that all supplements are fda approved the majority are not the fda does not regulate the safety or effectiveness of supplements and many aren t identified as dangerous until people are negatively affected by them furthermore we know many alternative therapies and supplements on the market make extraneous claims about their effectiveness but the science to support those claims isn t there for example dietary supplements claim to help you lose weight or even more dangerously cure cancer the prevalence of misinformation causes concern for two immediate reasons first the number one concern is quality because supplements are not regulated before hitting the market and not all of them do as the packaging suggests they will the second is that supplements can have harmful interactions with prescription drugs ideally your provider would ask if you are using supplements but unfortunately sometimes the responsibility falls on you to bring it up to discover more about how to use supplements safely speak with your provider

worked for the employer for at least two years after signing the agreement containing the covenant or 2 the employer otherwise provided consideration adequate to support an agreement to not compete or to not solicit which can consist of a period of employment plus additional professional or financial benefits or merely professional or financial benefits adequate by themselves though somewhat vague and requiring court interpretation this definition provides employers with some options likely including a signing bonus raise a promotion training professional exposure and marketing incentive compensation such as stock options or restricted stock other bonuses separation pay or other employee benefits legitimate business interest considerations the act codifies current illinois supreme court precedent holding that in determining the employer s legitimate business interest the totality of the facts and circumstances of the individual case shall be considered factors that may be considered in this analysis include but are not limited to the employee s exposure to the employer s customer relationships or other employees the near permanence customer relationships the employee s acquisition use or knowledge of confidential information through the employee s employment the time restrictions the place restrictions and the scope of the activity restrictions no one factor carries more weight than any other the importance of any particular factor depends on the specific facts and circumstances reformation the court s discretion to reform an overbroad covenant to render it reasonable is codified by the act but cabined the act specifies that extensive judicial reformation may be against the public policy of this state and a court may refrain from wholly rewriting contracts factors to be considered include the fairness of the restraints as originally written whether the original restriction reflects a good faith effort to protect a legitimate business interest of the employer the extent of such reformation and whether the parties included a clause authorizing such modifications in their agreement remedies for employees the act provides new remedies for employees who prevail in litigation over covenants not to compete and not to solicit filed by an employer but not by the employee including attorney s fees f an employee prevails on a claim to enforce a covenant not to compete or covenant not to solicit the employee shall recover from the employer all costs and all reasonable attorney s fees regarding such claim to enforce this provision only applies when the employer sues to enforce a covenant not to declaratory judgment actions in which the employee seeks a ruling a covenant is unenforceable other unique components state attorney general enforcement the attorney general may initiate or intervene in litigation when it has reasonable cause to believe that any person or penalty is engaged in a pattern and practice prohibited by the act

penalty or other relief the attorney general may also initiate an investigation of potential violations covid 19 and similar circumstances exception the act contains an exception for employees terminated or furloughed because of the covid 19 pandemic or other similar circumstances in that situation the employer is barred from enforcing such a covenant not to compete or solicit unless enforcement of the covenant includes compensation equivalent to the employee s base salary at the time of termination for the period of employment less any compensation earned through subsequent

of law workaround unlikely the act does not expressly prohibit choice of law provisions pursuant to which another state s law would govern covenants not to compete or covenants not to solicit however

australia may finally put an end to its covid zero policy residents tired of an endless lockdown policy driven by ccp propaganda can thank the nation s truckers a viral video went out last week announcing that truck drivers in the nation were willing to shut down the country to end the authoritarian behavior of the government advertisement the trucker in the video says it s on the truckies are doing it we need you and everyone else s support to watch this video hand it up and let everyone in australia know that the truckies are gonna shut down the country what that means is you need to go shopping now get what you can for the next week or two load your fridge freezers the truckies are coming and they re going to pull this country down and we re all going to do it together and remove the s t government related australia building quarantine camps as military goes door to door to enforce lockdown orders he continues the vets are in the truckies are in i m in i am willing to go to jail to save my country and my children if you want to do this we got to do it together as one the trucker also criticized vaccinations but the threat was clear supply chains for essential goods will come to a screeching halt if the truck drivers put their big rigs in park language warning australia the truck drivers of australia are planning to shut down the country in order to bring down the dictators they are telling you to stock up on food for a couple of weeks let s see how this plays out nomorelockdowns australiahasfallen pic twitter com 8ptcfgc4iy gillian mckeith gillianmckeith august 22 2021 advertisement frustration with covid tests and layoffs due to repeated lockdowns had truck drivers threatening to stop delivery for three to four weeks this movement coincided with a labor dispute at a large trucking firm it also followed viral videos of police using tear gas and rubber bullets on anti lockdown protestors news that a rural council in new south wales shot rescue dogs rather than letting shelter workers come to pick them up also broke related revolting aussies shooting rescue dogs dead in anti covid effort perhaps the viral video made the australian leaders look in the mirror and see xi jinping staring back at them or maybe they were terrified of the toilet paper shortages that plagued the country earlier in the pandemic whatever the reason prime minister scott morrison emerged on august 23 to let australians know the government had a change of heart australia had a policy of circuit breakers that required lockdowns whenever cases were detected they believed this could stop the spread and eradicate the virus the delta variant proved this strategy was not going to work as lockdowns were ordered all over the country when testing found cases of the variant positive tests rose despite the draconian stay at home orders and militant enforcement morrison said the government developed a national plan to live with the virus in a video address that is our goal to live with this virus not to live in fear of it morrison said he asserted that actions taken to contain covid 19 to date had saved 30 000 lives and preserved 1 000 000 livelihoods it is not clear how the government tabulated these figures advertisement he went on to say that 70 of the country was now eligible to be vaccinated he said that at 80 vaccination the nation would have to move forward morrison added that the country must also change its mindset once it reaches the vaccination mark cases will no longer be the governing metric instead the health system will focus on severe illness and hospitalization and we will live with this virus as we live with other infectious diseases morrison emphasized related massive unrest as australia adopts china s authoritarian covid zero approach while the united states never had a stated covid zero policy that goal is the only way to explain many of the actions we see our health authorities and political leaders taking even though no local government in the u s has killed puppies yet many have decided we are not supposed to learn how to live with covid 19 perhaps it is time to stop testing people with no symptoms and every hospitalized patient tell people to stay home if they do not feel well seek testing if they are symptomatic and seek the available outpatient treatment if they are high risk and test positive according to the cdc 173 520 211 americans are fully vaccinated according to the agency s disease burden estimates approximately 166 million have recovered as harvard epidemiologist dr michael mina said recently repeated covid 19 exposure will reduce disease severity it is time to end the panic porn of breathless counting of cases and focus on outcomes the risk stratification for severe illness and death is known it is past the time to act as if we know it advertisement australia which appeared to have lost its mind just last week came to its senses because truckies decided they had had enough what will it take for our national leaders to relent and tell americans it is time to change our mindset

technically a rare earth element its economics are very much the same about 70 of known deposits are in china output is unstable with much of the supply existing only as a byproduct of zinc mining and

wean itself off of indium writing in the conversation behnam akhavan says that he and his team at the university of sydney have discovered a way to make touch screens with silver and tungsten oxide instead of indium the entire process takes only a few minutes produces minimal waste is cheaper than using indium and can be used for any glass surface such as a phone screen or window akhavan writes

the oil market has come through some tough sledding the last 6 8 weeks as doubts about the commitment of opec to the newly agreed output limits and the surging delta variant of the covid virus became manifest last week the market tacked on some gains as those fears abated somewhat and an unexpected inventory draw in the u s poured a shot of courage into investor s cups the oil and derivatives markets rallied strongly repairing much of the damage we are all familiar with the influx of international oil companies iocs into guyana years of one major discovery after another by exxonmobil nyse xom and partners have pasted this latin american formerly backwater country squarely into the exploration headlines the success has also spread to suriname with totalenergies nyse tte and partner apa corp s nyse apa success in block 58 offshore in many cases the stocks of these companies has responded strongly to news of these discoveries leaving less room for continued upside as the oil rally matures wsj that being the case i went looking for an undiscovered bargain in this play and think that perhaps i might have found one cgx exploration otcpk cgxef is a toronto canada based e p company with significant petroleum production licenses ppls on and offshore guyana given its assets and the extreme sell off in its shares over the last month for no particular reason other than a shift in sentiment in the overall market toward oil i am suggesting that cgx makes a compelling risk reward proposition at today s price cgx assets in guyana as noted above there is no hotter exploration play in the world right now with the success exxon mobil has had proving up the petroleum system with its track record of 18 commercial discoveries and 8 billion bbl of oil booked into reserves over the last 5 years apa corp and totalenergies have done the same on a smaller scale offshore suriname source the company with its partner frontera energy otcpk feccf has commenced drilling on the kawa 1 in the corentyne ppl a contract has been let to maersk drilling for the maersk discoverer to drill a 6 500 m exploration well kawa 1 in this block in 370 m of water as noted in the linked press release cgx has exercised its option to drill a second well with the maersk rig worth noting as well is the company s hiring of top flight talent to run operations kevin lacy ex chevron nyse cvx vp of drilling and completions was named drilling director for the wells to be drilled at corentyne and demara the company has staffed up with other highly qualified individuals as well for on rig and off rig assignments this lends credibility to the overall effort and it s plus for the company to get folks of this caliber unexpected events in deepwater can burn capital at a horrendous rate leading to poor decision making having someone with lacy s credentials makes it feasible over the short run i ll put forth my idea of the next steps assuming a discovery is made a little further down the page something that should be mentioned is that a tiny company like cgx has absolutely no business doing deepwater exploration remember even apache no slouch organization went running for a big daddy when the first block 58 well showed commercial without the guidance of a world class operator like tte the suriname development in block 58 would just be water cooler talk instead of heading for an fid later this year the map above from frontera energy s site does a pretty good job of laying out the prospective potential of this well the graphic below from a cgx presentation shows the target believed to be a sandstone reservoir with properties similar to those reported by apache in their wells listed below offshore suriname source cgx made the following commentary in the press release regarding the type of structure they expect to test when the kawa 1 reaches total depth td additionally the kawa 1 well is expected to de risk multiple other prospects on the block which also have stacked reservoirs and similar structural geometries proximity of the corentyne block to the cretaceous berbice canyon sediment source is interpreted to have concentrated sandstone reservoirs in the north corentyne area channelized stacked internal fan geometries evident on 3d seismic are indicative of thick stacked coarser grained sand reservoirs cgx a future exploration well is planned in the demarara prospect but it is still in the seismic data processing stage according to the q 1 financial document this was to be completed last may the deadline for spudding this well is february 11 2022 it s not a huge leap to think the discoverer will move to that location when it finishes with shell or it could any one of a number of idle floaters in the vicinity now let s understand the kawa 1 is a wildcat well looking to extend the play established by xom and others that said the success of these exploration wells and sanctioned liza 1 producing liza 2 startup 2022 and the payara underway with first oil in 2024 along with the associated infrastructure substantially de risks the kawa 1 the same holds true for the work apache and tte have done in the last couple of years offshore suriname when you look at the juxtaposition of the kawa 1 to haimara and pluma on the guyana side and the maka on the suriname side it s not too hard to imagine that when they run the log folks on the rig will get pretty excited we won t know for a couple of months likely as the results will be tight holed until the companies are ready to make an announcement about the success or failure of the test dst future work is also planned on the berbice prospect with a seismic program planned for august of this year and exploration well to spud by june 15 2022 source deepwater port in guyana last year the company secured a 50 year lease on site at the mouth of the berbice river according to its q 1 filing work has begun on this resource source starting in october 2020 grand canal industrial estates inc grand canal a wholly owned subsidiary of the company entered into various contracts to recommence work on its berbice deep water port project work has continued during the three month period ended march 31 2021 and grand canal had expended 327 000 for this period additionally the company awarded contracts for 2 003 000 in april 2021 source there is no surer path to riches than running a major port of entry in a growth area like guyana regardless of how the oil exploration turns out this factor alone is enough to consider buying into the company at current prices the thesis for cgx let s face it a tiny company with little or no revenue like cgx has absolutely no business doing deepwater exploration without frontera fronting the cost for the kawa 1 well it wouldn t be happening frontera has advanced cgx 19 mm for its share of the cost of drilling kawa 1 and has the option to convert this debt into shares of cgx at a rate of 0 71 per share for that matter frontera with an enterprise value of 900 mm has no real business doing deepwater exploration either advertisement related oil stages strong recovery they are hoping for a big daddy to buy into their dreams sort of like what happened with apache and totalenergies and depending on the results of the kawa 1 it could surely happen any number of companies like hess nyse hes or equinor nyse eqnr could farm in easily if the kawa 1 shows pay in any measure close to what its potential suggests source guyana i am not going to make a big case about guyana if you follow oil and gas news you are well aware of the splash the country has made in recent years with the xom discoveries the country is past the tipping point and is going to become a major oil producing state the last time i checked xom was producing 400k boepd from stabroeck and expects to pump as much as 2 mm boepd by 2024 even though xom has been operating for a few years in guyana the country is still in the early stages of a gold rush type state of development the point here is that the necessary onshore infrastructure is being built out by xom and its partners hess and china national offshore oil company nyse cnooc the critical mass is in place or being built to allow these other developments to proceed your takeaway i think cgx presents a compelling investment case at current prices they have no real income at this point so usual financial metrics are unavailable with 287 mm common shares outstanding the company has a capitalization of roughly 355 mm the xom haimara well logged 207 of vertical pay and pluma logged 127 of high perm sandstone reservoir xom hiked its reserve estimate for stabroeck by a billion barrels when the haimara and tilapia 1 discoveries were announced if even a tiny fraction of those metrics are announced when the results of the dst are released my expectation is that cgx will move sharply higher from current levels just for fun since we are speculating let s assume the log shows 100 mm boe recoverable from this reservoir or 1 10th the amount xom booked that works out to 6 5 bn at current prices and would completely change the story for cgx for reference when apache announced the results of the mako 1 in 2019 and then the block 58 farm in from total their stock doubled overnight to 32ish per share i ll close by emphasizing this is a risky play history is littered with the corpses of companies with game changer wells that didn t live up to their billing that said there are then the liza type wells that help overcome a lot of dry hole disappointment patient investors could be in for a nice treat a few months hence or a case of the blues that s the exploration business by david messler for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com

imf bailout will further weaken pandemic hit lankan economy by shiran illanperuma the morning courtesy newsin asia colombo august 29 covid 19 pandemic hit sri lanka is undergoing a very difficult period in its economic history since around 2012 the country s gdp growth rate has continuously plummeted manufacturing output has flat lined and external debt stocks as a percentage of gni have reached highs not seen since the mid 1990s in 2016 the country entered into an agreement with the international monetary fund imf to borrow 1 billion in special drawing rights sdr an international reserve asset as part of an extended fund facility eff policy makers justified this on the grounds that growing debt and flagging growth made an imf bailout necessary predictably the imf issued a set of conditions namely reducing the fiscal deficit by lowering government spending and increasing taxation the currency was devalued imports were liberalized subsidies on fuel and fertilizer were withdrawn interest rates were jacked up in a bid to rein in inflation but did it work well the growth rate between 2016 and 2019 the period of the imf agreement declined from 4 5 to 2 3 the average for the period was 3 unemployment rose from 4 4 in 2016 to 4 8 in 2019 inflation spiked to 7 7 in 2017 throughout this period manufacturing output showed no growth external debt to gdp continued to increase fueled by issuance of international sovereign bonds worth 10 billion in these three years alone source world bank the imf agreement did not bring about growth investment employment nor did it reduce external debt however it did achieve a primary budget surplus of lkr 2 billion in 2017 and lkr 91 billion in 2018 this appears to have been managed not necessarily through fiscal discipline but by withholding payments to public and private contractors and suppliers according to the finance minister s 2020 budget speech there were outstanding unpaid bills amounting to lkr 243 billion this includes lkr 23 9 billion for fertilizers lkr 31 4 billion for medicines lkr 119 billion for construction contractors and suppliers lkr 45 8 billion for elder s interest subsidy and lkr 22 1 billion in payments owed to various government ministries and departments this austerity helped the government present a primary budget surplus in order to meet the imf s conditionality in turn unpaid contractors and suppliers would most likely have faced severe cash flow issues forcing them to take on debt at the high interest rates of the time and cut down staff thereby increasing unemployment in this context it is unsurprising that the country was embroiled in strikes and protests the imf agreement was discontinued after november 2019 and a mere four months later sri lanka would have its first taste of the covid 19 pandemic much of the pre existing economic symptoms were exacerbated by this external shock concerns were raised over debt repayments and calls to go back to the imf for a fresh bailout package were renewed double whammy this raises the question what would imf conditionality disastrous as it was from 2016 to 2019 do to a developing country like sri lanka amid an unprecedented global pandemic and recession a paper titled adding fuel to fire how imf demands for austerity will drive up inequality worldwide published by oxfam in august holds a few answers analyzing 107 covid 19 related loan agreements negotiated between the imf and 85 governments from march 2020 to march 2021 oxfam found that 85 of the agreements encouraged austerity reduced government spending after the immediate threat of a health crisis thereby jeopardizing long term growth and recovery the analysis found that the imf had proposed cuts and or freezes in public sector wages in 31 countries increases in value added tax in 14 countries and cuts in general public expenditure in 55 countries 26 governments mainly in africa latin america and the caribbean had plans to implement fiscal consolidation following imf loans some as soon as 2020 and 2021 oxfam says in its report that austerity measures including wage cuts cuts to social spending and rationalizing social assistance programs directly contradict sdg 10 insofar as their effects are most severely felt by women low income households and those who are vulnerable the report goes on to say that austerity measures in the post pandemic period may cripple recovery efforts in addition regressive measures that typify austerity push the burden of recovery onto poor people and the middle classes while requiring little responsibility or contribution from rich people who have already recovered from the pandemic indeed oxfam argues not without reason that one of the reasons the covid 19 pandemic has hit underdeveloped countries so hard is due to under investment in state capacity and social services at the behest of imf mandated fiscal consolidation one could add that the adoption of laissez faire trade policy based on comparative advantage is also to blame as industrialized nations like china japan and south korea have been able to mobilize resources against the pandemic far better than tourism and services dependent countries like sri lanka if the period from 2016 to 2019 isn t proof enough that the imf doctrine doesn t work it s worthwhile looking into how it has affected countries simultaneously grappling with the covid 19 pandemic destabilization of angola and tunisia angola is a southern african nation where oil makes up around 90 of exports and a third of government revenue economic and social stability depends largely on global oil prices which dropped in 2014 causing the economy to contract for five consecutive years and debt to rise to 120 of gdp by 2020 the country entered into an imf loan agreement in 2018 bloomberg reports as part of the imf program angola has pledged to sell 195 businesses or stakes including partial holdings in national oil company sonangol and diamond firm endiama to boost its public finances and reduce the role of the state in the economy the government also aims to remove fuel subsidies and increase public transport tariffs once the pandemic subsides unlike sri lanka angola has chosen to stick with its imf reform program amid the covid 19 pandemic subsidies on fuel have been cut annual inflation has hit around 25 according to the economist the rising cost of living and high unemployment have sparked a wave of strikes and protests similar to what sri lanka experienced between 2016 and 2019 but with a far bloodier crackdown tunisia is a fairly diversified economy whose main foreign currency earners are tourism and exports of manufactured electronics however it runs a trade deficit of around 5 billion the country s gdp declined by 8 6 in 2020 amid the pandemic as tourism came to a standstill unemployment which stood at a very high 14 before the pandemic spiked to 17 in 2020 youth unemployment was even higher at 36 government debt reached 88 of gdp in april 2020 with the onset of the pandemic the country entered into a rapid financing instrument rfi agreement with the imf to borrow 745 million as emergency relief tunisia ran a fiscal deficit of 11 5 in 2020 and the imf in february warned that the deficit could be around 9 greater than the government s official target of 6 the imf then prescribed a specific set of actions including cutting public sector wages and energy subsidies this has been recommended while the country grapples with a wave of youth protests over rising unemployment naturally covid 19 intensified tunisia s pre existing problems and the imf s recommendations are likely to add fuel to the fire as cutting subsidies will increase the cost of living and cutting public wages will reduce the purchasing power of households kenyans protest kenyan citizens have taken to the streets in protest and petitioned the imf to cancel a 2 34 billion extended fund facility signed with the government in may online hashtags like stoploaningkenya and stopgivingkenyaloans have proliferated in kenyan social media since may this is because kenyans remember the imf s structural adjustment programs in the 1980s when the country drew on no less than seven different agreements the conditionality caused massive lay offs in the public service and removed subsidies in essential services including healthcare and education hurting the most vulnerable social groups many development economists refer to this period as a lost decade not just for kenya but for most sub saharan african countries embroiled in imf programs like sri lanka kenya is deeply indebted to international capital markets from which it has borrowed to bridge a yawning trade deficit the country has already lost two million formal jobs due to the covid 19 pandemic and has had a rate of investment well below global and regional standards for the past three decades in light of these conditions full implementation of imf style fiscal consolidation will be unlikely to provide long term growth and reverse the trend of low investment in kenya higher taxation and interest rates will only shrink profits further and throttle long term growth and recovery possible alternative sri lanka has recently been rocked by a wave of protests largely by public sector workers such as teachers doctors and nurses demanding better wages and working conditions meanwhile consumers have been complaining of rising food prices exacerbated by loss of income due to the pandemic indeed global food prices have reached record highs in the last few months this has happened despite the government s running a budget deficit to maintain spending on essential social services such as healthcare and education at their pre pandemic levels consumption taxes like vat have been removed one can only imagine the social instability that would be unleashed if the government adopted aggressive imf style fiscal consolidation cutting back on essential services and withdrawing subsidies on goods like fuel even further households would be squeezed and thousands more pushed into poverty and unemployment protests and strikes would bring the economy to a screeching halt sri lanka has resorted to imf bailouts no less than 16 times in its history yet the standard prescription of fiscal consolidation reduced government spending and increased taxation and inflation targeting monetary policy raising interest rates and restricting money supply to combat inflation have failed to fundamentally change the structure of the economy an alternative an alternative to the imf doctrine is possible for example rationalizing imports like vehicles which accounted for 5 of import costs between 2016 and 2019 has helped save foreign currency and avoid default meanwhile low and stable interest rates are needed to reduce the cost of production and increase global competitiveness while encouraging money holders to invest rather than hoard savings in bank accounts however proper mechanisms such as state mandated lending targets are needed to ensure that credit is pumped into productive investment in the real economy rather than devaluation a stable currency is desirable to allow for imports of investment goods as oxfam says at this critical juncture governments can either choose to continue down the same path and fuel this increasing inequality or take the necessary redistributive measures and fund recovery through progressive efforts to reduce inequalities shiran illanperuma is a global macro research analyst at econsult asia which is an economic research and management consultancy firm with an alternative development outlook

operational highlights and financial results for the year ended june 30 2021 tweet new york aug 30 2021 globe newswire mesoblast limited nasdaq meso asx msb global leader in allogeneic cellular medicines for inflammatory diseases today reported operational highlights and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended june 30 2021 fy2021 during this calendar year we made significant progress in both regulatory and clinical outcomes for our lead product candidate remestemcel l after experiencing a disappointing set back last year said silviu itescu chief executive of mesoblast we are pleased with recent recommendations by fda s cber to meet with the review team and address remaining cmc items for remestemcel l in the treatment of steroid refractory acute graft versus host disease in children additionally our most recent meeting with the fda has provided clarity on the pathway towards an emergency use authorization for remestemcel l in the treatment of covid ards operational highlights remestemcel l outcome of recent meeting with fda on regulatory pathway for emergency use authorization in the treatment of covid 19 ards mesoblast met with the united states food drug administration fda in regard to potential emergency use authorization eua for remestemcel l in the treatment of ventilator dependent patients with moderate or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ards due to covid 19 the fda advised mesoblast that an additional clinical study in covid ards would be required which if statistically positive could provide a dataset in conjunction with the recently completed 222 patient clinical study that might be sufficient to support an eua fda provided guidance that the existing covid ards investigational new drug ind file and future submissions for remestemcel l in this indication may continue to cross reference manufacturing information in biologics license application bla 125706 for pediatric steroid refractory acute graft versus host disease sr agvhd fda indicated that potency assays must be established and agreed prior to commencement of the proposed phase 3 clinical trial fda indicated that the potency assays currently in development appeared to be reasonable based on in vitro results provided in the briefing document the in vitro activity of the product appears to be relatively well established though the relationship between in vitro activity and the product s actual mechanism of action remains theoretical mesoblast intends to meet with fda s office of tissue and advanced therapies otat in q4 cy21 to address potency assays for remestemcel l in relation to sr agvhd attributes which we believe to be also relevant to covid ards mesoblast has entered into a license and collaboration agreement with novartis for the development manufacture and commercialization of remestemcel l with an initial focus on the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards including that associated with covid 19 the agreement remains subject to certain closing conditions including time to analyze the results from the covid 19 ards trial remestemcel l in the treatment of steroid refractory acute graft versus host disease sr agvhd in children mesoblast continues to be in discussion with the fda through a well established regulatory process that may include a resubmission with a six month review with the aim of achieving approval of remestemcel l in the treatment of sr agvhd in children the fda s center for biologics evaluation and research cber has recommended that mesoblast as a next step discuss with cber s review team at otat our approach to address certain outstanding chemistry manufacturing and controls cmc items including potency assays which could support a resubmission of the current bla mesoblast intends to meet with fda s otat in q4 cy21 to address potency assays and other outstanding cmc items rexlemestrocel l in the treatment of chronic heart failure and chronic low back pain mesoblast expects to receive feedback from the fda in the next quarter on the potential pathways to us regulatory approval for its rexlemestrocel l technology platform following the recently completed phase 3 trials in patients with chronic heart failure and chronic low back pain clbp due to degenerative disc disease mesoblast and its partner for clbp in europe and latin america grünenthal amended their collaboration agreement in line with a strategy to achieve regulatory harmonization cost efficiencies and streamlined timelines aiming to leverage the results from a planned us trial in support of potential product approvals in both us and eu manufacturing during fiscal year 2021 mesoblast continued to invest in manufacturing of remestemcel l as part of its readiness strategy for potential fda approval and commercial launch with 92 of total manufacturing spend being for commercial readiness and next generation pre launch inventory and clinical cell supply for life cycle management considerable effort has been focused on development and validation of specific cmc items necessary for mesoblast s potential resubmission of the bla for remestemcel l as well as potency assay work that will support both the agvhd bla resubmission and the ind for the phase 3 trial covid ards work has also continued on mesoblast s proprietary technology that facilitates the increase in yields necessary for the long term commercial supply of its product candidates and next generation manufacturing processes to reduce labor drive down cost of goods and improve manufacturing efficiencies financial highlights us 136 9 million cash on hand at june 30 2021 sales of temcell hs inj 1 in japan by licensee jcr for the treatment of agvhd have re established a steady

amendment to extend the interest only period of its current senior debt facility through to at least january 2022 and is in active discussions to refinance the facility ongoing investment in remestemcel l platform to support the regulatory pathway to potential approval manufacturing scale up and life cycle management we expect to recognize the existing us 21 9 million of remestemcel l pre launch inventory on the balance sheet if we receive fda approval detailed clinical activities for the fiscal year fy2021 remestemcel l acute respiratory distress syndrome due to covid 19 mesoblast recently presented results from the randomized controlled trial of remestemcel l in 222 ventilator dependent covid 19 patients with moderate severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ards at the biennial stem cells cell therapies and bioengineering in lung biology and diseases conference hosted by the university of vermont burlington vt and at the international society for cell gene therapy isct scientific signatures series event on cell and gene based therapies in lung diseases and critical illnesses the presented data included improved respiratory function in patients treated with remestemcel l as well as 90 day survival outcomes showing remestemcel l significantly reduced mortality by 48 at 90 days compared to controls in a pre specified exploratory analysis of 123 treated patients under 65 years old the trial had been halted after the third interim analysis since the 30 day primary endpoint would not be attained key presentation findings were remestemcel l reduced

reported at 60 days p 0 048 and indicates a durable treatment benefit in this patient population remestemcel l showed benefit in an exploratory analysis in patients on dexamethasone as part of their

accompanied by improvements relative to controls in pre specified secondary endpoints of ventilator free days respiratory function as assessed by ards severity and overall clinical improvement on a 7 point ordinal scale despite a treatment related improvement in respiratory function at day 7 there was no mortality reduction in the 97 treated patients over age 65 suggesting the potential need for more prolonged or higher dosing of anti inflammatory therapy in these patients who may have a more exuberant inflammatory response associated with defective immune mediated viral clearance mechanisms inflammatory bowel disease crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis a randomized controlled study of remestemcel l delivered by an endoscope directly to areas of inflammation and tissue injury in up to 48 patients with medically refractory crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis commenced at cleveland clinic in october 2020 the investigator initiated study is the first in humans using local cell delivery in the gut and will enable mesoblast to compare clinical outcomes using this delivery method with results from an ongoing randomized placebo controlled trial in patients with biologic refractory crohn s disease where remestemcel l was administered intravenously rexlemestrocel l chronic heart failure the results from the landmark dream hf randomized controlled trial in 537 treated patients with chronic heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction hfref who received rexlemestrocel l revascor or control sham demonstrated that a single dose of rexlemestrocel l resulted in substantial and durable reductions in heart attacks strokes and cardiac deaths the trial s primary endpoint of reduction in volume overload related hospitalizations was not achieved the results of this trial identify new york heart association nyha class ii hfref patients as the optimal target population for greatest rexlemestrocel l treatment effect and therefore a focus for developing rexlemestrocel l in the largest market in heart failure the incidence of heart attacks and strokes were reduced by 60 over a median follow up period of 30 months following a single dose of rexlemestrocel l in the entire population of 537 treated patients the incidence of death from cardiovascular causes was reduced by 60 in the 206 patients with nyha class ii disease a significant reduction which was evident in both ischemic and non ischemic subgroups as well as diabetic and nondiabetic patients the results also show that the nyha class ii patients in the control group following an initial period of approximately 20 months of disease stability progressed to cardiac death rates in line with nyha class iii patients nyha class ii patients treated with a single dose of rexlemestrocel l did not show such cardiac death progression the combination of the three pre specified outcomes of cardiac death heart attack or stroke into a single composite outcome called the three point major adverse cardiovascular events mace is a well established endpoint used by the fda to determine cardiovascular risk rexlemestrocel l reduced this three point mace by 30 compared to controls across the entire population of 537 treated patients in the nyha class ii subgroup of 206 patients rexlemestrocel l reduced the three point mace by 55 compared to controls mesoblast expects feedback from the fda in the next quarter on the potential pathway to us regulatory approval for rexlemestrocel l in patients with chronic heart failure chronic low back pain due to degenerative disc disease the results from the randomized controlled trial of its allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cell mpc therapy rexlemestrocel l in 404 enrolled patients with chronic low back pain clbp due to degenerative disc disease ddd refractory to conventional treatments indicate that a single injection of rexlemestrocel l hyaluronic acid ha carrier may provide a safe durable and effective opioid sparing therapy for patients with chronic inflammatory back pain due to degenerative disc disease and that greatest benefits are seen when administered earlier in the disease process before irreversible fibrosis of the intervertebral disc has occurred the trial s composite outcomes of pain reduction together with functional responses to treatment were not met by either mpc group the rexlemestrocel l ha treatment group achieved substantial and durable reductions in clbp compared to control through 24 months across the entire evaluable study population n 391 compared with saline controls greatest pain reduction was observed in the pre specified population with clbp of shorter duration than the study median of 68 months n 194 and subjects using opioids at baseline n 168 with the rexlemestrocel l ha group having substantially greater reduction at all time points 1 3 6 12 18 and 24 months compared with saline controls there was no appreciable difference in the safety of mpc groups compared to saline control over the 24 month period of follow up in the entire study population in subjects using opioids at baseline the mpc ha demonstrated a reduction in the average opioid dose over 24 months while saline control subjects had essentially no change there is a significant need for a safe efficacious and durable opioid sparing treatment in patients with chronic low back pain due to severely inflamed degenerative disc disease mesoblast has filed a request and expects to receive feedback from the fda on the pathway to us regulatory approval in patients with chronic low back pain due to degenerative disc disease intellectual property mesoblast has an extensive patent portfolio with over 1 000 patents and patent applications across 77 patent families and patent terms

cell gene therapy financing what is the role for private equity and spacs by joseph pategou since 1980 and professor martin j cline s first attempt at gene therapy1 biomedicine has experienced tremendous progress particularly in the field of cell and gene therapy the emergence of this field means hope for many around the world for a cure to their diseases rather than treat symptoms how do the private equity and special purpose acquisition companies spacs fit into this picture an overview of the cell gene therapy sector the global cell and gene therapy market will reach 1 8 billion in 2021 and it is expected to grow at an impressive rate to hit 27 9 billion by 2026 this strong momentum is mainly driven by gene therapy products from 1 4 billion to 17 2 billion 2026 compared to cell

private institutions in the u s and europe have invested more than 15 billion in cell and gene therapies to accelerate product development that contribution has helped strengthen the pipeline of potential drugs for alliance for regenerative medicine there are 1 085 cell gene and tissue based therapeutic developers worldwide with north america 543 leading followed by asia pacific 295 and europe 209 those companies are involved in 1 220 ongoing regenerative medicine and advanced therapy trials worldwide with three leading indications oncology 554 central nervous system 94 and

intense as it was before how many secretary of state antony blinken said later monday that under 200 and likely closer to 100 americans who want to leave remain in afghanistan but that officials were still working to determine the exact number reaction republicans were quick monday with criticism after the administration acknowledged americans were still in afghanistan this national disgrace is the direct result of president biden s cowardice and incompetence sen ben sasse r neb said in a statement the president made the decision to break our word to our afghan partners the president made the decision to tell one lie after another as the crisis unfolded the president made the morally indefensible decision to leave americans behind dishonor was the president s choice may history never forget this cowardice president biden told the american people if there s american citizens left we re gonna stay to get them all out he didn t keep his word house armed services committee ranking member mike rogers said in a statement hundreds of americans are now stuck in afghanistan at the mercy of the taliban and isis k biden to speak tuesday mckenzie not president biden was the official tasked with announcing the end of u s military involvement in afghanistan but biden will speak to the nation tuesday about the end of the war in afghanistan written statement biden in a statement a short time after the pentagon confirmed the end of the war thanked the u s military for its service he said he would offer a lengthier explanation on tuesday or his decision not to extend the mission into september for now i will report that it was the unanimous recommendation of the joint chiefs and of all of our commanders on the ground to end our airlift mission as planned biden said their view was that ending our military mission was the best way to protect the lives of our troops and secure the prospects of civilian departures for those who want to leave afghanistan in the weeks and months ahead next steps biden said in his statement that he s tasked secretary of state antony blinken to coordinate efforts to ensure americans and afghan allies can safely leave afghanistan in the coming weeks the taliban has made commitments on safe passage and the world will hold them to their commitments biden said it will include ongoing diplomacy in afghanistan and coordination with partners in the region to reopen the airport allowing for continued departure for those who want to leave and delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of afghanistan ndaa season kicks into high gear with all the afghanistan news the house armed services committee s upcoming defense bill debate has flown somewhat under the radar but the committee is indeed slated to hold its marathon national defense authorization act ndaa markup on wednesday ahead of that the committee formally released what s known as the chairman s mark monday as well as a summary sexual assault among the provision of the chairman s mark are the changes to prosecuting military sexual assault that were recommended by the pentagon that means removing commanders from the decision to prosecute sexual assault and related crimes and creating special victim prosecutors to handle that still expect continued debate on the issue from those who want to go further and remove all serious crimes from the chain of command afghanistan also of note in the chairman s mark most of the funding that had been expected to be authorized for the now defunct afghan security forces has been reallocated elsewhere save for 350 million to cover costs associated with the termination of operation freedom s sentinel and termination of related support to the security forces of the government of afghanistan including costs for returning equipment and other materiel taken into dod stock contract termination and other close out costs per the summary money money money money as expected the overall amount of defense funding is already shaping up to be a premier fight in the ndaa the chairman s mark adheres to the biden administration s request of 744 billion for defense including 716 billion for the pentagon republicans ready shortly after the chairman s mark was released monday republicans on the committee unveiled the amendment they are planning to introduce wednesday to increase the topline the amendment from ranking member rep mike rogers r ala would add nearly 25 billion to the topline we cannot afford to cut corners and play politics with our national security unfortunately that is all president biden has done rogers said in a statement from china to russia to iran to north korea to the threat of global terrorism the united states faces no shortage of adversaries who work around the clock seeking ways to supplant or inflict harm on our nation dem backing at least one democrat has already said she s backing the republican amendment i have stressed for months that the current budget fails to adequately address the rising threats of china iran and russia i ll vote to increase defense spending by 25b to send a strong message to our allies and adversaries that we are not backing down rep elaine luria d va tweeted monday the committee is split 31 democrats to 28 republicans leaving little room for error if democrats hope to defeat the amendment progressive pushback also monday democratic reps mark pocan wis and barbara lee calif along with 25 other democrats penned a letter calling on the committee to reject republican efforts to add 25 billion to the defense budget at a time when america s largest national security threat is a global pandemic our spending priorities should embrace efforts such as increased covid vaccination efforts abroad instead of continually increased military spending especially during a period of military withdrawal from foreign wars they wrote reminder the senate armed services committee already voted to increase biden s defense budget by 25 billion with strong democratic backing and while some house democrats may be loath to do the same the ndaa typically needs republican support to pass since progressives regularly vote against it

salvatore zarella founder construction management group llc passive home building is a growing trend focused on building in a way that is more energy efficient than traditional building methods salvatore zarella and his firm construction management group is at the forefront of the passive house movement zarella s interest was first sparked by an article on the topic i was enamored it was exactly what i was looking for said zarella the method which began in germany and austria in 2003 has foundations in green building it expanded building science we know a ton more than we once did and we ve perfected the model now in 2011 i studied the rigorous process involved and realized just how much i didn t know about how to create a high class building today the passive house institute us reports it has precertified or certified projects in 37 states and provinces in north america with jobsites totaling more than 4 2 million square feet it s the most efficient building standard in the world anything more efficient would be counterproductive i take these standards to any project i work on said zarella zarella s company offers full service building and contracting and specializes in residential and commercial projects i wish that the construction industry and my colleagues would embrace it because it s the simplest and smartest way to build i try to encourage all of my clients to build to that standard according to zarella passive home building is more effective than other building standards but also acknowledges there has been some resistance to the method for the reason that it can be difficult to find the resources needed to build in this manner however opinions have begun to shift as it picks up more steam in the united states and gains traction in europe europe is more advanced in building than we are at the moment and we have to catch up they are far more exacting it s a science said zarella i think that s part of my job to pull people into this way of building it will only become easier as more people adopt it demand is certainly changing people s interest we are in an interesting period right now energy consciousness has been elevated and energy stocks are doing well the new administration is creating incentives and as a result things are picking up this is on the minds of consumers he said zarella predicts this trend is only just now approaching the horizon and energy efficient homes and buildings will be more in demand than ever in the future at a certain point our gasoline engines will be dinosaurs he said it s going to be strange to purchase a gas powered vehicle soon electricity will be the new dominant energy source and it s more efficient today s newer vehicles are being powered at home instead of at gas pumps and efficient homes can play into that said zarella he encourages other builders to be prepared for a shift in reliance on electric power and energy efficient building methods a lot of people are just kind of waiting for incentives to get more involved in energy efficient building if enough people start to ask for it it will become more inundated and that will influence the trades said zarella this isn t a tree hugger situation anymore this is mainstream and practical it s driven by the wallet and when something is wallet driven it picks up speed he added not only is zarella interested in seeing success with its application on his own projects but he also believes passive home building will be easy for other contractors to adapt what we re doing is not rocket science you don t need to be ultra smart either it s just a different way of assembling components said zarella it s slightly different and it makes a big difference it s mostly the same materials not space age high tech stuff it s about understanding basic principles to be aware of how to eliminate inefficient spots in the home the personal motto driving zarella s business decisions is there should be no feelings without data this focus on data and a forward thinking mindset are what first drove him to begin using passive home building methods and are also what give his firm an edge and help to maintain profitability today

increase of 4 09 per 13kg cylinder bulk gas from 2 60 to 2 86 an increase of 26 cents per kg and autogas from 1 74 to 1 92 an increase of 18 cents per litre the fuel and lpg price review implemented by fccc follows a one month lag period as such the september 2021 fuel and lpg regulated prices are based on importations made in july 2021 by fuel companies and lpg companies in fiji fuel price change reasons the price of fuel in fiji is impacted by the movement in means of platts singapore mops the international freight rate and the exchange rate the increase noted in local fuel prices for september 2021 are due to unfavourable movements noted in international prices for motor spirit premix kerosene and diesel and favourable movements in international freight rates for all refined products the gains from international refined oil prices for motor spirit premix and diesel were further supported by strengthening of the usd against the fijian dollar based on july 2021 imports although the international refined price for kerosene had unfavourable movement on local price of kerosene favourable freight rates and weakening of the usd against the fijian dollar had a favourable impact on local price of kerosene in september 2021 based on july 2021 imports crude oil market the price of crude oil rose firmly in july 2021 due to the following reasons 1 the physical market fundamentals strengthened on demand side however declining oil inventories continued to support the oil prices in july 2021 2 the crude oil market continued to be supported by strong oil market forces primarily driven by robust oil demand growth outlooks and expectations of slow global oil supply growth which pointed to a significant oil supply demand deficit in the second half of 2021 3 a strong driving season in the united states improved road transportation fuels in europe firmed demand in china and a steady oil demand recovery in india after the easing of covid 19 related mobility restrictions bolstered global oil demand outlooks 4 improved refinery intakes in major refining centres and encouraging global economic data particularly in the united states china and europe added optimism to market sentiment 5 uncertainty about the global oil supply market also pushed crude oil prices higher in july 2021 6 crude oil markets entered a turbulent zone in the second decade of july with heightened volatility which were triggered by rising concerns about the rapid spread of the new covid 19 delta variant in several major economies and a broad selloff in us equity markets 7 crude oil prices however recovered slightly in the third decade of july and rose further towards the end of the month after investors turned more optimistic on the global oil demand recovery amid expectations that higher vaccination rates in major economies would mitigate the negative impact of a resurgence of covid 19 infections speculation about a supply overhang after opec and non opec producers in the declaration of cooperation doc decided to voluntarily adjust their production the global oil supply demand balance continued to show a deficit in second half of 2021 despite announcement by opec and non opec on upward output adjustments oil prices were also sustained by declining oecd oil stocks particularly in the us in a sign of a continued rebalancing process these global economic factors in july 2021 contributed to the change in the local fijian prices for refined oil products which will be effective from 1 september 2021 lpg price change reasons the lpg price in fiji is impacted by the movement in saudi aramco butane contract price cp the international freight rate and the exchange rate the major reasons for the movement in prices for all lpg products in september 2021 in fiji are due to the unfavourable movement of saudi aramco butane cp and unfavourable movement in the international freight rate unfavourable movement in saudi aramco butane cp was further supported by the strengthening of the us dollar against the fj dollar based on july 2021 imports lpg prices surged in july 2021 as demand tightened and global economies recovered from covid 19 lockdowns amid huge roll out covid vaccines in bigger economies such as china united states and european nations other countries also reportedly started to build up their inventories to prepare for their heating requirements during the winter season hence giving heavier pressure on lpg demand on the supply side while the middle east spot supplies from qatar and kuwait remain steady saudi arabia cut acceptances of term cargo nominations for july as the persian gulf market faced tight supply due to plant maintenance at saudi arabia s key refinery at ras tanura traders also noted that july loading cargoes from the us showed signs of improvement although the volumes were not ample enough to meet demand in asia thus keeping prices in the region firm these international market forces

in recent years south korea s rampant state funding of overseas coal power plants earned it a reputation as one of the world s worst climate villains but the colossal sums pumped into the dirty fuel over the past decade have been eclipsed by finance funnelled to oil and gas according to a new analysis that is set to further tarnish the country s image on the international stage the report by seoul based research and advocacy organisation solutions for our climate sfoc reveals that korean public financial institutions such as the export import bank of korea kexim korea trade insurance corporation k sure and korea development bank kdb channelled a staggering 127 billion into overseas oil and gas projects from 2011 to 2020 that s nearly 13 times larger than the nation s controversial support for the coal industry over the same period which amounted to about 10 billion shows the study titled fueling the climate crisis south korea s public financing for oil and gas the figures are shocking said sejong youn climate finance programme director at sfoc and lead author of the report south korea has long been criticised as a climate villain for providing massive support to overseas coal power projects but the country s newly revealed public finance to overseas oil and gas completely dwarfs its backing of coal while the analysis does not provide data on emissions resulting from korea s public financing the overwhelming difference in the scale of financing means that the contribution of oil and gas funding to global greenhouse gas emissions is likely to be larger than that of coal investments jeeyeon song sfoc s communications officer told eco business the oil and gas industry is responsible for nearly half of global carbon dioxide emissions and has recently come under scrutiny for its emissions of methane a greenhouse gas that boasts a 100 year global warming potential about 30 times that of carbon dioxide it is the second biggest driver of human caused climate change today the paris based international energy agency iea widely considered the leading voice on energy transition issues estimates that the sector emitted 82 million tonnes of methane in 2019 about three times the carbon dioxide equivalent that germany released into the atmosphere that year despite various industry led initiatives methane emissions have remained high in a recent landmark report which examined what it will take to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and stay within safe limits of global heating the iea warned that investment in new oil and gas exploitation and coal fired power stations must stop immediately and the demand for oil and gas would need to drop by 75 per cent and 55 per cent respectively enormous sums sfoc s study shows that loans and guarantees have been dished out both to state owned enterprises and private sector companies in all segments along the value chain with 32 2 billion 25 per cent invested in upstream projects such as exploration and drilling 49 7 billion 39 per cent in midstream projects including pipelines and storage and 45 1 billion 36 per cent in oil refining gas processing and other downstream sectors geographically the middle east hosts most ventures backed by korean banks 35 3 billion followed by central asia which includes uzbekistan turkmenistan and russia 10 1 billion the biggest recipient was kuwait with 7 6 billion deployed oil and gas projects across southeast asia south asia and east asia received 6 8 billion in the upstream sector australia is home to most korean backed ventures with 3 6 billion invested followed by mozambique with 2 7 billion and the united states with 2 billion among projects funded is the 5 6 billion barossa caldita gas field off the northern coast of australia which has come under fire for its potential to emit twice as much carbon dioxide as other gas fields due to high content of the heat trapping gas present in the reservoir the most notable beneficiaries in the industrial sector are major korean shipbuilders including daewoo shipbuilding marine engineering samsung heavy industries and hyundai heavy industries nearly half of the country s oil and gas public finance was invested in shipbuilding and offshore plant financing with liquefied natural gas carriers receiving the most at 23 1 billion south korea s shipbuilding industry is the world s second largest after china s and an integral part of the country s economy rising pressure sfoc s analysis warns that south korea s financial backing for oil and gas increases transition risk for domestic industries and stranded asset risks for state banks while bucking global public financing trends last december the united kingdom announced it would end taxpayer support for fossil fuel projects overseas as soon as possible albeit with limited exceptions to support a transition to low carbon energy the following month the european investment bank the world s largest multilateral lender pledged to stop all funding for fossil fuels before the end of the year recently the united states narrowed its fossil fuel financing through multilateral development banks though it left the door open for fossil fuel based energy financing in developing countries if clean alternatives are unfeasible and two swedish export credit agencies exportkreditnämnden ekn and svensk exportkredit sek are set to cease all financing for fossil fuel exploration and development by 2022 financial markets too have begun to respond to the industry s shifting economic tides a 2020 report by the institute for energy economics and financial analysis ieefa a global energy finance think tank argued that progressively tighter oil and gas lending guidelines and market trends indicated that investors had begun to reassess financial strategies amid looming stranded asset risks like other nations south korea has come under pressure to reduce climate impacts and redirect financial flows to low carbon development as this year s united nations climate conference cop26 approaches and scientists sound the alarm bells over irreversible climate disaster if emissions keep soaring after china and japan south korea is the world s third largest financier of coal the biggest culprit behind man made climate change it is also the seventh biggest emitter of carbon dioxide globally following last year s declaration that south korea would go carbon neutral by 2050 president moon jae in pledged at a climate summit hosted by united states president joe biden in april that the east asian nation would stop state funding for coal power beyond its border and commit to a tougher 2030 emissions reduction target by 2022 although the government reportedly mulled backpedalling from the announcement a month later dongjae oh a researcher at sfoc and co author of the report said further investments in oil and gas projects go against the public s interest by contributing to climate disasters and is a direct contradiction to the country s carbon neutrality drive to minimise risk to the korean economy and public funds and to build demonstrate climate leadership korea needs to rapidly stop the pipeline of overseas fossil fuel projects like public institutions in the united kingdom sweden and united states

the statements are made and are based on information available to zoom at the time those statements are made and or management s good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events zoom assumes no obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made except as required by law non gaap financial measures zoom has provided in this press release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap zoom uses these non gaap financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that use of these non gaap financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing zoom s financial results with other companies in its industry many of which present similar non gaap financial measures non gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with zoom s condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap a reconciliation of zoom s historical non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation non gaap income from operations and non gaap operating margins zoom defines non gaap income from operations as income from operations excluding stock based compensation expense and related payroll taxes expenses related to charitable donation of common stock acquisition related expenses and litigation settlements net zoom excludes stock based compensation expense and expenses related to charitable donation of common stock because they are non cash in nature and excluding these expenses provides meaningful supplemental information regarding zoom s operational performance and allows investors the ability to make more meaningful comparisons between zoom s operating results and those of other companies zoom excludes the amount of employer payroll taxes related to employee stock plans which is a cash expense in order for investors to see the full effect that excluding stock based compensation expense had on zoom s operating results in particular this expense is dependent on the price of our common stock and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of the business zoom views acquisition related expenses when applicable such as amortization of acquired intangible assets transaction costs and acquisition related retention payments that are directly related to business combinations as events that are not necessarily reflective of operational performance during a period zoom excludes significant litigation settlements net of amounts covered by insurance that we deem not to be in the ordinary course of our business in particular zoom believes the consideration of measures that exclude such expenses can assist in the comparison of operational performance in different periods which may or may not include such expenses and assist in the comparison with the results of other companies in the industry non gaap net income and non gaap net income per share basic and diluted zoom defines non gaap net income and non gaap net income per share basic and diluted as gaap net income attributable to common stockholders and gaap net income per share attributable to common stockholders basic and diluted respectively adjusted to exclude stock based compensation expense and related payroll taxes expenses related to charitable donation of common stock acquisition related expenses litigation settlements net gains on strategic investments and undistributed earnings attributable to participating securities zoom excludes gains on strategic investments because given the size and volatility in the ongoing adjustments to the valuation of our strategic investments we believe that excluding these gains or losses facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our operational performance zoom excludes undistributed earnings attributable to participating securities because they are considered by management to be outside of zoom s core operating results and excluding them provides investors and management with greater visibility to the underlying performance of zoom s business operations facilitates comparison of its results with other periods and may also facilitate comparison with the results of other companies in the industry in order to calculate non gaap net income per share basic and diluted zoom uses a non gaap weighted average share count zoom defines non gaap weighted average shares used to compute non gaap net income per share basic and diluted as gaap weighted average shares used to compute net income per share attributable to common stockholders basic and diluted adjusted to reflect the common stock issued in connection with the ipo including the concurrent private placement that are outstanding as of the end of the period as if they were outstanding as of the beginning of the period for comparability free cash flow zoom defines free cash flow as gaap net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment zoom considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors regarding net cash provided by operating activities and cash used for investments in property and equipment required to maintain and grow the business customer metrics zoom defines a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity which can be a single paid host or an organization of any size including a distinct unit of an organization that has multiple paid hosts zoom calculates net dollar expansion rate as of a period end by starting with the annual recurring revenue arr from all customers with more than 10 employees as of 12 months prior prior period arr zoom defines arr as the annualized revenue run rate of subscription agreements from all customers at a

editorial article future proofing after the pandemic building supply chain resilience through partnership industry expert john radke reveals how a reliable and transparent supply chain partner can be critical to weathering turbulent times john radke head of life science chemistry production materials group at merck the covid 19 pandemic has cast a spotlight on the importance of reliable global supply chains across the science industry unprecedented raw materials shortages and delays caused by regional manufacturing shutdowns logistics disruptions and surges in demand have served as a formidable test for both life science manufacturers and laboratory end users now as the world takes its first cautious steps towards a post pandemic future becoming better prepared for managing crises is imperative with the need to mitigate supply chain disruptions a key priority to this end fostering partnerships with suppliers can be highly beneficial enabling both laboratories and manufacturers to effectively navigate unpredictable fluctuations in supply and demand speaking to the value of such collaborations john radke head of life science chemistry production materials group at merck shares in this article some of the key considerations to factor into choosing a supply chain partner and explains how support from merck can help organizations build a strong resilience to ongoing and future shocks meeting diverse needs whether sourcing raw materials to manufacture products for downstream applications or managing the materials inventory of a laboratory finding a trusted reliable supplier can pose multiple challenges the first is ensuring the supplier has the exact product that you re looking for this may sound simple but for those seeking application specific products or facing regulatory requirements navigating broad product listings can be extremely time consuming procurement errors can also have significant impacts both financially and through workflow disruptions suppliers with well defined products applicable specifications and easily accessible supporting documentation can therefore greatly streamline these efforts radke explains at merck one of the things we pride ourselves in is not only being customer centric but also being quality aware he says this is where our m clarity program comes in the m clarity program uses defined quality attributes to place products within quality levels and is designed to improve product and service transparency throughout merck s broad life science portfolio it allows users to navigate to products that range anywhere from being appropriate for use in research to being appropriate for use as an excipient or active pharmaceutical ingredient making it easy to choose the product that best meets their needs says radke the six mq levels ranging from mq100 to mq600 also define the documentation and services offered in each class including the level of change control notification support customers are able to get notification of changes to supplier label or quality specifications and at the higher levels even changes to the manufacturing process he adds resilience during covid 19 in addition to quality assurance and transparency strong supply chain management should be a vital consideration when choosing a supplier one which the covid 19 pandemic has brought into sharp focus radke recalls this period as both stressful and energizing while highlighting how a global manufacturing and distribution network was critical to maintaining stock supplies and meeting the demand because we re a global company we have at least 65 manufacturing procurement and distribution facilities within the whole organization and we were able to really leverage these during the covid 19 crisis he says these facilities enable us to relocate the inventory to the appropriate geo region if we see an increase in demand and also conduct tech transfers of our products for example if we are manufacturing in north america we can potentially leverage a facility in apac or western europe as a backup supply from supplier to partner the ability to minimize supply chain risk by offering alternative products and mobilizing a network of secondary and tertiary sourcing makes suppliers such as merck ideal candidates for those seeking strategic partners we have the capability to take a customer from bench to bulk or concept to commercialization asserts radke we work with our customers to define what they need short and long term in order to provide a customized service not only from the quality standpoint but also from a scale up and cost perspective we have the capability to take a customer from bench to bulk or concept to commercialization as merck is itself a manufacturer of life sciences reagents kits and devices manufacturing customers can also benefit from a wealth of expertise lower raw material costs and potential secondary sourcing during capacity constraints we have a full in house technical group that can be drawn upon to support customers with product information and applications says radke using a combination of planned orders and forecasting models we re even helping companies go through the process of planning to generate procurement schedules and find the best total cost of ownership ongoing communication is critical to these collaborations if there is a serious supply chain problem we pride ourselves on getting the right information back to customers so they can make alternative plans says radke we re willing to be honest and transparent with our customers
