some places do power rankings here at cageside we do a stock report in this weekly series we identify three superstars or groups of superstars who are on their way up and three that are moving in the opposite direction after a busy week that included summerslam 2021 and all of its fallout a lot of fortunes were changed with that in mind let s see whose stock has decreased the most this week stock down 3 ricochet some people tricked themselves into thinking that ricochet s standout performance in the men s money in the bank ladder match would finally lead to better booking for him on raw this week s aug 23 episode squashed any remaining hope of that happening with ricochet losing to karrion kross and his terrible new ring gear in about 90 seconds stock down 2 nikki a s h nikki s brief reign as raw women s champion came to an end at summerslam nikki s promos always made it sound like she didn t deserve to have the title and her booking in the ring as a fluke champion followed suit it s as if wwe just wanted to get the women s money in the bank contract angle out of the way as soon as possible before resetting the championship scene back with charlotte flair on top stock down 1 goldberg bill goldberg s performance in the ring at summerslam was once again awkward and underwhelming he lost against bobby lashley due to a kayfabe leg injury that led to a referee stoppage as a result goldberg came off like a feeble old man who has no business challenging for the top titles in wwe any more the post match angle where goldberg s son was put in the hurt lock makes it clear that a rematch will happen at some point between bill and bob goldberg seeking revenge for what happened to his son is a good hook for another match with lashley but it s really hard to justify how goldberg deserves any more title shots he s lost three championship matches in a row and looked particularly impotent in this one unless lashley drops the title between now and the rematch it s going to be hard to stomach goldberg getting one more shot at championship gold when they meet again now let s see whose stock has increased the most this week stock up 3 rk bro randy orton and matt riddle won the raw tag team titles from aj styles omos at summerslam rk bro was then featured in a championship celebration during the main event segment of raw riddle went on to defeat styles in a singles match with some help from orton using a scooter to neutralize omos stock up 2 damian priest damian priest had a hell of a week he first defeated sheamus to win the united states championship at summerslam two nights later on raw he emerged as a potential new challenger for wwe champion bobby lashley for what it s worth priest has yet to lose a singles match on the wwe main roster stock up 1 becky lynch brock lesnar the biggest stories coming out of summerslam were the surprising returns of becky lynch and brock lesnar lynch won the smackdown women s championship from bianca belair in 26 seconds while lesnar has been immediately thrust back into the universal championship mix with roman reigns it can be easily argued that lynch and lesnar are the two biggest stars in wwe and they will now be a focal point at the top of the card going forward there you have it cagesiders whose stock do you think has changed the most this week
uk vaccine watchdogs are under pressure to approve the roll out of jabs for children as young as 12 as doctors say it could save thousands of lives by christmas they say vaccinating 12 to 15 year olds is urgent as it would cut the number of covid deaths and hospitalisations by a fifth and protect the youngsters themselves the dramatic findings seen by the mail on sunday come in a new study by exeter university medical school set to be published this week it follows health secretary sajid javid s instruction to the nhs last week to start preparing to jab 12 to 15 year olds amid fears children starting back at school could trigger a new covid wave a new study by exeter university set to be published this week says vaccinating 12 to 15 year olds is urgent as it would cut the number of covid deaths and hospitalisations by a fifth stock image but it also comes amid anger that the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation jcvi has still not given the go ahead for the shots that is despite the fact that other countries including france and the united states have been vaccinating children as young as 12 for weeks even australia which has dramatically lower rates of covid than the uk has now approved vaccines for 12 to 15s with its vaccines committee saying the benefits far outweigh the potential risks tory mp and former cabinet minister david jones said last night it is welcome that preparations are now well under way to jab 12 to 15 year olds but there is a danger of missing the boat given children will very shortly be returning to school another tory mp said privately that he was at a loss as why the jcvi is taking so long to give the go ahead however others insist schoolchildren should only be jabbed to protect their own health not to save older generations more at risk from covid sources said the jcvi is expected to make a decision within ten days but the exeter university study made clear there is no time to lose dr david strain senior clinical lecturer at the university s medical school and a working hospital consultant said the delta variant had changed the rules of engagement he said this new variant produces 1 000 times more copies of itself which means 12 13 and 14 year olds who previously couldn t generate enough copies of virus to infect their parents now can it follows health secretary sajid javid s pictured instruction to the nhs last week to start preparing to jab 12 to 15 year olds amid fears children starting back at school could trigger a new covid wave and while earlier strains rarely made youngsters very sick delta was causing more to fall seriously ill a quarter of covid patients at the royal devon and exeter hospital s respiratory support unit this summer are under 25 he said he and his team predict jabbing all 12 to 15s will cut total covid related deaths by 18 per cent and hospitalisations by 21 per cent compared to the current strategy vaccinating just youngsters with health conditions plus those who live with at risk others under a conservative scenario jabbing 12 to 15 year olds could prevent 28 000 hospitalisations across all age groups and save 2 250 lives but if there is a bigger autumn wave vaccinating younger adolescents could stop 77 000 hospitalisations and save 6 500 lives dr strain said covid was now rife in youngsters who act as super spreaders failing to vaccinate them would increase the risk of another lockdown it is thought the main reason the jcvi is hesitating is concern the pfizer and moderna jabs given to young people can trigger a heart condition called myocarditis but dr strain said the risk was very low four per million in 20 to 25 year olds even if the risk in under 18s was double that it would only translate to 37 uk cases if we vaccinate all adolescents there have been two deaths from vaccine induced myocarditis worldwide he said but at least four per cent of young people made ill by the virus suffered long covid a source said the jcvi was considering all available evidence

20 24 studio faqs why did polaroid build such a camera to demonstrate the quality of polacolor ii film polaroid was about to release a professional color film in 8 10 format polaroid built a studio on ames street in cambridge ma this studio contained two studios and a gallery to exhibit the images initially they invited a number of select photographers to experiment with the cameras in exchange for donating images to the polaroid collection polaroid also used a process camera version to copy paintings in the 40 80 studio at the museum of fine arts in boston cameras were also sent to amsterdam and tokyo where are the cameras currently located there are two cameras operated by 20 24 holdings one is in new york city and the second is a travel camera the nyc camera is at our studio at the film society of lincoln center the third is at 20 24 studio west in san francisco the fourth is owned by elsa dorfman and is in cambridge ma the fifth is owned by jan hnizdo in prague czech republic and is currently inactive the sixth is being operated by impossible project in the netherlands also inactive a sixth camera one of the original five is now in the harvard museum of scientific instruments it was a retirement gift to edwin land in 1982 and was part of land s rowland foundation bequeathment to harvard university it is also inactive a seventh camera is in dusseldorf germany the 20 24 studio west camera is not one of the original five but rather an earlier prototype with a new front end built by wisner manufacturing and customized by mammoth camera what are the specifications of the camera the 20 24 camera is a traditional view camera but has hybrid characteristics of a rail camera and field camera it weighs 235 pounds and sits on a rectangular frame on wheels that supports a two column studio stand the bellows is driven by a telescoping nylon gear that allows bellows extension from 17 to 60 the front standard has 24 of rise and fall 6 of side to side shift and the ability to swing 4 forward and back the rear standard of the camera is static and has no independent rise and fall separate from the camera itself the camera can descend to 24 and rise to a height of 72 the camera rear box contains a built in processor with 22 titanium rollers it is driven by a geared motor drive powered by a 110v ac motor transformers are used for 220 or 240v current what lenses are used on the 20 24 camera the new york studio offers focal lengths of 1200mm 800mm 600mm 360mm 210mm and 135mm only the 1200 800 and 600 were designed for the 20 24 format translated into inches these are 48 inch 31 inch and 24 inch lenses the bellows of the camera extends from 17 to 60 inches and each of these lenses will provide different levels of magnification at different bellows extension the 24 inch lens 600 has the most range of magnification allowing landscapes at infinity all the way up to 1 5 times lifesize the shorter focal lengths which are actually 8 10 and 4 5 lenses provide magnifications from 1 5 times life size all the way up to 10x as magnification increases depth of field decreases and subject to lens distance decreases at extreme magnification it becomes more difficult to light the subject because it is so close and the bellows extension factor can lose up to 8 or 9 stops of light how is the film put in the camera 20 24 film is provided on rolls the negative is supplied as a 150 roll and sits on brackets at the top of the camera box the positive is on a 50 roll and sits on a similar bracket at the bottom of the processor there are no sprockets in the film and it is moved into position with tab connected to string with adhesive tape this simple solution was utilized early on and has never been improved on above the positive roll in the camera sits a tray that through a chain driven system moves the chemical reagent pods into position between the two rollers where the negative and positive meet where do you get your film 20 24 holdings purchased over 500 cases of film in raw stock form from polaroid corp in 2009 the negative is kept in cold storage at 38º and the positive is stored in a climate controlled space at 45 relative humidity the chemicals that make up the reagent are stored in component form and only mixed when needed once placed in a pod the reagent will begin to age what is a pod a pod is a foil packet with special seals designed to break under pressure when passing through rollers allowing the reagent to spread evenly between the negative and positive rolls and begin the development process how are the pods made the pods are produced on a special machine the only remaining one in the us polaroid once had dozens of pod machines in their us factories it is housed in our warehouse in ashland massachusetts how often do you make pods it is based on demand so far it is four or five times per year what kind of film do you have left we have polacolor er which was sold by polaroid as t669 t59 and t809 it is also referred to as p3 this film was a favorite of photographers making image transfers and emulsion lifts it has a rather subdued color palette and is excellent for portraits our other color film is polacolor 7 and was sold as t690 by polaroid it has a brighter color palette more contrast and is similar to fuji fp100c in performance it is excellent for fashion and still life many photographers prefer it for portraiture as well sadly we are out of polapan 400 our black and white emulsion how does the 20 24 instant process work the 20 24 format utilizes the exact same material that polaroid once produced for all peel apart films from 3 and ¼ by 4 ¼ inches up to 8 10 there were three distinct film types black and white a silver only emulsion and two color emulsions polacolor er and polacolor 7 in black and white film the image formation is accomplished through a transfer of undeveloped silver halide unoxidized developer and unused alkali to the receiving layer once in the receiving layer the chemicals react to create a positive silver image the black and white film that is used in 20 24 is known as coaterless and does not require the print coater solution that earlier films such as type 52 552 and 57 did the physical makeup of color instant films contains many more components than found in comparable black and white films the basic structure consists of a black support material holding separate silver gelatin emulsion layers sensitive to red blue and green light during processing each of these will form its own separate color record as it releases a complementary subtractive dye the red sensitive layer releases cyan dye the blue sensitive layer releases yellow dye and the green sensitive layer releases magenta dye in between these color layers are spacers that contain alkali diffusible dye developers above these dye and spacer layers sits the image receiving layer followed by a timing layer that consists of both a barrier and an acid lastly there is an acidic mordant layer that will fix the dyes in place the layers are arranged as such to facilitate the chain reaction that takes place during development the developer pod in instant color materials contains a strong alkaline reagent in gel usually made of sodium or potassium hydroxide the reagent has been made viscous by water soluble polymeric thickeners and also contains high molecular weight polymers reducing agents alkali as well as components that assist in image formation and stabilization the pod itself must be inert to strong alkali and able to keep out oxygen and water for long periods of time the process used by polaroid known as alkaline induced dye diffusion transfer is outlined here after the alkaline developing reagent has been spread over dyes it forms a uniform layer that serves as a protective colloid during processing the reagent is spread above the light sensitive layers and below the image layer the developing reagent then begins to migrate toward the receiver sheet while the reagent moves it changes the exposed particles in each layer into metallic silver it then dissolves the three developer dyes allowing them to diffuse from their original locations toward the receiver sheet as the dyes move they are blocked wherever the metallic silver exists only dyes from the unexposed areas of the film will reach the receiving layer to produce a positive color image at the same time the developing reagent is moving down toward the light sensitive layers it is also diffusing through the timing layer to eventually come in contact with the layer of acid here the acid and alkaline combine to form water and salt in some types of instant color film the developing chemicals may remain on the surface of print while in other cases they

the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc projects a significant rise in the frequency duration and intensity of extreme weather events such as droughts heatwaves and heavy rainfall ipcc 2021 the direct local economic repercussions of such events are considered to be greater in low income countries because these countries typically already have hotter climates which implies that ecosystems are closer to their biophysical limits and have less access to technology that can mitigate the consequences of extreme weather moreover most low income countries have very high shares of agriculture in economic activity which is the most vulnerable sector to weather shocks nordhaus 2006 dell et al 2012 noy 2012 tol 2015 cruz and rossi hansberg 2021 since poor countries have to bear the bulk of the climate change burden it is often argued that this acts as a disincentive for rich economies to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions althor et al 2016 however the rise in the frequency and intensity of severe weather events around the globe as well as crop diseases and pests due to climate change could also have an impact on the economic performance of countries that are not directly exposed to the extreme events through global agricultural production shortfalls and surges in food commodity prices specifically since global production of the most important crops is concentrated in a small number of major producing regions that are vulnerable to extreme weather conditions the ipcc projects greater risks of global food system disruptions and agricultural production shortfalls that trigger substantial rises in global food prices ipcc 2019 such food commodity market disruptions at the global level are not science fiction extreme droughts in several major producing regions at the same time were for example the primary reason for the rise in the prices of the key staple food items in the second half of 2010 and summer of 2012 by 40 and 20 respectively which can be observed in figure 1 barriopedro et al 2011 de winne and peersman 2016 studies conclude that an event that would have been called a 1 in 100 years extreme adverse global food production shock over the period 1951 2010 may become as frequent as 1 in 30 years before the middle of the century bailey et al 2015 figure 1 evolution of global real food commodity prices over time note all prices are in us dollar and measured as 100 times the natural log of the index deflated by us cpi the broad food commodity price index is a trade weighted average of benchmark prices for cereals meat seafood vegetable oils sugar fruit vegetables and dairy products data from the imf economic consequences of global food commodity price shocks in de winne and peersman 2021a we examine the impact of disruptions in global food commodity markets on the economic activity of 75 advanced and developing countries for each country we have estimated the effects of changes in global food commodity prices that were caused by harvest disruptions and by weather shocks that occurred in other regions of the world the harvest disruptions are unanticipated shocks to the aggregate harvest volumes of the four most important staple food commodities corn wheat rice and soybeans the weather shocks are deviations of agricultural weighted global weather conditions i e a quadratic in average temperature as well as total precipitation weighted by grid level agricultural output and crop calendars from their historical averages and long term trend for each country we only look at shocks that occurred in other regions of the world to measure the macroeconomic effects via global food commodity markets rather than direct effects of extreme weather on local economic activity figure 2 shows the average responses of economic activity in all 75 countries to a 10 increase in global food commodity prices caused by both types of shocks the dynamic effects turn out to be very similar for both sources of food price shifts that is real gdp reaches a maximum decline of 0 53 after six quarters this impact is considerable since extreme weather has triggered several price shifts of more than 10 and up to 30 in the past the results also suggest that the strong rise of global food commodity prices in recent periods see figure 1 could impede the post covid recovery figure 2 dynamic responses to a 10 increase in global food commodity prices note the price shift is at period 0 while all other determinants are kept constant horizon of the responses x axis is quarterly 68 and 95 confidence intervals the first column isolates for each country price changes that are caused by unfavorable harvest disruptions in other regions of the world and the second column price changes caused by weather shocks in other regions of the world results are based on 75 advanced and developing countries covering the period 1970q1 2016q4 source de winne and peersman 2021a we further find that several indicators of expected global economic activity decline as a consequence of the food commodity market disruptions whereas consumer prices increase significantly in related research de winne and peersman 2016 and peersman forthcoming show for the us and euro area respectively that food commodity price surges have an impact on food retail prices through the food production chain but also trigger indirect inflationary effects via rising wages and exchange rate shifts in addition households do not only reduce food consumption that is there is even a much greater decline of durable consumption and investment the latter is partly the consequence of the monetary policy response to stabilise the inflationary consequences overall the macroeconomic effects turn out to be a multiple of the maximum impact implied by the share of food commodities in the consumer price index and household consumption differences between rich and poor countries figure 3 reveals that high and middle income countries are much more affected by global food commodity price shifts that are caused by harvest and or weather shocks elsewhere real gdp in these two groups of countries declines by 0 52 and 0 91 respectively whereas the peak decline in low income countries is only 0 19 and statistically insignificant figure 3 effects of global food commodity price increases in advanced versus poor countries note results for 10 price shifts caused by unfavourable harvest disruptions in other regions of the world 68 and 95 confidence intervals high income countries are the top tertile top 25 of countries according to ppp adjusted real gdp per capita over the period 2000 2015 low income countries are the bottom tertile 51 75 and middle income countries are the remaining countries 26 50 source de winne and peersman 2021a the stronger effects in advanced economies are surprising since the share of food commodities in household expenditures is much lower than in low income countries moreover since high income countries typically have more effective government institutions it is less likely that food price increases trigger conflicts that are detrimental for economic activity such as food riots de winne and peersman 2021b finally advanced countries have better developed financial markets to absorb income shocks it turns however out that these favourable characteristics are offset by a number of less advantageous features first we find that the macroeconomic repercussions are weaker in countries that are net exporters of agricultural products which can be explained by a favourable terms of trade effect in addition we document a more subdued decline of real gdp in countries that have higher shares of agriculture in economic activity which is likely the consequence of the fact that these countries are more isolated from changes in global prices because more households are self sufficiency farmers and a lot of agricultural products are traded on local markets only due to higher transportation costs in rural areas finally we find weaker effects in countries that have lower shares of non agricultural trade in gdp that is countries that are less integrated with the rest of the world via trade are also less sensitive to the global economic downturn caused by the rise in food commodity prices the favourable characteristics which typically apply to low income countries can explain the weaker overall effects in low income countries in particular once we control for these country characteristics in a panel regression we find that the decline of economic activity becomes smaller when income per capita is higher conclusion there will be more frequent and greater downturns in economic activity compared to a no climate change scenario through increases in global food commodity prices that are the consequence of extreme weather events in major agricultural production regions such as droughts and heatwaves in contrast to common perception e g financial times 2021 espitia et al 2020 the macroeconomic repercussions of increases in global food prices are greater in advanced economies than in low income countries this suggests that the consequences of climate change on advanced countries may be greater than previously thought this also implies that we need a more nuanced debate on the welfare effects of higher food prices as earlier argued by headey 2011 and hertel and rosch 2011 finally swings in global food prices appear to be important for economic activity in many countries the strong rise of global food commodity prices since the outbreak of covid 19 could thus

engagements by chidi amuta separated by great distance but proximal in influence and geostrategic thinking nigeria and afghanistan are drifting closer for most nigerians afghanistan is not exactly their next favorite tourist destination but aspects of afghanistan s undulating history of trouble making and theocratic fixations are beginning to resonate more with nigeria and indeed the rest of the world where jihadist terror has become a permanent concern the strategic importance of the unfolding situation in afghanistan for our terrorism situation may not immediately concern our security experts but the two elements that make afghanistan a country of permanent interest are present here jihadist violence bred by atrocious governance in a faulty state if we recognize the interplay of these two elements in our current security headache we had better stay tuned to the news from kabul in tandem with the last minute efforts of the us to wrap up what is unarguably a nasty withdrawal and evacuation process issi k terrorists have bombed the vicinity of kabul airport the immediate theatre of the evacuation effort the attack and its large casualties is a quick reminder to the us and the taliban that the calculus of power change in afghanistan must include the presence of terror squads like isis and remnants of al queda to the rest of the world especially in places like nigeria that are wracked by jihadist terror and governance instability there is an even more harsh and direct message from kabul jihadists everywhere are emboldened whenever jihadists in one place score a triumph over a perceived great power at such moments the good of sectarian puritanism seems to triumph over the evil of the secular corrupt state jihadists everywhere jubilate through intensified violence campaigns a latent terror virus finds oxygen and explodes to infect more places america s carelessness has fed a familiar monster which is returning to torment the world for the us and the biden presidency in particular this avoidable nasty outcome may not bode well for the politics of the afghanistan misadventure in washington the last minute janitorial oversights may yet cause the democrats a few sleepless nights unless they can quickly and stoutly remind americans that mr biden was merely fulfilling an agreement entered into by the tardy mr trump and in any case americans are better off with keeping their dollars at home to pay for weekend shopping and medicare than burying it in sink holes in a hellhole of terror if the containment of terrorism or indeed its reduction was touted as a benefit of the 20 year afghan mission this latest attack underlines the falsity of the optimism of course terrorist episodes remained an active part of the afghanistan ecosystem while the american occupation lasted the several attacks on kabul and its environs were conveniently attributed to the taliban now the taliban is in power it cannot possibly bomb itself and fellow afghan citizens isis k has rudely stepped in to announce its stake as part of the present and future of a bad place for the taliban the terrorist attack at kabul airport poses an instant credibility problem of immense proportions the resurgent taliban that is still clawing its way back to power in afghanistan is busy making initial noises about a change of heart and a slightly reformed image no one is certain what taliban 2 0 really is it is uncertain if it has overtly abandoned the kind of terrorism that it used to support and sometimes sponsor the old taliban would ordinarily turn a blind eye to the kind of gruesome attack that has just taken place in kabul in its original format and iteration the taliban remains an extremist fundamentalist movement with jihadism at its very foundation from 1996 to 2000 the purist sharia driven government of the taliban distinguished afghanistan as a safe haven for all manner of terrorist franchises the challenge of taliban 2 0 is to redefine its relationship with terrorism the attitude of the world will fall into place while the world awaits the full meaning of the unfolding afghan quagmire nations with known jihadist terrorism problems can already feel the psychological impact of the afghanistan outcome jihadists all over the world are likely to be emboldened by the afghan outcome nigeria s long running boko haram enterprise remains an ideological off shoot of both taliban and isis type extremism and jihadism such boldness is most likely to enhance the belief that the ultimate vindication of the jihadist campaign in dysfunctional secular states is to conquer and overthrow them this audacity is reinforced by the atrocious governance record of such failing or faulty states for instance the main thrust of international opinion on the reason behind nigeria s prolonged jihadist insurgency is the inherent dysfunction and corruption of the state says the london economist jihadists in north eastern nigeria are hard to beat because locals detest the central government and army officers sell their own men s weapons to the guerillas and pocket the cash in addition to deriving original inspiration from the taliban nigeria s boko haram shares traits with classical taliban like the taliban boko haram subscribes to a medieval version of islam which abhors western education and modernization they raze schools and kill teachers they have the same attitude to the status of women women s education and basic freedoms they enslave women and prefer men with scraggy beards without grooming and have no room for freedom of expression respect for the media and other manifestations of the open society jihad is its driving force divine ordained violent retribution against infidels is its fuel while terrorist violence remains its principal vehicle therefore last tuesday s bandit attack on the nigerian defence academy nda points in a bad direction in the nation s expanding lethal handshake with jihadist terrorism so far two officers are dead while a third who was abducted by the gunmen faces an uncertain fate in the process the credibility of our military has taken a direct hit the message is undisguised a military establishment that cannot protect the officers and men in its premier national academy can hardly reassure the general populace of safety and security such a military establishment cannot justify its huge charge on the public purse or indeed its very professional capability why did the bandits target the nda our attention should be on the historical and strategic importance of the defence academy in our national defence and security profile to date since its establishment in february 1964 the nigerian defence academy has remained the nation s apex citadel of military training and professional excellence in these 57 years the academy has become the benchmark for establishing the seniority of a succession of officers who have come to lead the nigerian military and indeed the nation for most of our history both for good and for ill the nda is our equivalent of britain s sandhurst america s west point or india s indian military academy it is the apex laboratory for the best training that our military can give to its officers combining strategic tactical academic and practical combat training the standard expectation is that the nda would showcase the best capacities that our military can boast of the terrorist attack on the institution is therefore a direct hit at the professional integrity and prestige of the military establishment this is the first time that the security and professional credibility of the institution would be so brazenly breached and assailed official abuja has not helped itself or the citizenry with its responses to this incident the usual attempt to find a political spin to anchor this incident has fallen flat on its nose the attempt to politicize the incident by ascribing it to political opponents has come out as a tragic trivialization and an outright show of official foolishness to insist as the president himself has done that the incident will merely rouse the military into more serious action is simplistic and pedestrian nor will the enlightened public buy the claim that this is the handiwork of just casual criminals or political busy bodies the attack on the nda is plainly what it is a calculated strategic targeting of a symbolic national military institution by a dangerous and methodical insurgent adversary that adversary knew what to target when to strike and the class of casualties to inflict without suffering any itself this is an enemy that understands news and the value of media a military training formation that pleads surprise as an excuse for the loss of lives and compromise of its space is deficient the enemy that struck the nda seems fairly determined to strike at the vertebra of national security with a clear message that message was delivered with devastating effect it is a bad message of demonstrating the vulnerability of even our most respected and best protected national security institutions and high points we cannot diminish the import of this incident by ascribing it to bandits loosely defined as squads of opportunistic criminals out to extort money from government and individuals that is simplistic lazy and naïve opportunistic business minded bandits cannot be so foolish as to expect to make money out of an attack on a government military installation the accounting process is long and laborious no individual will feel so pained as to dole out huge sums because the nda was attacked and its officers abducted or killed and in any case why kill your captives if you need a ransom abducting a low level army officer in expectation of a ransom in hundreds of millions of naira does not quite make sense to do so in a city full of low risk targets with immense commercial heft does not fit into the mind set of any entrepreneurial set of criminals who want to carry out successful abductions and live to enjoy the loot of an attractive ransom only a jihadist minded set of gunmen would dare to attack a military institution of the level of the nda where they should expect stiff resistance the operation was carried out fully mindful of the symbolism of the nda in relation to the risk to have done it and inflicted casualties without suffering any themselves indicates some degree of training and preparation that should be of interest to serious investigators and in any event jihadist terrorists do not care about death since it guarantees them instant martyrdom and the ultimate reward of virgins and eternal happiness in heaven it is foolish for our security people to continue seeing the bandits roaming most of the northern states as free mercantile agents without either an ideological or political compass there is a contrary belief that sees the so called bandits as the roving department of the larger boko haram jihadist movement they consist of operatives trained indoctrinated and armed by the parent organization as foot soldiers they have shown very good weapons training they are more mobile than the more administratively minded master organization they operate in smaller formations and can spread out to a wider targeted or designated territory their political guidance and target selection seems to be centrally controlled more importantly the bandits seem to be a mobile fund raising machinery of boko haram they demand and collect ransom in large sums as against the small taxes and rates collected by the parent organization their ransom collections seems to be geared towards reinvestment in new stocks of armaments and remittance to the parent organization for heavy logistics outlays the funds are moved around through shadowy conduits including bureau de change operators and sundry unlicensed money changers sensitive observers and analysts ought to have noted the ease with which some of their captives and abductees end up in boko haram camps should be of interest to our managers of violence it would also be of further interest to security analysts to explore the relationship between the roving bandits of the northern ecosystem and the itinerant herdsmen accompanying cattle in the southern states who in the last six years have suddenly showed up with military grade assault rifles to terrorize communities highways and settlements robbing killing and collecting ransom as well we should also be interested in the territorial focus of bandits and their operations the axis of coverage now spans katsina zamfara kaduna niger and parts of nassarawa states with active operational flanks out to plateau and benue states the most intense theatre of bandit interest seems to be kaduna state and kaduna city the strategic importance of kaduna state in matters of sectarian violence and religion inspired instability have been a permanent part of successive disruptions in addition to being the headquarters of the original northern region kaduna remains attractive as the location of a number of strategic military and civilian government institutions the long standing historical restive relationship between native hausa and settler fulani populations has remained a matter of serious security interest in the story of our national insecurity it becomes a soft fault line for bandit infiltration and activity for ends that go beyond criminal extortion and ransom collection by most sensible intelligence estimates there is a clear and present danger that boko haram and its affiliate terror squads have their eyes trained on abuja they have all shown a common interest in disrupting the business of the government in abuja if only to demonstrate their capacity to challenge the prevailing sovereignty there are very recent indications that boko haram is expanding its theatre of operation southwards from its original base in the north east boko haram activities have spread to yobe katsina zamfara and lately niger state the governor of niger state recently revealed that boko haram has taken over control of five local governments in the state and was within two hours of abuja the highway between abuja and kaduna has become a favourite operational thoroughfare and playground of all manner of bandits and gunmen similarly at the height of the shiite campaign to free mr el zakzakky militants of the sect freely invaded abuja and quickly turned the central business district of the city into a battle theatre of free exchange of fire with security forces taken together therefore there is a palpable but latent strategic instability around abuja the city of abuja seems surrounded by both sectarian and criminal armed threats united by a common interest in subversive disruption of the nigerian state concerned interest groups and leadership factions in nigeria have already begun to caution president buhari to be mindful of the political risk of jihadist bandits and terror squads hovering around the northern precincts of the country opposition from partisan political adversaries can make buhari uncomfortable it is only the concerted onslaught of a coalition of boko haram militants and their bandit foot soldiers that pose a danger of overrunning abuja and occupying aso rock villa which they see as the citadel of an evil empire in all of this there are overriding strategic implications that ought to challenge our security managers to reach beyond surface solutions an internal security strategy that cannot see the interconnections among all jihadist forces operating to subvert the nigerian state would fall flat on its face
hurricane ida is expected to rapidly strengthen before pummeling louisiana on sunday forcing evacuations in new orleans and the surrounding coastal region on the eve of the 16th anniversary of hurricane katrina on saturday ida was moving away from cuba and into the gulf of mexico where it is expected to intensify over the next 24 to 36 hours prior to landfall across the louisiana coast on sunday afternoon or evening recent satellite imagery showed the storm has already strengthened new orleans mayor latoya cantrell on saturday warned residents planning to voluntarily evacuate which she recommended to get out now time is not on our side it s just rapidly growing it s intensifying the mayor said at a news conference referring to ida if you re voluntarily evacuating our city now is the time to leave you need to do so immediately if you re planning to ride it out again make sure that you re able to hunker down louisiana gov john bel edwards said ida will be one of the strongest hurricanes that hit anywhere in louisiana since at least the 1850s this is a very large storm edwards told reporters saturday noting that the hurricane could span about 150 miles east and west from the storm s center i don t want folks who are further inland to be caught off guard over 4 000 soldiers and airmen with the louisiana national guard are currently mobilized and another 5 000 will be prepared by the time the storm makes landfall edwards told cnn saturday afternoon you just have a few more hours really to prepare edwards said where you go to bed tonight you need to be prepared to ride out the storm and the storm is going to be very severe he told those who are not evacuating an extremely dangerous major hurricane ida is anticipated to reach at least category 4 strength before landfall the national hurricane center said maintaining its earlier forecast tropical storm force winds could reach new orleans about 8 a m sunday before the storm makes landfall that afternoon or evening west of new orleans near houma and morgan city late saturday afternoon meteorologists at the center said the storm appears to have begun its intensification phase ida is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane when it approaches the northern gulf coast on sunday national hurricane center forecasters said saturday morning at 2 p m et the storm had strengthened to a category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph officials throughout the state implored people to evacuate with some issuing mandatory orders to do so news footage from the area showed traffic backed up heading out of new orleans collin arnold director of the new orleans office of homeland security and emergency preparedness urged people to stock up on enough food and water for at least three days and to be either on the road or home by midnight we say the first 72 hours is on you arnold added the first three days of this will be difficult for responders to get to you in text alerts saturday new orleans officials urged residents to leave by this morning if you can if you re staying gather supplies charge devices lower fridge temp secure outdoor items today the message said state officials also texted residents get ready for ida louisianans have until nightfall the text warned adding that ida will bring serious impacts across the state cantrell issued a mandatory evacuation of all city areas that are outside its flood protection system and urged other residents to evacuate voluntarily or shelter in place the city cannot issue a mandatory evacuation because we don t have the time cantrell said friday at a news conference speaking about areas inside the levee system we do not want to have people on the road and therefore in greater danger because of the lack of time a dangerous

with plans during storm season i would ask our residents if you do not need to go to the hospital this weekend if you do not have a life threatening emergency please do not go avegno said this is not the time to go to the hospital for a routine thing that could wait until later meanwhile louisiana had no plans friday to separate vaccinated and unvaccinated people in shelters in state assisted emergency facilities during ida according to mike steele a spokesperson for the state homeland security and emergency management steele noted that municipalities issue evacuation orders and those operations start at the local level he added that masks are required at all shelters in the state along with social distancing louisiana gov john bel edwards expressed concern about sheltering while covid 19 are on the rise in the state the prospect of sheltering potentially thousands and thousands of people at the height of the fourth surge is very very daunting he said during a news conference about hurricane recovery efforts the governor acknowledged the challenge of bracing for a potential hurricane in the midst of recovery efforts from the 2020 hurricane season we re not recovered not by a long shot the governor said of hurricanes laura and delta impacts last year we still have businesses boarded up from the last hurricane homes have not yet been repaired and reoccupied or if they are damaged to the point where they need to be demolished and removed in many cases that hasn t happened either edwards said there are currently 2 450 people hospitalized with covid 19 more than at any point before this current surge we had four hurricanes last year during covid but we had a small fraction of the number of people in our hospitals that we currently have edwards told cnn saturday when hurricane laura hit last year we only had about 300 in the hospitals evacuating hospitals is not an option because there is no excess capacity anywhere else in the state or outside the state he said officials are concerned not only that hospitals could face prolonged power outages but also worry about what capacity they would have for those who might be injured during the hurricane according to edwards ida made two landfalls in cuba friday before entering the gulf ida made landfall twice over cuba as a category 1 hurricane first forming as a tropical storm in the caribbean on thursday ida

camaro zl1 coupe make chevrolet segment coupe among the big three range topping american pony cars the chevrolet camaro zl1 is the least powerful and the slowest in a straight line yes even though this 650 horsepower supercharged v8 coupe can reach 60 mph in 3 5 seconds both the ford mustang shelby gt500 and dodge challenger srt super stock are more powerful and quicker admittedly we re talking tenths of a second here in some cases but the chevy can t claim ultimate bragging rights that could change because a new rumor has emerged that the zl1 could be receiving some high performance upgrades from the cadillac ct5 v blackwing close the zl1 s 6 2 liter supercharged lt4 v8 is hardly what you d call underpowered with its 650 lb ft of torque but the caddy is even more powerful the ct5 v blackwing produces 668 hp and 659 lb ft and can reach 60 mph in 3 7 seconds it also rides on the same alpha platform as the camaro and comes with extras like brembo carbon ceramic brake rotors and a magnetic ride control suspension according to a source from inside general motors these are some of the features that could make it onto the zl1 for the last two model years that it ll be on sale and we d expect these changes to also apply to the zl1 1le close a few days ago a camaro prototype was spotted in transit and it certainly looked like a high performance version it sported a massive rear wing and wheels that are shared with the zl1 1le of course the ultimate incarnation of the current camaro would no doubt be the return of the z28 with a flat plane crank v8 from corvette but this is unlikely to transpire the camaro s future remains in doubt but we ve heard an all electric model could follow the existing generation before a possible electric camaro it ll be interesting to see if the latest rumor is true but a camaro zl1 with blackwing upgrades sounds like a perfect way for gm to see out the current car with a bang
bronco make ford segment suv as ford scrambles to fix quality control issues with the roof production of the 2021 ford bronco has been delayed but somehow hennessey performance engineering managed to get its hands on one the texas tuner has big plans for the off roader but before making any modifications hennessey took the bronco for a spin at the pennzoil proving ground to see how it performs finished in oxford white hennessey s 2021 bronco is a four door off road focused badlands edition which has heavy duty suspension with a front stabilizer bar disconnect hennessey s bronco also has a molded in color hard top roof which will need replacing by ford close on the track hennessey was impressed with how the bronco handled and experienced less body roll than the jeep wrangler then it was time for some light off roading with all the stability settings off hennessey had a lot of fun sliding the bronco around in the dirt to find out how much power the bronco produces hennessey then hooked the off roader up to a dyno bone stock the suv is offered with either a 2 3 liter ecoboost four cylinder rated at 300 hp and 325 lb ft with premium fuel or a 2 7 liter twin turbocharged v6 ecoboost producing 330 hp and 415 lb ft naturally hennessey ordered the more powerful 2 7 liter v6 when hooked to the dyno the bronco produced 284 rear wheel hp and 383 rear wheel lb ft torque close factoring drivetrain losses the dyno run suggests the bronco produces around the same amount of power as advertised we re assuming it was running on high octane fuel but hennessey didn t confirm this particular bronco won t stay stock for long however now that hennessey has it the tuner will start researching and developing a slew of modifications for the off roader available to order for 80 000 including the price of the bronco badlands the upcoming velociraptor 400 bronco will crank up the power to 405 hp and 503 lb ft of torque only 200 velociraptor 400 broncos will be built per year if you want more power the bronco velociraptor v8 swaps ford s 2 7 liter v6 for a 5 0 liter coyote v8 good for 750 hp only 24 of those will be made each costing 200 000

the good boys and girls of the world with christmas now less than four months away australia is facing its own logistic issues indeed there is a very real chance this festive season will look less like a happy yuletide tale and more like the grinch when the pandemic first forced shut the doors of china s factories in january last year the world began to feel the impact practically immediately all of a sudden the stream of various products parts and materials from the asian country in some cases simply evaporated as arguably the world s most draconian lockdown choked off tightly wound supply chains here in australia this was best illustrated by the sizeable quantity of empty shelves of some large retailers such as kmart as supply issues began to significantly impact the availability of goods to consumers empty shelves at kmart in ashfield sydney in july 2020 pictures benedict brook news com au across practically every industry from construction to automotive hairdressers to furniture retailers supply chain issues have begun to impact businesses and the flow of goods to households for example where once you could order a new couch from one of the nation s large furniture retailers and have it in under a month customers are now often facing extremely long waits that at times stretch into the territory of you ll get it eventually a 12 month wait for stock now as a result of multiple outbreaks of the delta covid 19 strain in china and elsewhere throughout the manufacturing hubs of the world these issues have actually significantly worsened since the initial supply chain shocks of march and april last year when combined with the enormous level of western government stimulus driving the highest level of demand for manufactured goods in history there is little hope that the current supply chain issues can be resolved by the start of the 2022 lunar new year february as lead in times for products continues to grow aussie retailers are increasingly being forced to order stock eight to 12 months in advance christmas shop now in a recent interview super retail group chief executive anthony heraghty said but even if you are buying it eight to 12 months out the chances of it arriving on time is zero he told fairfax if it s not in the shed or on the shelf today for christmas this year i think the chances of it being in stock come that peak time is incredibly remote mr heraghty went on to say that consumers should certainly consider getting in early and doing their christmas shopping now with delays expected to stretch well into next year and potentially even into 2023 mr heraghty urged aussies to christmas shop now however with many in lockdown it may need to be online shopping picture nca newswire david crosling

continues to set new record highs port of los angeles executive director gene seroka has shared his concerns about the impact on households mr seroka said the challenge facing the global supply chain amounts to squeezing 10 lanes of freeway traffic into five lanes the port boss cautioned americans to get their christmas shopping plans in place far earlier this year or risk having some very disappointed loved ones come the big day this already challenging situation has been further complicated by an outbreak of the delta strain at the chinese port of ningbo which is one of the busiest in

a rent stabilization policy in california s coastal city of santa monica kept average rents down researchers found but stagnant incomes meant people were still priced out of the market eventually in oregon some landlords rushed to increase rents before a statewide rental cap law went into effect according to a university report and in new york leaders have implemented several iterations of rent caps since world war ii illustrating the difficulty of getting the details right minneapolis voters will soon decide whether to join the ranks of hundreds of cities that have adopted varying laws to keep their housing affordable to low income people with mixed results housing leaders and researchers who study the effects of rent regulations warn that while rent capping laws can help in some cases they won t solve the affordable housing problem in minneapolis in the long term the supply of low cost housing will still need to increase they point out and too much rent regulation could push some landlords into deferring building maintenance or even getting out of the rental business by converting apartments to condominiums as has happened in other cities they said is a band aid said shane phillips a project manager with the lewis center for regional policy studies at the university of california los angeles and sometimes you need a band aid but you actually have to address the underlying cause as well a november ballot question will ask minneapolis voters to give the city council the authority to adopt a rent control ordinance explained as to regulate rents on private residential property but it does not give details of how the rent cap would work locally council members said if voters approve the question leaders will then figure out the specifics housing researchers suggest that minneapolis would likely adopt a form of rent stabilization favored recently in other cities tying allowable rent increases to inflation exempting newer dwellings and possibly including provisions that allow rents to jump to market rates after a tenant vacates an apartment but they warn leaders to implement it with a careful balance for both renters and landlords our review of studies from across the country showed that rent control does on balance result in lower rent than would otherwise have occurred in markets said edward goetz a university of minnesota professor and director of the center for urban and regional affairs cura and it can do so without adversely affecting the quality of the housing and it can do so without adversely affecting the rate of new construction some council members contend that restrictions on rent is the last missing piece of the puzzle to ease the city s housing crisis and to help keep people safely and stably housed council president lisa bender said greg russ who left the minneapolis public housing authority in 2019 to lead the new york city housing authority offered a different view calling rent regulation an awful idea that can suppress the supply and upkeep of affordable housing stock over time russ said he has seen some of those drawbacks in new york and at his previous job in cambridge mass where restrictions priced landlords out of doing business and prevented much needed capital improvements russ said minneapolis leaders should instead provide more subsidies to low income renters well funded subsidy programs help boost the housing supply and give eligible renters more choices of where to live he said rent control is very popular now with a generation that has never lived in rent control russ said when you establish rent control you re really interfering with the economics of a market other tactics minneapolis has already tried various tactics to help struggling renters including policies that subsidize rent and encourage the construction of more affordable housing the stable homes stable schools program for instance gives housing rental assistance to homeless elementary students families and incentivizes landlords who provide affordable units the city council also enacted a zoning ordinance that requires affordable housing units to be included in new developments as part of the city s 2040 comprehensive plan more recently city leaders allocated money to help provide legal services to families facing eviction and passed a city ordinance that requires landlords to give tenants written notice at least two weeks before going to court to evict them for unpaid rent the long running debate over imposing rent limits in minneapolis became more urgent in 2010 when the number of renters surpassed homeowners but a decade later racial and economic disparity heightened by the covid 19 pandemic is lending a fresh urgency to the city s push to put restrictions on landlords and protect tenants from being displaced according to an apartment trend report issued in 2019 by the residential analytics group of marquette advisors the average rent for a two bedroom apartment in minneapolis was 1 847 more than half of the city s renters earn less than 60 of the area median income while rent control advocates in minneapolis are still debating specific proposals advocates in st paul want to cap rent increases there at 3 annually control vs stabilization although the terms are often used interchangeably rent control and rent stabilization policies are technically different in their strength and sometimes in their scope according to a cura report rent control which is the less popular and more stringent version of the two systems because it imposes price ceilings on rent gained popularity after world war ii it can only be found in new york city and its rules apply to buildings built before 1947 rent stabilization laws on the other hand appeared in the 1970s and have different types of regulations with varying terms seen as more moderate forms of regulation they allow rent increases to be capped at a certain percentage each year and in most cases exempt single family homes and new construction either completely or for some period of time in minnesota a 1984 state law prohibits local governments from enacting rent regulations unless approved by voters in a general election a common stance around the country in the last decade or so cities and states across the u s have been giving it the go ahead in 2019 oregon became the first state in the nation to pass a statewide rent stabilization law limiting rent increases to 7 each year plus inflation and exempting subsidized rent and new construction that same year california capped annual rent hikes at 5 plus inflation or 10 whichever is less some local jurisdictions in california including los angeles have their own stronger regulations that supersede the state s rule in jersey city n j the allowable increase is limited to 4 and is directly tied to the change in cost of living during a lease new york passed sweeping statewide reforms in 2019 that allow expanded protections for tenants and limited opportunity for regulated rents to rise at rates higher than the annual limits set by a rent guidelines board according to the new york university furman center the changes which apply to both rent controlled and rent stabilized apartments eliminated policies that allowed rent to be raised any amount when a tenant vacates a unit and placed limits on preferential rent a practice where landlords initially offer a lower rent but later bump it up to market rate when a tenant renews a lease about 50 of rental units in new york city are rent stabilized according to the cura report goetz said regulating rents in minneapolis over the past couple of decades would have helped people of color in particular between 2006 and 2019 for instance african americans saw a 44 increase in their rent and almost no increase in their income the cura study found meanwhile those who were most well off mostly white residents saw a significant increase in income but not rent according to the study the rental market was operating pretty well for many people goetz said but there is a significant segment of the market where rent control would have been very helpful faiza

the late hall of famer s legacy at the event it s certainly an honor and privilege to be here this weekend for this historic moment in time frank scott said during a zoom interview held by nascar with reporters friday afternoon it s been nearly 60 years since wendell scott won that jacksonville 200 race and scott who died in 1990 wanted the recognition that was due to him for the victory he always wanted to get that trophy frank scott said he predicted he would get his trophy one day wendell scott piloted his 1962 chevrolet to first place at the jacksonville 200 but the race continued for two more laps possibly to give a white driver behind him a chance to catch up and take the lead he completed 202 laps but second place finisher buck baker was announced as the winner a few hours later officials notified scott of a scoring error but said the trophy had been misplaced the victory put wendell scott into the record books as the first african american race car driver to win the grand national nascar s highest level nascar president steve phelps gave scott s son frank scott the trophy on stage following a pre race concert and just before driver introductions the associated press reported driver bubba wallace nascar s lone full time black driver joined several of scott s family members on stage for the ceremony as they started to leave the dais warrick scott got his chance to pose with the trophy instead of holding or hoisting it he decided to kiss it it was maybe the most telling scene of what this meant to the family the ap reported warrick scott told the danville register bee in june 2020 there had been no effort from nascar to rectify this injustice in all the years since the wendell scott foundation was formed in 2010 to further his legacy and now also helps youth in underserved communities find mentors and stem based educational opportunities as part of its mission the foundation has worked to convince nascar to find a time to properly honor the driver that has been partially scrubbed from the sport s history the jacksonville stock car racing hall of fame created a replica trophy and presented it to the family in 2010 though that was 20 years after wendell scott died of spinal cancer nascar was not part of that ceremony danville museum warrick scott ceo of the wendell scott foundation plans to have the trophy put on display for the planned wendell scott center museum in danville this is where you ll find the trophy warrick said during the nascar interview friday wendell scott was 100 danville virginia every step of the way the foundation has been focusing efforts to put the museum inside the former woolworth building on main street the design company assisting in the efforts is based in richmond warrick pointed out that the trophy for scott will be a point of inspiration for untold amounts of people and illustrates his legacy of perseverance wendell scott never let detractors get in the way of his ambitions frank scott said he was a great man of determination frank said the wendell scott legacy is rooted in community and outreach warrick said diversity is a really big topic warrick said wendell built the bridge for diversity not just within this sport but in the minds and ideologies of people who didn t know how to share a space together brandon thompson nascar vice president of diversity and inclusion said the trophy will be presented to the scotts during pre race ceremonies saturday it s the prize wendell scott should have received on dec 1 1963 at the jacksonville 200 thompson said that historical moment wasn t celebrated in the way it should have been thompson said center of racing when asked why the trophy was being presented at daytona thompson said for us it s the world center of racing about a year ago nascar banned confederate flags at races and black driver bubba wallace debuted a black lives matter paint scheme at martinsville speedway wendell scott s victory 58 years ago took place only about 100 miles north of daytona he pointed out also wendell scott who was born in 1921 would have turned 100 on sunday thompson said all the stars aligned he said we agreed with the scotts that this would be the place to make this happen in addition traveling to dayton is coming home of sorts for frank scott i grew up at daytona he said it s good to be back at this historic place as happy and proud they are to receive the trophy for wendell the scotts said they felt frustration at the long wait for his proper recognition it s been a long wait frank said however you have to move forward he added wendell never let anything distract him from his mission frank said warrick who was 13 when his grandfather died also said he experienced frustration at the wait recalling spending a large amount of time with wendell warrick also recalled the nascar driver s prediction i always remembered how he felt warrick said thompson said nascar was exited and aware that scott s legacy extends to all people especially to children of color who have dreams it certainly is a testament to what is possible when you work hard thompson said
new york city new york after promising greater transparency new york governor kathy hochul announced some 12 000 more people have died from covid 19 than was reported under her disgraced predecessor former governor andrew cuomo in a statement she said the state is now reporting a total of 55 400 covid 19 deaths based on data from the centers for disease control and prevention 12 000 more than the 43 400 reported by cuomo on his last day in office we are using cdc numbers which will be consistent and so there is no opportunity for us to mask them said hochul in an interview with national public radio even with the additional 12 000 deaths new york still ranks third nationally behind california and texas in the highest number of covid 19 deaths according to reuters it is also still second in the deaths per capita remaining behind new jersey the incomplete numbers reported by cuomo focused only on confirmed deaths and excluded those who died at home and other locations however the revised count is based on death certificate data submitted to the cdc including any confirmed or suspected covid 19 deaths in any location within the state hochul stressed telling national public radio these are presumed and confirmed deaths people should know both hochul was one of the officials who questioned whether cuomo was releasing incorrect data to improve his image during the pandemic in february he admitted his office should not have withheld data on covid 19 nursing home deaths but he did not apologize a new york attorney general s report released in january criticized cuomo for undercounting coronavirus deaths in nursing homes by as much as 50 percent democrat hochul became the first female governor of new york on tuesday after serving as lieutenant governor to cuomo who resigned due to numerous sexual harassment allegations

for weeks a new wave of covid 19 cases has surged through the gulf coast region threatening health care capacity and emergency services across louisiana mississippi and alabama now with hurricane ida making landfall the region could see a collision of two public health emergencies in areas still grappling with the most critical wave of the pandemic we ve got a hurricane season coming we ve got a pandemic said mike evans director of the mobile county emergency management agency in coastal alabama where officials have reported negative icu capacity for days because of covid 19 cases how many more things can you pile on top of folks hurricane ida slammed onto the louisiana coast on sunday as a category 4 storm with punishing winds of 150 mph life threatening storm surge and potentially catastrophic rainfall it first made landfall near port fourchon less than 100 miles south of new orleans a short time later it made a second landfall a few miles to the north near galliano in louisiana covid 19 hospitalizations peaked at 3 022 on aug 17 and began dropping a welcome sign as the state struggled to find beds and staff but the covid 19 hospitalizations reported at 2 684 on friday are still comparatively high filling critical care beds across the state covid 19 cases in alabama continue to climb as officials have been forced to call in federal medical teams to coastal areas crushed by an onslaught of critically ill patients two mobile morgue units were dispatched to the area last week in anticipation of a fatality spike and hospitals around the state have been forced to treat icu patients in hallway gurneys and emergency departments as icu beds have bottomed out more onslaught of critically ill patients no icu beds is scenario we ve all been dreading mississippi covid 19 hospitalizations and icu usage are also at record high levels having a large patient census during any storm is never desirable as it requires us to house more resources than normal which equals more people in harm s way said ken mcdowell safety officer at memorial hospital in gulfport mississippi memorial has invested in hardening the facility to ensure we can meet the needs of the communities we serve essentially we are implementing two emergency plans at one time for both the pandemic and the hurricane though covid 19 numbers are headed in the right direction in louisiana hospitalizations are still high the new orleans area oschner health system informed the state this week they have limited capability to take patient transfers particularly from nursing homes that sometimes need to evacuate during storms oschner was prepared to take care of people who might come in for medical attention ceo warner thomas said but a large wave of new patients would be difficult our ability to take in a big influx would certainly be very challenging thomas said in terrebonne parish southwest of new orleans hospital officials echoed thomas late last week and asked residents to properly prepare for the hurricane to preserve hospital resources if there is a massive influx of patients due to weather casualties it will be taxing on our already drained system due to covid terrebonne general hospital said in a statement so please be careful when preparing your homes before and cleaning up after the storm officials around the region stress that they re battle tested and well equipped at this time to weather power outages in the past bad experiences have helped us achieve a degree of effectiveness said greg stock ceo of thibodaux regional in lafourche parish north of terrebonne we are prepared for emergencies that might come during and after the storm we have a surge plan in case an unexpected number of patients come and feel really great about our leaders frontline middle managers that that are very capable and very dedicated and our staff the workers throughout the facility still stock acknowledged the ongoing strain covid 19 patient surges have had on hospital s ability to fully staff critical care units and other specialties alabama and mississippi have faced severe staff shortages in recent months with 2 000 fewer nurses than last year in mississippi and hundreds of vacant positions in alabama that is a challenge and it wears on people stock said on mississippi s coast singing river health system is preparing with four days of food generators pharmaceuticals linens bulk oxygen tanks and small cylinders and anything else patients and staff might need the goal is to protect patients and allow hospital operations to continue uninterrupted said randall cobb director of facilities and services but even prior to the storm some of singing river s emergency rooms are seeing hours long wait times due to bed demand covid presents a few challenges that we normally don t have during a hurricane no 1 being availability of rooms all hospitals right now are strapped cobb said so in a hurricane unless you are in a true dire emergency as are most hospitals in our state even without a hurricane there will be limited opportunity to help cobb said staff may need to triage patients to accommodate the most emergent cases and send other patients elsewhere we would have to get very creative but we re not going to turn down someone that needs life saving care cobb said we re just not going to do that contact montgomery

for several years now the air force has been thinking through the possibility of an arsenal plane a large aircraft that would carry a variety of munitions into battle but avoid direct combat here s what you need to know nevertheless the arsenal plane concept remains innovative and exciting and has the chance to solve some of the key force structure problems that wargaming and analysis have identified as the u s increasingly pushes for longer ranged air to air missiles more opportunities for separating sensor from shooter from weapons carrier will present themselves if not a battle plane then what about an arsenal plane the air force is fully aware that its fleet of stealth fighters cannot due to the need to fly in stealth configuration carry enough missiles to decisively defeat a larger force of 4th generation aircraft a rand study of several years ago noted that china could defeat a force of 5th generation fighters by expending enormous numbers of older aircraft to force the us planes to use all of their missiles thus exposing tankers and other infrastructure to attack however advances in communications and sensor integration have made it possible for tip of the spear fighters to take advantage of munitions carried by aircraft away from the fray for several years now the air force has been thinking through the possibility of an arsenal plane a large aircraft that would carry a variety of munitions into battle but avoid direct combat this is distinct from plans to equip the b 21 raider or any other bomber with anti aircraft capabilities thus turning it into a battle plane the air force and navy have also examined the prospect of developing an unmanned wingman that would carry additional missiles that an f 35 or f 22 could fire the term arsenal plane originates from naval thinking in the 1990s the united states navy repeatedly revisited the concept of an arsenal ship which would carry a large stock of land attack cruise missiles thus relieving destroyers cruisers and submarines of the need to carry such munitions themselves some argued that the arsenal ship could replace much of the punch provided by the aircraft carrier fleet of course the arsenal ship never took shape even if the idea has never quite died the arsenal plane is distinct from the aforementioned battle plane in that the platform is not intended to engage in contact with the enemy and will always operate from well behind the scenes this enables considerable freedom in thinking through appropriate platforms instead of a high end aircraft requiring stealth and other modern defenses to survive an older platform unsuited for sustained penetration of defended airspace will do rather than a b 2 b 21 or even a converted b 52 or a b 1b for example the arsenal plane could be an aircraft developed out of the c 130 hercules the latest thinking for the arsenal plane has focused on the b 52 and b 1b and the air force has already conducted some testing with respect to redesigning payload spaces in a way that could support front line combat planners have also begun to consider using the arsenal plane as a truck for air to ground munitions including potentially hypersonic weapons developing different aircraft for different arsenal missions would ease conversion problems as cargo aircraft such as the c 17 and the c 130 do not have the external hardpoints that would make them well suited to an air to air mission of course loading the aircraft with more capabilities runs the risk of overloading the plane driving up price and over complicating the platform many other problems also remain bifurcating the mission between air to air and air to ground aircraft increases maintenance costs and training costs as is the case with any increase in the number of platforms and missions moreover the bomber force including the b 52 and b 1b is already overloaded with missions b 1b readiness has fallen dramatically because of overuse finally the air force has always struggled with difficult choices between front line and support aircraft and the future of the procurement budget remains uncertain nevertheless the arsenal plane concept remains innovative and exciting and has the chance to solve some of the key force structure problems that wargaming and analysis have identified as the u s increasingly pushes for longer ranged air to air missiles more opportunities for separating sensor from shooter from weapons carrier will present themselves an opportunity to repurpose an old platform for a new mission always represents a potential for savings which both the u s air force and the u s navy should be attentive to dr robert farley a frequent contributor to tni teaches at the patterson school of diplomacy and international commerce at the university of kentucky he is the author of the battleship book and can be found at drfarls this article appeared earlier in 2019 image flickr

increasingly larger online networks of people sharing resources for finding doctors or services that will connect them to ivermectin others are simply opting for animal varieties easily obtained over the counter or online unfortunately these at home treatments have translated to a rash of poisoning cases as people accidentally overdose on the medicine made for livestock weighing thousands of pounds mark winter the director of the southeast texas poison center and a pharmacology professor at the university of texas medical branch s school of medicine said that the call volume of cases related to ivermectin has recently grown by 115 and daily call volumes are well exceeding the average some of these calls have been from parents whose children have downed easily opened tubes of fruit flavored paste meant for horses but most are from adults treating themselves the difficult part is differentiating their symptoms from that of covid 19 if they are infected winter said we can t do that over the phone and many hospitals are too overwhelmed to easily accept them it s a difficult situation but the fact that veterinary ivermectin might be causing poisonings isn t surprising to experts especially when considering the forms they come in and advice people are being given online usually one dose of ivermectin formulated for humans is given to treat severe parasitic infections like the so called river blindness named for the mass of worms that can breed in people s eyes after drinking infected water winter said a six gram tube of horse paste can contain up to 30 equivalent doses and can be difficult to accurately divide to make matters worse he found while researching information to present to texas doctors that many websites are telling people to take between one dose for two days or two doses for five days some promise to even reverse lasting effects of covid 19 infections by taking large doses of the medicine when poisoned callers phone the line the first sign is usually abdominal pain nausea vomiting or diarrhea more severe symptoms can include chest pain which is a sign of neurological issues and liver problems advice from poison centers can be life saving for people that have overdosed but winter said experts are just as susceptible to the kind of doubt and mistrust that physicians face usually the first thing we hear on a call is my child just ate this substance and i read on the internet that they are going to die he said when we tell them that their child will be fine if they follow these steps they almost always ask if we are sure while doctors may legally prescribe ivermectin to patients for purposes other than treating parasites some could be facing repercussions under certain circumstances one doctor recently gained notoriety after it was reported he was prescribing the medicine to inmates at an arkansas jail the state s medical board confirmed friday that it had opened an investigation into the doctor s actions some physicians like the one in arkansas had justified the practice of using human forms of the parasite treatment by pointing to limited trial data from the national institutes of health the agency concluded there were signs that ivermectin could eliminate cultures of covid 19 in test tubes winter said that on its face that development may make ivermectin seem like a perfectly acceptable treatment but the same result has been found with household cleaners like bleach the best prevention at this point is preventing infection which means vaccinations and wearing a mask winter said
menafn syndication bureau oil markets are renowned for rapid swings this year a price that has been in the doldrums since late 2014 has turned around to regain four years of losses now the killing of jamal khashoggi the us elections us sanctions on iran and the sino american trade war converge on november as the next crunch point for the layman to understand where prices might be headed he or she needs to appreciate the dynamics of oil pricing including its history oil markets are typified by volatility short memories and cycles they are volatile because supply and demand are highly inelastic they are stubbornly unmoveable even a large increase in price does not immediately call forth much new supply as fields take years to be found and developed and such a price increase does not reduce demand much either as people still need to drive to work ship goods and use plastics even when they buy more efficient cars the average age of the vehicle fleet 11 5 years in the us means the new models affect consumption slowly supply is also vulnerable to interruption by unexpected shocks the iraqi invasion of kuwait in 1990 the libyan revolution of 2011 venezuela s ongoing economic collapse and american sanctions on iranian oil exports in 2012 15 and again this year demand suffers in line with economic downturns such as when prices tumbled from a record 143 per barrel in june 2008 to 34 that december in the teeth of the global financial crisis short memories are combined with myopia the current oil price around 80 per barrel seems low compared to the new normal of 100 per barrel that the industry got used to in the 2011 13 period but it is high when set against the lower for longer mantra that took hold in 2014 16 or even worse the 10 per barrel reached during the asian financial crisis in 1998 during slumps investment is slashed in booms costs rise sharply as companies compete for skilled workers and equipment and venture into remote and more technically challenging projects a novel factor is some companies worry about the future of long term oil demand due to the rise of electric vehicles bp s latest outlook puts demand peak in the 2030s not far off compared to the multi decade life of a pipeline or offshore platform even the anticipation of a peak in demand could cause underinvestment now and a price spike before demand eventually falls the combination of inelastic supply and demand the long investment periods and the industry s limited view both backwards and forwards drives cyclicity except in countries where price controls prevent market adjustment or locally during a natural disaster there is never a physical shortage of oil temporary imbalances are met by accumulating or drawing down stocks in storage speculators are often blamed for price moves that do not seem to correspond to participants view of the physical market but usually the investors in paper oil are trading based on reasoned even if sometimes wrong views of future supply demand risks and macroeconomic factors nevertheless clearly unsustainable price levels too low or too high can persist for some time before prices suddenly adjust this has been evident in recent years after a period of stable high prices in 2011 13 they fell dramatically in late 2014 due to a sudden realisation of how fast us output was rising along with some negative chinese economic news in december 2016 countries from opec formed a pact with some other leading oil producers this deal saw opec countries committing to reduce production by about 4 5 percent while non opec states made smaller but still sizeable cuts along with these shortfalls unexpectedly strong global demand has tightened the market taking prices from about 45 per barrel in mid 2017 to a high of 86 in early october the narrative has thus changed again now the concern is that saudi arabia may not have enough production capacity to cover for rising demand and the growing losses from iran as us sanctions come fully into force on november 4 finally saudi arabia and its opec allies are also concerned that high prices could cause an economic slowdown and demand destruction opec s own estimates of 2018 demand have been falling since july the growing us china trade war is a further negative consequently opec members agreed in june to raise output though members differed over interpretations of how much saudi arabia has an official production capacity of 12 million barrels per day in september it pumped 10 5 million bpd increasing output since june from its agreed opec limit of 10 058 million bpd yet the khashoggi affair has cast something of a cloud over this some us politicians threatened sanctions on saudi arabia in response prominent saudi media figure turki al dakhil talked of various retaliatory measures should such sanctions be imposed raising the spectre of the 1973 oil embargo by suggesting that riyadh could cut its oil exports saudi oil minister khalid al falih promptly weighed in that his country would not use oil as a political weapon and markets have generally reacted with unconcern this is reasonable enough for now but the convergence of other conflicting factors in november promises yet

menafn syndication bureau of the 29 articles in the final statement of the recent arab league summit in saudi arabia none expressed support toward the arabs living on the iranian side of the arabian gulf despite recent incidents that show how they are being squeezed by the regime it is of course highly distasteful to have to speak in terms of race ethnicity and sectarian divisions but that is the unavoidable tone of politics in iran tehran exploits all this in the furtherance of its regional ambitions that in the case of arab residents within its borders has resulted in amnesty international s cataloging of infringements of those rights they share with all humanity that is to say their very human rights indeed recent iranian politics is a sad history of repression against minorities of all stripes living on the northern shores of the gulf while some might argue that the arab league refrained from mentioning the plight of iran s arabs out of respect to national sovereignty article 23 of the statement denounced human rights violations of the government of myanmar against the country s muslim minority showing that the league could have expressed similar support toward oppressed communities of arabic and other descent much closer to home this was a missed opportunity according to amnesty international iran s ethnic minorities including arabs azerbaijani turks baluchis kurds and turkmen have remained subject to entrenched discrimination curtailing their access to education employment adequate housing and political office the persian or farsi language remained the sole medium of instruction during primary and secondary education contributing to higher drop out rates in minority populated areas in its 2017 2018 report the organization wrote that members of minorities who spoke out against violations of their rights faced arbitrary arrest torture and other ill treatment grossly unfair trials imprisonment and the death penalty in a most recent example iran s state tv failed to mention arabs as one of the country s minorities in a children s program and when the arabs of ahwaz in the southwest protested the iranian authority s marginalization of arab origins and its efforts to erase their arab identity according to the group iran human rights monitor security forces detained 140 protesters the rights group also claimed that over the past decade ahwaz has witnessed growth in non arab migration into their residential areas with government support the aim of disrupting the demographic composition in the northeast iranian kurds found themselves taking to the streets between december 28 and january 7 to protest against the government denouncing its policy of corruption repression and martial law according to the washington kurdish institute despite the official narrative about a monolithic and ancient civilization iran is all but homogenous it is under the mullahs a vast country that is stitched together with myths that alternate between nationalism and religion with tehran using either or both to serve the repressive purposes of its government iran s duplicity between nationalism and religion has also been applied to its foreign policy azerbaijan has an overwhelmingly shia population yet tehran the self proclaimed leader of the world s shia has allied with christian armenia against the ethnically turkish azeris in iraq however iran behaves as the leader of the shia pitting the country s shia arabs against sunni arabs swinging between persian nationalism and international shiism iran has bullied communities here there and everywhere as it seeks to enforce a hegemony it has insisted on the name persian gulf for instance for the body of water where arabs form a majority of those who live on its shoreline and islands on more than one occasion iranian foreign minister javad zarif has called for the expansion of the concept of the persian gulf to include the red sea and especially to count yemen on its littoral the country where iran has been actively funding arming and training militias that have undermined local sovereignty and stability more successfully iran launched an international pr campaign that has secured the use in international circles of the name persian gulf though semantics may be a poor excuse tehran nevertheless has cited the common use of this name as an alibi for its expansion and dominance good relations between neighbors are built on mutual respect of each other s sovereignty iran however has used national chauvinism to repress ethnic minorities at home and has deployed world shiism to agitate communities in countries throughout the middle east as long as tehran fails to observe international rules and norms there is no reason why its neighbors most of whom came together in saudi arabia for the arab league summit should respect iranian sovereignty and not express solidarity with iran s oppressed minorities arab as well as those of other ethnic stock for perhaps nowhere is iran s ambition for regional prowess felt more keenly than at home where the suppression of rights for minorities is part of its revisionist rewriting of history minorities in iran after all have no place to turn to they could do with some champions abroad hussain abdul hussain is the washington bureau chief of kuwaiti daily al rai and a former visiting fellow at chatham house in

new york city new york after promising greater transparency new york governor kathy hochul announced some 12 000 more people have died from covid 19 than was reported under her disgraced predecessor former governor andrew cuomo in a statement she said the state is now reporting a total of 55 400 covid 19 deaths based on data from the centers for disease control and prevention 12 000 more than the 43 400 reported by cuomo on his last day in office we are using cdc numbers which will be consistent and so there is no opportunity for us to mask them said hochul in an interview with national public radio even with the additional 12 000 deaths new york still ranks third nationally behind california and texas in the highest number of covid 19 deaths according to reuters it is also still second in the deaths per capita remaining behind new jersey the incomplete numbers reported by cuomo focused only on confirmed deaths and excluded those who died at home and other locations however the revised count is based on death certificate data submitted to the cdc including any confirmed or suspected covid 19 deaths in any location within the state hochul stressed telling national public radio these are presumed and confirmed deaths people should know both hochul was one of the officials who questioned whether cuomo was releasing incorrect data to improve his image during the pandemic in february he admitted his office should not have withheld data on covid 19 nursing home deaths but he did not apologize a new york attorney general s report released in january criticized cuomo for undercounting coronavirus deaths in nursing homes by as much as 50 percent democrat hochul became the first female governor of new york on tuesday after serving as lieutenant governor to cuomo who resigned due to numerous sexual harassment allegations

when china launched its acclaimed reforms and opening programme in the late 1970s part of the strategy was to encourage its enterprises to explore trade and investment opportunities abroad africa was one of the natural places chinese companies set their eyes on africa was characterized by weak industrial chains poor infrastructure connectivity and high levels of penury the continent also presented less competition for chinese companies given that the few western firms with footprints in africa were more interested in resource extractions than sustainable economic partnerships four decades down the line private and state owned chinese enterprises have provided the linchpin for rapidly evolving and deepening cooperation with the african continent midway in the year 2000 the forum on china africa cooperation focac was established and nine years later beijing overtook the united states to become africa s largest trading partner in just two decades following founding of focac trade between china and africa grew twenty fold to hit us 200 billion
play and apple app stores well today the state secretary of health was in northwest arkansas for the state emergency management conference we asked him about ivermectin and about local docrsto prescribing it to patients ivermectin is not fda approved for covid 19 treatment but it is approved tore tat other conditions dr jose romero recommends though the people infected with covid 19 stick to the ones that are approved you know we know that ivmectiner is being prescribed it s the prerogative of eryve physician and patient who decide whether that s appropriate for them it can be issued theda f has already said that it s not approved for the use in covid 19 you know there are proven therapies and i would tell the public that you know if they ndee treatment they should seekon moclonal antibodies those are proven therapies they reduce hospitalizations by 70 to 80 and dr romero says getting bkac vaccinated following the cdc masking guidelines are the best ways to help red advertisement have questions about ivermectin experts have answers share copy link copy ivermectin isn t the first medicine that has garnered the hopes of curious or vaccine hesitant people as a potential treatment for covid 19 but it s the one drawing potential patients to farm supply and pet stores across the country some stores like tractor supply company and feed mills are running low on stock of veterinary medicines like ivermectin paste for horses or bottles of sheep drench as the infected or cautious try to find a cheap and easy way to fight the virus while some area doctors are prescribing the human form of the medicine that experts overwhelmingly agree could just be a placebo regional poison control centers are seeing an uptick in emergencies from people trying out barnyard cures medical experts fielding questions about the medicine aren t surprised that patients willing to take their health into their own hands aren t keen on answering questions about it dr msonthi levine a primary care physician with a private practice in beaumont texas said that the latest obsession with ivermectin is just a symptom of the american medical system that he says doctors face every day there is a long history of people being overwhelmed with so much information and being paralyzed about what to do levine said if it sounds good to us and matches what we are inclined to believe we will try it even if it goes against research patients continue to request prescriptions from levine multiple times a week and he said he even wrote for it a few times when it was first being suggested as a possible treatment but now he believes it is clear from peer reviewed research that there is no legit connection to its ability to fight the virus but he said it is as easy to convince a patient that the miracle cure they read about on the internet isn t the right answer as it is to suggest they change their diet or take a specific medicine they read bad reviews about online ivermectin follows in the footsteps of medicines like hydroxychloroquine that have become popular alternative medicines but are only a few of the different medicines that researchers or doctors have tested to see if it could impact covid 19 infections levine said the difference is they are just a few of the substances that have been promoted by popular figures in the media which usually immediately launches a wave of requests from patients getting a patient to trust expert advice even from a doctor they may know and frequently rely on can be even harder when they know a clinic down the street may easily give them what they want levine said he has a moral obligation not to prescribe something that medical research has clearly demonstrated wouldn t be beneficial to his patients i basically try to remind them that in my opinion the peer reviewed sources i go to tell me it hasn t been studied enough and it hasn t been recommended to treat this illness levine said if it won t help and could potentially harm then i have taken an oath not to do anything that could be potentially harmful for every doctor that has decided not to risk giving false hope there seems to be

air india has asked a new york court to dismiss a petition filed by britain s cairn energy for seizure of its assets to enforce usd 1 2 billion arbitral awards against the indian government saying the litigation was premature as an appeal against the arbitration award was still pending the petition by the airline which is separate to indian government s plea in a washington court seeking dismissal of cairn s lawsuit to seek confirmation of the arbitral award said the new york district court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate a mere hypothetical question or one that depends upon contingent future events that may or may not occur cairn first moved a court in the us district court for the district of columbia seeking confirmation of the arbitration award and then filed a petition in the new york court to seek declaration of air india as alter ego of the indian government and so it should be made liable to pay the usd 1 26 billion arbitral award an international arbitration tribunal in december last year set aside the levy of capital gains tax using a 2012 retrospective legislation on a 2006 reorganization of india business that cairn carried before listing it on local stock exchanges it ordered india to return the value of shares seized and sold dividend confiscated and tax refund withheld to enforce levy with india refusing to pay cairn moved courts in the us cairn s petition to confirm the award is pending in the district court for the district of columbia air india said in the august 23 petition seen by pti it went on to state that the indian government has filed before a court in the hague the seat of the international arbitration tribunal a motion to stay and a motion to dismiss the arbitral award in effect the complaint by cairn energy is a premature enforcement action dressed up as a declaratory judgment action invoking this court s federal jurisdiction to get a head start on executing the award before the d d c has had the opportunity to address the republic of india s immunity defenses and its claims that the award is not subject to enforcement under the new york convention air india said such an attempt is improper and the complaint should be dismissed it sought dismissal on three counts first because the court lacks jurisdiction to issue a declaratory judgment because the alleged controversy is not ripe second air india is immune from suit because none of the exceptions to sovereign immunity under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia applies to a premature collection proceeding of a hypothetical judgment and third the complaint which presupposes an enforceable judgment that does not exist fails to allege a cognizable cause of action the indian government had earlier this month asked the us district court for the district of columbia ddc to dismiss the case arguing that it lacks jurisdiction since the country never agreed to arbitrate tax disputes meanwhile litigation filed by new delhi in the netherlands to have the award set aside also remains pending cairn asks this court to issue a declaration that air india as alleged alter ego of will be liable on a judgment that does not and may never exist the airline said in the august 23 petition unless and until the court in the cairn confirmation action determines the threshold question of the enforceability of the award against india whether cairn can then enforce that judgment against air india under an alter ego theory is purely academic and not ripe for adjudication this comes within weeks of the government enacting a legislation to scrap the tax rule that gave the tax department power to go 50 years back and slap capital gains levies wherever ownership had changed hands overseas but business assets were in india that rule had been used to levy a cumulative of rs 1 10 lakh crore of tax on 17 entities including rs 10 247 crore on cairn the indian government and air india are defending their positions as rules for withdrawal of such tax demands are in the process of being framed one of the requirements for the dropping of the retrospective tax demands is that the parties concerned have to give an undertaking for withdrawal of all cases against the government tax department so while all this is in process the government is obligated to respond in any legal matter where there is a time bar for doing so an official explained the government in the dismissal motion filed on august 13 before dcc cited protections afforded by the us foreign sovereign immunities act of 1976 india in the filing said the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction under the fsia because india never waived its sovereign immunity and likewise never offered let alone agreed to arbitrate the present dispute with petitioners india also never clearly and unmistakably excluded judicial review or delegated exclusive competence to decide these questions to an arbitral tribunal implying that cairn couldn t satisfy any exception to sovereign immunity under the us law the filing said

benjamin franklin famously noted that in this world nothing is certain except death and taxes he never said those two certainties needed to go hand in hand that came later with the imposition of the death tax also known as the estate tax the federal death tax enacted in 1916 is levied on the transfer of the taxable estate of every decedent who is a citizen or resident of the united states it tends to fall hardest upon farmers and small business owners seeking to pass their assets to the next generation instead of cash their assets are more likely to be dominated by land livestock and equipment as a result the heirs of the deceased may have to sell large portions of what they inherited just to pay their tax bill i believe this is unfair tax policy that hurts residents of virginia s ninth congressional district throughout my time in congress and previously in the state house of delegates i have consistently supported efforts to reduce or eliminate entirely the death tax earlier this year i cosponsored h r 1712 the death tax repeal act progress was made in the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act passed by republicans in congress and signed by president trump it increased the death tax s exemption so that its burdens fall on wealthier individuals now a new threat to the ability to pass one s assets to his or her heirs looms president biden has rolled out numerous plans for turbocharging federal spending they are a cause for concern because of their wastefulness and misplaced priorities but also in how the biden administration wants to pay for them among president biden s proposals for increasing the burden on taxpayers is repealing stepped up basis and taxing capital gains at death these actions would amount to a second death tax and like the original death tax fall hardest upon family owned farms and small businesses stepped up basis allows heirs to only pay taxes on the gain in appreciation since the date of inheritance and only applies when the assets are sold thanks to this provision if a family member inherits an asset such as land or a farm that has been in the family for generations he or she is not hit with an outlandish tax bill if that asset s value has risen sharply from when it first came into the family s possession as a state delegate i once worked with two elderly gentlemen who were having their property a mountain in the ninth congressional district logged they had grown up on this property in cabins without running water or electricity the property itself came from a king s grant awarded to their families for services rendered in what i recall to be the french and indian war which ended in 1763 president biden s plan would end stepped up basis and tax the capital gains at death by the way his plan also seeks to double the current tax rate for all capital gains his plan would take a huge chunk of the value of land that had been in the families of those two gentlemen for over 250 years i know of many families in southwest virginia who would be similarly threatened by death taxes forcing the sale of their property to developers this plan found a place in the biden tax agenda despite evidence that it would reduce jobs and wages a study conducted by the accounting firm ernst young for the family business estate tax coalition found that these changes could reduce wages by 32 for every 100 in new taxes collected eliminate 80 000 jobs per year over the first ten years and eliminate 100 000 jobs per year each year after that the resulting damage to the american economy would be a 10 billion annual hit to our gross domestic product or a total of 100 billion over the next decade if enacted the repeal of stepped up basis and the imposition of capital gains taxes upon death would be a great administrative weight on the family of the deceased and for those involved in estate planning they would have to determine the growth in value of an asset since it has been in the family meaning for some landowners in southwest virginia a calculation of inflation and appreciation all the way back to the 1760s the costs imposed by a second death tax would be severe not only in monetary terms but to the idea that americans should be able to pass the benefits of their hard work onto their descendants that s too high a price to pay for president biden s big spending if you have questions concerns or comments feel free to contact my abingdon office at 276 525 1405 my christiansburg office at 540 381 5671 or website at www morgangriffith house gov morgan griffith represents the ninth district of virginia in the u s house of representatives
by devika krishna kumar and jonathan allen new orleans reuters hurricane ida plowed into louisiana from the gulf of mexico as a fierce category 4 storm on sunday lashing the coast with 150 mile per hour winds torrential downpours and pounding surf that submerged much of the shoreline under several feet of water power was knocked out sunday night to the entire new orleans metropolitan area with the failure of all eight transmission lines that deliver electricity to louisiana s largest city the utility company entergy nyse louisiana reported one transmission tower collapsed into the mississippi river according to the jefferson parish emergency management department u s president joe biden declared a major disaster in louisiana ordering federal assistance to bolster recovery efforts in more than two dozen storm stricken parishes ida slammed ashore around noon near port fourchon louisiana a hub of the gulf s offshore energy industry blasting the coast with hurricane force winds extending 50 miles 80 km out from the eye of the storm landfall came 16 years to the day after hurricane katrina one of the most catastrophic on record struck the gulf coast sunday night the sheriff s office in ascension parish reported the first known u s fatality from the storm a 60 year old man killed by a tree falling on his home near baton rouge the state capital flash flooding was reported by the national hurricane center across southeastern louisiana nearly all offshore gulf oil production was suspended and major ports along the louisiana and mississippi coasts were closed to shipping residents of the most vulnerable coastal areas were ordered to evacuate days in advance of ida those riding out the storm in their homes in new orleans less than 100 miles inland to the north braced for the toughest test yet of major upgrades to a levee system constructed following devastating floods in 2005 from katrina i almost found myself in a panic attack when news announced this was the anniversary of katrina janet rucker a lifelong new orleans resident and recently retired sales manager who took shelter in a downtown hotel with her dog deuce this is just not good for our nerves and our psyche the storm s approach forced the suspension of emergency medical services in new orleans and elsewhere across a state already reeling from a fourth wave of covid 19 infections that has strained louisiana s healthcare system for an estimated 2 450 covid 19 patients hospitalized statewide many in intensive care units evacuation was not an option a loss of generator power at the thibodaux regional health system hospital in lafourche parish southwest of new orleans forced medical workers to manually assist respirator patients with breathing while they were moved to another floor the state health department confirmed to reuters farren clark a nicholls state university professor who studied katrina s impact and was riding out the storm at his mother s home in thibodaux called the arrival of ida nerve wracking i can hear the howl of the storm getting stronger he told reuters by phone having done research on katrina it is a little bit triggering michael lewis 45 restaurant owner in nearby houma said he could see shingles blown off his roof and a downed fence through a window of his home but was unable to check the full extent of damage as the storm raged it s way too dangerous to go outside right now he said in a phone interview officials of the u s army corps of engineers said they expected the city s newly reinforced levees to hold though they said they said the flood walls could be overtopped in some places this is one of the strongest storms to make landfall here in modern times louisiana governor john bel edwards said at a news briefing hundreds of miles of new levees were built around new orleans after flooding from katrina inundated much of the low lying city especially historically black neighborhoods that monster storm claimed more than 1 800 lives edwards voiced confidence in the 14 5 billion in levee improvements since then saying they were built for this moment widespread outages power outages were widespread in the first hours of the storm with more than 1 million louisiana homes and businesses losing electricity by late sunday night according to the tracking site poweroutage us just three days after emerging as a tropical storm in the caribbean sea ida had intensified into a category 4 hurricane and swept ashore with top sustained winds of 150 miles per hour 240 km per hour the national hurricane center nhc reported as ida pushed inland past to new orleans over the next 10 hours its maximum sustained winds diminished to 105 mph ranking it as a category 1 storm on the five step saffir simpson hurricane wind scale according to the nhc palm trees trembled as rain blasted in sideways through new orleans on sunday where retiree robert ruffin 68 had evacuated with his family to a downtown hotel i thought it was safer he said it s double trouble this time because of covid inundation from ida s storm surge high surf driven by the hurricane s winds was reported to be exceeding predicted levels of 6 feet 1 8 m along parts of the coast videos posted on social media showed storm surge flooding had transformed sections of highway 90 along the louisiana and mississippi coast into a choppy river the nhc also warned of potentially catastrophic wind damage and up to 2 feet 61 cm of rainfall in some areas we re as prepared as we can be but we re worried about those levees said kirk lepine president of plaquemines parish and one of the most vulnerable areas along gulf coast the parish later issued an alert on facebook nasdaq urging residents of one area to seek higher ground after reports of an overtopped levee offshore energy operations in the region were at a virtual standstill the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee said nearly 300 offshore oil and gas platforms were evacuated cutting gulf based petroleum and production by 96 and 94 respectively
new york city new york after promising greater transparency new york governor kathy hochul announced some 12 000 more people have died from covid 19 than was reported under her disgraced predecessor former governor andrew cuomo in a statement she said the state is now reporting a total of 55 400 covid 19 deaths based on data from the centers for disease control and prevention 12 000 more than the 43 400 reported by cuomo on his last day in office we are using cdc numbers which will be consistent and so there is no opportunity for us to mask them said hochul in an interview with national public radio even with the additional 12 000 deaths new york still ranks third nationally behind california and texas in the highest number of covid 19 deaths according to reuters it is also still second in the deaths per capita remaining behind new jersey the incomplete numbers reported by cuomo focused only on confirmed deaths and excluded those who died at home and other locations however the revised count is based on death certificate data submitted to the cdc including any confirmed or suspected covid 19 deaths in any location within the state hochul stressed telling national public radio these are presumed and confirmed deaths people should know both hochul was one of the officials who questioned whether cuomo was releasing incorrect data to improve his image during the pandemic in february he admitted his office should not have withheld data on covid 19 nursing home deaths but he did not apologize a new york attorney general s report released in january criticized cuomo for undercounting coronavirus deaths in nursing homes by as much as 50 percent democrat hochul became the first female governor of new york on tuesday after serving as lieutenant governor to cuomo who resigned due to numerous sexual harassment allegations
air india asked a us court to dismiss a petition filed by uk s cairn energy for seizure of its assets air india has asked a new york court to dismiss a petition filed by britain s cairn energy for seizure of its assets to enforce 1 2 billion arbitral awards against the indian government saying the litigation was premature as an appeal against the arbitration award was still pending the petition by the airline which is separate to indian government s plea in a washington court seeking dismissal of cairn s lawsuit to seek confirmation of the arbitral award said the new york district court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate a mere hypothetical question or one that depends upon contingent future events that may or may not occur cairn first moved a court in the us district court for the district of columbia seeking confirmation of the arbitration award and then filed a petition in the new york court to seek declaration of air india as alter ego of the indian government and so it should be made liable to pay the 1 26 billion arbitral award an international arbitration tribunal in december last year set aside the levy of capital gains tax using a 2012 retrospective legislation on a 2006 reorganization of india business that cairn carried before listing it on local stock exchanges it ordered india to return the value of shares seized and sold dividend confiscated and tax refund withheld to enforce levy with india refusing to pay cairn moved courts in the us cairn s petition to confirm the award is pending in the district court for the district of columbia air india said in the august 23 petition seen by pti it went on to state that the indian government has filed before a court in the hague the seat of the international arbitration tribunal a motion to stay and

to get a head start on executing the award before the d d c has had the opportunity to address the republic of india s immunity defenses and its claims that the award is not subject to enforcement under the new york convention air india said such an attempt is improper and the complaint should be dismissed it sought dismissal on three counts first because the court lacks jurisdiction to issue a declaratory judgment because the alleged controversy is not ripe second air india is immune from suit because none of the exceptions to sovereign immunity under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia applies to a premature collection proceeding of a hypothetical judgment and third the complaint which presupposes an enforceable judgment that does not exist fails to allege a cognizable cause of action the indian government had earlier this month asked the us district court for the district of columbia ddc to dismiss the case arguing that it lacks jurisdiction since the country never agreed to arbitrate tax disputes meanwhile litigation filed by new delhi in the netherlands to have the award set aside also remains pending cairn asks this court to issue a declaration that air india as alleged alter ego of will be liable on a judgment that does not and may never exist the airline said in the august 23 petition unless and until the court in the cairn confirmation action determines the threshold question of the enforceability of the award against india whether cairn can then enforce that judgment against air india under an alter ego theory is purely academic and not ripe for adjudication this comes within weeks of the government enacting a legislation to scrap the tax rule that gave the tax department power to go 50 years back and slap capital gains levies wherever ownership had changed hands overseas but business assets were in india that rule had been used to levy a cumulative of rs 1 10 lakh crore of tax on 17 entities including rs 10 247 crore on cairn the indian government and air india are defending their positions as rules for withdrawal of such tax demands are in the process of being framed one of the requirements for the dropping of the retrospective tax demands is that the parties concerned have to give an undertaking for withdrawal of all cases against the government tax department so while all this is in process the government is obligated to respond in any legal matter where there is a time bar for doing so an official explained the government in the dismissal motion filed on august 13 before dcc cited protections afforded by the us foreign sovereign immunities act of 1976 india in the filing said the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction under the fsia because india never waived its sovereign immunity and likewise never

for the past 300 years a slow motion invasion has been unfolding under our feet year by year a plethora of invasive earthworms have been quietly burrowing their way through our forests leaf litter grasslands and backyard gardens although earthworms are beneficial for growing food research shows they are harming our forests and could potentially be contributing to climate change earthworms are not native to most of north america until about 10 000 years ago a vast ice sheet covered the northern third of the north american continent scientists think it killed off the earthworms that may have inhabited the area before the last glaciation the common earthworm lumbricus terrestris is native to western europe known to many as the canadian nightcrawler it s the earthworm most commonly used for fishing bait and likely the type of worm living in your backyard cristina sevilleja gonzalez earthworms were reintroduced to north america with the arrival of european settlers in the 18th century there are now more than 30 species of non native earthworms in canada according to michael mctavish a postdoctoral research fellow at the university of toronto specializing in the ecology of non native earthworms by physically changing the soil environment earthworms affect everything from decomposition of organic matter to nutrient cycling carbon storage how water moves through said mctavish they just kind of affect everything across the board although they re usually perceived as friendly helpers in the garden elsewhere they can be a surprisingly destructive force threatening forest diversity earthworms are ecosystem engineers meaning they play a huge role in shaping their environment normally microbes and other soil dwelling organisms such as mites nematodes millipedes and fungi break down organic matter in canadian forests they turn leaves and wood bits into soil and free up the nutrients that were once bound in organic matter in the absence of earthworms the litter layer which is composed of old leaves and detritus that has built up on the soil floor breaks down very slowly earthworms such as lumbricus terrestris pictured above quickly break down organic matter and mix different soil layers together they significantly alter the soil s compostion to the detriment of native plant and invertebrate species cristina sevilleja gonzalez when earthworms move into our forests they have the potential to rapidly change these ecosystems by devouring the leaf litter they break down plant matter in much the same way as other invertebrates but they do it much faster in essence worms speed up decomposition which can be a bad thing for ecosystems used to taking it slow small earthworm eggs are easily transported in soil or caught in tire treads helping them invade new ecosystems erin cameron when earthworms move in you have a fundamentally different soil environment said mctavish so you can get changes in ph in the texture and density and nutrient enrichment the problem is that the species that we have present in our forests are not used to those kinds of conditions according to mctavish the soil environment becomes inhospitable to native plants allowing non native plants to thrive erin cameron an environmental science professor at st mary s university in halifax who studies invasive earthworms found that earthworms cause a 50 per cent decrease in abundance in native soil invertebrates now to the great concern of climate scientists invasive earthworms are expanding their range northwards in boreal forests that have lacked native earthworms since the last ice age the boreal forest is losing carbon justine lejoly a soil scientist with the university of alberta in edmonton researching the effects of earthworms on soil carbon dynamics says the earthworms voracious appetite has serious implications for the boreal forest s capacity to store carbon the boreal is special in warmer climates the floor of a typical forest is a mix of mineral soil and organic soil in a boreal forest those components are distinct with a thick layer of rotting leaves mosses and fallen wood on top of the mineral soil dendrobaena octaedra is the most common species of earthworm found in the boreal forest the relatively small worm native to europe feeds on the forest s litter layer depleting its carbon stock erin cameron this spongy layer of leaf litter contains most of the carbon stored in the boreal soil dendrobaena octaedra the small earthworm responsible for invading most of the north american boreal is the type that loves to devour leaf litter and stay above ground releasing carbon boreal forests are known to be a very important terrestrial reservoir of carbon said lejoly if we lose that organic matter it means that there is a lot of carbon that s not going to be stored in those forests anymore the canadian boreal forest stretches from yukon to newfoundland and labrador the world s boreal forests have been largely earthworm free since the last ice age but when earthworms arrive the soil changes can release carbon and may accelerate climate change natural resources defense council lejoly estimates that only around 10 per cent of the boreal forest currently has earthworms but she projects that by 2050 most of the boreal forest will be invaded which means the boreal forest soil could potentially lose most of its carbon stock cameron modelled the potential effects of earthworms on carbon stored in the forest floor her models found that when earthworms were present the forest floor s carbon stock was reduced by around 50 to 94 per cent after 125 years but most of that reduction occurred in the first 35 to 40 years this means that boreal forests may potentially be emitting a lot more carbon in the form of carbon dioxide into the earth s atmosphere than they are absorbing already rising temperatures are releasing carbon from forests by thawing permafrost and increasing the number of forest fires second wave of invasion more recently several species of asian earthworms have made their way to the continent and they have soil scientists particularly concerned originally from korea and japan they are known as jumping worms snake worms or crazy worms named for their distinctive thrashing when disturbed they are ravaging soils throughout the u s and have crossed the border into canada mctavish fears that jumping worms pose an even greater threat than their european predecessors jumping worms have many of the same effects except that they grow larger recycle nutrients even faster and exist in dense colonies sometimes numbering more than 100 individuals per square metre of ground jumping worms are known to quickly churn the top layer of soil turning it into something that resembles coffee grounds from all the worm droppings managing the invasion invasive earthworms have been found everywhere from ontario to alaska their rapid spread across the continent is largely due to human activity earthworms left to their own devices can only spread around 10 metres per year but invasive earthworms can easily travel a couple hundred kilometres in one day by roads anglers tire treads boats and even gardeners mctavish says this means it s key to educate the public about invasive earthworms and limit the transfer of soil and earthworms between different areas for example david legros the chief naturalist at ontario s algonquin provincial park says the park has begun asking visitors going fishing to stop dumping their leftover bait the problem is there s no way of removing them from an area once they invade said cameron so any action or management really has to be done in terms of restricting introduction
for me backyard barbecues and thanksgiving dinners are similar events at both i secretly don t care much about the main course you d never know because i make all the requisite gasps and coos at all the correct times but really i m there for the sides yes i love to see turkey or burgers or turkey burgers on the menu but watch me carefully and you ll catch me loading up a plate with salads sauces potatoes and buttery vegetables all offset by a mere shred or two of the meal s putative star if i had to guess i d diagnose this behavior as a hangover from a few lost years as a vegetarian if you go

sirkingkitchen com and with the upcoming labor day holiday fast approaching i ve been dreaming of side dishes once again this time thinking about southern maine sourced foods that would be a welcome addition to any barbecue picnic or thanksgiving table here are several of my favorites mashed potatoes and vegan baked beans from dizzy birds rotisserie biddeford both 7 99 pint after i reviewed dizzy birds rotisserie a few years ago i made a habit of ordering takeout every time i passed through biddeford sometimes i d carry my meal down to mechanics park where i d watch the ever present collision prone skateboarders other times i d order items i knew would keep well in the fridge stockpiling them for future midnight snacking dishes like skin on yukon gold potatoes mashed roughly with caramelized onion infused cream 7 99 pint or sticky slow cooked white navy beans simmered in a brown sugar mustard and molasses sauce as special as the beans are the fact that they re served from a hand me down bean crock once lovingly used by owner barb peacock s mom somehow makes them taste even better savory potato kugel from ben reuben s knishery south portland 4 75 advertisement looking for a casserole like potato side that will stand up to all the jostling and abuse you can throw at it try a potato kugel you can transport this compact oniony dish down a gravel road on a unicycle and it

sauce 6 25 health salad from rose foods portland 4 serving or 15 quart on the catering menu as much as i love a barbecue i don t generally feel the same way about cole slaw often soggy and drowning in mayonnaise slaw is the one barbecue accompaniment i m most likely to leave untouched but there are exceptions rose food s health salad a fresher crisper cousin of slaw is one here carrots and purple cabbage get a crunch assist from shredded fennel an ingredient that also imparts anise flavors to dill caraway seeds and scallions it s crunchy and tart and offsets heavier dishes beautifully try it with or even on a burger sweet and sour cabbage from sichuan kitchen portland 13 another surrogate for the slaw phobic sichuan kitchen s tender umami suffused cabbage side dish gets much of its appeal from a triple whammy of soy zingy black vinegar and buzzy numbing sichuan pepper yet this isn t a side that will blow your skull off with its fiery heat instead this is an accompaniment suited to

fantastic matches nonetheless advertisement italian pasta salad from anania s variety store portland 10 99 quart another classic picnic side dish that can go horribly wrong is pasta salad but when it s made well it can transform a meal anania s gets the balance right starting with barely cooked rotini that soaks up the vinegary dressing without slumping into a starchy mess among the supple pasta

by rob moir to meet the ravages of climate change congress has introduced the ocean based climate solutions act hr 8632 the ocean covers nearly three quarters of the planet nothing has more of an impact on the climate than does the ocean about one out of every four carbon dioxide molecules emitted into the atmosphere are drawn down into the ocean sea water along our shores buffer the rise of land temperatures during the summer and the cold of temperatures during the winter the ocean fuels rainfall drives local water cycles is one with weather systems and with waters warming gives much more energy to hurricanes yet we know very little about the ocean we are not very good at making long term predictions to prepare for what s to come to increase our understanding accelerate ocean monitoring enhance data management and to better coordinate across agencies the ocean based climate solutions act features the blue globe act or the bolstering long term understanding and exploration of the great lakes oceans bays and estuaries act this bill gives noaa a stronger focus on technology advancements and adds innovative technology components to better address illegal unreported and unregulated fishing an ocean innovation prize is in the bill to catalyze the rapid development and deployment of research vessels unmanned vehicles and sensors federal agencies will be directed to develop careers in oceanic and atmospheric data collection this will result in better informed alerts necessary for navigation resource managers fishermen and the general public to forecast ocean acidification harmful algal blooms hypoxia and marine heat waves the ocean based climate solutions act features 10 billion for shovel ready restoration grants for coastlines and fisheries 3 million will go to work within 90 days and will include compensation for fishermen labor and vessel use 300 million per year for four years will provide grants to non federal entities to restore and protect fish and wildlife habitats coastal restoration work will result in tens of thousands of new jobs protecting spawning breeding and nesting nurseries are nature based climate solutions more sea grass beds salt marsh grasses seaweed forests and mangrove stands provide natural buffers that protect inland ecosystems and reduce sea level rise meanwhile reducing storm damage benefits the hospitality and tourism sector which employs over 7 million u s workers and produces 450 billion in gdp annually a good return on a 10 billion investment by the government don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free transportation is a large contributor of greenhouse gasses warming the globe bunker fuel the dirtiest fossil fuel on the planet is used by much of the global shipping fleet 800 000 tons of fuel oil sludge and other oily waste is dumped from ship bilges each year compliance with speed restrictions when in the presence of whales increases fuel efficiency and will reduce fuel costs reducing diesel emissions and electrifying operations will result in less toxic air exposure for adjacent mostly low income communities for offshore energy the bill prohibits oil gas or methane hydrate exploration on the continental shelf except for the western and central gulf of mexico planning area much of which is already riddled with wells an ambitious national offshore wind goal for the continental shelf is set at not less than 12 5 gigawatts by 2025 and not less than 30 gigawatts by 2030 offshore wind leasing and development will be allowed in american samoa guam the northern mariana islands puerto rico and the us virgin islands the ocean based climate solutions act brings together more than a dozen worthy efforts some are specific such as strengthening marine mammal conservation 5 million a year for oyster conservation restoration and management 12 5 million a year for harmful algal bloom forecasting 30 million increasing annually by 5 million to 50 million for ocean acidification research and placing a five cent excise tax on virgin plastic in manufactured single use products such as packaging no tax on medical products or personal hygiene products more broadly the u s should be party to the law of the sea convention 1982 if climate had been defined as the continuation of the oceans by other means instead of the interactions of the natural system the convention would have been the most powerful tool to force nations into action with passage of this bill we would finally be better able to negotiate international issues such as deep seabed mining arctic claims high seas and migratory fish stocks and ocean protection a tribal and indigenous communities resilience subgroup would be created in the white house and a resilience liaison position created within the department of the interior to coordinate with tribes this bill authorizes 200 million for each fiscal year 2022 2026 finally harking back to the ocean river institute s first year advancing bioregional ecosystem based management and the massachusetts ocean planning act the ocean based climate solutions act would enact into law and fund with 10

biden s mad lib bungle he s sticking to the mission even as he throws out his back on every banana peel from here to jalalabad matt purple mad lib bungle he s sticking to the mission even as he throws out his back on every banana peel from here to jalalabad the terrorist attack at kabul airport on thursday was so horrific as to summon the word unprecedented but it was nothing of the sort in fact it was hard not to be struck by a numbing sense of déjà vu there was the nature of the attack a suicide bombing pioneered as a terrorist technique by the tamil tiger rebels in sri lanka but introduced to americans by our islamist foes i remember reading for the first time about a suicide bomb back in 2001 and trying to comprehend the sheer fanaticism that could lead anyone to push that button fast forward 20 years to the supposedly more enlightened afghanistan we created and that same evil is still ripping apart the innocent there was the ghoulish disregard for human life a trademark of islamic extremists the killed were not just combat forces but evacuees men and women trying to get out of afghanistan the initial bombing was according to one account followed by a shooting as a gunman sprayed fire into the desperate crowd the attack killed more americans than any incident in afghanistan since 2011 there was the fatigues clad military man general mckenzie from centcom discussing death in the calm tones of a specialist and vowing to press on with the mission there was the media throwing it to their correspondents in doha or amman not kabul to be sure but still run by muslims so close enough there were the credentialed foreign policy gurus wearily returning to the cameras to reopen their vast stocks of delphic wisdom for public consumption some of these graybeards were on air in 2001 too being wrong about everything has in no way set back their careers and there was the hastily cobbled together presidential address joe biden s royal bungling of the afghanistan withdrawal has drawn comparisons to saigon under gerald ford but it s actually par for the course in the war on terror afghanistan and iraq have now managed to humiliate four presidents foiling their attempts at nation building transitioning surging withdrawing assassinating arming de baathifying coining and hearts and minds winning obama and trump transcended this chaos to a degree the former by focusing on his domestic agenda and the latter with his emphasis on personal drama but that chaos was still there even if it was raging half a world away biden deserves credit for trying to correct the mistakes of his predecessors by calling afghanistan a day he appears to be sticking to the mission even as he throws out his back on every banana peel from here to jalalabad but parts of his speech still sounded like they d been mad libbed by dick cheney and paul wolfowitz addressing the terrorists biden pronounced we will not forgive we will not forget we will hunt you down and make you pay he added we will respond with force and precision at our time at the place we choose and at the moment of our choosing always at the moment of our choosing these things only to discover it s the local jihad chapter that s got nothing but time if there is a difference between today and 2001 it s that our present enemy is even more brutal and determined enter isis k which is apparently what happens when isis gets on the metric system the islamic state khorasan is known both for its effectiveness and its inhumanity last year it attacked a maternity ward in kabul twenty four people were killed including mothers and infants isis k is a copycat of our last enemy isis which was masterminded by the remnants of a previous enemy saddam s baath party which emerged out of an enemy before that al qaeda in iraq which was a franchise of our original enemy al qaeda but let s not get to thinking the problem can be solved by identifying lineages and a common denominator our tunnel vision is now trained on isis k even if their focus isn t necessarily on us as with the last isis this one prefers to concentrate on its near enemies the taliban whose new regime in afghanistan is yet another instance of déjà vu and the afghani shias whom it regards as apostates also in the mix is iran which is attempting to leverage shiite fighters in afghanistan the fatemiyoun against the sunni taliban and islamic state concerns abound that the fatemiyoun could end up as a kind of afghani hezbollah a permanent instrument of iranian influence and instability again that discordant twang from memory s depths the iranians were rattling sabers with the taliban in 2001 too we even informally worked with them for a while until bush s lunkheaded axis of evil speech cast a froideur on this nascent friendliness the map of afghanistan thus has more flags than we think and that s before we even get to pakistan the gulf states anti taliban holdouts in the panjshir valley and pro democracy protests in afghani cities it looks increasingly like a post american afghanistan will be one of foreign meddling and factional war same as an american afghanistan and a pre american afghanistan same also as iraq and libya and syria and yemen and that s assuming we leave at all because the final pinch of déjà vu may be the most recognizable war hawks from both parties squawking for revenge and accusing dissenters of weakness american foreign policy has spent the last two decades at a sprint only to look around and realize that it hasn t moved at all biden is only the latest president to become stuck on a hamster wheel of folly comments are closed
on thursday night joe biden delivered himself of brief remarks about the slaughter perpetrated earlier that day by islamic terrorists at the kabul airport in afghanistan at least 170 people were murdered including 14 u s servicemen many more were injured the commentator scott johnson spoke for most candid observers i believe when he wrote at power line that the president s remarks were pathetic and stupid he gives human form to our humiliation he embodies it anyone can see that that is correct and i think fox news reporter peter doocy raised a question that was on many people s minds when near the end of biden s press conference he said this there had not been a u s service member killed in combat in afghanistan since february of 2020 you set the deadline you pulled troops out you sent troops back in and now 12 marines are dead you said the buck stops with you do you bear any responsibility for the way that things have unfolded in the last two weeks biden s answer yes but it giveth and it taketh away the strophe i bear responsibility for fundamentally all that s happened the antistrophe donald trump it was trump who made a deal with the tally bahn you see so really it s not my fault but his does anyone even the most thoroughgoing nevertrump enemy of the former president think anything like this would have happened on trump s watch there were so many horrible things about biden s cringe making press conference from the president s body language had he been supine you sense that he would have curled up into the fetal position to the gradually emerging realities that surrounded his talk at the conclusion of his prepared remarks it was time for questions biden then looked down at a piece of paper and said aloud the first person i was instructed to call on you would think his handlers would make some minimal effort to disguise their puppet s subservience and incapacity did you know that when we stole away from bagram airfield at night we left behind hundreds of millions of dollars worth of grade a military hardware including 23 a 29 combat aircraft three c 130 transport planes 33 uh 60 black hawk helicopters 170 armored humvees thousands upon thousands of rockets and grenades nearly a million rounds of 50 caliber ammunition and tens of thousands of rifles in a stroke we made the taliban the best armed radical islamic organization in the world did you know that the united states is soon to be home to tens of thousands of afghan refugees many if not most of them islamic fundamentalists did you know that in its partnership with the taliban sounds odd doesn t it the biden administration actually gave the taliban the names of americans and our afghan allies yes you read that right in a move no one can grasp politico reported u s officials in kabul gave the taliban a list of names of american citizens green card holders and afghan allies believing the taliban would allow them to enter the militant controlled outer perimeter of the city s airport lawmakers and military officials are outraged how about you

there are presently no less than 13 motorcycles available for the american market in harley davidson s grand american touring range from the electra glide to the cvo however for one reason or another the road king really stands out in this select crowd the road king line was born in 1994 with the american company behind it trying to bring back on the two wheeler some design cues of the 1960s especially when it comes to the shape of the front end since then not much has changed in terms of looks and a 2021 road king for instance described by harley as a stripped down highway legend with classic chrome styling and modern touring performance sells from 19 499 that s probably a hell of a lot less than the total price of this thing here a 2017 road glide so heavily modified that it looks to have been transported into our time from some dark harley davidson past sadly we don t know the exact price of the monstrosity as its maker russian shop box39 never tells but that s not stopping us from admiring the work the build was completed last year and aside from the light devouring black that wraps all around the body it packs a host of other changes that make it significantly different than a stock road king the wheels haven t changed size from stock but now come in a solid design probably of box39 s own making and wrapped in metzeler marathon ultra tires we get an air ride suspension to control the ride s distance from the ground and custom massive fenders of the wheels to give the build a very retro look the massive dark appearance of the build is enhanced by extended fuel tank the huge headlamp fitted up front and by the custom seat waiting at the rear the handlebar position has changed as well and there is no longer a windscreen there to protect the rider from the elements

air india has asked a new york court to dismiss a petition filed by britain s cairn energy for seizure of its assets to enforce 1 2 billion arbitral awards against the indian government saying the litigation was premature as an appeal against the arbitration award was still pending the petition by the airline which is separate from the indian government s plea in a washington court seeking dismissal of cairn s lawsuit to seek confirmation of the arbitral award lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate a mere hypothetical question or one that depends upon contingent future events that may or may not occur said the new york district court also read 1 2 bn arbitral award us court sets timelines for cairn india legal case cairn first moved a court in the us district court for the district of columbia seeking confirmation of the arbitration award and then filed a petition in the new york court to seek declaration of air india as alter ego of the indian government and so it should be made liable to pay the 1 26 billion arbitral award an international arbitration tribunal in december last year set aside the levy of capital gains tax using a 2012 retrospective legislation on a 2006 reorganisation of indian business that cairn carried before listing it on local stock exchanges it ordered india to return the value of shares seized and sold dividend confiscated and tax refund withheld to enforce levy with india refusing to pay cairn moved courts in the us cairn s petition to confirm the award is pending in the district court for the district of columbia air india said in the august 23 petition it went on to state that the indian government has filed before a court in the hague the seat of the international arbitration tribunal a motion to stay and a motion to dismiss the arbitral award in effect the complaint is a premature enforcement action dressed up as a declaratory judgment action invoking this court s federal jurisdiction to get a head start on executing the award before the d d c has had the opportunity to address the republic of india s immunity defenses and its claims that the award is not subject to enforcement under the new york convention air india said also read india asks us court to reject cairn energy s 1 2 billion suit cites sovereign immunity such an attempt is improper and the complaint should be dismissed it sought dismissal on three counts first because the court lacks jurisdiction to issue a declaratory judgment because the alleged controversy is not ripe second air india is immune from suit because none of the exceptions to sovereign immunity under the foreign sovereign immunities act applies to a premature collection proceeding of a hypothetical judgment and third the complaint which presupposes an enforceable judgment that does not exist fails to allege a cognizable cause of action the indian government had earlier this month asked the us district court for the district of columbia ddc to dismiss the case arguing that it lacks jurisdiction since the country never agreed to arbitrate tax disputes meanwhile litigation filed by new delhi in the netherlands to have the award set aside also remains pending cairn asks this court to issue a declaration that air india as alleged alter ego of will be liable on a judgment that does not and may never exist the airline said in the august 23 petition unless and until the court in the cairn confirmation action determines the threshold question of the enforceability of the award against whether cairn can then enforce that judgment against air india under an alter ego theory is purely academic and not ripe for adjudication this comes within weeks of the government enacting legislation to scrap the tax rule that gave the tax department power to go 50 years back and slap capital gains levies wherever ownership had changed hands overseas but business assets were in india that rule had been used to levy a cumulative of rs 1 10 lakh crore of tax on 17 entities including rs 10 247 crore on cairn the indian government and air india are defending their positions as rules for withdrawal of such tax demands are in the process of being framed one of the requirements for the dropping of the retrospective tax demands is that the parties concerned have to give an undertaking for withdrawal of all cases against the government tax department so while all this is in process the government is obligated to respond in any legal matter where there is a time bar for doing so an official explained the government in the dismissal motion filed on august 13 before dcc cited protections afforded by the us foreign sovereign immunities act of 1976 india in the filing said the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction under the fsia because india never waived its sovereign immunity and likewise never offered let alone agreed to arbitrate the present dispute with petitioners india also never clearly and unmistakably excluded judicial review or delegated exclusive competence to decide these questions to an arbitral tribunal implying that cairn couldn t satisfy any exception to sovereign immunity under the us law the filing said
in this week s dairy focus agriland made the trip to meet paul and matthew flanagan from the tubbertoby herd on their farm located just outside termonfeckin co louth paul his wife marguerite and children matthew thea and ella are currently milking around 90 pedigree holstein cows in a split calving system paul attended multyfarnham agricultural college from 1983 to 1984 he then worked abroad for a number of years in the uk and united states before returning home in 1987 to take over the running of the family farm when he retuned home paul took over the breeding decision increasing the use of holstein genetics paul made the decision to import a number of cows from canada with many of these cows being the start of the cows that are currently on the farm matthew complete his leaving certificate in 2018 and is currently in his third year of studying sustainable agriculture at dundalk institute of technology dkit he is currently splitting his time between the home farm and working for well known pedigree breeder thomas kelly from the monamore herd paul and matthew flanagan tubbertoby holstein the flanagan family has been on the farm since the late 1800s in paul s grandfather s time it was operated as a mixed farm with a small bit of tillage along with a few sheep and cattle that system continued until the early 1970s when paul s father moved into full time dairy farming starting with shorthorn and friesian cows commenting on this paul said he joined the irish friesian breeders association in the mid 70s and started registering pure friesian cows there has been pedigree cows on the farm since the mid 70s with the sires coming mainly from what is now progressive genetics that continued until the mid 80s when holstein genetics became available we saw the benefit of getting more milk out of cows compared to the friesian cows we started using holstein bulls that were available and began registering pedigree cows high input high output cows are turned out to grass as early as possible in spring with cows grazing during the summer months along with buffer feeding to maintain yields the land base around the yard is limited with a number of out farms used to rear replacements and for cutting silage speaking about the system operated on the farm paul said we operate a 50 50 spilt for spring and autumn calving the maximum number of cows we would milk is 95 and we do not really drop below 80 cows milking at any time the family help as much as possible but it is mainly a one man operation so the calving season is a little more spaced out this helps to reduce the workload during the calving seasons our cows are averaging between 8 500l to 9 000l with average solids of 4 fat and 3 6 protein which we are quite happy with some of the top cows in the herd are producing between 11 000l and 12 000l with heifers producing around 7 000l advertisement feeding the system operated on the farm requires high quality feed to maintain production and cow condition the flanagans try to make top quality silage with the aim of a mid 70s dry matter digestibility dmd into the 80s maize is also grown for feeding during the winter and into early spring paul said we find the maize is great for keeping condition on cows and maintaining solids during the summer months cows are offered grass along with buffer feeding cows are offered 15kg of silage along with 5kg of meal in a total mixed ration tmr cows are given a top up of concentrates in the milking parlour depending on production when grazing the cows are kept in one group but they would be spilt when housed into high and low yielders canada in the late 1980s paul made the decision to purchase and import a number of cows from canada to try and obtain some of the best genetics available at the time commenting on this he said we tried to pick some of the best cows from the best cow families with good pedigrees behind them there were not many of those types of cows available in ireland at the time there were a few in the uk but they were hard to come by the idea behind purchasing cows from canada was to try and buy in some cow families as a main stay of the herd it was a while ago now so some of those cow families are longer on the farm and have been replaced by other families we would also be looking to improve the genetic development of the cows so it is only natural that some families would fall away we would continue to buy heifers or embryos to introduce new cow families to continue the progressing of the herd tubbertoby absolute sesime she is vg88 second calver north american sires currently only holstein friesian artificial insemination ai sires are used with no beef ai or stock bulls used this is mainly to produce heifers to sell but that might change depending the new nitrate regulations and how that will affect farms commenting on the breeding paul said we are mainly using north america sires with the aim to produce highly fertile cows while maintaining production advertisement while also keeping an eye on type we want cows with good udders feet and legs we are trying to move away from the more extreme holstein and breed a more balanced medium sized cow these cows should last long on the farm and be easier to maintain manage we would not chase economic breeding index ebi but we would keep an eye on it some examples of the bulls we are using are stantons chief woodcrest king doc and siemers lambda haniko et bulls that are leaving medium sized cows with good udders and production while also keeping type we would show cows and heifers from the farm in millstreet in cork tullamore the virginia show the winter fair and balmoral in northern ireland so having cows that keep to type is important we would get the irish holstein friesian association ihfa to carry out classification on the cows and heifers it is an important part of showing and selling animals classification is an international standard for breeders with the score attached to the ancestry of the animal on their pedigree certificate joy family one of the families that the flanagans are trying to expand on the farm is the joy cow family paul purchased a heifer tubbertoby absolute joy in 2015 from a sale in the netherlands commenting on the cow matthew said she is an ex93 cow and is one of the best cows on the farm but has also produced some great cows in 2018 her daughter tubbertoby doorman joy was reserve heifer in milk champion at the emerald expo she s a 89 point cow and her daughter tubbertoby unix joy is an 88 point two year old they are the type of cow we want to bred they are powerful good milking cows that get on well in cubicles and grazing the showing of cows and heifers is something the whole family gets involved with tubbertoby absolute joy purchased in 2015 from left to right tubbertoby unix joy tubbertoby doorman joy and tubbertoby absolute joy granddaughter tubbertoby unix joy pedigrees speaking to matthew about the plan for the future of tubbertoby holstein he said if land became available i would like increase numbers to about 120 cows i want to continue to work with the pedigree cows i enjoy working with the cows and progressing the genetics within the herd i would like to modernise some of the facilities on the farm such as a new milking parlour and maybe a cubicle shed short term we want to continue breeding the more balanced medium sized cow it s not going to happen from the first cross it is going to take a few generations to achieve what we want
rome italy an italian economy undersecretary resigned following an uproar over his recommendation that a park in his hometown should be renamed after the brother of fascist dictator benito mussolini claudio durigon a member of the right of center league said in early august that his party was committed to restoring the original name of the park in latina a city of around 120 000 residents in central italy to arnaldo mussolini in 2017 the mussolini name was removed and renamed for giovanni falcone and paolo borsellino two anti mafia magistrates who were murdered by the sicilian mafia in 1992 the town of latina was founded in 1932 and is associated with mussolini that is our history that someone wanted to cancel by changing the name of that park it must return to being the mussolini park durigon told supporters at a rally following the publication of his comments center left parties that sit in the unity government which includes the league said they would seek to dissolve the government unless durigon quit durigon resigned on thursday night noting that he had erred and apologized to the families of the murdered jurists i am not and never have been a fascist he said in a statement the league is competing with other rightist parties for the top spot in opinion polls party leaders thanked durigon for resigning and said he would remain in the party

valuewalk matthew zabloski said there had been no significant changes to their views recently and their focus has remained on second quarter earnings and the apparent shifting economic environment q2 read more s p global market intelligence reviewed 2020 sustainability reports from more than 90 leading gold mines globally to conduct a year over year comparison of greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 gold output was down 5 globally compared with 2019 largely due to lockdowns imposed to curb the covid 19 pandemic the combined output from primary gold mines that accounted for around 35 of global supply in 2020 fell just over 1 from 2019 production throughput from these mines also fell around 1 from 847 million tonnes of ore processed in 2019 to 840 mt in 2020 meanwhile emissions from these operations increased less than 1 from 27 7 million tonnes of co2 equivalent or tco2e in 2019 to 27 6 mtco2e in 2020 emissions intensity averaged 0 697 tco2e per ounce of gold produced a negligible decrease year over year on a per tonne of throughput basis emissions intensity increased incrementally up less than 1 to 28 7 tco2e per thousand tonnes of ore processed analysis of 2019 data from 96 gold mines highlighted clear differences in the emissions intensity across mine types with open pit mines exhibiting a higher intensity on a per ounce of gold produced but a lower intensity on a per tonne of ore processed basis increases in emissions intensity were not uniform across mine types and jurisdictions on a per ounce basis emissions at open pit mines decreased 6 year over year but increased 13 and 5 at underground and combined operations respectively on a per tonne basis the open pit mine emissions decline was more understated at 1 while underground operation emissions decreased 5 grade key factor in shifting per ounce emissions intensity though there exists a degree of nuance within the data regarding the reasons behind the increases in emissions intensity the most important factor is the ore grade grades at open pit mines were higher year over year which contributed to the decrease in emissions intensity per ounce of gold produced throughput and total emissions were both down at open pit mines by 2 and 5 respectively however with emissions declining faster than throughput year over year the intensity per tonne of ore processed declined 1 at underground mines there was a significant decline in the grade of ore processed from an average of 3 25 grams of gold per tonne in 2019 to 2 64 g t in 2020 emissions increased by a modest 2 at those mines but with less gold produced per tonne of ore processed emissions intensity on a per ounce basis increased far more in canada where nearly 50 of production came from underground mines in 2020 a period of lockdown in april contributed as much as 23 to a drop in throughput at newmont corp s eleonore mine in quebec which is the largest underground mine in canada by 2020 output consistent with the decline in throughput emissions from the mine fell 22 year over year declining ore grade however was the bigger driver in canada at eleonore the grade at the mill was 10 lower year over year which combined with the lockdown contributed to a 46 decline in gold output in 2020 this ultimately led to a 44 increase in eleonore s emissions intensity per ounce despite a relatively flat 1 increase in emissions intensity per tonne of ore processed there was however more behind canada s overall 39 and 17 respective increases in per ounce and per tonne emissions intensities for example at meadowbank nunavut s largest gold mine the addition of the amaruq satellite contributed to increases across the board throughput rose 13 grades improved almost 6 and gold production increased 23 consistent with the increase in throughput and including trucking of additional ore 57 kilometers from the amaruq deposit to the meadowbank mill emissions were up 15 with output increasing by a greater margin than emissions meadowbank s per ounce emissions intensity decreased 7 while its per tonne intensity was up marginally at less than 2 decline in russian emissions intensity lacks clarity a global leader in emissions intensity change was russia on a per ounce basis russia s average emissions intensity was down 24 year over year certainly a 9 increase in grade was instrumental in lowering the intensity with the region s per tonne emissions intensity also inching downward year over year however grade was clearly not the only driver the largest gold miner in the country pjsc polyus led the decline in intensity actual emissions fell between 18 and 58 at four of polyus s operations including a 23 drop at its largest the olimpiada and blagodatnoye mines which report combined emissions polyus has been implementing local initiatives to reduce emissions across its operations however due to the company s revised methodology behind the calculation of scope 1 emissions it is still unknown whether actual emissions from olimpiada and blagodatnoye declined year over year with gold output slightly more than half that of top miner polyus in 2020 russia s second largest producer polymetal international plc reported an emissions increase of nearly 44 year over year largely reflecting a scaling up of operations namely at the kyzyl and varvara mines in kazakhstan throughput was up 22 and the average grade was also up with the increase in emissions outpacing the increase in gold output and ore processed the company s emissions intensities were up on both a per ounce and a per tonne basis by 37 and 18 respectively in 2020 endeavour mining plc s agbaou mine saw a 58 increase in emissions intensity in 2020 which contributed to a regional increase of around 5 in west africa grade was down 21 while additional material was mined from satellite pits located farther from the processing facilities adding to higher fuel consumption endeavour divested agbaou to dubai based allied gold corp in january 2021 barrick gold corp s kibali mine one of africa s largest gold mines saw emissions decline 18 year over year in 2020 the company commissioned a 9 mw battery support system for kibali s power grid in 2020 which stabilized power at the mine and reduced emissions additionally kibali is increasing its reliance on hydroelectric power at the mine projects that serve the dual purpose of lowering emissions while also reducing power costs low ore grades fossil fuels keep us emissions intensity high barrick s nevada operations joint venture with newmont is by far the greatest emitter in the united states the joint venture had 2020 emissions of 3 6 mtco2e a 25 increase year over year due to a rise in scope 2 emissions from electricity purchased rather than produced on site as part of their commitments to reducing emissions barrick and newmont are currently converting the mine s coal fired ts power plant to generate power from natural gas once complete the transition should eliminate around 650 000 tco2e or 24 of the site s 2020 scope 1 emissions kinross gold corp s fort knox mine in alaska further increased the u s average while kinross s data is released later than others so that 2019 data is used for this analysis emissions from the mine are already on the high side of the spectrum with a combined 418 000 tco2e in scope 1 and scope 2 emissions in 2019 a 4 decline over 2018 with a 2019 grade of 0 31 g t au however the mine has one of the lowest grades of those included in the study far below the u s average of 1 20 g t au resulting in a high amount of waste to be moved on average emissions intensity little changed year over year but change is expected despite fluctuations at many operations emissions intensities globally remained relatively stable on average in 2020 just below 33 tco2e per thousand tonnes of ore processed on a per ounce of gold produced basis falling grades and a period of lockdown in 2020 increased emissions intensities across some operations but year to year fluctuations in actual output are common particularly due to grade changes the push to reduce carbon emissions from gold mining remains at an early stage given the scale of their operations the largest producers have the largest capacity to upgrade their operations to reduce their environmental impact most of the top producers are currently upgrading facilities to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels in the transition to renewable energy sources or at the least to transition to cleaner fuels such as by shifting from coal fired plants to natural gas the top five gold producers newmont barrick gold anglogold ashanti ltd polyus and kinross accounted for 53 of the emissions evaluated in this study and 56 of the gold production each has committed to reducing emissions by 20 30 in accordance with the 2016 paris climate accord if those top five producers reduce their emissions by an average of 25 by 2030 and assuming they process a similar amount of ore as they did in 2020 emissions will decrease from 27 tco2e in 2020 to 20 tco2e in 2030 per thousand tonnes of ore processed this article was published by s p global market intelligence and not
