via facebook shapurji saklatvala 1874 1936 the first and one of only two communist members of britain s parliament his grandfather was both related to and a business partner of nusserwanji tata father of the famous jamsetji tata whose 182nd birth anniversary was recently commemorated by ratan tata saklatvala was born in bombay and spent much of his youth in jamsetji s j n tata s home as late as 1926 saklatvala felt his own father dorabji and his immediate family had been done out of a substantial part of the fortune that went to the tatas his father he wrote in a letter from that year â had to lead all his life in want and from this age 14 was dispossessed of all wealth as well as business rights in the firmâ he referred in the letter to â the most cruel wrong done to my father and through him to our future stockâ and of how his father died â after years of injustice and sufferingâ he explained how the tatas found his father a lad of 14 in 1868 when his father shapurjiâ s grandfather died â disobedient vicious and uncontrollableâ and later extended no support for the education of his younger brother beram saklatvalaâ s daughter states in her biography that he â was convinced that his uncle jamsetji tata had virtually destroyed his fatherâ and caused the de facto separation of his parents this is the background against which one should situate the otherwise remarkable trajectory of an upper class parsi moving progressively to the left once he left india hereâ s an extract from john hinnells book on the zoroastrian diaspora from the pages dealing with saklatvala â he turned the young shapurji against his own father and favoured him to the extent that his own son was jealous something which caused saklatvalla problems later on he studied at the catholic st xaviersâ collegeâ in the early years of the twentieth century he and some friends worked with a bacteriologist prof vladimir haffkine immunizing bombayâ s poor against bubonic plague haffkine had left russia to escape tsarist surveillance and it is reasonable to suppose that his socialist views influenced saklatvalla after this experience he spent time depressed in a sanatorium he joined tatas in 1901 and in 1902 began prospecting for iron and coal in central india with dorabji tata and an american he pursued this quest further than either of the tatas did sometimes to the detriment of his own health in the jungles and swampsâ and to his own future career disadvantage because of dorabjiâ s increasing jealousy more than any of his colleagues he lived among and worked with the labourers presumably out of his growing socialist convictions but certainly to their reinforcement partly for the sake of his health and partly to distance his views from those of the congress orientated tatas he was sent to the outer reaches of the tata empireâ london few books have paid due attention to the fact that in plague ridden bombay and in the jungles saklatvalla had spent what was to prove half his life working for the poor when he arrived in london in 1905 he was again depressed and ill and went to take the waters at the derbyshire spa town of matlock there he fell in love with a waitress at his hotel a year later he married elizabeth known as sally and renamed by saklatvalla as seri saklatvalla arrived in england a member of the liberal party he moved progressively to the left through the independent labour to the communist party wadsworth gives a good account of his increasing political activity and the left wing sympathies of the battersea constituency making intelligible what at first seems incredible namely the election of an indian communist as a member of the british parliament indeed he was the only communist ever to be elected to westminster he lost his seat in 1923 but regained it a year later â he undertook a visit to the soviet union which influenced him deeply but was banned by the american authorities from a parliamentary visit to the usa he was a prominent figure during the minersâ and the general strike in 1926 he was imprisoned for two months because in a speech in trafalgar square he called for the soldiers not to take up arms against the unarmed strikers when he appeared in court he refused to be bound over and so was sent to prison throughout much of his life especially after his release from prison he was subject to police surveillance and the intelligence services opened his mail even though his rallies had never been associated with violence the police often cancelled his speeches at the last minuteâ in 1927 he had an extensive national tour from karachi to calcutta to madras as well of course bombay he addressed large audiences in many cities his relations with the inc leadership were mixed generally nehru was willing to attend his lectures and on saklatvallaâ s death sent a message to the funeral relations with gandhi were much more strained saklatvalla was hostile to gandhiâ s negative views on indian industrializationâ he also objected to the way that gandhi allowed himself to be venerated gandhi had little sympathy for saklatvallaâ s marxist viewsâ what is also interesting in the context of this book are the different reactions of the parsis in india to saklatvalla in bombay the reactions of the community leaders were polarizedâ sir pheroze sethna opposed the presentation of an address to saklatvalla on his visit to the city whereas four other parsis including f k nariman supported such a presentation at a meeting in navsari saklatvallaâ was honoured by the senior of the dasturs dastur meherjirana â hinnells goes on to say that on his return from india he sought agreement from the zoroastrian association for the navjote of his children they â finally agreed to the function even though saklatvalla had married out of the community and had undergone a christian baptism while at st xavierâ s saklatvalla assured the association that he had only done this to see what it felt like and had never given up his zoroastrian religion later the same year 1927 the association also gave permission for him and his children but not his wife to be buried at brookwood the communist party praised him more on his death than in his later years when they had on occasion publicly reprimanded him for example in engaging in the â superstitionâ of his childrenâ s initiation â hinnells the zoroastrian diaspora pp 376ff saklatvala was a remarkable speaker in â œinsurgent empireâ priyamvada gopal refers to â the over 500 interventions he made in the house of commons during a relatively short but packed parliamentary careerâ in one speech to parliament on 7 november 1928 he said â there is no nation in the worldâ which has devoured more human lives and created more murders than the british nation and the british parliamentâ and of the three parsi mps in britain naoroji bhownaggree and saklatvala â saklatvallaâ hinnells writes â was the only one to call in parliament for the removal of british ruleâ with considerable thanks to sanober keshwaar
there s a direct connection between human slavery and environmental destruction slave labor is commonly used for illegal activities such as in deforestation causing massive amounts of carbon dioxide pollution kevin bales a professor of contemporary slavery at the university of nottingham finds that added to the atrocity of human slavery the practice of slavery enables almost unthinkable amounts of environmental damage slavery and carbon dioxide pollution if the 40 million slaves in the world today were united into a single country he observes that country would be the size of angola or bulgaria and it would have a gdp of 150 billion however even though it would be a small and poor country it would be the world s third largest emitter of carbon dioxide extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof here s why i know it s true says bales slave labor is typically used for illegal activities such as logging using the united nations deforestation database i calculated the amount of carbon dioxide slave based deforestation causes i found that only the united states and china are responsible for more carbon dioxide pollution than what comes about because of slave based deforestation plus other slave based practices the figure he came up with was actually so much larger than he was expecting that he redid his calculations he got the same results he still doubted his own figures so he sent his calculations to bill mckibben the climate change professor at middlebury college i told him you ve got a team that works on this kind of thing where am i wrong kckibben had his experts study bales figures they couldn t find a flaw in fact their conclusions were unanimous it s not cars or airlines that are causing the major amount of carbon dioxide pollution it s illegal slave based deforestation it isn t just deforestation slaves are frequently used to turn forest products into charcoal a process that releases still more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in addition in south asia 50 000 slave based brick kilns emit vast amounts of co2 along with other noxious and carcinogenic chemicals illegal logging illegal mining illegal fishing bales sees a particularly ugly pattern at work criminals can make huge profits using environmentally destructive practices industries where this is particularly prevalent include illegal logging illegal mining and illegal fishing since the people responsible for such activities are motivated by profit and aren t constrained by morals or the law the temptation to use unpaid labor has proven irresistible the consequences strain belief source adobe stock image as an example of the almost inconceivable results of enslaving people for illegal deforestation members of law enforcement in brazil showed bales the shallow unmarked graves in the forest where slaves were murdered and buried murdered for doing their dirty work in the amazon there are forest preserves where legal loggers can t go with their legal competition gone the illegal loggers moved in the criminal loggers logged everything of value and then before leaving murdered their slaves to ensure the slaves could never testify against them bales has also visited the gold miners in illegal gold mines in ghana where the average slave is dead within six months they die from silicosis added to the lethal chemicals involved in mining not least mercury which then saturates the local environment and the water sources of local villages environmental destruction drives indigenous and other people into extreme vulnerability criminals enslave the vulnerable and force them to commit more illegal destruction an encouraging attitude why is bales willing to spend his life working in an area so dark if we shy away from it he answers we ll never fix it bales does see a road map for fixing it we know that all of this environmental destruction and human slavery is funded by global supply chains it s a vicious cycle where criminals can make extraordinary profits while creating extraordinary misery however there s another side to this equation with any vicious cycle he points out you can reverse it and turn it into a virtuous cycle to the extent that people can look into their supply chains and not buy products that come from slave labor not only will individuals suffer less the planet will suffer less bales recommends the following 1 make clear in both law and policy the tight link between slavery and environmental destruction including bringing a slavery lens to environmental project funding many climate justice leaders are now including slavery in their research and practice likewise anti slavery leaders have recognized the inextricable tie to environmental destruction fostering this mutual and complementary interest creates a synergy and new areas for effective change 2 support projects that demonstrate how freed slaves can return to livelihood while restoring the natural world they were forced to destroy if such projects focused on reforestation they could support building new lives for ex slaves while increasing carbon sequestration and potentially generating carbon credits that would fund further reintegration reforestation projects 3 given that the ultimate destination of many of the products of slave based and environmentally destructive crime is the homes of first world consumers work to help corporations free the supply chains from both the crime of slavery and of environmental destruction

in depth research investing resources and more learn more last week we discussed how the s p asx 200 index asx xjo had just capped off its fifth week in a row of week to week gains well that venerable streak ended last week on the australian share market the asx 200 ended up in the red by friday afternoon after a dramatic week in a move perhaps obvious in hindsight some shares that have come to be perceived as lockdown winners rallied hard on friday as it became clear sydney would be facing another lockdown its first outside the northern beaches in over a year shares like kogan com ltd asx kgn afterpay ltd asx apt and temple webster group ltd asx tpw saw a big uptick in valuation by the end of the week and ended up being among the asx 200 s best performers over the whole week more on that later asx resources shares also had a great week the big miners like bhp group ltd asx bhp and rio tinto limited asx rio had strong performances bhp shares were up close to 3 last week with rio rallying a more modest 1 4 a big infrastructure deal that president joe biden announced last week may have been a catalyst here a week to forget but this strength in one niche of the market wasn t enough to prevent a loss overall for the asx 200 asx banks led the selloff as we know it s hard for the asx 200 to rise if the banks are in the red commonwealth bank of australia asx cba shares led these losses with the cba share down a nasty 4 3 to back under 100 over last week but westpac banking corp asx wbc national australia bank ltd asx nab and australia and new zealand banking group ltd asx anz were down 3 7 2 6 and 2 4 respectively but perhaps the biggest story on the asx last week was the long awaited demerger of the woolworths group ltd asx wow endeavour business this is now officially an independently listed company endeavour group ltd asx edv on the asx it s also now a straight in member of the top 50 asx companies woolworths shareholders were issued one endeavour group share for every one woolworths share owned and so far it s been a mixed story woolies shares opened 13 6 lower on thursday morning at 36 71 per share when the split became official and investors may not have ended up ahead by the end of endeavour s first week of independence after listing at 6 50 on thursday morning the endeavour share price fell to 6 07 by the end of trading and closed up for the day on friday at 6 10 how did the markets end the week not too well the asx 200 started the week out at 7 369 9 points and finished up at 7 308 points a fall of 0 84 monday gave us the worst day of the week with a hefty fall of 1 81 tuesday reversed some of these losses with a healthy gain of 1 48 but back to back losses of 0 6 and 0 32 on wednesday and thursday really set things in stone friday s 0 45 rally wasn t enough to pull the asx back into the green with the index finishing down for the whole week meanwhile the all ordinaries index asx xao also had a rather lousy week the all ords started out at 7 624 3 points and finished up at 7 578 6 points a fall of 0 6 which asx 200 shares were the biggest winners and losers time now for our most salacious segment where we look at the asx 200 s best winners and poorest losers so get the chins a wagging as we as always start with the losers worst asx 200 losers loss for the week woolworths group ltd asx wow 13 8 codan limited asx cda 8 8 nuix ltd asx nxl 8 6 mesoblast limited asx msb 6 9 woolies ended up being the worst performing asx 200 share last week with its endeavour demerger clinching the wooden spoon for the grocer but as we discussed above shareholders can t complain too much having voted for the demerger in the first place and receiving endeavour shares in the process and a demerger is one of the best reasons to have a share price fall along with shares going ex dividend apart from woolies codan was the asx 200 s worst performing share last week losing a hefty 8 8 it s not exactly obvious why codan shares fell last week but as my fool colleague james mickeboro pointed out during the week a weak gold price and some share sales from the company s ceo may not have helped asx tech share nuix wasn t swept up in the lockdown rally that some other tech shares saw it finished the week down close to 9 as well news that a search warrant was reportedly executed by the australian federal police at nuix s office might have been the reason investors were hitting the sell button again with this company pushing it to new all time lows finally mesoblast was also on investors hit lists despite no major news coming out of the medical company now with the losers out of the way let s now take a look at last week s winners best asx 200 gainers gain for the week afterpay ltd asx apt 12 8 kogan com ltd asx kgn 11 1 boral limited asx bld 8 3 adbri ltd asx abc 6 8 buy now pay later bnpl pioneer afterpay was indeed the best performing asx 200 share on the markets last week a new development with the company s not a credit card seemed to be the driving force here lockdown winner kogan was another strong performer putting on an additional 11 1 there was no major news or announcements out of kogan so perhaps it s all lockdown sentiment here construction materials company boral was also on fire last week a couple of things were going on here firstly seven group holdings ltd asx svw upped its takeover offer for boral to 7 40 per share albeit under certain circumstances secondly boral announced the sale of its north american building products business to the us company westlake chemical corporation both of these announcements seemed to have been welcomed by investors and finally fellow construction company adbri was also a beneficiary of positive investing sentiment last week there was no news or announcements out of adbri so perhaps some goodwill from the boral developments spilled over into the adbri share price a wrap of the asx 200 blue chip shares before we go here is a look at the major asx 200 blue chip shares as we commence yet another week on the asx boards and finally here is the lay of the land for some leading market indicators s p asx 200 index xjo at 7 308 points all

global share markets rebounded over the past week with us shares rising 2 7 to a new record high helped by calming words from the fed however australian shares fell 0 8 partly in delayed reaction to the previous week s falls in the us and not helped by talk of earlier rate hikes in australia and coronavirus concerns with it and materials up but falls led by health and financial stocks financial equality for women the central bank and coronavirus soap opera rolls on unfortunately but i thought i would reverse the order this week there is a great new biopic called the glorias about american feminist writer and activist gloria steinem towards the end of the film in a rally after the us 2016 election she said that one of the benefits of being old is that she can remember a time when things for women were worse and it does seem that there has been significant progress in terms of gender equality since the 1960s but there is a long way to go recognising this a few years ago bianca hartge hazelman put together the financy women s index to track the financial progress of women and the timeframe to reach gender economic equality the latest issue has just been released and while the trend is up there are many years in some areas decades to go to achieve financial equality for women update on business conditions business conditions pmis in major developed countries remained strong in june down but still very strong in the us and uk up and now very strong in europe and down and weak in japan overall its consistent with ongoing strong global growth but with momentum shifting from the now mostly open us to reopening europe source markit amp capital the sting in the tail is that price pressures remain significant as evident in strong input and output price readings but there may be some reliefas the ratio of new orders to inventories is showing signs of rolling over suggesting that production and hence inventories are catching up to demand this is evident in various other things with us auto makers production plans surging and us lumber prices down nearly 50 from this year s high source markit amp capital in australia our view on the rba s exit path from easy money remains as follows ending the term funding facility for banks this month leaving the bond yield target focussed on the april 2024 bond tapering the bond buying program from september and possibly ending the bond yield target next year ahead of a first rate hike in 2023 or maybe covid permitting in late 2022 2023 for the first rate hike now seems to have become consensus amongst economists reflecting the continuing stronger than expected recovery and in order to provide more flexibility rba governor lowe is likely to also use the july meeting to formally drop the reference to the conditions for a rate hike as being unlikely to be met until 2024 at the earliest with the more flexible wording that the conditions still seem some way off that he used in his 17th june speech in toowoomba the latest coronavirus related lockdowns and a weaker inflation spike in australia will likely keep the rba relatively cautious in july though coronavirus update it was more of the same on the coronavirus front over the last week the global downtrend in new cases continues led by developed countries and with india remaining in steep decline however the downtrend in new cases globally is showing tentative signs of bottoming out as many countries continue to see a rising trend in new cases including south africa south korea indonesia russia brazil and columbia source ourworldindata org amp capital the uk is also continuing to see a rising trend in new cases and there has also been a pick up in israel albeit from a low base with both due to the delta variant affecting mainly unvaccinated people while vaccines are not completely effective against infection particularly against the delta variant they are highly effective against hospitalisation and death which is what will be key in term of allowing a continuing reopening so far so good with deaths and hospitalisations remaining low in the uk despite the rise in new cases and this will be the key to watch going forward the problem though is that even in the uk there is still a big part of the population that has not been vaccinated let alone fully vaccinated posing a threat to the recovery until higher levels of full vaccination are reached and this is also a risk in other countries including the us and europe source ourworldindata org amp capital sydney outbreak a big concern in australia while the number of new cases remains low by global standards the expanding cluster of delta variant cases in sydney is a big concern with greater sydney the blue mountains wollongong and the central coast along with anyone who has been in greater sydney since june 21 now in a two week lockdown ideally the lockdown should have started a few days earlier when the flow of new cases was lower but at around 20 a day it s still relatively low compared to say last july when the melbourne hotspot lockdown started when new cases were already spiralling at over 60 a day or the over 600 a day when the full victorian lockdown started in august providing some confidence the lockdown will quickly work in controlling the spread of new cases and so can be limited to two weeks or so source covid19data com au cost of sydney lockdown our rough estimate is that the two week greater sydney and surrounds lockdown will cost the economy around 2bn although much of the lost economic activity will hopefully be quickly recouped upon reopening australia has had several snap lockdowns since november last year and the evidence strongly suggests that if applied early they head off a bigger problem with coronavirus and hence a much longer and far more economically damaging lockdown in the absence of course of most being vaccinated a stitch in time saves nine as the old saying goes providing they are short then the economic impact is relatively minor although still horrible for those impacted as people and businesses delay spending and economic activity which then bounces back quickly once the lockdown ends this is evident in our weekly australian economic activity tracker see the next chart which shows a rising trend in economic activity through the period of snap lockdowns since last november including a rebound recently after victoria s snap lockdown ended with greater sydney the blue mountains wollongong and the central coast having around 6 6 million people and covering about 25 of australian gdp we estimate a hit to economic activity from the lockdown of about 2 billion if it s contained to two weeks with much of that likely to be recouped upon reopening fortunately as noted above the lockdown is starting relatively early providing some confidence that it can be contained to two weeks of course the risk is greater now that we are dealing with the more virulent delta variant but so too was victoria in late may source amp capital vaccine update so far 23 of people globally and 48 in developed countries have had at least one dose of vaccine canada is now at 68 the uk at 65 the us at 54 europe at 48 and australia is at 27 the success of the vaccines continues to be evident in low new cases hospitalisations and deaths in countries with high levels of vaccination although as noted earlier the uk has had some problems source ourworldindata org amp capital australia s daily vaccination rate remains low at 0 4 of the population however with global vaccine production ramping up and more pfizer and then moderna vaccines scheduled to arrive in australia the latest federal government plan sees enough vaccines for two doses for all adults by october fingers crossed economic activity tracker our australian economic activity tracker recovered further over the last week after the hit from victoria s snap lockdown however another dip is likely in the weeks ahead reflecting the lockdown in sydney and surrounds our us tracker has now just ticked above its pre coronavirus level but the recovery in our european tracker stalled in the last week

the most recent series saw events edge ever closer to the present day focusing on prince charles and princess diana s marriage it s understood that the crown won t continue past season 6 with some claiming show creator peter morgan wishes to leave sufficient time between modern day events and their fictionalized re telling but whilst we might not see meghan markle and kate middleton on screen as the crown moves forward into the 1990s there is still plenty of heartbreak romance and drama yet to come though some expressed concerns about fans mistaking fictional events for fact suggesting the crown should have a fictional warning it s said that some members of the royal family have seen the crown now almost seven months after season 4 premiered on netflix we re preparing to delve back into the world of british royalty but when is season 5 of the crown coming out and who has joined the star studded cast you might also like first photos of elizabeth debicki as princess diana leave the

a sixth and final season of thecrownnetflix in addition to the previously announced five they tweeted excitedly before going on to share more detail from show creator peter morgan news from the palace we can confirm there will be a sixth and final season of thecrownnetflix in addition to the previously announced five july 9 2020 see more as we started to discuss the storylines for series 5 it soon became clear that in order to do justice to the richness and complexity of the story we should go back to the original plan and do six seasons peter s statement declared writer creator peter morgan as we started to discuss the storylines for series 5 it soon became clear that in order to do justice to the richness and complexity of the story we should go back to the original plan and do six seasons july 9 2020 see more so while we might have to be patient as we wait for the crown season 5 to land on netflix it seems we ll have plenty more drama to enjoy long after we ve raced through to the series finale who s joined the crown season 5 cast just as viewers have come to expect based on previous seasons the crown season 5 cast will be dramatically different from that of season 4 as the royal family members reach different life stages never is this more noticeable than in the casting of the major royal figures including the queen prince philip and princess margaret who have all been there from the very beginning in the earlier seasons doctor who star matt smith played prince philip before the role was taken over by tobias menzies however from the crown season 5 game of thrones actor jonathan pryce will be taking up the mantel as the duke of edinburgh image credit photo by vincent sandoval getty images meanwhile olivier award winner lesley manville will be taking over as princess margaret in the crown season 5 she will directly follow on from helena bonham carter who added her voice to calls for the crown to have a fictional warning as well as vanessa kirby who played margaret in seasons 1 2 and though gillian anderson was praised for her performance in the crown season 4 it s unlikely that margaret thatcher will appear in the crown series 5 image credit dom slike alamy stock photo emma corrin also won huge praise for her portrayal of princess diana in the crown season 4 but princess diana in season 5 of the crown will be played by elizabeth debicki viewers have recently seen the very first photo of elizabeth as princess diana leaving many fans disappointed by the grainy nature of the photographs the great gatsby star was spotted on set at ardverikie estate in scotland a stand in for the queen s scottish home balmoral castle here elizabeth was walking alongside two young actors who appear to be playing prince william and prince harry though with months to go until we see elizabeth s diana on screen there are sure to be many more exciting snaps to come we are so not counting this as the first look of elizabeth debicki as diana because we can count the pixels 5 2021 see more given how prominent princess diana and prince charles marriage was in season 4 it s perhaps only expected that many fans will be speculating on who will be playing charles and camilla parker bowles in season 5 olivia williams has reportedly been cast as the future duchess of cornwall whilst dominic west is rumored to be playing prince charles though this has not yet been confirmed and after speculation that the crown producers were struggling to find an actor to play prince andrew it s since been said that james murray is set to play the queen s third child in season 5 the sun reports that the cutting it actor will portray prince andrew opposite emma laird craig as sarah ferguson while trainspotting star jonny lee miller has joined the crown as john major causing quite the stir amongst royal fans john major succeeded margaret thatcher as prime minister and remained in this position until 1997 the same year that princess diana tragically passed away who will play queen elizabeth in the crown season 5 we might have got used to oscar winning actor olivia colman as queen elizabeth ii but from the crown season 5 there s a new queen in town imelda staunton perhaps best known for her role as professor dolores umbridge in the harry potter and the order of the phoenix film adaptation is stepping into olivia s shoes olivia colman previously issued a warning to imelda about her itchy wig prior to filming and imelda will be the third actor to take on this iconic role following on from olivia and claire foy image credit pictorial press ltd alamy stock photo according to the hollywood reporter after being cast as queen elizabeth ii a delighted imelda revealed she has loved watching the crown from the very start before going on to praise her predecessors as an actor it was a joy to see how both claire foy and olivia colman brought something special and unique to peter morgan s scripts i am genuinely honored to be joining such an exceptional creative team and to be taking the crown to its conclusion she declared and she certainly looks the part as netflix have recently given fans their first glimpse at imelda playing the queen a post shared by the crown thecrownnetflix a photo posted by on taking to instagram netflix shared a picture of imelda immaculately dressed in what looks to be a primrose yellow blouse as she portrays queen elizabeth the streaming giant captioned the sneak peak simply an early glimpse of our new queen elizabeth ii imelda staunton and fans were quick to comment their delight with one excitedly writing she s perfect i cannot believe it she ll totally nail this role another declared while someone else echoed this sentiment responding hair and wardrobe on point what plot points will the crown season 5 cover it s not been confirmed exactly what period of history the crown season 5 will cover the crown season 4 came to an end in 1990 following margaret thatcher s resignation and it s thought that the crown season 5 will likely move forward into the 90s during the period when john major was prime minister the early 90s would certainly make for some dramatic storylines with the queen herself describing 1992 as her annus horribilis horrible year it was then that her only daughter princess anne and her husband captain mark phillips got divorced and prince andrew and sarah ferguson duchess of york also split in november 1992 a fire also broke out at windsor castle image credit photo by tim graham photo library via getty images and while 1992 was definitely a challenging year things did not get easier as the 90s progressed prince charles and princess diana divorced and her shocking panorama interview aired in 1995 two years later in 1997 the princess of wales tragically passed away it s not known whether the crown season 5 will cover this devastating time though it s thought likely that if it does not the crown season 6 might what does the royal family think of the crown as reported by the sun royal biographer robert lacey has previously suggested that the queen herself isn t a committed watcher of the crown he supposedly claimed that whenever any of them are asked about the crown they always deny watching it and that may be because imagination can convey a truth that the facts themselves cannot the queen herself has never officially spoken out to give her opinion or address the events shown in the crown though according to hello magazine her granddaughter princess eugenie has previously described the drama as being filmed beautifully when she watched it image credit photo by chris jackson getty images it s not known what the royal family might make of the upcoming season 5 and until an official synopsis is released fans will also just have to wait and see exactly what the crown season 5 might cover though for anyone that just can t wait that long catching up on the recent kate and william anniversary documentary could be a good option for the meantime and if you want something non royal related but equally explosive find out how to watch married at first sight australia and how to watch gossip girl online via our tv guides

last weekend defence minister annegret kramp karrenbauer christian democratic union cdu expressed her fundamental confidence in germany s special forces command ksk she announced that the secretive fighting unit would not be disbanded despite a long string of far right scandals and serious weapons offences in an organization like the bundeswehr she said right wing extremists can never be ruled out in absolutely every instance even more so in the special forces she has arranged for the command to be sent back to afghanistan to secure the redeployment of german troops there by deciding to leave the ksk largely untouched the defence minister is protecting the fascist networks that have developed within the force extensive stockpiles of ammunition and explosives which are said to have been funneled toward a nationwide fascist network that recruits members from across the state and security apparatus and is preparing for a violent coup on a day x disappeared from the ksk and other special units given detailed witness statements and press research that painted a picture of a shadow army in may 2020 the defence ministry felt compelled to convene a ksk task force which was officially charged with investigating right wing extremist ties within the elite unit the task force is comprised of ksk commander markus kreitmayr germany s most senior military brass inspector general eberhard zorn as well as defence commissioner eva högl social democratic party spd in reality it served to shield the unit along with its armed parallel structures from the critical gaze of the public for example kreitmayr who was supposed to take action against those in possession of the unit s lost war materiel instead ordered an illegal ammunition amnesty under which ksk soldiers could hand over privately stashed bundeswehr stocks without fearing any consequences the public only learned of this by chance during the trial of one of the soldiers involved who maintained an underground weapons cache in march his two year sentence was suspended although criminal and military investigations are underway against the ksk commander because of the amnesty measure kreitmayr will not be suspended but will assume a new leadership position in rotation his successor as ksk head will be brigadier general ansgar meyer who currently commands the german contingent of nato s resolute support mission in afghanistan that kreitmayr s blatant attempt to obstruct justice was only the tip of the iceberg is borne out by other details that have come to light recently according to a report by redaktionsnetzwerk deutschland the possibility of returning the stolen ammunition without punishment was evidently known in the defence ministry bmvg at least since last summer the bundestag federal parliament however was not informed of this the inspector general personally deleted the relevant passage in the report to the parliamentarians according to tv news show tagesschau the working group s final report signed by inspector general zorn and published early last week now claims that more than 90 percent of the defence minister s 60 measures announced last summer have already been implemented and that comprehensive structural changes have been implemented that are effectively tantamount to a reorganization of this unit the world socialist web site commented on the alleged reform measures at the time it stated the defence minister s move is primarily a damage control operation the discredited right wing extremist force is not to be disbanded but rather organised more effectively and given more influence within the bundeswehr as a whole this assessment has since been fully confirmed for example the bundeswehr website states that exchanges of the ksk with special forces of other branches of the armed forces and the police as well as international exchange in training should be specifically promoted in the future however research by broadcaster zdf suggests that it was precisely such regular exchanges with other special forces which under the auspices of politicians benefited the development of the nationwide terrorist networks as for the grandiloquent announcement of the disbanding of a ksk company in which the right wing extremist activities were particularly comprehensively documented this turns out to be a mere regrouping on its website the bundeswehr explains that the formal dissolution of the company was not connected with the suspension and disarmament of its members but was the prelude to personnel decisions that could include transfers out of the unit or to another area of the ksk in parallel with these manoeuvres the military counterintelligence service mad which reports directly to the defence ministry also established a working focus on the ksk and was given broad powers to monitor telecommunications the ministry thus strengthened the authority under whose eyes the armed command structures had developed both robert p alias petrus a ksk soldier and administrator of the far right nord chat group and andré s alias hannibal a former ksk instructor and alleged head of the group were at least temporarily informants of the military intelligence service in 2018 mad agent and former ksk soldier peter w had to stand trial on suspicion of having warned his informant hannibal about the ongoing investigations against the latter s network at the time peter w was also acting as an official contact person for the investigating federal prosecutor general and the federal criminal police office bka in june 2020 various media outlets finally reported that eight ksk soldiers were regularly provided with information about the trial of their comrade by at least one mad agent the head of evaluation at mad had passed on internal documents from ongoing investigations to a ksk soldier who had subsequently forwarded them tagesschau reported such an approach is standard practice for a secret service whose annual report unapologetically describes its task as protecting bundeswehr soldiers in contact with suspected right wing extremists from unjustified suspicion that the ksk riddled with right wing extremists and intelligence operatives is again being deployed to afghanistan the country where it was used to torture and murder people speaks volumes the unit was the first german force to set foot on afghan soil in 2001 as part of operation enduring freedom just weeks later ksk soldiers allegedly physically abused murat kurnaz who was born and raised in bremen germany at a us airbase in kandahar province before transferring him to the torture chambers at guantánamo where he was subsequently detained without charge for five years with the knowledge of the german government american special forces who then collaborated with the ksk in processing so called capture or kill lists later reported hearing music from world war ii at the german troops debauched drinking parties significantly on 1 september outgoing ksk commander kreitmayr will take over the post of head of training at the armed forces base previously held by brigadier general georg klein klein who in turn was promoted within the armed forces base command is responsible for the bundeswehr s bloodiest war crime to date in 2009 the then bundeswehr colonel working closely with members of the ksk ordered the bombing of two tanker trucks in afghanistan s kunduz province resulting in the deaths of between 100 and 140 people including many children of primary school age as documents obtained by wikileaks later showed the operational command knew in advance that the bombing would result in numerous deaths and injuries without adequate action being taken immediately before and after the incident kramp karrenbauer s rehabilitation of the ksk sends an alarm in the face of growing social tensions the ruling layers need such forces and methods to enforce their interests abroad and at the same time to suppress growing resistance at home as early as 2017 former ksk commander and brigadier general dag baehr publicly described a ksk deployment at home as a scenario that urgently needed to be rehearsed in june 2020 a whistleblower reported that soldiers in the unit were ordered by superiors to write essays about a ksk deployment inside the country last month a former bundeswehr colonel who helped build the ksk according to a report by broadcaster zdf appeared at an anti lockdown demonstration in the capital and declared that the ksk should be sent to berlin for a change to clean things up properly

a woman passes a billboard advertising perfect diary s small stiletto heel lipstick in beijing on may 4 cosmetics firm rides home success to build overseas presence for sustainable growth perfect diary a young chinese brand that emerged from nowhere to become a cosmetics giant is putting on another makeup on the southeast asian market as domestic beauty companies look for global presence with their rising prowess in the domestic market going global is no doubt one of our important strategies for the future the overseas market is considered another fresh driver of the company s long term sustainable growth said maria wang head of the overseas market at perfect diary the guangzhou guangdong province based company sells its products in several southeast asian markets including vietnam malaysia singapore and the philippines through perfect diary s website as well as via local e commerce platforms such as shopee despite being in the market for only a year perfect diary is already ranked the largest vendor in color cosmetics on shopee in singapore and vietnam in terms of sales as at the end of may it also topped other foreign brands in the face powder category in the philippines the very reason that we first set our foot in southeast asia is that we see broad development opportunities as well as geographic advantages from here compared with the mature beauty markets in europe and the united states consumers from southeast asia have an unmet huge demand for beauty products said wang with their high acceptance of new beauty products chinese cosmetics brands will have a very good foundation in beefing up presence overseas she said according to a report on the website of market research firm mintel southeast asia is considered a hot spot for the global cosmetics industry with the support of local e commerce platforms such as lazada and shopee the beauty and cosmetics industry has been growing at an unprecedented speed sales revenue of the beauty and personal care market of southeast asia is expected to reach 304 8 billion yuan 47 1 billion in 2025 with a compound annual growth rate of 9 3 percent which will rival that of the chinese market industry experts said for chinese cosmetics brands expanding their footprint in foreign markets is not an easy task especially when western market leaders like l oreal and lvmh are dominating the beauty market globally for the planned southeast asian market expansion the biggest challenge for perfect diary is localization as consumers from various markets there have different religious beliefs and preferences to better localize in the southeast asian market the chinese company cooperated with sanrio a company that designs licenses and produces products focusing on the cute aspect of japanese popular culture to launch a series of products with cute packaging and reasonably priced products the series soon became a hit there we also developed color numbers that are more suitable for local consumers in products such as loose powder and lip gloss according to their skin color we also upgrade oil control technologies used in makeup related foundation products to better suit local demands wang said she said the company also found that local users prefer cameo brown and rose colors in lipstick natural brown in eyebrow pencils and the whitest color for powder compared with leading western brands i just feel that perfect diary s products are more suitable for the skin of asian people and it is very interesting that i first got to know the brand from my foreign friends said li chunxiao a 21 year old university student in beijing data from the general administration of customs showed that china has become the second largest cosmetics consumption market globally despite the impact of the covid 19 pandemic on various businesses china s imports of cosmetics and personal care products reached 20 25 billion last year up 29 4 percent year on year driven by such huge demand a group of local brands such as perfect diary and hangzhou zhejiang province based florasis are gaining momentum in the domestic market and began to set their sights on foreign markets in china perfect diary has become a first mover in the marketing method of dtc or direct to consumer where it cooperates with kols or key opinion leaders including charismatic influencers like lipstick king li jiaqi to sell products on social media platforms like douyin tiktok for china wechat and the little red book our highly social digitally native sales and marketing strategy works effectively our main consumer group the young consumers is more receptive to marketing through kols that they identify with wang said in southeast asia we develop a broad range of kols from tiktok and facebook as well as celebrity partners to drive viral online social marketing campaigns and rapidly build vast and loyal fan followings for our brands and products in vietnam for instance amee a popular music singer of vietnam has become a lipstick artist for perfect diary which attracted many young consumers to buy the lipstick used by the online star yatsen holding ltd the company behind seven color cosmetics and skincare brands including perfect diary made its debut on the new york stock exchange in november with a 617 million ipo in addition to perfect diary it also owns brands such as little ondine and abby s choice yatsen s fiscal report showed that total net revenues for the first quarter of this year increased 42 7 percent to 1 44 billion yuan the number of dtc customers for the first quarter increased by 11 6 percent year on year to 9 6 million growth in the quarter was driven by stellar performance of our flagship perfect diary brand as well as robust growth from little ondine abby s choice and other brands under yatsen s portfolio we are especially pleased to see increases in revenue per dtc user and gross margin driven by brand premiumization and disciplined pricing and discount policies said huang jinfeng founder chairman and ceo of yatsen building on our momentum in the first quarter we will continue to leverage our current unique window of opportunity to identify valuable brands and businesses to further enrich our portfolio and invest in critical research and development and infrastructure capabilities to sustain our competitive advantage over the long term he said in terms of globalization perfect diary alongside with its parent company yatsen are also striving to tap into the high end market abroad yatsen has acquired galenic an iconic skincare brand under french pharmaceutical and dermocosmetic group pierre fabre in october last year in march this year yatsen acquired eve lom a skincare brand from uk private equity firm manzanita capital founded in 1985 by the renowned facialist eve lom the brand launched a series of skincare products globally through the tie up with eve lom the company hopes to enrich its global brand building capabilities and product offerings said huang in an announcement hu qimu a researcher from the china digital economy institute said owing to the impact of the epidemic the vitality of some foreign industries has not yet recovered so the coming three to five years will be a good opportunity for domestic brands to enter overseas markets
as the economy starts to fully open there are some glaring issues that are being exposed first there is still a deep crisis in housing on the affordability front the fed in partnership with big banks buying up properties is causing major market disruptions that are pushing out regular first time home buyers aka younger americans then you add the massive juicing of student loan debt where college costs have skyrocketed so many young americans already have a mountain of debt before their first job so it is no surprise then that half of young adults are living at home and then you have many americans deciding to opt for other work or quitting given the low wage economy that has created a near permanent underclass in this country but wait isn t the stock market near a record high and real estate as well first half of americans do not own one single stock second as we just mentioned those benefitting by higher home prices are largely baby boomers and hedge funds that are buying up properties to rent out to the new serfdom class of america younger workers half of young adults living at home the percentage of young adults living at home today is even higher than it was during the great depression this has large down stream impacts for example household formation is a big deal in economics because when someone starts a household they usually buy big ticket items refrigerators couches beds televisions etc so when you stunt this part of the economy the implications are large in many areas you also have the issue of restricting the natural flow of the market right now the market is juiced on easy money and this easy money comes in the form of low interest rates wall street is loving this and some of the unintended consequences are hedge funds buying up tons of properties across the country trying to chase yield this blocks out first time home buyers then you have baby boomers refinancing their homes and essentially jacking up their portfolios but many were already in a comfortable position the end result is young americans cannot compete since they have yet to accumulate any significant amount of wealth and the juicing apparatus is set to reward those who already had these asset classes it is also causing some interesting family dynamics in expensive metro areas children are now simply quietly waiting for their parents to die so they can finally own a home when they look at their balance sheet that is the only way they are going to enter the real estate market as an owner parents try to blame avocado toast and starbucks but the reality is the two income trap is a very real thing and many of these people bought a home with one income and a blue collar job something that is virtually impossible today in many markets so it probably is no surprise that crypto and robinhood are extremely popular since people do not want to dollar cost average for 30 years for a nice nest egg and would rather swing for the fences in the hope they can pull themselves out of the gen z and millennial wealth trap now what is wrong with living at home nothing really but when you look at the data most are not opting to live at home it is done because rents and buying a home are out of reach simply looking at the stock market and real estate prices does not signal a healthy economy we have some serious issues ahead including inflation cutting into purchasing power for the moment we will continue to see half of young americans living at home
simon cowell and america s got talent pranked sofia vergara into believing that she shot her fellow judge with an arrow after judging for the first time last season vergara has been notably petrified of danger acts on the tuesday june 22 episode of agt cowell decided to prank her by enlisting former contestants ryan and amberlynn stock previously during the season 11 live shows amberlynn accidentally shot ryan with a crossbow during a stunt gone wrong i don t know you guys but i ve heard the stories vergara said before ryan reminded her of their previous failed performance i was shot in the neck with a flaming arrow ryan told the judges of the incident their prank audition began with crossbow stunts one of the most impressive tricks was when amberlynn successfully shot an arrow through a balloon that ryan held with his mouth all while she was blindfolded the couple then invited cowell and vergara to the stage to participate in a stunt of their own vergara was blindfolded and brought to the crossbow so amberlynn could help her attempt to shoot an arrow above cowell s head while she was getting ready the agt production team stepped in to attach a fake prop arrow to cowell s chest along with fake blood on his shirt vergara released the trigger for the unloaded crossbow and the crowd played along and gasped she took off her blindfold to see cowell on the ground acting like he was in pain and had been shot while host terry crews ran to him and yelled for a medic vergara was visibly in shock seconds later cowell told crews to bring vergara to him and then he whispered to her i got you i m alive though the actress was seemingly upset by the prank she was also simultaneously relieved that she did not actually injure cowell the segment concluded with a promise from vergara to cowell you know i m colombian and we get revenge watch the wild moment below
our minister of agriculture is alhaji muhammad nanono from kano state the minister of state for that ministry is alhaji mustapha baba shehuri from borno state you are wondering why the two of them come from the far north where else do you have farmers in nigeria except in the north east and the north west if you sincerely desire an answer to that question you will need to ask your president muhammadu buhari my interest in discussing that ministry however is not the bigness of the babanriga sweeping its floor and its purse i am interested in how between those two gentlemen the agric ministry became ministry of religious affairs the ministry of agriculture under them recently built a n30 million mosque for a community in borno state and they justified it as being appropriate in all ramifications they said they built the mosque for livestock farmers displaced by boko haram so how about farmers displaced by bandits in benue niger zamfara and those sacked by herdsmen in oyo if you are as troublesome as i am you are likely to ask more questions the mission and mandate of the federal ministry of agriculture is stated on its website the ministry says it has the mandate to ensure food security in crop livestock and fisheries stimulate agricultural employment and services promote the production and supply of raw materials to agro industries provide markets for the products of the industrial sector generate foreign exchange and aid rural socio economic development i can t see praise and worship here but that is what the ministry did with my money and has proceeded to tell me and all others who may not like what it did to shut up the news of this act of worship broke a few weeks ago i have waited to hear or read of a rebuke from the person who employed those who did it it would appear that a rebuke would come from the villa the day the sun rises from the west the gentlemen who did it have even moved on to other things like tracing grazing routes and cow roads and things like that i have waited to hear custodians of faith from the far north repudiating that expenditure as a sinful act but there has not been one voice of reason from that pious zone on that misbehaviour there is inverted spirituality here the elite in that part of the country use religion to worship their politics and inanities but i am a muslim so why am i wailing here where i come from no matter what religion we profess we see warts as intrusions into our beauty we slam acts like this as indefensible steps in governmental misconduct that is perhaps why former president goodluck jonathan a few days ago described western nigeria as the only part of nigeria that has been able to manage religion and development very well why would a religious nation see nothing wrong in using filthiness to water the flowers of piety even the direct victims of this baldness of sense in governance applauded it maybe we should just keep quiet and pretend that it is normal for the ministry of agriculture to leave grains and tubers and start planting mosques and churches here and there an american wrote that without relentless scrutiny the government will misbehave the rational must agree with that point of view nigeria is right in the eye of a food crisis yet our federal government through its ministry of agriculture is working furiously to address hunger by building worship centers our country is officially recognized by the united nations as a famine country there is trouble everywhere you turn in the land and we all know it the world food programme once stressed that by the time a famine is declared it is too late it means people are already dying of hunger we know this is true with us from the north to the south yet we have a government that is drooling behind cows and planting prayers with money meant for farm works farmers loiter around their homes in nigeria because pampered bandits and terrorists have chased them out of their farms there is therefore a pandemic of hunger in the country with only the very rich inoculated against it by the system on december 10 1948 the general assembly of the united nations passed resolution 217 a iii through which it declared the right to food as a universal human right yet as i write this 73 years after that declaration the figure from the world body exhibits a nigeria in the throes of starvation the un has stated that as many as 5 1 million people in north east of nigeria alone faced starvation which would happen between june and august 2021 yet it is in that very north east that the government is misbehaving applying scarce money to fund faith there is a country called venezuela if anyone is in doubt of where a mismanaged country is headed that is the current example a journalist s account of what that country has managed to become is sobering most venezuelans eat fewer than two meals a day people awaken late in the morning so they can skip breakfast and go directly to lunch water scarcity has made us bathe in nearby rivers water plants are not working to capacity all of this speaks eloquently to the national mismanagement of resources bloomberg also has an example she s crying and she s furious both she and her husband have lost their jobs she explains in a rapid fire staccato and so she had been doing hairdressing work to help make ends meet that too ended when she decided to sell her scissors and blow dryer to pay some bills the bread for the world institute has an elegant description of venezuela s tragedy the nation s economy and political structure collapsed even though it possesses the world s largest known petroleum reserves more than 5 million people have now fled the country and an estimated 91 percent of those who remain live in poverty nearly a third of all venezuelans more than 9 million people are food insecure or malnourished in venezuela traders set prices and sell in american dollars because the country s local currency the bolivar is worth less than the wrapper on sweets but any normal nigerian would read his country in the venezuelan horrid story we are there already during the last sallah i was to buy crates of coca cola and fanta in a shopping mall but the sellers asked me to choose one of the two products you can t buy both the cashier told me i didn t understand i asked why there is a scarcity of these products someone whispered to me the picture got clearer this last saturday an alarmed shopper photographed and posted online what he saw on a fruit juice shelf in a popular supermarket dear customer kindly note that you can only buy 2pcs two pieces of juice per customer due to low stocks of juices everything takes us back to the structure of nigeria there is nothing you won t see in a structurally defective country what is the business of the federal government intruding into building worship houses someone in kano would wonder why anyone would be wasting his time writing about this he would say it is spiritual normal and politically correct and makes a lot of sense to embrace religion and abandon farming but where i come from we say what is not good is bad a ministry of religious affairs building a worship house is within its mandate a ministry of agriculture declaring its building of a worship centre as appropriate is aberrant in a nigeria rebuilt to its original shape there won t be an overfed federal government itchy to misapply resources that is why the south is loud and insistent on federalism as designed by its authors but the political north would rather protect what they see as their advantage in the current setup is that why the two ministers in the agric ministry are northerners what is so special about that ministry that it has to be cocooned in the bed chamber of the north someone said the elite of the north are already sculpturing restructuring in the image that suits their greed they think the south is a fool forever they want the beat of death to sound on you read a former nassarawa state governor abdullahi adamu who would rather see the southern demand for sanity in this federation as separatist he was in the news on sunday lambasting southern governors he said by making structural demands of the federation the southern governors are sounding like a broken record he then for emphasis proceeded to ask his interviewer you know what a broken record does it cracks he said each of the governors is under an oath of loyalty and of preservation of the sovereignty of this country he said that means that each of them is duty bound to stay away from any act or word that has the tendency to be perceived as being separatists what else have the governors done beyond banning trekking of people from the north to the south grazing cows and spreading devastation death rape and tears but adamu like his other people would rather invoke the right of the trekkers over the customary and legal rights of the land owners he even issued threats he said these governors know the constitution and they know that every nigerian has the right of movement association and the right to pursue legitimate goals however if these governors are saying no to cattle routes and open grazing what are the alternatives that they have provided if northern governors come together and take a position what will happen what right have you to tell nigerians not to move freely if northern groups also say no to southern businesses in their domain how will that end up there is a limit not that we can t talk we have the capacity to do more but what we won t take lightly is for any part of this country to think that they have a louder voice that is not true when the north starts talking maybe there will be sense if we want this country to stay on we will interesting adamu said when the north starts talking maybe there will be sense but that is exactly what the south is asking the north to do come out and talk and let nigeria have sense a sensible nigeria will work well for all it will not defend the right of some people to suffering to trekking barefooted from kaura namoda to katsina ala and down to kara market in lagos a nigeria with sense will not load a federal ministry with persons from a part of the country to enable crass misbehaviour to fester it won t adamu should lead his brothers to come out and talk keeping quiet and manipulating one part of the oppressed against another will expire soon and when that happens it will be too late to raise a hand and say excuse me sir i have something to say you should not miss these headlines from nigerian tribune we have not had water supply in months abeokuta residents in spite of the huge investment in the water sector by the government and international organisations

this article is more than 2 years old getty images wow talk about a retail double whammy headache that turned miserable first the workers quit and then the may pce personal consumption expenditure index hit its biggest inflationary increase in 29 years the department of commerce released their pce numbers friday morning and the index hit 3 4 excluding food and energy after rising 3 1 in april clearly from the trending index inflation is at hand but is it transitory as the government says federal reserve chairman jerome powell told a congressional oversight committee that inflation was running higher than anticipated but it will prove to be temporary chairman powell said that a pretty substantial part or perhaps all of the overshoot in inflation comes from categories that are directly affected by the reopening of the economy when the surging pce increase was announced the stock market was probably concerned for about a minute before it reacted with a yawn the tepid market response was largely because the inflation number was anticipated and the month to month increase was not so bad however within all the delivered data they did seem to quietly overlook that consumer spending was flat in may and that personal income has also declined by 2 these important numbers remain of concern for retailers especially when they see a slow down of spending in a rising economy with new inbound inventory arriving to catch anticipated sales the double whammy headache began when consumers started rolling into retail s front door while workers started aggressively rolling out the back the labor department released their april turnover numbers on june 8th and the actual number of quits in the retail sector topped the job loser list with a huge percentage increase all totaled about 4 million people quit in april and of them 649 000 were employed in retail which was the largest number for the sector in about 20 years thinking back a few months wasn t the paycheck protection program ppp supposed to preserve retail jobs during covid now with reasonable abatement at hand workers are leaving on their own some employees have said that they were challenged by dealing with customers or simply too stressed to continue while others left their jobs to seek new opportunities because they felt it was time to self graduate from the retail environment the troubling punch line for this issue is that retail is considered a bell weather industry and one that should be leading america s recovery from the pandemic however the data indicates that retail is still 419 000 jobs behind the more normal april 2019 levels and that is of concern some blame the extra unemployment benefits that are considered to be overly generous but perhaps in an awkward degree of confirmation the n y times commissioned an online research survey that actually showed 52 of those polled wanted the extra benefits to end immediately in order to get employment levels up to speed retailers will need to pay their employees more which many indicate is a good thing and it is a reasonable assumption that once basic wages go up they won t come down couple that with higher inventory costs and retail america could easily tip the scale towards some more serious inflation remember all this is happening in plain sight as the government continues to tell everyone that the inflationary condition remains transitory hopes to the contrary are pinned to data points like the newly lowered commodity price of lumber simply because lower lumber prices are presumed to be a symbol that all commodity prices will settle down after a few very minor bumps in the road the constant inflation or transitory drumbeat enhanced by the media is somewhat reminiscent of the tv weatherman who predicted the weather from an office with no windows asked how he could possibly predict without looking out the window he said i use radar and computer model simulations and it tells me everything i need to know on my last visit to his weather office it was a sunny day and the weatherman forecast little chance of rain however on the way home i ran into a torrential thunderstorm and pulled off the road sitting in the pouring rain with thunder and lightning all around i called the weatherman in his windowless office and said might be a good idea to stick your head out the window from time to time the concern about reading all these data points is that some government officials and tv pundits are attempting to predict the economic weather without looking outside their window or even walking down main street usa all they have to do is see all the retail stores that still remain boarded up or try to buy something that costs more than it used to instead pundits are mixing up the conversation by calling america the ation nation they predict everything from inflation to deflation to stagnation as one ation rises in media popularity like inflation other analysts predict a different one could rear its treacherous head like trying to make the case for deflation deflation is interesting to discuss because it seems so unlikely and could only occur if the value of inflation goes below zero it s really hard to imagine any possibility for that theory when we know that our demand right now is exceeding supply which is causing prices to rise but what if the demand has been heightened by the many pandemic months of non spending coupled with the extra cash that the biden administration has pumped into the system and what if supply was also limited by the same set of circumstances economists tend to look at this scenario and wonder if the cash in the economy is simply of a lesser intrinsic value and then the overall valuations in the stock market would be out of sync with the actual economy which could be evident if demand levels off and supply exceeds demand thus depressing earnings in that case the ability for the fed to make adjustments becomes much harder and prices will suddenly fall in a dramatic fashion causing stock markets to tumble as an example it remains extremely difficult in this economy to grit your teeth and pay 1 million for a house that you know is only worth 600 000 with housing supplies limited and mortgage rates artificially low inflation allows the dollar to buy a lesser property for significantly more cash in the same scenario if more homes become available and demand drops along with the value of the dollar then the 1 million that you just paid might only be worth 600 000 and that s essentially deflation in a nutshell talking with fashion retailers they clearly indicate that costs are rising at a rapid rate and they don t expect prices to drop any time soon last year the price of cotton was 63 per pound and today it s 86 per pound which is 36 higher cost of dye stuffs have also increased and the cost of knitting and weaving raw material has increased as well the cost of labor is up the cost of packaging is up and the cost of shipping is also way up at fashion retail it is also difficult to get workers for a myriad of reasons plus they are also quitting now as the data indicates no matter how you look at it the retail double headache conundrum is in play and the big boxes are watching their inventory to sales ratios with a careful eye factoring for inflation larger retailers have to increase their lower cost assortments just to keep their overall inventory in line with sales and to fill their space smaller retailers are forced to do more with less and while all this is going on consumer spending just flattened and that could easily roll backwards spiking inventory and lowering sales the issue extends to the restaurant business as well where some re openings have stalled because managers can t get enough workers one neighborhood restaurant has delayed reopening until september because they need 45 people to run their mid size operation and they can t fill the slots for restaurants already open food prices are on the rise and drink sizes have been shrinking all in an ongoing effort to cover costs better restaurants are pushing steak for two to help mask the price of a steak for one and martini bars have been forced by savvy customers to raise their martini price to get the regular size glass in pre covid times a good martini was 15 then it went to 18 and some in the new york s tony hamptons have pumped the price up to 22 to top it off new york s incredible hot pastrami sandwich at katz s deli is now 24 95 and you have to ask yourself are these just rising prices or is our dollar worth less the bottom line for the inflation watchers is that prominent democrat harvard economist and former treasury secretary larry summers is likely correct and federal officials who could better control the rise of inflation might want to stop hiding in the transitory sand and like the windowless weatherman start looking outside for an hourly employee on a fixed wage who is not invested in the stock market everything just costs more right now inflation no matter how you translate it or try to explain the word is a genuine risk to the american economy and it s hitting hard on main street right now a recent quote from mr summers bears revisiting we are printing money we are creating government bonds we are borrowing on unprecedented scales and those are things that surely create more of a risk of a sharp dollar decline than we had before and sharp dollar declines are much more likely to translate themselves into inflation than they were historically will rogers the american

reduced to 4 46 from 4 50 the analyst continues to forecast earnings will fall by circa 20 in fy22 this is based on the assumption that like for like lfl sales growth turns negative gross margins ease

photograph by hildegarde decades in the making with a cast of characters including investors activists and international bureaucrats the story of esg has all the hallmarks of a classic coming of age tale what started out as a way to measure the environmental social and governance performance of a company for the purposes of gauging risk is now a major force driving business strategy the gangly teenager in the corner that few took notice of is now moving to center stage indeed 2020 was a big year for esg data research firm morningstar identified 253 investment funds that switched to an esg focus during the year 87 of them rebranding in the process in the fourth quarter of 2020 esg funds accounted for 100 billion us 120 billion of new money have we reached a plot point that moment in a drama when the action takes a turn the focus for some is on the limits of esg and the e in particular how much can really be achieved by voluntary disclosure it is possible that the pace of change on environmental issues lags too far behind the onward march of our degrading biosphere worse still skeptics say companies may just be hiding behind the moniker of esg the naysayers warn that the movement is misaligned with society s goals because it will seem like a box ticking communications exercise and that it is distracting companies from taking more meaningful action according to tariq fancy the former sustainable investing cio at blackrock the world s biggest asset manager overseeing around 7 trillion as quoted in the guardian in many cases it s cheaper and easier to market yourself as green do the long tail work of actually improving your sustainability profile that s expensive and if there is no penalty from the government in the form of a carbon tax or anything else then this market failure is going to persist the problem stems from the definition of esg itself kenneth pucker advisory director at berkshire partners and former coo of timberland wrote in the harvard business review that reporting is not a proxy for progress and argued that society needs to move far beyond the current system of voluntary disclosures and toward changes in regulations investment incentives and mindsets to help establish the scene for that next act it helps to understand the backstory a quick history socially responsible investing sri emerged from social movements in the 1970s when groups such as the quakers pioneered the notion that one could connect the dots between morals and money during the 1980s social movements drove awareness of business s shortcomings calling out companies that helped prop up the apartheid regime in south africa or contributed to environmental degradation and human slavery corporate social responsibility csr became the shorthand used at the united nations and elsewhere to signal to institutional investors that due diligence had become more comprehensive this led to the idea of materiality what is it that businesses do or carry on their balance sheets that is going to be relevant to investors esg is the next iteration expanding the definition of what is material to include a host of nonfinancial concerns in 2004 former un secretary general kofi annan wrote to more than 50 ceos of major financial institutions inviting them to join a un led initiative to find ways to integrate esg into capital markets two key reports were published making the case that embedding esg factors into investing made good business sense and would lead to better outcomes for societies demonstrating that esg issues matter for financial valuation those reports paved the way for the launch of the principles for responsible investment pri in 2006 at the new york stock exchange today the pri brings together more than 1 600 members representing in excess of 70 trillion in assets under management as jérôme tagger ceo of preventable surprises and employee number two at pri recalled the smart tactical thing that the pri did was to go to the top of the food chain which is the pension funds and asset owners and ask them to make esg investments a market requirement and because the bar to become a pri signatory is fairly low everybody becomes a pri signatory over time tools and methods once the un had named the field made the case and created a space for engagement it was time for the hard work of developing the how of responsible investment how to gather the data how to make sense of it what tools to use all of these were early challenges that persist to this day esg integration is predicated on the idea that if esg is material then it will drive investment decision making said tagger but esg is mostly not material materiality does not account for negative externalities that however is now up for debate he noted that the european commission is working on defining the idea of double materiality that is what s material for the company the value of its oil reserves for example and what s material for the rest of the world reducing carbon emissions for example or eliminating modern slavery indeed greater transparency with respect to material esg issues will increasingly affect asset values and access to capital in high risk sectors according to the moody s global esg outlook for 2021 a growing landscape of sustainability standards and disclosure requirements through the financial and corporate systems will expose financial flows to greater scrutiny and oversight the report said we expect this to start having greater influence on investment decisions at all levels from banks to asset managers to consumers for now there is no transparency in how rating organizations compile esg scores making it harder for investors to compare esg scores or understand how they are calculated this opens a pandora s box of variables which makes the assessment exercise complicated esg ratings providers use their own unique methods and companies are assessed on the basis of the data they provide and what their peers are doing for now there is no transparency in how rating organizations compile esg scores making it harder for investors to compare esg scores or understand how they are calculated take the esg scores created by refinitiv for example mining company glencore has one of the top five esg scores in the ftse financial times stock exchange 100 that score is based on self reported data from glencore and the more data glencore produces compared with its peers the better its ranking or consider uk fashion retailer boohoo which earned a double a esg rating from us finance company msci despite this seeming stamp of approval last year it was hit by a labor relations scandal related to poor pay and working conditions in a recent article in usa today fancy wrote in truth sustainable investing boils down to little more than marketing hype pr spin and disingenuous promises from the investment community existing mutual funds are cynically branded as green with no discernible change to the fund itself or its underlying strategies another critic is ralph thurm cofounder of r3 0 a nonprofit sustainability platform who wrote in a recent article that the current ratings only tell us who is best in class of those that say that they became less bad future perfecting we re back at the plot point in the past esg had been a box ticking exercise but it didn t practically have implications for investment decision making and managing investments said rupesh madlani cofounder of global sustainable capital management a dedicated impact investment asset manager based in london now it s becoming more than that a proxy for how markets and societies are changing and how concepts of valuation are adapting to those changes in that light we can see clear progress the e was really well understood but what wasn t so well understood was the s and the g social factors are much better appreciated and understood today i think the understanding of g has also improved in the past trying to assess terms of reference or types of committees or incentive structures was not easily quantified and appreciated said madlani as the field matures concerted efforts are underway particularly in the eu to create regulatory arrangements that will crack down on greenwashing to promote more transparency to harmonize classification of what s green and what s not and ultimately to direct more capital flows toward the delivery of the european green deal s agenda to tackle climate change the eu sustainable finance disclosure regulation took effect in march and it requires financial institutions to disclose how they assess sustainability risks the hope is that these regulations will improve transparency and crack down on greenwashing products labeled as esg compliant will have to provide proof to back up their claims get the strategy business newsletter delivered to your inbox sample email email address similar efforts are afoot globally china s central bank governor recently said that china was working with the eu to push for greater convergence of taxonomies of green finance and investment and the us securities and exchange commission is currently drawing up plans for esg oversight but the bigger question the one that fancy and other esg critics are focused on is still unanswered the original goal of esg scrutiny from an investor s standpoint was to help manage financial risk not to promote long term sustainability goals so if and when esg reporting is standardized will it actually promote a more sustainable future for generations to come or just give investors more oversight of their risks there s increasingly an understanding that all these issues need to be regulated and much of our future hinges on our capacity to agree on this develop the right governance and for investors and companies not to be in the way of these changes tagger said right now esg is still used as a risk management tool and it is hampered by a lack of common standards which leaves it wide open to be instrumentalized as greenwash it is not designed to deliver a sustainable economy and society even though many investors and society at large hold this expectation but hopeful signs hint that we may be moving toward agreeing on a new globally accepted framework for sustainability reporting a critical mass of standard setting organizations have rallied behind a world economic forum led endorsement of the international financial reporting standards ifrs foundation s work in this area asset managers will continue to moan about the exponential increase in paperwork but if everyone with a stake in the investment community rallied around a single standard it would be a huge step a new potentially transformative star is born author profile

dubai it is the 10 million and over homes that are recording some of the biggest sales activity in dubai s property market since 2015 if this trend continues and chances are that they will it could extend itself for the better part of this decade according to a new update from knight frank the consultancy if there were 19 deals in the whole of 2020 in the range of 10 million and above there were already 22 such between january and may this year and estate agents are talking about ever increasing interest for pricey homes on the palm dubai hills and at some of the other neighbourhoods as well we appear to be in the midst of a spectacular post covid 19 rebound in luxury home sales said faisal durrani head of middle east research at knight frank even if we step back to the period before the pandemic the number of home sales in this price bracket so far this year is at the highest level since 2015 home buyers are clearly oozing with confidence when it comes to the emirate s uber luxury homes market dh 111 m the costliest home to sell in dubai so far this year fetched this price it is on the palm what s interesting is that a lot of the buying is bringing investors seeking their first exposure to luxury homes in dubai the fact that dubai s property market had undergone a 20 30 per cent dip in values over the last three years has been another factor driving buyers to pick up their choices now rather than wait and potentially having to pay higher in three to six months eyes on dubai being cheaper is actually playing to dubai s advantage now the world s wealthy have their eyes firmly set on the city where a million dollars gets you five times more residential real estate than london new york or singapore which means accessing a luxury lifestyle is relatively more affordable said durrani with over 42 000 million dollar homes dubai is second only to london where luxury home sales have also rebounded
by cheng yu china daily updated 2021 06 28 08 59 a woman passes a billboard advertising perfect diary s small stiletto heel lipstick in beijing on may 4 cosmetics firm rides home success to build overseas presence for sustainable growth perfect diary a young chinese brand that emerged from nowhere to become a cosmetics giant is putting on another makeup on the southeast asian market as domestic beauty companies look for global presence with their rising prowess in the domestic market going global is no doubt one of our important strategies for the future the overseas market is considered another fresh driver of the company s long term sustainable growth said maria wang head of the overseas market at perfect diary the guangzhou guangdong province based company sells its products in several southeast asian markets including vietnam malaysia singapore and the philippines through perfect diary s website as well as via local e commerce platforms such as shopee despite being in the market for only a year perfect diary is already ranked the largest vendor in color cosmetics on shopee in singapore and vietnam in terms of sales as at the end of may it also topped other foreign brands in the face powder category in the philippines the very reason that we first set our foot in southeast asia is that we see broad development opportunities as well as geographic advantages from here compared with the mature beauty markets in europe and the united states consumers from southeast asia have an unmet huge demand for beauty products said wang with their high acceptance of new beauty products chinese cosmetics brands will have a very good foundation in beefing up presence overseas she said according to a report on the website of market research firm mintel southeast asia is considered a hot spot for the global cosmetics industry with the support of local e commerce platforms such as lazada and shopee the beauty and cosmetics industry has been growing at an unprecedented speed sales revenue of the beauty and personal care market of southeast asia is expected to reach 304 8 billion yuan 47 1 billion in 2025 with a compound annual growth rate of 9 3 percent which will rival that of the chinese market industry experts said for chinese cosmetics brands expanding their footprint in foreign markets is not an easy task especially when western market leaders like l oreal and lvmh are dominating the beauty market globally for the planned southeast asian market expansion the biggest challenge for perfect diary is localization as consumers from various markets there have different religious beliefs and preferences to better localize in the southeast asian market the chinese company cooperated with sanrio a company that designs licenses and produces products focusing on the cute aspect of japanese popular culture to launch a series of products with cute packaging and reasonably priced products the series soon became a hit there we also developed color numbers that are more suitable for local consumers in products such as loose powder and lip gloss according to their skin color we also upgrade oil control technologies used in makeup related foundation products to better suit local demands wang said she said the company also found that local users prefer cameo brown and rose colors in lipstick natural brown in eyebrow pencils and the whitest color for powder compared with leading western brands i just feel that perfect diary s products are more suitable for the skin of asian people and it is very interesting that i first got to know the brand from my foreign friends said li chunxiao a 21 year old university student in beijing data from the general administration of customs showed that china has become the second largest cosmetics consumption market globally despite the impact of the covid 19 pandemic on various businesses china s imports of cosmetics and personal care products reached 20 25 billion last year up 29 4 percent year on year driven by such huge demand a group of local brands such as perfect diary and hangzhou zhejiang province based florasis are gaining momentum in the domestic market and began to set their sights on foreign markets in china perfect diary has become a first mover in the marketing method of dtc or direct to consumer where it cooperates with kols or key opinion leaders including charismatic influencers like lipstick king li jiaqi to sell products on social media platforms like douyin tiktok for china wechat and the little red book our highly social digitally native sales and marketing strategy works effectively our main consumer group the young consumers is more receptive to marketing through kols that they identify with wang said in southeast asia we develop a broad range of kols from tiktok and facebook as well as celebrity partners to drive viral online social marketing campaigns and rapidly build vast and loyal fan followings for our brands and products in vietnam for instance amee a popular music singer of vietnam has become a lipstick artist for perfect diary which attracted many young consumers to buy the lipstick used by the online star yatsen

the number of dtc customers for the first quarter increased by 11 6 percent year on year to 9 6 million growth in the quarter was driven by stellar performance of our flagship perfect diary brand as well as robust growth from little ondine abby s choice and other brands under yatsen s portfolio we are especially pleased to see increases in revenue per dtc user and gross margin driven by brand

henry kissinger once said america has no permanent friend or enemy only interests the famous quote should form the cornerstone of foreign policy of any country as it is demonstrated in the recent visit by us president joe biden to the european union it was his first formal visit to the european bloc to rekindle the historic transatlantic alliance which faced a major setback during the trump era although western powers are gearing up for what they perceive as the emerging threat from the alliance between china and russia the global trade data shows that china still remains the largest trading partner of the us and europe as per april 2021 data of the us census bureau the us imported 151 billion of good and services from china ranking top in the list and which accounted for 17 5 of the total import bill of the us once again the geostrategic location of pakistan is at the epicentre of a major tectonic shift in the geopolitical realignment which is happening amid the turmoil caused by the us withdrawal from afghanistan it is now very clear about pakistan s strategic direction however the most critical aspect is to constantly review the trade and economic impact of policy decisions so far the numbers published by the state bank of pakistan sbp revealed that the umbilical cord feeding the country s economy was still largely attached to the old western camp the tale of two charts remittances and exports puts things into perspective when it comes to maintaining the inflow of foreign exchange to build and sustain the strategic reserves and not to run down on the current account balance again the impact that the western bloc has on global institutions is very obvious from the recent outcome of financial action task force fatf meeting that kept pakistan in the grey list despite being largely compliant with the action plan and from the immense pressure exerted on the country with a highly front loaded imf programme these are a few examples of the leverages that western powers have as a major donor of the imf the world is largely divided even when it comes to dealing with the covid 19 pandemic which is posing a common threat to the humanity recall my article surviving pandemic in deeply polarised world where i highlighted the dilemma in detail travel advisories and recent visa issues for pakistanis in the gulf cooperation council gcc bloc which accounts for half of the remittance flow and recent shortage of astrazeneca vaccine in pakistan have caused havoc may disrupt the free movement of pakistani workforce and eventually affect the flow of remittances the same is true for pakistan s export sector where it relies heavily on the european and us markets the recent resolution by the european union to review the gsp plus status of pakistan during nationwide protests against france highlights the vulnerabilities and dependency on the status quo the long term strategy should be to always look for opportunities to diversify trade and investment portfolios and discover new avenues and here pakistan s trade missions abroad have to play a pivotal role in the meantime the foreign policymakers have to make sure not to fall in the trap of forming new alliances at the cost of existing ones as we have seen in the past thomas jefferson once said peace commerce and honest friendship with all nations entangling alliances with none the writer is a financial market enthusiast and attached to pakistan s stocks commodities and emerging technology published in the express tribune june 28th 2021 like business on facebook follow tribunebiz on twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation

we have now passed the longest day and the weather continues to be dry and reasonably warm but nothing like that in the south of england with some recent heavy rain and temperatures as high as 30 c potato irrigators are being kept busy cereal and oilseed rape crops are looking well but harvest is expected to be later than usual because of the slow start to spring covid 19 issues continue to cause problems as we gradually get back to some form of normality but social distancing rules means that pubs and restaurants cannot get up to full capacity with seat and table numbers which cuts down demand for food and drink and this does not help our industry brexit issues are causing delays in exports and imports fruit and vegetable growers are struggling to get enough workers to harvest their crops and we are having to come to terms with the recent import agreement with australia which will likely be the first of many farmers will have to stand up and compete as best as they can so the agricultural industry has a lot to face up to in coming years with lots of uncertain times ahead brexit has already cost scotland s economy around 4bn and less trade is being done now than before brexit on january 1 recently hmrc announced a 2bn fall in food and drink exports to the eu in the first quarter of the year and a 90 drop in dairy product sales one thing that we cannot manage or change is the weather which globally continues to cause continual volatility in world market prices wheat prices have fallen in recent days and london wheat futures have fallen again from their highs of recent weeks a change in weather prospects is one of the main drivers for lower us maize and wheat markets with cooler and wetter conditions now arriving which will help their spring drilled crops the november 2021 liffee new crop feed wheat futures have dropped by more than 7 per tonne from last week to currently stand at 172 july 2021 old crop wheat futures stood at 201 70 two weeks ago and are now 18 down at 183 75 tonne may 2022 new crop has dropped by 5 as well to 176 95 tonne us crops are in desperate need of better weather and more than 40 of the state of iowa which is one of their main maize producing states is now subject to severe drought as is dakota a main wheat growing state their winter wheat ratings have dropped to 48 good to excellent and spring wheat is put at 37 which when compared to this time last year stood at 81 farmers have been reporting that their wheat fields are as bad as they have ever seen them maize good to excellent ratings have dropped by 11 to 58 in minnesota and iowa dropped down by 14 to 63 the biggest weekly loss of condition in 33 years these two states represent 27 5 of the total us maize crop the recent commodity price drops are due to forecasts for cooler and wetter weather where 30 60mm of rain is forecast next week which will help their crop yields if the rain does come however the recent fall in prices has also been driven by us maize which lost more than 12 of its value last week despite drought there also us markets were affected by speculation that president biden might allow a reduced blending of maize ethanol into fossil fuels as blenders come under severe financial pressure to meet their targets prices in the states are also coming under pressure with the usda estimating that over 96m acres of us maize will be planted compared to the previous estimate of 91 1m acres and this would add a further 20m tonnes to current production estimates recently the us dollar gained over 2 in futures exchange markets which forced the us to lower its prices to remain competitive in the export markets the black sea wheat producing countries of russia ukraine and kazakhstan are likely to export 5 more wheat this year which would be around 66m tonnes and this despite having a small reduction in wheat production to around 124m tonnes russia continues to be the world s top exporter much of western europe is seeing beneficial rain and french winter wheat crop ratings are stable at 81 well ahead of the 56 good to excellent it achieved last year at this time that led to eu wheat production estimates being increased to 137m tonnes on the back of better weather conditions throughout europe over the past month and germany s wheat crop next season is also forecast to rise 3 8 to 22 98m tonnes due to better weather these figures and the anticipated increase in uk wheat production is continuing to pull prices lower the eu s total soft wheat exports are put at 24 7m tonnes so far in comparison to the 33 3m tonnes exported at this time last season the usda has cut brazilian maize estimated output by 3 5m tonnes to 98 5m tonnes but that did not go far enough to see any increase in prices as before weather issues there will continue to be key to a change in prices and if it remains dry we could see prices rise once again the ukrainian maize crop is forecast at 37 5m tonnes which is 22 above the five year average and 30 5m tonnes is due for export which would be 25 above the five year average ukraine has done a marketing deal with china and maize exports from there from last october until april was 7 34m tonnes up from the 5 5m tonnes exported throughout the whole of the previous year and this arrangement is likely to grow in future this could help uk grain prices as reduced ukraine maize imports could lend support to new crop barley prices china s pig producers have been encouraged to maintain production levels despite prices falling below cost of production as live prices in china have dropped 60 since the start of the year if prices keep falling farmers could cut herd sizes with a potential impact on feed demand as a result of the recent hot spell of weather in the south of england harvest might be earlier than at first thought but as mentioned earlier this is not expected to be the case in the north and in scotland scottish old crop barley prices remain at a premium over english prices but have fallen in line with us wheat and maize futures due to forecast rain and a stronger us dollar the recent much needed rain helped to fill spring sown crops especially spring barley in the south of england but continued rainfall in the black sea region is raising quality issues meanwhile the baltic states are experiencing dry weather which is not helping their crops beer sales recently have been above average given the gradual relaxing of covid 19 rules and this has seen old crop barley prices remain firm as merchants find themselves short of stocks and having to go out to the market for more product new crop barley is holding its discount to wheat at around 12 15 tonne and domestic compound feed demand is expected to reduce significantly from crop 2020 as a result of this much smaller price discount to wheat but given that the price of other raw materials especially proteins remain high good new crop demand is expected for barley the drop in the wheat futures market put pressure on new crop bean prices as this crop is now showing benefits of the last few weeks of warm conditions this past week feed beans have been sold at 205 210 ex farm and prices are expected to fall as wheat values drop with a stronger us dollar there could be demand from egypt but farmers may not commit to a sale until the uk bean quality is known especially with the prospect of another high bruchid level year there has been some interest in new crop green peas recently with some sales now below 250 tonne ex farm but again growers will not be keen to sell until nearer harvest when the crop quality is confirmed after a year of rising prices of oilseed rape a near 50 tonne drop in new crop prices in the past two weeks has dented market confidence concerns over low global stock levels are now being replaced by thoughts that stock levels are about to be rebuilt rather than eroded away due to the recent high prices a record level of oilseeds has been planted for production in 2021 which is forecast as up by 11m ha this year compared to a 10 year average increase of just 4m ha meaning production could rise by 34m tonnes this includes an extra 20m tonnes of soya to a new record volume of 615 2m tonnes and consumption is forecast to grow by only 19m tonnes so this will result in oilseed stocks in 2021 22 building up by around 8m tonnes within the oilseeds group oilseed rape tonnage still looks likely to be tight even though plantings are forecast to be up by1 3m ha and production up by around 1 7m tonnes low opening stocks means it will be tight up to the end of 2021 22 especially in europe australia is forecast to increase its canola crop by 0 5m tonnes and canada by 0 4m tonnes both these countries export to the eu and the uk however a potential recovery in stock levels will mean that prices are unlikely to go any higher in the short term unless we get some very poor weather that affects the crop and future yield between now and harvest another factor that pushed up oilseed prices was insufficient vegetable oil production to meet demand due to a 9 reduction in the sunflower seed crop in ukraine russia and parts of the eu 27 because of poor weather another factor was the reduced palm oil production due to covid 19 resulting in a labour shortage which reduced palm oil production by 2 from previous levels in 2019 20 and the ongoing pandemic along with heavy rain in south america in the early part of 2021 meant global production only recovered by 1 in 2020 21 global demand for vegetable oils continues to grow and is estimated to rise by 4 1 to 213 0m tonnes for both food and industrial uses this will push up global vegetable oil prices and create more crush demand for rapeseed and keep global supplies tight despite bigger australian and indian crops current forecasts show bigger supplies of rapeseed and sunflower seed in 2021 22 along with a recovery in palm oil output and if confirmed these could be enough to move the market back into surplus and enable some stock rebuilding which could see prices dropping once the crops are harvested stocks of rapeseed and sunflower seed continue to be very low so the market is very sensitive to any threat to yields and this is again where the weather comes in to play and until the crop is in the barn there will still be price volatility until harvest as no one knows what the weather is going to do between now and the crop being safely gathered in
president biden has a rare opportunity to act on climate with maximum political capital from the 2020 election bipartisan support for a clean energy recovery from the covid induced economic crisis and the imperative of meeting his announced goal of halving the united states greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 the upside of acting now is massive 1 5 trillion in investment across every corner of the country biden campaigned on a 100 clean electricity by 2035 pledge included this target in his american jobs plan and outlined the job creation benefits of clean energy in his annual message to congress in april biden can seize this opportunity by working with congress to pass a clean electricity standard ces targeting 80 clean electricity by 2030 which new research shows is possible without increasing customer costs thanks to plummeting wind solar and battery costs a ces requires utilities to gradually reduce the carbon intensity of their power generation portfolios by adding zero carbon resources like wind and solar clean or renewable electricity standards are already law in 30 states and have effectively driven low cost power sector decarbonization while stimulating local investment clean electricity policy as a national jobs creator an 80 by 2030 ces would benefit all americans because sustained precipitous clean energy technology cost declines have far outpaced industry forecasts research from uc berkeley gridlab and energy innovation shows an 80 by 2030 ces is achievable using existing technologies while maintaining grid dependability without increasing consumer electricity costs it also delivers substantial benefits across the u s including more than 1 5 trillion in capital investments by 2030 and more than 1 7 trillion in avoided health and environmental costs including 93 000 avoided premature deaths by 2050 because cheap renewable energy is now available everywhere hundreds of thousands of new net jobs created annually by a ces would accrue across the country not just in areas with high wind speeds like the great plains or high solar irradiance like the southwest projected new capacity additions 2021 2030 under an 80 by 2030 clean electricity standard an ambitious interim clean electricity target supported by the white house and major u s utilities would provide near term business certainty to shift today s power generation decisions and spur innovation to help achieve a fully clean system by 2035 an 80 by 2030 ces also falls within the 10 year federal budget window and could pass with only 50 votes in the senate with vice president harris serving as the tiebreaker if needed allowing it to be a centerpiece of biden s infrastructure package clean energy cost declines and deployments continue exceeding expectations in 2010 solar energy had a negligible u s presence and its unsubsidized levelized cost of energy lcoe was more than 30 cents per kilowatt hour kwh for context the energy component of consumers electricity bills was approximately 5 9 cents kwh in 2010 in the decade since utility scale solar generating capacity ballooned to 60 gigawatts gw more than 5 of installed u s power generating capacity and utility scale solar lcoe has nose dived to an average of 3 0 cents kwh making it the cheapest source of power in many u s regions u s utility scale solar pv deployment and cost a similar story has played out with onshore wind energy and offshore wind energy and battery storage systems are following their more mature counterparts paths while the first u s offshore wind project required a contract of 24 cents kwh in 2016 new u s offshore wind projects are viable with contracts less than 6 cents kwh this cost decline has empowered the biden administration to target 30 gw of offshore wind by 2030 which could support 83 000 jobs and add 25 billion in annual economic activity meanwhile the average cost of u s utility scale battery storage systems fell more than 70 from 2015 to 2018 industry forecasts have consistently underestimated clean energy technology growth and cost decline rates the u s energy information administration forecast in 2018 that 73 gw of cumulative grid connected solar capacity excluding residential rooftop solar would be online by 2025 this number was surpassed early in 2020 the national renewable energy laboratory nrel forecast in 2015 that capital expenditures for utility scale solar projects would fall below 1 100 kw dc by 2030 however solar costs reached that mark more than a decade ahead of expectations u s utility scale solar pv capital expenditures further lawrence berkeley national laboratory lbnl recently reported that the lcoe of onshore and offshore wind fell by 28 36 and 28 49 from 2014 to 2019 respectively yet the median forecast from a 2015 lbnl survey of wind experts anticipated mere 10 declines for both technologies and expert cost trajectories are now 50 lower than predictions made in 2015 this is not a new phenomenon regularly bearish forecasts have long left policymakers investors and utilities themselves unprepared to properly assess the economic upside of a more rapid clean energy transition but it s not too late to get it right these cost decline trends have accelerated the timeline to cost effectively achieve high levels of clean energy on the grid a 2012 nrel study concluded that an 80 clean electricity grid would be technically feasible by 2050 but would create higher electric bills two years later a follow up study concluded the same goal could be reached at no additional cost and now several studies show we can achieve the same results 20 years earlier than expected what once seemed out of reach may now be the best path forward seizing the moment with a national clean electricity standard researchers from uc berkeley gridlab and energy innovation modeled 80 clean electricity in the u s by 2030 with high levels of electrification in other sectors e g assuming all electric light duty vehicle sales by 2030 showing that an 80 by 2030 ces would drive 1 5 trillion in clean energy capital investments across the country through 2030 avoid more than 1 7 trillion in health and environmental costs through 2050 support grid dependability while requiring rapid but achievable renewable deployments through 2030 support reaching a fully decarbonized grid by 2035 as well as near term decarbonization of transportation buildings and industry the 80 by 2030 ces would also keep consumers electric bills about the same as today s levels but this doesn t mean the 80 ces will happen on its own a no policy approach only achieves 45 clean electricity by 2030 strong federal policy is required to achieve these remarkable benefits an 80 by 2030 ces would be a boon for workers and communities in rural and politically conservative states supporting broader revitalization through increased tax revenues and induced economic activity in fact the top 15 states by new clean energy investment include appalachian states like kentucky ohio and virginia along with other fossil fuel dependent states like texas oklahoma and wyoming according to uc berkeley research reaching 80 clean electricity by 2030 while rapidly electrifying transportation and buildings would require building an annual average of 95 gw of renewables and 22 gw of battery storage effectively doubling our current stock of power generation capacity within the next decade and matching china s renewable energy deployment in 2020 research from energy innovation and princeton university indicates a similar rate of renewables deployment could create up to 1 million new jobs annually in the 2020s and these jobs can be high paying a working paper from princeton indicates high road labor practices for wind and solar jobs would support wages in excess of average fossil fuel jobs without meaningfully increasing solar and wind costs this economic growth is enabled by clean energy technology costs falling sufficiently to be economic throughout the country whereas a 50 difference in the cost of solar between regions e g california versus new england used to be 10 cents kwh it is now closer to 1 5 cents kwh average solar left and wind right lcoe unsubsidized by region under an 80 by 2030 technology cost declines show that significant clean electricity deployment is inevitable but market failures are locking out benefits that could be realized by society much sooner if the right set of policies corrected them for example fossil fuel fired power plants do not have to pay for the greenhouse gases they emit and onerous siting and permitting rules present barriers to entry for new transmission projects that would otherwise unlock potential for new renewables monopoly utilities face little competition and they have continued investing in existing and new fossil power plants despite compelling economics for building new renewables exacerbating stranded asset concerns a plan to benefit all americans a national 80 by 2030 ces would create hundreds of thousands of well paying jobs demonstrate global leadership on climate change after a period of tumult substantially reduce local air pollution which disproportionately affects americans of color and help transition communities with ties to the fossil fuel industry to more financially sustainable economies the u s has risen to unprecedented challenges throughout its history extending electric service to rural areas building the interstate highway system and even landing on the moon were all seemingly insurmountable tasks in their times now ubiquitous low cost renewables dare us to meet our present crises with the collective construction of a clean electricity grid and through an 80 by 2030 ces we can unleash this potential original
