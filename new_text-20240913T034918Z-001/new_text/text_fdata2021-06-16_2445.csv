it s not the first real estate investment trust reit to recycle capital via the local stock exchange as the curtain raising title has gone to ayala land s areit inc it s not even the second reit as doubledragon s ddmp reit became the runner up however gotianun led filinvest reit corp which has applied for an initial public offering ipo worth as much as p14 9 billion seeks to differentiate itself by becoming the first sustainability themed reit in this part of the world as such filinvest chief josephine gotianun yap said in an economic journalists association of the philippines forum yesterday that she was hoping that filinvest reit with the help of underwriters ubs and bpi capital could attract sustainability focused funds as anchor or cornerstone investors advertisement she noted that filinvest city where 16 buildings out of filinvest reit s 17 buildings are located was the first central business district in the country to bag the leadership in energy and environmental design leed v4 gold for neighborhood development certification this cbd also has an eco loop the philippines first integrated electric powered 24 7 public transport system office buildings within its northgate cyberzone are served by the country s largest district cooling system reducing carbon emissions and energy consumption the 17th property in the portfolio is an office tower with a retail component in cebu cyberzone all in all the 17 building reit portfolio has a total gross leasable area gla of 301 362 square meters like areit filinvest reit which has 88 4 percent of its gla devoted to business process outsourcing locators does not own the land on which the skyscrapers stand but these are secured by 75 year lease agreements gotianun yap noted at the height of the current pandemic she noted that there were still some e payment and european business process outsourcing bpo firms signing up leasing deals for their expansion programs suggesting the resilience of the bpo sector as to dividends gotianun yap assured the public that filinvest reit s policy would be competitive relative to existing reits that yield around 5 percent a year she added that filinvest reit was keen on declaring 100 percent of earnings as dividends versus the 90 percent minimum required by the reit law as filinvest reit will be the group s financial platform for commercial assets we can expect this reit to gobble up even more assets under the group in addition to the initial portfolio we have another 315 000 square meters of office portfolio that will be infused when it has attained the investment criteria of the reit guidelines gotianun yap said in addition to that we have many many other assets like retail property under construction as well as industrial warehousing with over 400 hectares of landbank in prime cbds including clark and cebu she said this reit would have more room to grow in the future advertisement as the group is required to reinvest reit ipo proceeds within a year she said among the criteria was that a prospective investment would have to be a grade a commercial property whether office or opportunistic assets in the shopping mall or hospitality segments for office assets they would have to cater to prime bpo multinational clients and would have to be well located strong growth and accessibility to the workforce are likewise among the key criteria doris dumlao abadilla speaking of which not a lot of people know that cyberzone properties inc a subsidiary of filinvest land inc was born out of the gotianun family s silicon valley dreams when the family took annual treks to california in the 1990s they saw the vast residential and commercial real estate landscape in silicon valley the gotianuns even foresaw that the business process outsourcing bpo trend would one day arrive in the philippines this inspired the family to build a world class purpose built office complex that will house bpos and technology companies just like in silicon valley this california dream is now known as northgate cyberzone an 18 7 hectare philippine economic zone authority special economic zone in filinvest city in alabang that was home to one of the earliest bpo campuses in the country northgate was patterned after the sprawling campus offices of many startups and global technology firms fli president josephine gotianun yap said from my trips i saw the large floor plate and side core office buildings which we introduced to the philippines and has since become the industry standard one of the first built to suit commercial properties in the philippines was completed in northgate cyberzone in 2004 with a 7 000 square meter space for a multinational global bpo firm another bts commercial property was completed the following year with 18 000 square meters of space the largest bts commercial property at the time for a global bpo of a multinational bank northgate cyberzone is also why filinvest takes great pride in being a pioneer and having one of the longest track records in leasing office spaces to bpos gotianun yap even hired a silicon valley based architect for the first office building in northgate cyberzone thanks to gotianun yap s foresight the strategy has so far served fli well amid the covid 19 global pandemic cyberzone properties revenues still rose 7 percent to p3 1 billion in 2020 versus the previous year thanks to the resilience of the country s information technology bpo sector in the last decade revenues from this market segment have steadily given cpi a steady cash flow the question now is will investors view the company s upcoming reit issue with the same foresight as that of its owners we ll know soon enough abangan daxim l lucas ride sharing and politics ride sharing companies have learned that operating in the philippines like most other markets requires good political clout to survive the usual solution was to hire a talented lobbyist or government relations officer we leave the rest up to the imagination the more practical route of course is to simply join the government we understand a founder of one of the ride sharing companies operating here is in fact mulling such a possibility with the 2022 elections drawing near no this isn t to transform the industry as the next president but something more achievable such as the party list system that path would also avoid the need to have anyone riding in tandem so to speak this potential candidate does have a powerful transport advocacy on his side his company also has the backing of millions of commuters and some clever tongue in cheek marketing skills assets that have helped it overcome past instances of hostile government intervention and will be useful tools in a campaign such a bid remains a possible scenario at the moment and more clarity should emerge in the coming months with the approaching deadline for the filing of candidacy until then we can just say abangan your subscription could not be

lordstown motors corp shares took their biggest one day drop ever after its two top executives stepped down and the electric truckmaker s board found evidence of inaccurate statements dimming the shine of the onetime spac star chief executive officer steve burns and chief financial officer julio rodriguez have resigned from the company effective immediately the company said in a statement monday burns declined to comment about his exit in a text message it is the latest setback for the company which warned last week it might not have enough cash to fund the development of its first truck or even survive the next 12 months if it can t raise more capital in march the startup disclosed a securities and exchange commission probe of its operations after a short seller said its technology was flawed and that preorders for its truck were nonbinding shares of the company sank 19 to close at 9 26 the lowest in almost three weeks the stock is down 54 this year and more than 70 below its closing high of 31 40 in september it may come under further selling pressure from potential stock disposals by burns who is the single largest shareholder with a 26 5 stake adam jonas an analyst at morgan stanley who recently pulled his rating on lordstown wrote in a research note lordstown is one of a slew of electric vehicle startups that have gone public through mergers with so called special purpose acquisition companies or spacs which have been controversial because they ve made public companies out of young ventures with little in the way of revenue or commercially viable products it combined with diamondpeak holdings in an october deal that netted lordstown 675 million the company said in a separate statement that a board investigation concluded it had made misstatements about its vehicle preorders the probe cited instances when the startup inaccurately claimed preorders came from commercial fleets instead of from third party management companies or influencers that didn t plan to purchase trucks directly it also found that some of the preorders were placed by ostensible buyers unlikely to have the resources to complete the orders or whose commitments were too vague or infirm to be appropriately included in the total number of preorders disclosed in a march report short seller hindenburg research called the 100 000 preorders for its truck fictitious as recently as last month burns told analysts on a conference call that lordstown had halted preorders at 100 000 vehicles but had begun accepting an additional 23 000 vehicle purchase agreements most of which included down payments lordstown s board concluded that other allegations made by short seller hindenburg research in march were false and misleading in many aspects interim ceo the company s lead independent director angela strand has been named executive chairwoman and she will oversee the company until a new ceo is identified becky roof who has previously served as an interim finance chief at other corporations will do the same at lordstown we remain committed to delivering on our production and commercialization objectives holding ourselves to the highest standards of operation and performance and creating value for shareholders strand said in the statement short seller hindenburg alleged that burns had been forced out of his former company electric van maker workhorse group inc he left that company in 2019 and founded lordstown burns denied hindenburg s allegations burns s abrupt departure and lordstown s finding that it made misstatements under his tenure are eerily similar to what transpired at nikola corp another electric vehicle startup that went public via a blank check company nikola s founder and ceo also stepped down after hindenburg targeted the company for misleading investors something the startup later confirmed lordstown drew attention to itself when it acquired a shuttered general motors co factory in youngstown ohio where it plans to manufacture its own vehicles the move was lauded by president donald trump s administration after he had promised to bring back work to the thousands of workers who lost jobs when the plant was closed in 2019 commercialization shift the exit of lordstown s two top executives comes at a difficult time for the company as it attempts to transition from research and development into commercial production of its first model the company is trying to build a unique electric pickup with a motor at each wheel that makes it an engineering challenge it is working with technology licensed from elaphe propulsion technologies of slovenia to produce the motors lordstown s board rejected an allegation from short seller hindenburg that the technology isn t workable in a commercial vehicle while hub motors have not previously been used at scale in commercially produced passenger vehicles the hub motor technology licensed from elaphe is viable it said in the report but morgan stanley s jonas said the technology may prove to be a headwind lordstown can do without in the post burns era it is our understanding that steve burns was the primary proponent of the hub motor system he said while a change of architecture would add as much as a year or two to the start of production we believe moving to an alternative motor strategy or an entirely different product and go to market strategy altogether may be required to preserve sustainable equity value first published date

president joe biden and russian president vladimir putin meeting in person june 16 the white house announcing the meeting saying the two leaders quote will discuss the full range of pressing issues as we seek to restore predictability and stability to the us russia relationship unquote it will take place in geneva at the end of biden s first trip abroad to europe in march biden called putin a killer moscow then recalled its ambassador to washington the kremlin said in its own statement quote we intend to discuss the state and prospects of further development of russian american relations problems of strategic stability as well as topical issues on the international agenda including interaction in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic and the settlement of regional conflicts unquote advertisement biden and putin are to meet on wednesday the two leaders have divergent goals for the summit share copy link copy an american president won t side with moscow over his own intelligence agencies there will be no talk of a reset in russian relations and it is highly doubtful that anyone will gaze into vladimir putin s eyes and discuss his soul but beyond that it s not clear what will happen wednesday in geneva when president joe biden meets putin for the first time since taking office both sides acknowledge that the relationship between the two nations is dismal and neither holds out much hope for meaningful areas of agreement still each man brings his own goals to the summit table a look at what each president is hoping to achieve in switzerland what biden wantsbiden and his aides have made clear that he will not follow in the footsteps of his recent predecessors by aiming to radically alter the united states ties to russia instead the white house is looking for a more modest though still vitally important goal to move toward a more predictable relationship and attempt to rein in russia s disruptive behavior biden s first overseas trip was deliberately sequenced so that he will meet with putin only after spending days meeting with european allies and powerful democracies including a gathering at nato the decades old alliance formed to serve as a bulwark to russian aggression he hoped to project a sense of unity and renewed cooperation after four years of tumult under former president donald trump who often tried to cozy up to the russian president biden will push putin to stop meddling in democratic elections to ease tensions with ukraine and to stop giving safe harbor to hackers carrying out cyber and ransomware attacks aides believe that lowering the temperature with russia will also reinforce the united states ties to democracies existing in moscow s shadow national security adviser jake sullivan said biden will look for areas where in our common interest we can work together to produce outcomes that are that work for the united states and for the american people sullivan who briefed reporters on air force one heading to brussels for the nato summit said that biden s other message would be more stick than carrot how do we send a clear message about those harmful activities that we will not tolerate and to which we will respond there have been brief moments of common ground moscow and washington have shown a shared interest in restarting talks on strategic stability to work out a follow up deal to the new start the last remaining u s russian arms control pact that was extended for five years in january biden will exhort putin on human rights including the poisoning and imprisonment of dissident alexei navalny to not support the regime in belarus that carried out a recent skyjacking and to stop interfering with other nations elections cyber will also be a focal point with the geneva summit coming just days after nato expanded its article 5 mutual defense pact to include cyberattacks but the president acknowledged that there may be no way to keep putin in check there s no guarantee you can change a person s behavior or the behavior of his country autocrats have enormous power and they don t have to answer to a public said biden during a news conference sunday after the group of seven summit in england and the fact is that it may very well be if i respond in kind which i will that it doesn t dissuade him and he wants to keep going biden had not minced words when it comes to assessing putin he said in an interview earlier this year that he agreed with an assessment that putin was a killer and he once declared that putin didn t have a soul that was far colder rhetoric that his immediate predecessors trump spoke warmly of putin and was deferential to him during their one summit held in helsinki in 2018 in which he turned his back on his own intelligence agencies president barack obama s administration though wary of putin expressed hope in a reset and improvement of relations with moscow and george w bush said that he looked the man in the eye and found him very straightforward and trustworthy i was able to get a sense of his soul bush said biden won t what putin wantsputin also won t be expecting to warm up ties his main goal would be to draw his red lines to the new u s administration and negotiate a tense status quo that would protect moscow s vital interests the russian leader doesn t hope for a new détente to mend the rift caused by russia s 2014 annexation of ukraine s crimean peninsula nor does he count on a rollback of the crippling u s and eu sanctions that have restricted moscow s access to global financial markets and top western technologies putin s task now is more modest to spell out russia s top security concerns and try to restore basic channels of communication that would prevent an even more dangerous destabilization the main red line for moscow is ukraine s aspirations to join nato fearing its bid for the alliance membership putin responded to the 2014 ouster of ukraine s russia friendly president by annexing crimea and throwing moscow s weight behind a separatist insurgency in the country s eastern industrial heartland where the seven year conflict has killed more than 14 000 when tensions along the line of contact in ukraine s east rose earlier this year russia quickly beefed up its troops near ukraine and warned kiev s leaders that it would intervene militarily if they try to reclaim the rebel controlled regions by force moscow has since pulled back some of its forces from the border areas but the ukrainian leadership has said the bulk of them have remained close to the border in an interview with state tv last week putin described ukraine s bid to join nato as an existential challenge to russia that would allow the alliance s missiles to hit moscow and other targets in western russia in just seven minutes he compared it to russia deploying its missiles in canada or mexico near the u s border isn t it a red line he said while taking a tough stance on ukraine the russian leader could show a degree of flexibility on other global hotspots even though moscow has been critical of the u s led military campaign in afghanistan it s interested in a settlement that would prevent the country from plunging into chaos following the u s troops withdrawal later this year fearing that instability could spill into ex soviet central asia russia also has been involved in painstaking international talks to help repair a nuclear deal with iran that was spiked by trump and it has expressed a willingness to cooperate with the u s in efforts to restart the stalled mideast peace talks and the kremlin would be interested in working out a deal on syria where moscow s military campaign helped president bashar assad s government reclaim control over most of the country after a devastating civil war and the u s has maintained a limited military presence russia has said it s ready to include its prospective doomsday weapons such as the poseidon atomic powered nuclear armed underwater drone and the burevestnik nuclear powered cruise missile to the talks agenda on condition the u s brings its missile defense and possible space based weapons into the equation putin also has emphasized russia s readiness to make joint efforts to address climate change and cope with the coronavirus pandemic he called for establishing a dialogue on cybercrime noting that moscow could agree to extradite cybercrime suspects to the u s if washington takes the same obligation the white house has strongly downplayed the idea of a cybercriminal prisoner exchange

president joe biden and russian president vladimir putin meeting in person june 16 the white house announcing the meeting saying the two leaders quote will discuss the full range of pressing issues as we seek to restore predictability and stability to the us russia relationship unquote it will take place in geneva at the end of biden s first trip abroad to europe in march biden called putin a killer moscow then recalled its ambassador to washington the kremlin said in its own statement quote we intend to discuss the state and prospects of further development of russian american relations problems of strategic stability as well as topical issues on the international agenda including interaction in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic and the settlement of regional conflicts unquote advertisement biden and putin are to meet on wednesday the two leaders have divergent goals for the summit share copy link copy an american president won t side with moscow over his own intelligence agencies there will be no talk of a reset in russian relations and it is highly doubtful that anyone will gaze into vladimir putin s eyes and discuss his soul but beyond that it s not clear what will happen wednesday in geneva when president joe biden meets putin for the first time since taking office both sides acknowledge that the relationship between the two nations is dismal and neither holds out much hope for meaningful areas of agreement still each man brings his own goals to the summit table a look at what each president is hoping to achieve in switzerland what biden wantsbiden and his aides have made clear that he will not follow in the footsteps of his recent predecessors by aiming to radically alter the united states ties to russia instead the white house is looking for a more modest though still vitally important goal to move toward a more predictable relationship and attempt to rein in russia s disruptive behavior biden s first overseas trip was deliberately sequenced so that he will meet with putin only after spending days meeting with european allies and powerful democracies including a gathering at nato the decades old alliance formed to serve as a bulwark to russian aggression he hoped to project a sense of unity and renewed cooperation after four years of tumult under former president donald trump who often tried to cozy up to the russian president biden will push putin to stop meddling in democratic elections to ease tensions with ukraine and to stop giving safe harbor to hackers carrying out cyber and ransomware attacks aides believe that lowering the temperature with russia will also reinforce the united states ties to democracies existing in moscow s shadow national security adviser jake sullivan said biden will look for areas where in our common interest we can work together to produce outcomes that are that work for the united states and for the american people sullivan who briefed reporters on air force one heading to brussels for the nato summit said that biden s other message would be more stick than carrot how do we send a clear message about those harmful activities that we will not tolerate and to which we will respond there have been brief moments of common ground moscow and washington have shown a shared interest in restarting talks on strategic stability to work out a follow up deal to the new start the last remaining u s russian arms control pact that was extended for five years in january biden will exhort putin on human rights including the poisoning and imprisonment of dissident alexei navalny to not support the regime in belarus that carried out a recent skyjacking and to stop interfering with other nations elections cyber will also be a focal point with the geneva summit coming just days after nato expanded its article 5 mutual defense pact to include cyberattacks but the president acknowledged that there may be no way to keep putin in check there s no guarantee you can change a person s behavior or the behavior of his country autocrats have enormous power and they don t have to answer to a public said biden during a news conference sunday after the group of seven summit in england and the fact is that it may very well be if i respond in kind which i will that it doesn t dissuade him and he wants to keep going biden had not minced words when it comes to assessing putin he said in an interview earlier this year that he agreed with an assessment that putin was a killer and he once declared that putin didn t have a soul that was far colder rhetoric that his immediate predecessors trump spoke warmly of putin and was deferential to him during their one summit held in helsinki in 2018 in which he turned his back on his own intelligence agencies president barack obama s administration though wary of putin expressed hope in a reset and improvement of relations with moscow and george w bush said that he looked the man in the eye and found him very straightforward and trustworthy i was able to get a sense of his soul bush said biden won t what putin wantsputin also won t be expecting to warm up ties his main goal would be to draw his red lines to the new u s administration and negotiate a tense status quo that would protect moscow s vital interests the russian leader doesn t hope for a new détente to mend the rift caused by russia s 2014 annexation of ukraine s crimean peninsula nor does he count on a rollback of the crippling u s and eu sanctions that have restricted moscow s access to global financial markets and top western technologies putin s task now is more modest to spell out russia s top security concerns and try to restore basic channels of communication that would prevent an even more dangerous destabilization the main red line for moscow is ukraine s aspirations to join nato fearing its bid for the alliance membership putin responded to the 2014 ouster of ukraine s russia friendly president by annexing crimea and throwing moscow s weight behind a separatist insurgency in the country s eastern industrial heartland where the seven year conflict has killed more than 14 000 when tensions along the line of contact in ukraine s east rose earlier this year russia quickly beefed up its troops near ukraine and warned kiev s leaders that it would intervene militarily if they try to reclaim the rebel controlled regions by force moscow has since pulled back some of its forces from the border areas but the ukrainian leadership has said the bulk of them have remained close to the border in an interview with state tv last week putin described ukraine s bid to join nato as an existential challenge to russia that would allow the alliance s missiles to hit moscow and other targets in western russia in just seven minutes he compared it to russia deploying its missiles in canada or mexico near the u s border isn t it a red line he said while taking a tough stance on ukraine the russian leader could show a degree of flexibility on other global hotspots even though moscow has been critical of the u s led military campaign in afghanistan it s interested in a settlement that would prevent the country from plunging into chaos following the u s troops withdrawal later this year fearing that instability could spill into ex soviet central asia russia also has been involved in painstaking international talks to help repair a nuclear deal with iran that was spiked by trump and it has expressed a willingness to cooperate with the u s in efforts to restart the stalled mideast peace talks and the kremlin would be interested in working out a deal on syria where moscow s military campaign helped president bashar assad s government reclaim control over most of the country after a devastating civil war and the u s has maintained a limited military presence russia has said it s ready to include its prospective doomsday weapons such as the poseidon atomic powered nuclear armed underwater drone and the burevestnik nuclear powered cruise missile to the talks agenda on condition the u s brings its missile defense and possible space based weapons into the equation putin also has emphasized russia s readiness to make joint efforts to address climate change and cope with the coronavirus pandemic he called for establishing a dialogue on cybercrime noting that moscow could agree to extradite cybercrime suspects to the u s if washington takes the same obligation the white house has strongly downplayed the idea of a cybercriminal prisoner exchange

meeting of the federal reserve shortly after the opening bell the dow jones industrial average was up slightly 0 03 at 34 405 while the s p 500 had dipped 0 06 to 4 252 and the nasdaq fell 0 31 to 14 130 sentiment in new york is unlikely to have been helped by the latest us retail sales data which came in lower than expected by reporting a 1 3 decline in may compared to expectations of a 0 7 fall sales of vehicles and electronic goods which had been in demand during lockdown as people avoided public transport and bought equipment for home working declined in may the car figures are also likely to have been affected by fewer vehicles being made as a global semiconductor shortage hinders production but spending on clothing and dining outgrew as the us vaccination programme became more widespread 7 35am wall street set for mostly flat start wall street is set for a flat open on tuesday morning as the federal reserve begins its two day meeting to discuss the latest economic situation and most crucially whether the central bank needs to act amid signs of inflationary pressures sophie griffiths market analyst at oanda said there is only one show in town this week and that s the fed investors want to know if the fed has started to talk about reining in its ultra loose policy or not the markets want to know whether the sugar rush that has boosted stocks to all time highs is coming to an end the fed is unlikely to hurry into a decision now however with bond yields at three month lows and equities at record highs the fed has the market where it wants it as such there s a good runway for very gradually introducing the debate surrounding tapering asset purchases even if it doesn t happen tomorrow it could well happen at the jackson hole economic forum later in the summer ahead of all that the dow jones industrial average is expected to open virtually unchanged down a minuscule 0 02 while the s p 500 is forecast to edge up 0 07 and the tech heavy nasdaq composite is indicated to add 0 12 as the fed meets investors will also be able to see the latest us retail sales and producer price figures retail sales have been on a rollercoaster ride in recent months with a fall of 2 7 in february a 10 7 surge in march then a flat figure in april the may figure due later is forecast to slip 0 7 michael hewson at cmc markets said while the us is doing well on the vaccine rollout plans and the reopening of the economy with theme and holiday parks also reopening there still seems to be an overriding feeling of caution around consumer spending patterns which appears to be tempering retail sales higher fuel prices probably aren t helping with an expectation of a decline of 0 7 expected with inflation at multi year highs today s ppi numbers for may could also offer a further glimpse into the inflationary impulse of the us economy often a leading indicator of future cpi numbers they have already proved to be reasonably accurate so far today s headline ppi is expected to stay at 6 2 however core prices are expected to rise further from 4 1 to 4 8 which would be additional food for thought for the members of the federal reserve when they sit down and start their deliberations later today four things to watch for on tuesday
rolling blackouts freezing homes and skyrocketing electricity prices back in february texas primary electric grid suffered a one two punch wrought by the deep freeze and off the charts demand for power as power plants struggled to keep up with heating demand power outages such as the texas one are not only becoming much more frequent compared to the situation two decades ago but are also increasing in severity mainly due to climate stresses and a power grid that s increasingly unable to hold up the texas blackouts marked the third time the electric system failed to perform adequately in winter in recent years 1989 2011 and 2021 the devastating blackouts once again brought into sharp focus the fact that the united states is relying on an aging electrical grid that s increasingly unstable underfunded and incapable of taking us to a new energy future despite being the wealthiest country in the world the u s only ranks 13th in the quality of its infrastructure indeed our power grid is the weakest link in the ongoing energy transition last year a new study from uc berkeley and gridlab found that it will be economically feasible for renewable energy to power 90 of a reliable grid by 2035 while only depending on natural gas for 10 of annual electricity production unfortunately whereas renewable power sources have grown dramatically in recent years our aging electrical grid is simply incapable of fully integrating them into our energy use leading to so much potential power wasted yet therein lies a great investment opportunity a wood mackenzie analysis has estimated the cost of shifting the u s power grid to 100 renewable energy over the next 10 years at a staggering 4 5 trillion that runs the gamut from constructing and operating new generation facilities investing in transmission and distribution infrastructure making capacity payments delivering customer facing grid edge technology and more president biden s 10 year 2 trillion american jobs plan seeks to re energize the power grid upgrade roads bridges and water systems and help make u s infrastructure more resilient to the impacts of climate change but that amount will hardly be enough to go the distance and private investors will have to step up to the plate modernizing the power grid alone will require 300 billion per year spread out over 15 years or double the current annual spending of 150 billion that s why investing in companies working hard to build the next generation grid could pay off big dividends for long term investors here are our top picks with good dividend growth

there s a major new arts philanthropist on the scene mackenzie scott a novelist who also happens to be the former wife of amazon founder jeff bezos announced today that she has donated a staggering 2 7 billion to 286 organizations across the country including many affiliated with the arts such as the studio museum in harlem the new england foundation for the arts and united states artists this marks the third time in 12 months that scott whose fortune forbes recently estimated at 60 billion has issued a wave of donations worth a combined ten figures it s also the first time she has funded arts organizations at scale the latest round of recipients also includes racial justice groups universities and other organizations absent from the list of arts recipients are big names that wealthy donors often favor such as the museum of modern art or lincoln center instead scott opted to fund smaller largely bipoc led groups including project row houses in houston texas the laundromat project and recess in brooklyn new york the east bay fund for artists in oakland california el museo de arte puerto rico in san juan and the national museum of mexican art in chicago illinois in another departure from traditional high dollar cultural philanthropy scott provides the funds up front and without restrictions to be used however the organizations see fit arts and cultural institutions can strengthen communities by transforming spaces fostering empathy reflecting community identity advancing economic mobility improving academic outcomes lowering crime rates and improving mental health scott wrote in blog post announcing the news so we evaluated smaller arts organizations creating these benefits with artists and audiences from culturally rich regions and identity groups that donors often overlook also included is new york s museum of chinese in america which suffered a devastating fire in early 2020 and the art for justice fund which funnels the proceeds of art sales into efforts to end mass incarceration to select the organizations scott and her current husband chemistry teacher dan jewett spent the first quarter of this year working with a team of researchers to identify equity oriented non profit teams working in areas that have been neglected scott s post named the chosen organizations but didn t specify how much each was given saying only that the gifts were relatively large souls grown deep which works to support self taught artists from the american south reported a grant of 2 million the mosaic network fund which funds arts nonprofits led by people of color in new york earned 5 million and united states artists which offers direct and unrestricted funds to artists and cultural practitioners received 7 million please spread the word about these remarkable teams and when you do please help shift the culture by making them the subject of your story or comments mackenzie scott mackenziescott june 15 2021 several recipients did not immediately respond to a query about the process of receiving the grants or how they were informed they had won the new york times reported that there is no formal application process representatives typically approach organizations to let them know they are under consideration for a major grant but forbid them to speak about the money until scott s announcement is public the lack of fanfare associated with the june 15 announcement which came in the form of a simple medium post rather than a costly pr blitz was part of the point according to scott putting large donors at the center of stories on social progress is a distortion of their role she wrote noting that she and jewett are attempting to give away a fortune that was enabled by systems in need of change deborah cullinan ceo of san francisco s yerba buena center for the arts another donation recipient said scott s donation is not only an investment in the arts it is a game changing new approach that upends traditional philanthropy and puts resources into the hands of people who are doing the urgent work of now scott s previous two major donations came in july and december of 2020 when she gave a combined 6 billion to 500 organizations few of which focused on the arts the bequests followed the 51 year old philanthropist s 2019 pledge to donate the majority of her personal fortune by or shortly after her death i will keep at it until the safe is empty she said at the time despite these monumental gifts however scott stands even further away from that goal today than she was in 2019 thanks to amazon s spring stock prices follow artnet news on facebook

more than half of americans feel they just aren t saving enough for retirement according to a 2019 bankrate survey but for those who have fallen behind it s always a great time to take stock of your 401 k plan and get moving on ways to set you up for greater wealth and financial security in your golden years a 401 k is an employer sponsored account that allows you to defer the taxes on your investments until retirement meaning you can roll up more money faster as a bonus many employers contribute matching funds to encourage you to save offering you free money for something that is already good to do the biggest mistake one can make is not saving for retirement at all says kevin driscoll vice president of advisory services at navy federal financial group if you re not investing in your retirement at all you re leaving money on the table anyone can take control of their finances it just requires proactive effort bankrate spoke with a number of financial experts to breakdown the top ways to set up your 401 k to thrive in 2021 and beyond investing can be difficult but the 401 k is one of the easiest ways to start investing and it s one of the best ways for americans to save for their golden years many of the actions below focus on small changes and then you can let stocks do what they do best go up over time 1 act now the best advice according to experts is to resolve to act now even if your contributions are modest many workers set up or adjust their retirement plans as the new year begins but you can set up or adjust your plan at any time the new year is a time to review retirement savings goals and make sure 401 k benefits are maximized says ed farrington executive vice president at natixis investment managers natixis surveyed americans with access to a 401 k and found that they understand the value of investing for the future even if they don t always do it the 2017 survey found that millennials for instance are buying homes raising families and paying off school debt only one in four 25 percent is focused on retirement planning says farrington the same survey revealed that baby boomers biggest regret about retirement preparation is that they didn t start sooner the more time you give your money to grow the greater its returns are likely to be over time act today to get your 401 k in order or to start investing bankrate s 401 k calculator can help you see where your savings stand 2 grab all the free cash from your company s match to get started on a tangible level take a look at your company s 401 k options says driscoll many companies offer an incentive match encouraging you to invest part of your paycheck into a retirement fund whatever they match put that percentage into your retirement fund it s free money the incentive match is one of the best parts maybe the single best of the 401 k plan and the employer match is the easiest safest money you could ever make offering you an immediate return for doing what you need to do anyway many employers will match 50 percent of your contribution and sometimes as much as 100 percent up to a certain amount a few employers do even better than that although many employers do not offer a match at all ensure you have contributed enough to get the full company match says kirk kinder certified financial planner at picket fence financial in bel air maryland there isn t any legit reason not to get the full match 3 get more aggressive if you have a long time until you retire you re probably going to be better off having a portfolio that s more aggressive that means your portfolio will likely have more stocks in it and fewer fixed income investments such as bonds and cds in fact if you re more than a decade away from retirement it could be a huge mistake to be too conservative over time a diversified portfolio of stocks can return more than a typical bond portfolio the standard poor s 500 index has gained an average of about 10 percent annually for decades and with retirees living longer than ever they re going to need to ensure their investments offer a high rate of return many 401 k plans have target date funds that automatically shift your aggressive assets into safer ones as you approach your retirement date these target date funds can be a good solution for investors who don t want the hassle and headache of managing their own portfolio i m a big fan of target date funds says mark wilson founder and president at mile wealth management most of these are well diversified wisely built and auto rebalanced unfortunately i often find that they are too conservative nobody needs all of their nest eggs on the day they retire so why would you have 20 percent or less of your investments in stocks on the day you retire asks wilson retirees have a long horizon and will need to have some stocks to keep ahead of taxes and inflation wilson recommends using a target date fund that s 10 15 years longer than when you expected to retire because it will have a greater allocation to stocks for example if you would normally take a 2040 target date fund consider a 2050 or 2055 one instead the extra years on the fund should help you generate a higher return and better maintain your standard of living 4 but avoid being too aggressive if you have a long time horizon it can be smart to get aggressive with your portfolio but those closer to retirement should be careful too for retirees and pre retirees it may be time to shift into preserving your assets rather than trying to play catch up yet many are focused on growing their assets including aggressive investment strategies rather than preserving their assets against sudden market downturns says david potter former spokesperson for massmutual financial citing the company s research many people may be taking more risk than they realize potter suggests that investors reevaluate their portfolio regularly to consider how they would fare if the market declines significantly typically financial professionals recommend that retirement savers dial back their exposure to stocks as they get within five years of retirement and within the first five years after retiring he says a steep market downturn of 20 percent or more during those periods could irreversibly reduce your income in retirement 5 consider rebalancing the various positions in a portfolio grow at different rates and over time the portfolio can move from its target allocations investors should look at their portfolios to see if they need to be rebalanced rebalancing returns the 401 k from its current allocation to its target allocation for example if your target allocation was 50 percent bonds and 50 percent stocks it may have grown to 40 percent bonds and 60 percent stocks over the last few years as stocks soared by rebalancing investors can take some of their appreciated assets and buy underappreciated assets effectively selling high and buying low think about opening a roth 401 k if you re looking ahead a few years you may also want to consider opening a specific type of 401 k called a roth 401 k with the roth version you pay with after tax money but you re able to enjoy tax free withdrawals at retirement here are all the details on the roth 401 k tax rates are relatively low so now could be a good time to fund a roth 401 k rather than a traditional 401 k with the trump tax law due to sunset in 2025 we are facing higher rates in the future says kinder it could be an excellent time to utilize the roth 401 k option and take advantage of the lower rates now this is especially true for folks under 40 or folks in the 10 percent or 12 percent tax bracket lower tax rates mean that the cost to take advantage of the roth plan is lower since you pay with after tax money taxpayers in higher brackets may find their break on current taxes is more advantageous however and stick to the traditional 401 k plan bottom line the 401 k is an excellent vehicle to save for retirement and it s a great time to join the many other workers who are securing their financial futures by saving and investing many of the top moves to make are easy and painless and some can even

president joe biden and russian president vladimir putin meeting in person june 16 the white house announcing the meeting saying the two leaders quote will discuss the full range of pressing issues as we seek to restore predictability and stability to the us russia relationship unquote it will take place in geneva at the end of biden s first trip abroad to europe in march biden called putin a killer moscow then recalled its ambassador to washington the kremlin said in its own statement quote we intend to discuss the state and prospects of further development of russian american relations problems of strategic stability as well as topical issues on the international agenda including interaction in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic and the settlement of regional conflicts unquote advertisement biden and putin are to meet on wednesday the two leaders have divergent goals for the summit share copy link copy an american president won t side with moscow over his own intelligence agencies there will be no talk of a reset in russian relations and it is highly doubtful that anyone will gaze into vladimir putin s eyes and discuss his soul but beyond that it s not clear what will happen wednesday in geneva when president joe biden meets putin for the first time since taking office both sides acknowledge that the relationship between the two nations is dismal and neither holds out much hope for meaningful areas of agreement still each man brings his own goals to the summit table a look at what each president is hoping to achieve in switzerland what biden wantsbiden and his aides have made clear that he will not follow in the footsteps of his recent predecessors by aiming to radically alter the united states ties to russia instead the white house is looking for a more modest though still vitally important goal to move toward a more predictable relationship and attempt to rein in russia s disruptive behavior biden s first overseas trip was deliberately sequenced so that he will meet with putin only after spending days meeting with european allies and powerful democracies including a gathering at nato the decades old alliance formed to serve as a bulwark to russian aggression he hoped to project a sense of unity and renewed cooperation after four years of tumult under former president donald trump who often tried to cozy up to the russian president biden will push putin to stop meddling in democratic elections to ease tensions with ukraine and to stop giving safe harbor to hackers carrying out cyber and ransomware attacks aides believe that lowering the temperature with russia will also reinforce the united states ties to democracies existing in moscow s shadow national security adviser jake sullivan said biden will look for areas where in our common interest we can work together to produce outcomes that are that work for the united states and for the american people sullivan who briefed reporters on air force one heading to brussels for the nato summit said that biden s other message would be more stick than carrot how do we send a clear message about those harmful activities that we will not tolerate and to which we will respond there have been brief moments of common ground moscow and washington have shown a shared interest in restarting talks on strategic stability to work out a follow up deal to the new start the last remaining u s russian arms control pact that was extended for five years in january biden will exhort putin on human rights including the poisoning and imprisonment of dissident alexei navalny to not support the regime in belarus that carried out a recent skyjacking and to stop interfering with other nations elections cyber will also be a focal point with the geneva summit coming just days after nato expanded its article 5 mutual defense pact to include cyberattacks but the president acknowledged that there may be no way to keep putin in check there s no guarantee you can change a person s behavior or the behavior of his country autocrats have enormous power and they don t have to answer to a public said biden during a news conference sunday after the group of seven summit in england and the fact is that it may very well be if i respond in kind which i will that it doesn t dissuade him and he wants to keep going biden had not minced words when it comes to assessing putin he said in an interview earlier this year that he agreed with an assessment that putin was a killer and he once declared that putin didn t have a soul that was far colder rhetoric that his immediate predecessors trump spoke warmly of putin and was deferential to him during their one summit held in helsinki in 2018 in which he turned his back on his own intelligence agencies president barack obama s administration though wary of putin expressed hope in a reset and improvement of relations with moscow and george w bush said that he looked the man in the eye and found him very straightforward and trustworthy i was able to get a sense of his soul bush said biden won t what putin wantsputin also won t be expecting to warm up ties his main goal would be to draw his red lines to the new u s administration and negotiate a tense status quo that would protect moscow s vital interests the russian leader doesn t hope for a new détente to mend the rift caused by russia s 2014 annexation of ukraine s crimean peninsula nor does he count on a rollback of the crippling u s and eu sanctions that have restricted moscow s access to global financial markets and top western technologies putin s task now is more modest to spell out russia s top security concerns and try to restore basic channels of communication that would prevent an even more dangerous destabilization the main red line for moscow is ukraine s aspirations to join nato fearing its bid for the alliance membership putin responded to the 2014 ouster of ukraine s russia friendly president by annexing crimea and throwing moscow s weight behind a separatist insurgency in the country s eastern industrial heartland where the seven year conflict has killed more than 14 000 when tensions along the line of contact in ukraine s east rose earlier this year russia quickly beefed up its troops near ukraine and warned kiev s leaders that it would intervene militarily if they try to reclaim the rebel controlled regions by force moscow has since pulled back some of its forces from the border areas but the ukrainian leadership has said the bulk of them have remained close to the border in an interview with state tv last week putin described ukraine s bid to join nato as an existential challenge to russia that would allow the alliance s missiles to hit moscow and other targets in western russia in just seven minutes he compared it to russia deploying its missiles in canada or mexico near the u s border isn t it a red line he said while taking a tough stance on ukraine the russian leader could show a degree of flexibility on other global hotspots even though moscow has been critical of the u s led military campaign in afghanistan it s interested in a settlement that would prevent the country from plunging into chaos following the u s troops withdrawal later this year fearing that instability could spill into ex soviet central asia russia also has been involved in painstaking international talks to help repair a nuclear deal with iran that was spiked by trump and it has expressed a willingness to cooperate with the u s in efforts to restart the stalled mideast peace talks and the kremlin would be interested in working out a deal on syria where moscow s military campaign helped president bashar assad s government reclaim control over most of the country after a devastating civil war and the u s has maintained a limited military presence russia has said it s ready to include its prospective doomsday weapons such as the poseidon atomic powered nuclear armed underwater drone and the burevestnik nuclear powered cruise missile to the talks agenda on condition the u s brings its missile defense and possible space based weapons into the equation putin also has emphasized russia s readiness to make joint efforts to address climate change and cope with the coronavirus pandemic he called for establishing a dialogue on cybercrime noting that moscow could agree to extradite cybercrime suspects to the u s if washington takes the same obligation the white house has strongly downplayed the idea of a cybercriminal prisoner exchange

pitcher partners partner mark harrison discusses how retailers can work to lockdown proof supply and distribution channels it s been 18 months since the first news of covid in china sent shudders through world economies and the reaction of some australian businesses still ranges from hopeful to head in the sand for businesses based around the sale of goods the fragility of retail supply and distribution channels has been laid bare they are prone to interruption not only from lockdowns or restrictions on movement but growing international tensions the cancellation of regular flights and the situation on the ground in a dozen or more countries that provide the bulk of our supplies and as the latest lockdown in victoria shows despite the sluggish vaccine rollout and an intermittent return to business as usual this pandemic won t be over any time soon uncertainty lingering over supply chain disruption remains a factor for more than one in five businesses when assessing future capital expenditure plans and it is an issue that is top of mind when we speak to retail clients about their confidence going forward as every hotel quarantine leak and lockdown proves businesses have no control over the events happening around them and when a change comes it will come with little or no notice unlike previous months there s also no jobkeeper to fall back on for affected businesses and little financial support on offer from the victorian government relative to the revenue lost and the costs that must be carried all retailers can do is plot a defence that will offer some protection if problems arise from their supply and distribution rethink delivery time frames india s terrible covid 19 suffering in recent months and the ongoing tensions with china remain a threat to the supply network of raw products and manufacturing that many australian businesses rely on a shorter lead in time for products particularly those that carry seasonal stock such as fashion needs to be factored into plans and retailers should be thinking about contingencies to deal with the impact of stock shortages australian retailers also need an eye on what is happening offshore in end markets the us is seeing the same massive retail rebound australia experienced in late 2020 but on a much much bigger scale the massive demand for supply there as well as in a recovering europe will also make it harder for australia s retailers to compete for supply a further looming challenge lies in the cost of bringing in raw materials or finished goods port congestion a global demand for shipping and even the large vessel that got stuck in the suez have combined to push up the price of maritime freight doubling or tripling the cost of transporting a container on many routes there is also an international shortage of shipping containers which is leading to delays and adding to the cost inevitably this will raise the cost of products at the local level particularly for goods that must be shipped to meet seasonal demand or tight customer timeframes build contingency plans before you need them as potential consequences increase in severity so does the importance of an effective risk management process business leaders who feel their company is exposed on supply must start by reinforcing relationships with existing partners while mapping where risks lie explore different channels for shipping materials and products as well as backup or alternate suppliers and ensure communication channels are healthy use them to assess potential looming issues are you moving into seasonal weather that could knock out roads or damage plants where products are manufactured how likely is another covid 19 breakout that will hamper your distribution networks lay down a plan to cover different contingencies and outline the stakeholders you will need to alert if supply issues emerge retailers cannot keep issues to themselves or they risk destroying trust keep existing and prospective customers informed about products and stock movements it is that engagement whether through social media email or other channels that ensures the presence of your brand remains front of mind the time to build contingencies is while business is healthy when problems emerge it s too late to start reinforcing relationships or building new plans look more broadly and more locally as the first waves of the pandemic swamped us more than a year ago the disruption dished up a crash course for retailers about the importance of diversifying their supply chains the lesson was that retail businesses must continually examine and reassess their networks and seek to remain nimble the reality is for those who produce goods such as clothing nowhere can do it as cheaply as china and india however part of the risk assessment is weighing up other areas that might offset higher production costs how does the higher costs of production in another jurisdiction such as australia sit against the threat from shipping disruption or lockdowns closing factories overseas how will freight costs change the calculation the cost of textile and clothing production for example is high in australia compared to china and india but the price of raw materials such as wool and cotton are well off their peaks reached the last 12 years turnaround times may be faster than overseas and smaller batch production may allow for at least partial local production which may offset higher costs take the opportunity to reassess the landscape if your target market is local there is also a powerful marketing message to be drawn from using australian products and manufacturing data from roy morgan shows 93 of australians are more likely to buy products made in australia if australia doesn t work out vietnam bangladesh and latin america are important to explore along with eastern europe and the middle east but these manufacturing scenarios will have an impact on a business model and if the additional costs cannot be absorbed product pricing must change and that affects competitiveness the worst of the covid crisis may be over but the pandemic has morphed into a supply chain challenge that will be with us for years to come for retailers the lesson is that risk can t be eliminated but repeatedly assessing and testing the robustness of your channels is the only way to stay prepared for the worst
after months of nato secretary general jens stoltenberg mercilessly tediously denouncing russia and china ahead of yesterday s summit the communiqué issued after it finally raised china s ire two of the document s 79 points addressed china the second was conciliatory the first was confrontational it was the first time the 30 nation military bloc so overtly directed harsh language of that nature at china in an official publication the opening sentence of section 55 contends that china s stated ambitions and assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules based international order and to areas relevant to alliance security a threat to an individual member of nato can result in the activation of its article 5 war clause china was accused of endangering the security of the entire alliance specifically china was charged with coercive policies that are the antithesis of the fundamental values enshrined in the washington treaty nato s founding document expanding its stock of nuclear weapons and more sophisticated delivery systems to establish a nuclear triad being opaque in modernizing its military being equally opaque in relation to what is called its military civil fusion strategy lack of transparency use of disinformation engaging in military cooperation with russia the last point is worth examining although the communiqué specifies concern about that cooperation including exercises in the euro atlantic area in general no distinction is made between a military exercise in say the pacific ocean and the so called euro atlantic area to lecture a nation in regard to who it can engage in military cooperation with is overt diktat is an insult to its sovereignty the u s and its nato allies regularly conduct military exercises in nations bordering china the khaan quest exercise in mongolia and the steppe eagle exercise in kazakhstan and in nearby cambodia angkor sentinel as well as naval exercises with several neighboring nations off china s coast china has not threatened local nations for participating in those the nato summit communiqué mentioned for example strengthening military ties with its partners across the globe members japan south korea and australia while attacking china for engaging in military exercises with its neighbor russia neither has it threatened other asia pacific nations for joining nato military partnership programs several of which nations border china afghanistan kazakhstan kyrgyzstan mongolia pakistan and tajikistan china responded accordingly and quickly to the above writ of indictment the spokesman of the nation s mission to the european union china doesn t have a mission to nato as many of its asia pacific neighbors do denied that china presents systemic challenges to other nations much less to all of europe and north america nato was accused of slander and of misjudging the current international political climate in fact of mixing cold war thinking and bloc mentality with normal state to state relations the statement also ascribed the motivation for the attack to the administration of u s president joe biden china already has a blood debt to settle with nato one it has never forgotten for the military bloc s killing of three journalists and the wounding of 27 other chinese in belgrade in 1999 and it has come in for an unrelenting barrage of insult and vilification from nato in the months leading up to the summit see here and here and here and here and here in response to the above charges against china the global times said this this nato summit can be seen as a key point in the us and europe s attitude toward china in the security arena washington has raised the curtain for a political mobilization campaign to use the nato bloc to carry out strategic competition with china the eu mission spokesperson s comment also included a reminder that china s defense budget for this year is 209 billion 1 35 trillion yuan which is 1 3 of the chinese gross domestic product less even than the 2 demanded of nato member states in contrast the 30 member nato alliance has a total military spending as high as 1 17 trillion making up over half of the global sum and 5 6 times that of china the statement also mentioned that the world who knows which country s military bases stretch all over the world and aircraft carriers are wandering around to flex their military muscle it also recalled that the u s alone has almost 20 times the amount of nuclear as weapons as china does and invited nato to match china s commitment to the no first use of nuclear weapons and unconditionally not using or threatening to use nuclear weapons against non nuclear weapon states or zones one knows what the answer to that offer will be the chinese official said i would like to ask whether nato and its member states which are striving for peace security and stability can make the same commitment as china one knows what the answer to that question would be the response to nato also contained words particularly worth heeding china has been committed to peaceful development but will never forget the tragedy of the bombing of the chinese embassy in yugoslavia nor the sacrifices of our compatriots homes and lives we will unswervingly defend our sovereignty and development interests and keep a close eye on nato s strategic adjustments and policies toward china not content to have dragooned almost the entire european continent into its ranks to have waged wars of aggression against countries in three continents none of them remotely near the euro atlantic area and recruited forty partners to add to its thirty members nato is now challenging and confronting china an opinion piece in china daily no enemy nato will create one had this to say about nato s throwing down the gauntlet to china of moving from one adversary to another from the soviet union to yugoslavia to libya to china by imposing their role of imaginary enemy upon china nato is hurting the interests of the whole world its own members included and the only side that benefits is nato itself because it finds an excuse to continue existing and spending the 2 5 billion collected from western taxpayers pockets the loss in treasure is great the loss of blood may be far greater rick rozoff is a contributing editor at antiwar com he has been involved in anti war and anti interventionist work in various capacities for forty years he lives in chicago illinois he is the manager of stop nato this originally appeared at anti bellum
more than half of americans feel they just aren t saving enough for retirement according to a 2019 bankrate survey but for those who have fallen behind it s always a great time to take stock of your 401 k plan and get moving on ways to set you up for greater wealth and financial security in your golden years a 401 k is an employer sponsored account that allows you to defer the taxes on your investments until retirement meaning you can roll up more money faster as a bonus many employers contribute matching funds to encourage you to save offering you free money for something that is already good to do the biggest mistake one can make is not saving for retirement at all says kevin driscoll vice president of advisory services at navy federal financial group if you re not investing in your retirement at all you re leaving money on the table anyone can take control of their finances it just requires proactive effort bankrate spoke with a number of financial experts to breakdown the top ways to set up your 401 k to thrive in 2021 and beyond investing can be difficult but the 401 k is one of the easiest ways to start investing and it s one of the best ways for americans to save for their golden years many of the actions below focus on small changes and then you can let stocks do what they do best go up over time 1 act now the best advice according to experts is to resolve to act now even if your contributions are modest many workers set up or adjust their retirement plans as the new year begins but you can set up or adjust your plan at any time the new year is a time to review retirement savings goals and make sure 401 k benefits are maximized says ed farrington executive vice president at natixis investment managers natixis surveyed americans with access to a 401 k and found that they understand the value of investing for the future even if they don t always do it the 2017 survey found that millennials for instance are buying homes raising families and paying off school debt only one in four 25 percent is focused on retirement planning says farrington the same survey revealed that baby boomers biggest regret about retirement preparation is that they didn t start sooner the more time you give your money to grow the greater its returns are likely to be over time act today to get your 401 k in order or to start investing bankrate s 401 k calculator can help you see where your savings stand 2 grab all the free cash from your company s match to get started on a tangible level take a look at your company s 401 k options says driscoll many companies offer an incentive match encouraging you to invest part of your paycheck into a retirement fund whatever they match put that percentage into your retirement fund it s free money the incentive match is one of the best parts maybe the single best of the 401 k plan and the employer match is the easiest safest money you could ever make offering you an immediate return for doing what you need to do anyway many employers will match 50 percent of your contribution and sometimes as much as 100 percent up to a certain amount a few employers do even better than that although many employers do not offer a match at all ensure you have contributed enough to get the full company match says kirk kinder certified financial planner at picket fence financial in bel air maryland there isn t any legit reason not to get the full match 3 get more aggressive if you have a long time until you retire you re probably going to be better off having a portfolio that s more aggressive that means your portfolio will likely have more stocks in it and fewer fixed income investments such as bonds and cds in fact if you re more than a decade away from retirement it could be a huge mistake to be too conservative over time a diversified portfolio of stocks can return more than a typical bond portfolio the standard poor s 500 index has gained an average of about 10 percent annually for decades and with retirees living longer than ever they re going to need to ensure their investments offer a high rate of return many 401 k plans have target date funds that automatically shift your aggressive assets into safer ones as you approach your retirement date these target date funds can be a good solution for investors who don t want the hassle and headache of managing their own portfolio i m a big fan of target date funds says mark wilson founder and president at mile wealth management most of these are well diversified wisely built and auto rebalanced unfortunately i often find that they are too conservative nobody needs all of their nest eggs on the day they retire so why would you have 20 percent or less of your investments in stocks on the day you retire asks wilson retirees have a long horizon and will need to have some stocks to keep ahead of taxes and inflation wilson recommends using a target date fund that s 10 15 years longer than when you expected to retire because it will have a greater allocation to stocks for example if you would normally take a 2040 target date fund consider a 2050 or 2055 one instead the extra years on the fund should help you generate a higher return and better maintain your standard of living 4 but avoid being too aggressive if you have a long time horizon it can be smart to get aggressive with your portfolio but those closer to retirement should be careful too for retirees and pre retirees it may be time to shift into preserving your assets rather than trying to play catch up yet many are focused on growing their assets including aggressive investment strategies rather than preserving their assets against sudden market downturns says david potter former spokesperson for massmutual financial citing the company s research many people may be taking more risk than they realize potter suggests that investors reevaluate their portfolio regularly to consider how they would fare if the market declines significantly typically financial professionals recommend that retirement savers dial back their exposure to stocks as they get within five years of retirement and within the first five years after retiring he says a steep market downturn of 20 percent or more during those periods could irreversibly reduce your income in retirement 5 consider rebalancing the various positions in a portfolio grow at different rates and over time the portfolio can move from its target allocations investors should look at their portfolios to see if they need to be rebalanced rebalancing returns the 401 k from its current allocation to its target allocation for example if your target allocation was 50 percent bonds and 50 percent stocks it may have grown to 40 percent bonds and 60 percent stocks over the last few years as stocks soared by rebalancing investors can take some of their appreciated assets and buy underappreciated assets effectively selling high and buying low think about opening a roth 401 k if you re looking ahead a few years you may also want to consider opening a specific type of 401 k called a roth 401 k with the roth version you pay with after tax money but you re able to enjoy tax free withdrawals at retirement here are all the details on the roth 401 k tax rates are relatively low so now could be a good time to fund a roth 401 k rather than a traditional 401 k with the trump tax law due to sunset in 2025 we are facing higher rates in the future says kinder it could be an excellent time to utilize the roth 401 k option and take advantage of the lower rates now this is especially true for folks under 40 or folks in the 10 percent or 12 percent tax bracket lower tax rates mean that the cost to take advantage of the roth plan is lower since you pay with after tax money taxpayers in higher brackets may find their break on current taxes is more advantageous however and stick to the traditional 401 k plan bottom line the 401 k is an excellent vehicle to save for retirement and it s a great time to join the many other workers who are securing their financial futures by saving and investing many of the top moves to make are easy and painless and some can even reward you with a bonus for your effort ___ comparing minimum wage to the cost of living in every state comparing minimum wage to the cost of living in every state alabama alaska arizona arkansas

financialnewsmedia com news commentary palm beach fla june 15 2021 prnewswire the modern psychedelic renaissance has empirically proven that psychedelic drugs are going to revolutionize mental health treatment before these incredibly promising medicines can get to the people who need them the most they must pass through the extensive drug development pipeline where ip patents are crucial it seems that a week doesn t go by without a psychedelic company saying it has filed for a new patent an informative article on microdose explains the reasons why psychedelic companies are pursuing these patents first the plants that the medicines are based on can t be patented products in nature belong to the public and thus can t be patented microdose wrote one company cannot claim it as intellectual property to exclusively profit from it however companies can create new molecules based on natural psychedelics to create an improved drug these new altered molecules are patentable and provide the necessary framework to create new and focused treatments for different neurological and psychological health conditions from their natural predecessors if a company can get the patent then it allows the treatment to be developed active companies in news today include nextleaf solutions ltd otcqb oilff cse oils mindmed nasdaq mnmd numinus wellness inc otcpk lkysf tsx v numi field trip health ltd otcqx ftrpf cse ftrp cardiol therapeutics inc otcqx crtpf tsx crdl microdose article continued with without patents competitors could easily duplicate the manufacturing of a drug and there would be no incentive for anyone to create these new treatments many of these companies are filing for provisional patents these applications are issued by the u s patent and trademark office uspto and it helps to protect a new invention from being copied during the 12 month period before a formal patent application is filed the idea is that it gives a company to test or refine a product before committing to the expensive and time intensive process of a formal application in more mature markets filing for patents would be a nonevent but since psychedelics are so new these are worth watching there is clearly a land grab for application processes as well as formulations while some of it feels like these companies are casting a wide net it surely makes sense to be creative and file now at the beginning of the mushroom mania this is an incredible opportunity for advanced and innovative drug developers to create novel psychedelic drugs that can offer massive benefits beyond traditional psychedelic drugs however this pathway requires significant capital time and skill patenting is one of the most important steps to bringing a new drug to market one of the companies in play in this exploding market is nextleaf with its 80 issued global patents which is using its proven track record to explore more complex cannabinoid based treatments for development of psychedelic therapies and treatments nextleaf solutions ltd otcqb oilff cse oils breaking news nextleaf launches specialty molecules division thc o acetate to be produced through company s specialty molecule division nextleaf solutions ltd nextleaf oils or the company an extraction company that owns one of the largest portfolios of u s patents for the extraction and distillation of cannabinoids is pleased to announce the launch of a specialty molecules division to focus on the development and commercialization of novel and psychedelic molecules the division is supported by the company s existing intellectual property portfolio including the manufacturing of cbd o acetate and the recently announced u s patent for the synthesis of thc o acetate the purpose of this new division is to leverage nextleaf s existing intellectual property and delivery technology to develop ip protected therapeutic products from novel molecules said paul pedersen chief executive officer of oils the commercial opportunity for our speciality molecules division is to partner with larger organizations looking for differentiation by leveraging nextleaf s intellectual property and metro vancouver based licensed innovation lab and extraction plant to manufacture speciality molecules under our health canada licenses we anticipate our specialty molecules division will play a major role in the long term value creation thanks to the disruptive nature of our acetylation ip said pedersen there is increased focus and investment from large cannabis and pharma companies in novel cannabinoid based products with wellness and therapeutic applications an example is british american tobacco s recent 221 million investment in organigram the company expects to announce a future r d and innovation agreement with a large strategic partner operating in the cannabis and pharmaceutical space the initial focus of the specialty molecules division is commercializing more complex cannabinoid based treatments that may provide an alternative to opioid based medications the company currently holds the prerequisite licensing necessary under the cannabis act to commercialize thc o acetate in canada thc o acetate nextleaf intends to develop therapeutic products from its intellectual property pertaining to the acetylation of cannabinoids the company expects to release adult use products with thc o acetate which to the best of the company s knowledge has never been sold under a legal framework the company believes a thc derived product produced with its patented acetylation process may hold significant potential as a therapeutic due to thc o acetate reportedly having pronounced psychedelic effects compared to delta 9 thc and positive outcomes in the treatment of cancer chronic pain ptsd and alcohol use disorder nextleaf s u s and canadian issued patents describe a process of acetylating thc by refluxing naturally derived thc distillate in the presence of a single reactant with thc o acetate the product of the reaction this u s patent covers our method of thc acetylation and follows our previous patent for synthesizing thc o acetate with improvements to reaction efficiencies said patent author dr david novitski our latest patented method reduces processing time and costs which are critical when scaling up any drug delivery technology and thc o acetate is no different continued read this and more

pharmacogenetic data on lsd to help personalize dosing the study results from a pooled secondary analysis of four phase 1 studies that each used a randomized double blind placebo controlled crossover

shrimpers are seeking permission to trawl along the federally protected oculina bank which treasure coast conservationists say will cause lasting damage to the unique coral reef found nowhere else on the planet federal fishery managers will vote on the request thursday and are seeking public comment on the controversial issue until 4 p m wednesday the south atlantic fishery management council is likely to approve the request said john reed a research professor at florida atlantic university s harbor branch oceanographic institute in fort pierce who helped discover the reef in 1975 lophelia reefs south atlantic council projects deep sea corals reef mapping harbor branch uses first of their kind submersibles eve samples we must protect bathtub beach reef approval would allow rock shrimp trawlers to pull nets along the seafloor on the eastern boundary of the oculina bank habitat area of particular concern which ranges from fort pierce north to st augustine according to the proposal the conservation alliance of st lucie county is among the environmental nonprofits lobbying against the proposal i think it would be disastrous president shari anker said everything is so fragile we have a marine protected area that s supposed to be a preserve and they re chipping away at what is already established as protected scroll down for information on how to submit public comment what is the oculina bank and why is it ecologically important the bank is an expansive ecosystem of ivory tree coral called oculina whose mounds stretch up to 100 feet tall in water as deep as 300 feet reed has spent decades leading the charge to protect the fragile ecosystem we have the opportunity to try to protect this and let it grow back and it won t happen if it keeps getting impacted by chopping down its borders reed told tcpalm tuesday this is a unique community that occurs nowhere else shrimpers say they need to be allowed to fish where they once did to make a living about 20 vessels most based in the titusville area were permitted to harvest rock shrimp from the atlantic in 2015 19 with eight dealers purchasing their catch according to the south atlantic council records scroll down to read reed s letter to the council among those with deep connections to that fishing industry is laurilee thompson owner of the dixie crossroads seafood restaurant in titusville home of the rock shrimp and member of the south atlantic council s deepwater shrimp advisory panel her father rodney was known as the daddy of the rock shrimp industry and helped introduce the seafood across the state we fished there for a long long time thompson said of the reef system we d like to be able to continue to fish there as a clean water advocate for the indian river lagoon thompson said she also understands conservationists objections to the proposal i can understand the shrimpers desire to be able to fish where they historically had fished thompson said but i can also understand the desire to protect that transitional area how could shrimp trawling damage the oculina bank coral reef the proposed trawling area contains 29 muddy sediment on the seafloor which could be stirred up and blanket the reef reed said weights on the bottom of a general shrimp trawl net which are meant to stay open to entrap shrimp can penetrate nearly 6 inches into the seafloor according to university of miami research shrimpers say they d trawl parallel to the reef and claim the sediment would float back down to the seafloor without making its way to the corals but surface currents can be drastically different than seafloor currents reed said there s no way the trawlers can know the current conditions on the bottom reed wrote to the south atlantic council in a letter dated june 11 anker said she urged 400 alliance members to weigh in on the council s public comment period the shrimping industry s trawling creates sedimentation that is destructive to corals even if it occurs next to and not right on top of the corals the alliance wrote its members the reef faces more danger from polluted stormwater runoff flowing into the ocean from nearby cities than it does from commercial fishing thompson said in my opinion sewage from south florida has much more of a dangerous impact on the oculina reef than allowing a few rock shrimp boats to go back to trawling where they once used to fish she said a rule change is a lengthy process the proposal comes on the heels of a trump era executive order to reopen protected areas closed to commercial fishers and remove many fishing regulations the lengthy process to change the rules begins with thursday s vote by the south atlantic council s habitat committee spokesperson kim iverson said after that a vote is taken by the 13 council members who oversee conservation and management of fish stocks in the atlantic from north carolina to key west members include commercial and recreational fishers and government officials from agencies such as the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission if the council approves the proposal the national marine fisheries service begins its review process if that agency approves the u s department of commerce must give final approval according to iverson more often than not it s years iverson said of the process how you can submit public comment register to watch the webinar at register

by ank kuipers and brian ellsworth paramaribo caracas reuters suriname on tuesday said creditors were taking a confrontational attitude toward debt restructuring talks after bondholders rolled back a deal to delay payments escalating a dispute between investors and the small south american nation a creditor committee which includes franklin templeton eaton vance nyse and greylock partners on monday said it had triggered a termination clause on notes maturing in 2023 and 2026 scrapping a plan struck in april to defer payments on the securities with an outstanding balance of 675 million the dispute in part hinges on the handling of future oil revenue from recent crude discoveries suriname says it is too soon for those funds to appear on its books while creditors insist they should be a factor in the debt talks suriname s finance ministry said it regrets the non constructive and confrontational attitude it added that there was no alternative to creditors accepting a loss in response to the bondholders decision suriname s opposition parties on tuesday said they fear for suriname s international reputation now the government cannot meet its financial obligations president chan santokhi who was elected in 2020 said in a national assembly session that his government assumed office with a debt at 160 of gdp we have offered our proposals they have responded that they do not agree with that is that the end of the world no santokhi said we are showing leadership and we are continuing to negotiate creditors said the 70 haircut proposed by suriname does not take into account its capacity to pay nor the country s own description of its bright economic future suriname s bond prices were little changed on tuesday but have fallen sharply since the government proposal early this month bondholders have also complained about not being sufficiently involved in suriname s negotiations with the international monetary fund for a 690 million financing deal suriname says including future oil revenues in its current economic models would be inconsistent with imf guidelines and that it provided creditors with ample details of its financial situation it was not immediately evident what legal actions if any the creditor committee would take against suriname or if the government was readying a new proposal the bondholder committee did not immediately reply to a request for comment
