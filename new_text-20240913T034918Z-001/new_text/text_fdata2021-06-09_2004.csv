janet yellen s at it again ms janet yellen is talking again from comments sunday if we ended up with a slightly higher interest rate environment it would actually be a plus for society s point of view and the fed s point of view a higher interest rate environment would likely arise from a higher inflation environment inflation is presently on the jump is it transient as the federal reserve insists or is it a mere foretaste of inflation to come expert opinion divides yet we would like to ask ms yellen this question precisely how does higher inflation benefit society gradually falling prices a lovely deflation are the telltales of economic progress falling prices stretch the dollar in a fellow s wallet his dollar fetches him more goods each year that passes taking the average should we sob over the declining prices of computers madame treasury secretary an inferior 500 000 computer a hewlett packard 3000 fetched 95 000 in 1972 or over 500 000 in 2021 s money today s computers run laps and laps around the 1972 computer and at the price of only several hundred dollars are the inflationists yelling blue murder why not come forward a bit an apple macintosh powerbook went for 2 299 in 1991 in today s money 4 247 this particular model is no longer on offer but you can take home today s version a far more formidable version for under 1 000 deluxe versions cost greater yet should it go for even less money than it does 1 in 1991 is the rough approximate of 2 04 in 2021 inflation has chewed its way through the dollar at an average 2 33 each year yielding a cumulative 105 price increase reduced to essentials 2021 s dollar packs half the oomph of 1991 s dollar that is we are the collective victims of a camouflaged swindle a slow but steady pocket picking a creeping larceny assume 2021 s dollar equaled 1991 s dollar today s computer might go for 500 rather than 1 000 which version would you prefer did you answer the 500 version then off you go to the ivy leagues for remedial economic instruction you must come to appreciate inflation s blessings and deflation s curses both right and wrong yet let us scrutinize ms yellen s claim that a slightly higher interest rate environment would actually be a plus for society s point of view is it possible to be both right and wrong at once it is yes higher interest rates may well count plus from society s viewpoint as jim rickards explained recently yellen s first mistake is the belief that higher interest rates are the way to cool inflation interest rates are not a leading indicator they are a lagging indicator higher interest rates do not signal coming inflation they signal that inflation is already here higher rates are not generally bad higher rates are usually associated with stronger growth they mean that growing businesses are competing for funds and willing to pay more to get them banks can pick and choose from among borrowers and charge higher rates as a result in short higher rates can signal a strong economy what is more higher interest rates attract savings and economic growth rises from a bedrock foundation of savings savings form the granite core of all investment all consumption but today s economy does not rest upon the bedrock of savings it rests rather upon the sand of artificially low rates any substantial increase in interest rates could knock it down no room for rising rates total united states debt public and private exceeds 85 trillion rising interest rates elevate the burden of that debt consider the impact of rising rates on the public finances alone as we have explained before since 2007 total united states debt public and private has ballooned an impossible 30 trillion meantime the gross domestic product has expanded merely 7 trillion today s rates fall substantially beneath 2007 s rates yet due to today s dizzyingly greater debt volume each incremental rate increase weighs further upon the shoulders how much heavier mr larry mcdonald publisher of the bear traps report a 50 basis point move today in yields relative to 10 years ago wipes out literally the entire budget of the marines the navy and the army in other words because there s so much debt today relative to 10 15 years ago a small move in yields 50 basis points in yields today is equivalent to 2 15 years ago for emphasis a 50 basis point jump in yields today equals a 2 jump in 2006 that is a jump from 1 to 1 50 today equals a jump from 1 to 3 in 2006 what happens if yields rise 100 basis points 1 mr mcdonald you just have a ton of wealth that a 1 move up in yields number one it bankrupts the u s in terms of your budget right now 70 of the budget in the united states is entitlements and interest so you just can t afford a big move up in yields the fed has killed the bond market the bond market gives the master signal to the stock market and the overall economy the monetary and fiscal authorities cannot sit upon their doofus hands if rates climb notably they will reach deeper yet into their trick bag to magic them down through yield curve control for example if inflation menaces the bond market has traditionally shouted a warning but today s bond market is not the reliable inflation detector it once was that is because the federal reserve has distorted garbled jammed and censored its signals the federal reserve has the bond market transmitting static investors who depend upon its clear telegraphing fumble about lost macroeconomic analyst peter schiff the bond market is not working the way it has in the past because the fed is artificially manipulating interest rates the biggest buyer of treasuries is the federal reserve the fed is trying to influence the economy stimulate the economy prop up the stock market that is the purpose of the fed buying treasury bonds and so when you have the fed in the market the whole thing is distorted the bond market is broken you can t look at the bond market today the 10 year treasury note yields 1 52 is it a true signal or is it static we do not know i don t believe they re going to screw it up yet this we do know as treasury secretary ms yellen is fixing to accommodate the president s behemoth spending bonanza we think that most countries have fiscal space she states most countries we presume include the united states but what if inflation proves not transient but permanent what if interest rates break through the federal reserve s cordon the lady sloughs off all concerns all worries all fears i don t believe they re going to screw it up but as the wags at zero hedge remind us this is the same clueless hack who in 2017 said she doesn t expect another financial crisis in our lifetimes regards brian maher managing editor the daily reckoning

electric pickup truck startup lordstown motors corp nasdaq ride might not survive the year unless it raises more money the company said tuesday declaring it is in danger of remaining a going concern after a recent runup in its stock price on the fringe of a meme stock rally lordstown shares plummeted 16 2 in late trading tuesday following the disclosure of amendments to its annual report filed with the securities and exchange commission sec since going public in a business combination with special purpose acquisition company spac diamond peak holdings corp last october lordstown lmc has been beset with troubles short seller hindenburg research accused lmc of faking many of the 100 000 preorders it claimed to have for its battery powered pickup called endurance lordstown conceded that it paid to generate some of the order flow for the endurance to excite the market but the company denied any wrongdoing problems aplenty the sec is investigating the company other setbacks included an early exit from the san felipe 250 racing event in mexico where lordstown hoped to show the toughness of the endurance which used too much battery power to continue more recently competition from established automakers ford motor co nyse f and general motors nyse gm chilled lordstown s prospects in the commercial pickup market the ford f150 lightning electric pickup will sell for more than 12 000 less than the endurance when it goes on sale in 2022 and it comes from a company that has sold more pickup trucks than any competitor for 44 consecutive years as soon as people saw the f 150 lightning any chance of getting any additional investment pretty much dried up i think it s highly unlikely that lordstown is going to find a savior that s going to keep them going guidehouse insights principal analyst sam abuelsamid told freightwaves gm which effectively gave its former lordstown assembly complex in northeast ohio to lmc is a minor investor despite planning an electric version of its chevrolet silverado pickup in the next couple of years once potential customers had a chance to look at what else was coming there s no immediate rush to buy this truck from an unknown manufacturer that s got no history abuelsamid said coincidentally gm is building a 2 3 billion battery plant in a joint venture with lg chem in the shadow of its former 6 2 million square foot assembly plant that opened in 1966 the only reason gm got into this in the first place was for political reasons during the trump administration abuelsamid said they didn t want the blowback from closing the factory or to deal with the criticism so they did it for goodwill essentially giving the factory to a startup to let them try to make something out of it going concern warning lmc disclosed in the delinquent regulatory filing tuesday that it lacks sufficient cash to start commercial production and doubts it can stay in business through the end of the year lordstown ceo steve burns said during the company s first quarter earnings call may 24 that the company needs more money to produce the 2 200 endurance models it plans to build this year beginning in september that is less than half the company s original production estimate higher than expected costs were accelerating its cash burn and it would finish the year with between 50 million and 75 million on hand burns said on the earnings call as recently as the closing of its 780 million business combination with diamond peak last october burns said lordstown had more money than it needed to begin production i think they significantly underestimated how much they were going to need in order to finish development and retool the factory abuelsamid said given the current supply chain problems the entire industry is facing some of their parts probably went up quite a bit compared to what they were planning on they ve just been burning cash faster than they hoped super fast spac the diamond peak lordstown spac deal went from announcement on aug 3 to an oct 22 2020 at about 11 weeks that s fast even by spac standards the sec review of spac deals which bypass many of the rigors of traditional initial public offerings typically take four to six months and that was before the agency began to step up scrutiny of so called blank check mergers earlier this year as a startup with none of the infrastructure of an established manufacturer and a massive retooling of a 55 year old plant that last made passenger cars burns found out how expensive it is to start a new automotive venture in quarterly and annual sec filings made public tuesday lordstown laid out its dire financial condition the company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to complete the development of its electric vehicles obtain regulatory approval begin commercial scale production and launch the sale of such vehicles the filing said the company believes that its current level of cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to fund commercial scale production and the launch of sale of such vehicles lordstown shares had been trading at 15 80 when the filings were released shares plunged as low as 10 30 before closing with a 16 3 decline at 11 22 the price slipped below 11 a share in after hours trading workhorse woe ahead burns is the former ceo of workhorse group nasdaq wkhs which is struggling to ramp up production of battery powered composite electric delivery vans workhorse licensed its w 15 pickup truck technology to lmc in exchange for a 10 stake in the company and royalty payments for each w 15 order converted to an endurance sale by lordstown workhorse took a noncash hit in q1 earnings because of lmc s falling stock value after reflecting gains when lmc shares were trading higher workhorse had planned to contract lmc to build battery electric next generation delivery vehicles ngdvs for the u s postal service if it won a 6 2 billion contract the postal service instead awarded the contract to oshkosh truck corp nyse osk a move that led to a halving of workhorse s stock value that had been driven up by retail traders i would assume workhorse is going to have to take a pretty significant charge especially if goes under completely and the equity goes to zero abuelsamid said they were counting on the stock price but also getting

national news irs records show wealthiest americans including bezos and musk paid little in income taxes report says the propublica report shows how taxes can hit ordinary wage earners harder than the country s richest people jeff bezos the founder of amazon strikes a pose in seattle kyle johnson the new york times washington the wealthiest americans including warren buffett elon musk and jeff bezos paid little in federal income taxes at times in recent years despite soaring fortunes according to internal revenue service data obtained by propublica the tax information published tuesday shows how billionaires are able to legally reduce their tax burden highlighting how the american tax system can hit ordinary wage earners harder than the richest people in the country propublica said the report comes after president joe biden and other democrats have complained the u s tax system is unfair and tilted to benefit corporations and the wealthy advertisement propublica analyzed the data by focusing on the soaring fortunes of the country s wealthiest members in recent years and alleged they were paying a true tax rate of just 3 4 the news organization came up with this rate by calculating estimates of the value of their stock portfolios and other assets and then how much they paid in federal income taxes the publication of information from these personal income tax forms comes as the biden administration pushes to raise income taxes on the country s top wage earners but propublica s data shows how taxing income would have little effect on the richest americans whose wealth is mostly held as assets the u s tax system focuses on income not so called unrealized gains from unsold stocks real estate or other assets these are extremely well known facts said jeffrey hoopes a tax expert and associate professor at the university of north carolina at chapel hill if you don t realize you don t pay hoopes added this wouldn t change under biden s proposals for changing the u s tax code biden wants to nudge the top income tax from 37 9 to 39 6 for americans earning more than 400 000 a year and raise taxes on the sale of certain assets known as capital gains from 20 to the top income rate advertisement biden has rejected a so called wealth tax such as the one proposed during the presidential campaign by sen elizabeth warren d mass which would institute a tax on unsold assets for the ultrarich biden has also proposed raising taxes on corporations a number of which pay little if any corporate income taxes according to some estimates the trump administration and congressional republicans slashed taxes across the board in 2017 and republicans have vowed to block any efforts by the biden administration to roll back those changes their position has created a big roadblock for key pieces of biden s agenda including the white house s push to approve an infrastructure package there already was some data about taxes paid by the wealthiest americans but not with the detail found in what propublica said it obtained the irs publishes a report on the taxes paid by the top 400 taxpayers based on adjusted gross income the most recent version which uses anonymous data showed that in 2014 these richest americans paid an average 23 13 federal income tax rate information from individual irs tax forms are closely guarded secrets and in recent years have loomed large in political fights after president donald trump refused to release his personal income tax forms in the run up to and during his presidency claiming his tax forms were under an irs audit it was unclear how propublica obtained the records advertisement the records though purport to show warren buffett head of berkshire hathaway as having paid 23 7 million in federal income taxes on total income of 125 million from 2014 to 2018 which would indicate a personal income tax rate of 19 propublica estimated that buffett saw his wealth soar by 24 3 billion during that period and so his true tax rate was 0 1 buffett has in the past called for tougher restrictions on the wealthy to prevent them avoiding paying taxes likewise elon musk chief executive of tesla paid 455 million on 1 52 billion in income during the same period when his wealth grew by 13 9 billion accounting for a true tax rate of 3 27 according to propublica jeff bezos chief executive of amazon and the owner of the washington post paid 973 million in taxes on 4 22 billion in income as his wealth soared by 99 billion resulting in a 0 98 true tax rate spokespeople for musk and bezos did not immediately respond to a request for comment in a statement to propublica buffett said that his company berkshire hathaway pays a large amount of corporate income tax and that he has planned for more than 99 of his personal wealth to go to taxes and philanthropy i believe the money will be of more use to society if disbursed philanthropically than if it is used to slightly reduce an ever increasing u s debt buffett wrote in the statement but that will be for congress to determine through changes to u s tax policy he added

do you really understand inflation please take aboard these three suppositions supposition 1 an economy s production of goods increases 12 across one year supposition 2 its money supply blooms at the identical 12 rate across the same year supposition 3 demand for goods and supply of goods balance in perfect equilibrium now stack suppositions 1 2 and 3 one upon the other what should you expect you should expect no general increase or no general decrease in the price of goods that is all scales should roughly balance the widget that fetched 10 last year fetches 10 this year here you have the very model of price stability now answer this question what is the inflation rate in our example is it zero answer shortly first to the scene of an inflation that is very nearly obscene an inflation flaunting all rational description the stock market a lull an overall hush descended upon wall street today a dull affair by all standards the dow jones drifted 25 points higher the s p six points higher the nasdaq 19 points higher cnbc by way of explanation markets may be on hold before the big jobs report on friday the u s likely added 671 000 nonfarm payrolls in may up from 266 000 jobs added in the previous month according to economists polled by dow jones inflation fears and the ways in which the federal reserve might respond have weighed on sentiment recently although the major averages are still hovering around all time highs meantime the 10 year treasury yield crept 0 024 points backward today while gold advanced 6 and change bitcoin remains mired in the clutches of schizophrenia today it gained 1 638 to 37 712 but tomorrow awaits and another potential swing of the psychological pendulum to revisit today s central question if goods production and money production both expand at a mirrored 12 rate and this year s prices are last year s prices what is the inflation rate is the inflation rate zero percent rising prices alone don t equal inflation before exposing the answer we must realize that a rising price is not a synonym for inflation it might instead represent a temporary discombobulation consider for example lumber prices lumber prices have gone skyshooting over 300 since last april but have prices overall vaulted over 300 since last april they have not we can largely assign lumber s grotesque pricing to lockdowns that throttled fresh production when twinned with exploding demand to feed a housing boom the result is a bedlam of rising lumber prices lumber prices should plummet once supply and demand fall back into general equilibrium again this is not inflation it is a temporary bugaboo consider an economy with a fixed supply of money the federal reserve has been placed in handcuffs the united states government thrown from the credit markets all goods and services must therefore bid against the existing money stock some prices would rise through the hurly burly of supply and demand others would fall through the same hurly burly of supply and demand if certain prices increase does this equal inflation it does not if certain prices rise others must fall there is no general rising but let us return to our question getting inflation right if goods production and money production both expand at a mirrored 12 rate and this year s prices are last year s prices what is the inflation rate is the inflation rate zero percent that is the correct answer you say zero percent the identical widget that went for 10 last year goes for 10 this year there is no inflation at all just so but you have staggered into the trap now come sit down with the facts the true inflation rate does not come in at zero percent the true inflation rate rather comes in at 12 that is because price increases are the consequence of inflation they are not inflation itself to claim inflation is zero in this instance is to mistake the wagon for the draft horse the shadow for the substance the child for the parent ludwig von mises titan of the austrian economic schoolhouse inflation as this term was always used everywhere means increasing the quantity of money and bank notes in circulation and the quantity of bank deposits subject to check but people today use the term inflation to refer to the phenomenon that is an inevitable consequence of inflation that is the tendency of all prices and wage rates to rise this all results in a deplorable confusion the result of this deplorable confusion is that there is no term left to signify the cause of this rise in prices and wages there is no longer any word available to signify the phenomenon that has been up to now called inflation we hazard the monetary authorities delight in the terrible confusion concealing their tricks behind a dense screen of smoke look at the consumer price index they shout we can t even generate a sustained 2 inflation how can anyone suggest there s inflation the real inflation rate but tie yourself up to the traditional understanding of inflation that is tie yourself up to this definition increasing the quantity of money and bank notes in circulation and the quantity of bank deposits subject to check what then is the true inflation rate the true inflation rate will flabbergast and reel you economist frank shostak so what is the present status of inflation by popular thinking represented by the yearly growth rate in the consumer price index cpi inflation stood at 2 6 in march against 1 7 in february and 1 5 in march 2020 however in terms of money supply the growth rate of inflation stood at 69 2 in march against 13 4 in march 2020 a 69 2 inflation rate if measured with a straight ruler with an honest ruler inflate and die meantime the federal government is spending delirious amounts of money thus it is absorbing precious resources from the private economy how then can the private economy build steam shostak the ability of businesses to grow the economy has weakened further because of massive government spending which has diverted real savings from businesses toward various nonproductive government projects because of this massive fiscal and monetary spending the pool of real savings the heart of economic growth could be in serious trouble bubble activities cannot stand on their own feet they require support from increases in money supply that divert to them real savings from wealth generators once the pool of real savings starts to decline because of massive monetary pumping and reckless fiscal policies various bubble activities will plunge this in turn is likely to result in a large decline in economic activity inflate or die as our co founder bill bonner styles it the system requires constant expansion of credit else the thing comes heaping down but the business cannot run on in perpetuity all lunacies must end all fevers must break then comes the reckoning the terrible reckoning when accounts must be squared when the bills come due when the creditors thunder at the door inflate or die ends ultimately in inflate and die regards brian maher managing editor the daily reckoning
several of the richest americans have paid zero income tax in some years according to an investigative report published tuesday that comes as washington weighs new proposals to address tax avoidance by the wealthiest individuals and companies the bombshell report by new york based journalism nonprofit propublica showed amazon chairman jeff bezos paid no income tax in 2007 and 2011 while tesla chief elon musk avoided all payments in 2018 some of the richest americans pay little in income tax compared to their massive wealth sometimes even nothing said propublica which did not disclose how it obtained the confidential tax data others who paid nothing to the internal revenue service in some years included news industry billionaire and former new york city mayor michael bloomberg activist investor billionaire carl icahn and philanthropist and financial giant george soros propublica says the billionaires did nothing illegal in their tax declarations but employed tax avoidance strategies beyond the reach of ordinary people they also benefited from the way taxable income is defined in the us tax code since it does not take into account the growing value of assets like stock and property and only taxes proceeds from sales of those items the report comes days after g7 finance ministers endorsed a global minimum corporate tax rate of at least 15 percent one of several tax proposals aimed at ensuring profitable multinationals pay their fair share other efforts include democratic senator elizabeth warren s initiative to tax the super wealthy including the value of their stock holdings and homes rather than focusing on income alone our tax system is rigged for billionaires who don t make their fortunes through income like working families do warren said as she published the propublica article on twitter it is time for a wealthtax in america to make the ultra rich finally pay their fair share demolishing the myth propublica s report is based on irs tax returns of extremely wealthy people over more than 15 years taken together it demolishes the cornerstone myth of the american tax system that everyone pays their fair share and the richest americans pay the most the article said the treasury department and other authorities are investigating the release of the tax returns the unauthorized disclosure of confidential government information is illegal treasury spokeswoman lily adams told afp the issue has been referred to treasury s inspector general as well as the fbi and federal prosecutors in washington all of whom have independent authority to investigate bezos in 2011 reported that his investment losses exceeded his income meaning he could report a loss for the year he also received a 4 000 tax credit for his children that year according to the report afp queries to staff for bezos musk bloomberg icahn and soros did not garner an immediate comment a spokesman for soros told propublica that soros did not owe taxes between 2016 and 2018 because his investments lost money however he supports higher taxes for the wealthy something he has spoken about publicly bloomberg and icahn told the publication they had paid all taxes they owed propublica found that the rich pay far below the official 37 percent rate on the highest incomes if their taxes are compared to how much forbes magazine reports their wealth has increased in a given year what propublica calls the true tax rate means that buffett for example paid only 0 1 percent in taxes between 2014 and 2018 afp

s p 500 russell 2000 talking points the s p 500 sits just below the all time high while the russell 2000 appears a bit more vulnerable to pullback themes a big set of drivers is coming into the limelight in the us and that s the thursday release of cpi numbers ahead of next wednesday s fomc announcement advertisement the run in equities from the lows set last march has outstripped even the wildest expectations for how equities would perform through a global pandemic while last march was troubling much of what s happened since has been to the bewilderment of bears as prices have just continued to punch higher through the recovery of course there s a very obvious reason for this and that s the brute force accommodation provided by the federal reserve to help the us economy grind through this otherwise difficult period as data has started to show more and more optimism the big question has become when the fed might start to scale back some of that accommodation and as of this writing there are few signs to indicate that anything is yet on the horizon this could change in a week however as a really big fomc rate decision sits on the economic calendar for next wednesday few are expecting any rate hikes or announcements of taper or anything tangible really the devil is in the details here and market participants are likely going to be parsing the details of the fed s statement and accompanying press conference for any sign of less loose policy on the horizon what makes this meeting more interesting is the fact that it s a quarterly meeting so we ll also be getting updated forecasts and projections and this will highlight just how optimistic the fed is and when the bank may look to start adjusting rates recommended by james stanley get your free top trading opportunities forecast get my guide at the core of that argument around policy is the prospect of inflation the saga around inflation in response to stimulus goes back for a decade now when the fed was able to embark on multiple rounds of qe in the post gfc backdrop without yet exposing the american economy to the runaway inflation that many feared it would produce when covid came into the equation last february and march the fed threw the kitchen sink at the matter allaying inflation worries for another day what the bank did worked and support was soon in play before stocks went flying into the summer along the way the fed appeared to try to head off that worry around inflation changing their approach to targeting average inflation in which they said they d be more accepting of above average inflation prints well those have started to show this year as last month saw a 4 2 read for headline cpi far beyond the fed s 2 target another cpi release is due on thursday and the expectation here is for a 4 7 print so while the fed has said that they feel inflation is transitory and that they d be willing to tolerate above target inflation the question remains as to whether they re comfortable with this level of inflation along with some of the other peculiarities that have shown in markets such as the volatility around cryptocurrencies or meme stocks recommended by james stanley building confidence in trading get my guide setting up for inflation data then fed at this point equities look to be fairly optimistic around the drivers sitting ahead the s p 500

the s p 500 the index is set up for bullish breakout potential currently showing horiziontal resistance around the all time high coupled with a rising trendline represented by the higher lows that have built over the past couple of weeks such formations are often approached with the aim of bullish continuation and this would keep the door open for fresh all time highs ahead of or possibly even

food technologists at the combat feeding division work painstakingly to ensure each m r e is as compact and durable as possible in natick mass may 20 2021 the rations often derided as meals rarely edible have gotten somewhat better and become objects of fascination for millions of civilians kathleen ehl had always thought of her business as a niche affair an online store called north georgia outdoors supply that she and her husband run out of their home in gainesville selling meals ready to eat mres as they are widely known are thick pouches of shelf stable rations created for the united states military they re not particularly fancy or appetizing and they re technically not allowed to be sold commercially if they are made under a government contract as most are ehl and her husband oliver walker scour online auctions and salvage stores for the meals and sell most of them to collectors and survivalists but last february when pandemic induced panic buying kicked into high gear their orders jumped from 100 a week to 100 a day there were some nights my husband and i packed mres from after the kids went to bed to 2 in the morning said ehl 37 advertisement early 2020 was a boom time for mre distributors across the country from the major military suppliers to army surplus stores yet today as purchases of other pandemic fixations have flagged the civilian fascination with the meals has persisted driven by caution stocking up for the next potential pandemic or natural disaster and curiosity though sales figures for mres are hard to come by given the questionable legality of some sales the internet audience that discusses and taste tests the rations has grown to millions people who never thought they d own an mre now keep them in their basement sylvia marie 26 ordered a few including a mexican style chicken stew and a vegetarian taco pasta shortly into the lockdown while staying at her relatives home in south windsor connecticut she was looking for foods that were new to her and didn t require a great effort to make on the website where she placed her order a lot of the reviews were people who had been talking about how they had bought these to stock their bomb shelters said marie a food policy researcher at tufts university i don t think i would normally associate myself with that population no one is more intrigued or puzzled by the phenomenon than the scientists and engineers who research and develop the meals at the department of defense combat feeding division at the division s headquarters in natick massachusetts the team spends years perfecting every detail of an mre before it is sent off to manufacturers is this beef ravioli as nutritious as possible and shelf stable for up to three years can it survive a drop from a helicopter or blistering desert temperatures mres are explicitly made for service members on operations away from a dining hall or field kitchen yet many people outside the military have long been interested in what soldiers eat wartime museums display the bland hardtack that sustained civil war fighters and the canned meats breads and fruit of world war ii known as c rations in the 1990s after complaints from soldiers serving in the persian gulf war the focus of ration development shifted to creating better tasting and more diverse meals service members were invited to submit ideas for the menu which expanded to 24 entrees from 12 with vegetarian halal and kosher options available every year the least popular mres are dropped from circulation and new ones are added perennial favorites like spaghetti with meat sauce or beef ravioli are supplemented with dishes like a mexican rice and bean bowl in 2018 the highly anticipated pizza mre was introduced made possible by technology that creates barriers to microorganism growth between the layers of sauce cheese and bread each mre contains a complete meal an entree snacks dessert and beverages with an average of about 1 200 calories and a variety of vitamins and minerals some of them added every ingredient is meant to serve a purpose the beef jerky is fortified with caffeine and the applesauce contains maltodextrin which provides an energy boost these food choices play a critical role on the battlefield said stephen moody combat feeding division chief the right nutrition might be able to give us an edge increasing a soldier s alertness or decision making capabilities he said but why would a civilian want to eat one i don t know said julie smith a food technologist in the division the new interest she added seems antithetical to the growing movement toward buying fresh produce and cooking from scratch some veterans are just as bewildered it cracks me up said emmanuella franco 27 who was a specialist in the army national guard from 2013 to 2019 and now works as a microbiology technician in keeno california you want to eat this nonmelting piece of plastic that s on you man despising mres is a long tradition in the military where they have earned nicknames like meals rejected by everyone or meals rarely edible but on platforms like youtube and tiktok a growing cadre of mre taste testers most of them nonmilitary are transfixed they open and examine each component including snacks like the ever sought out jalapeno cheese spread and popular desserts like cherry blueberry cobbler as well as an accessory packet that usually contains toilet paper a moist towelette chewing gum and salt older mres may include cigarettes while non american ones might have alcoholic drinks one of the best known youtube reviewers is steven thomas the 1 8 million subscribers to his channel steve1989mreinfo have watched him fearlessly and even enthusiastically eat canned pork and eggs dating to 1945 or a ham and chicken loaf from 1984 last april views of his videos spiked to 9 million an all time high for his channel after first trying an mre at age 8 his father bought him one from an army supply store in lakewood florida where thomas still lives he became obsessed with tracking down rations from various countries and eras in 2015 he started tasting them on camera the rations are the closest thing to time travel said thomas 32 when you open something and air hasn t touched that stuff in 50 or 100 years and it is just the same as it ever was it is amazing even youtube hosts with a broader scope are running mre taste tests like emmy cho who runs a popular food channel called emmymade cho 43 said the meals are both nostalgic and surprising you don t always know what you re going to find in one you can look at the details of an mre and wonder why certain foods were included she said it s an accessible way to understand the military experience which to civilians can feel like another world especially during the pandemic buying the rations has helped people deal with a chaotic and unpredictable world said anastacia marx de salcedo author of the 2015 book combat ready kitchen how the u s military shapes the way you eat they are comfort food for courage development of the modern mre began in 1970 during the vietnam war today s versions contain two important innovations the retort pouch made of flexible materials that can withstand the heat of sterilization providing the shelf stability of canned food without the bulkiness and the flameless ration heater which uses a chemical reaction to warm an entree with just a little water the combat feeding division is constantly experimenting with ways to improve nutrition the massachusetts center has a food laboratory that could be mistaken for any commercial kitchen if not for the boxes of truffle macaroni and cheese in a tube for u s air force pilots and the portraits of soldiers lining the walls on a recent wednesday ann barrett a chemical engineer and michelle richardson a food technologist were making vegetable omelets of varying volumes and fat content to see how a soldier could be most sated from the smallest package lauren oleksyk who leads the food engineering and analysis team speculated about having soldiers wear sensors that detect what nutrients they need and having a 3d printer generate nutritionally appropriate food to be delivered via drone tom yang another food technologist was experimenting with what is essentially a giant microwave to turn entrees like macaroni and cheese and buffalo chicken into granola bar size meals that could fit in a pocket we understand it s not gourmet food said david accetta chief of public affairs for the army s research and development organization that oversees rations true enough in the pepperoni pizza the crust is dense the cheese is dry and flavorless and the pepperoni lacks crunch and richness yet it invokes the pleasing nostalgia of a lunchables the cherry blueberry cobbler is a mildly flavorful goo the cheese tortellini are rubbery and clumpy though well sauced warming an mre doesn t fill the room with inviting aromas all you ll smell is the metallic odor of the magnesium and iron inside the heater then again consider the sheer number of requirements the meal has to meet or the dire conditions in which a soldier is often eating one nasty or not it will keep you alive said joe guerrero 20 an army motor transportation operator stationed in fort bliss texas many mre sellers are hoping to capitalize on this spike in awareness to get civilians to think of the rations beyond the military context and associate them with camping hiking or emergency situations blair calder owner of meal kit supply in buffalo new york buys mre components and repackages them in his own retort pouches a common means of working around the commercial resale ban to make them more appealing to civilians he doesn t use the army stamp font or any battlefield language or imagery tom miller business director at wornick foods in cincinnati one of the three manufacturers that make most of the mres said his company is increasingly focused on manufacturing for food banks and other humanitarian organizations that help during natural disasters the federal emergency management agency also maintains a stockpile of the meals when a storm left millions of texans without water or electricity in february shoshana krieger and mincho jacob who work for housing nonprofit basta said the rations were far easier than hot meals to load and transport in bulk to individuals in need if climate change continues to amplify the impact of natural disasters these needs may increase still mres are far from mainstream selling them sometimes requires operating in a legal gray area ehl of north georgia outdoors supply said she had heard of sellers stealing from military bases there is too much of a stigma around the actual mre itself said steven cyros founder of mre depot and mre wholesalers in san clemente california and tucson arizona and dollars to calories it is an expensive option compared with other prepared foods a single mre typically retails for about 10 cyros has had little success advertising in outdoor magazines the rations are probably too heavy for hikers he said but people may already be eating in military fashion without realizing it many everyday foods from spam to energy bars originated as rations even the retort pouches made for mres are now used to package baby food and tuna the military comes up with these innovations marx de salcedo said and when they are provided to soldiers they seem like an odd sort of food but eventually she said they become american comforts this article

in popular culture echolocation conjures up images of dolphins and bats but humans can be taught the skill too and a kazakh start up is taking advantage central asia s fast growing start up ecosystem has plenty of innovative companies to keep an eye on kazakhstan s sezual is one of them from the kazakh verb sezu to feel sezual is a nur sultan based company using technology to foster inclusive innovation with devices aimed at helping the blind and visually impaired kazakhstan is a fast emerging tech hub though its start up ecosystem is in the infancy stage the most challenging and important part is complete creating a few strong engineering schools that consistently produce great talent which can easily compete at the highest level with some of the best engineers in the world says sezual co founder and ceo nurbek yensebayev when there is a large enough pool of skilled people that can solve real problems it attracts venture capital as well as increases collaboration between large corporations and start ups sezual s main product is an echolocation device that enables the blind and the visually impaired to navigate without sight in popular culture echolocation conjures images of dolphins and bats but humans can be taught the skill too emerging research in the field supports the idea that with training both sighted and blind individuals can learn how to navigate their environment using clicks this is precisely where the sezual echolocation device which emits a specific high pulse click reflecting surrounding objects to provide information on their shape material and distance can help seeing through sound sezual says that people with the device can learn how to see with sound in two months they are now conducting tests with volunteers in real life environments we are currently training our team of volunteers to navigate in intense real world environments such as 360 degree location awareness in busy streets close quarters sporting activities advanced coordination in rough terrain and much more yensebayev tells emerging europe he adds that this data is extremely useful for sezual s engineers testing the device under such conditions gives our engineers incredible insight and ideas to improve upon everything from ergonomics and human factors to performance and usability the potential of the device hasn t gone unnoticed by international organisations in 2020 sezual became a national nominee of the united nations world summit awards selected from 342 innovations based on content functionality design technology innovation impact on society and value sezual s technology covers eight of the 17 un sustainable development goals specifically those related to education growth and employment inequality and accessibility of human settlement interest exists from investors too both domestic and foreign which is why we are actively moving to a proper legal structure in the united states that can accommodate multiple investors and allow for appropriate board structure employee stock option plans and more we are also seeing interest from healthcare organisations as well as fortune 500 companies and we plan to pursue that as well explains elisar nurmagambetov founding partner and board member at the start up life changing technology in the start up s native kazakhstan the ministry of labour and social protection has along with medical and academic institutions participated in tests of the device in one of the tests blind people were able to walk in unfamiliar shopping malls find stairs and move to different floors in another test the blind were able to get up from any place in an auditorium leave it then enter through another door and find their initial place explains nurmagambetov as a result of these tests the sezual biolocator is now included in the kazakhstan state register of goods for the disabled for now work on the device continues with nurmagambetov saying there has been significant breakthroughs in user progress now we have a final product that the blind and visually impaired use on a daily basis in their own words their lives depend on it however we have a roadmap to make the product more native user friendly and smaller in size sezual is also working on other inclusive innovation projects such as tactile tv electronic signatures exoskeletons and software applications at the moment the company is focused on producing braille tutoring devices according to the american national federation for the blind only one in ten blind people can read braille nurmagambetov says the company has received a lot of requests from schools for the blind and visually impaired who voiced a need for self training braille devices for use during the covid 19 pandemic we have developed a tactile electronic self learning device for all braille symbols in any foreign language he explains as for the company s next steps nurmagambetov says they are preparing a rebrand and restructuring that will allow their us based venture be the main operating company with that they are hoping to reach a broader market and create the necessary ecosystem to attract investors partners and customers photo

the 25 richest americans paid little to no federal income taxes according to a report released tuesday by the nonprofit news organization propublica a claim that has reignited debate about the tax code and sparked an investigation by the irs into the leak of private tax documents nbc news has not independently verified the documents and propublica declined to disclose how it had gained access to what it called a vast trove of internal revenue service data on the tax returns of thousands of the nation s wealthiest people covering more than 15 years the report does not detail any illegality by the people whose tax documents it reviewed who include many of the richest people in the u s such as jeff bezos and elon musk the white house is pushing a plan that would tax capital gains as income for those making over 1 million annually irs commissioner charles rettig said in a previously scheduled hearing wednesday morning before the senate finance committee that the agency is looking into the leak of the documents i can confirm that there is an investigation with respect to the allegations that the source of the information from that article came from the internal revenue service he said upon reviewing the article the appropriate contacts were made and the investigators will investigate the chairman of the committee ron wyden d ore seized on the revelations to underscore his point now echoed by the biden administration that the richest people use tactics that most americans do not the irs has a responsibility to protect taxpayer data and you ve confirmed that this matter is being investigated wyden said the big picture is that this data shows that the country s wealthiest who profited immensely during the pandemic have not been paying their fair share he added the article illustrates the vast differences between how the extremely wealthy pay taxes compared to most wage earning americans and how they do so using a simple three pronged approach known in tax circles as buy borrow die the strategy focuses on making money off investments and capital which are taxed only when the assets are sold known as realization or a realized gain typically investors pay a drastically lower effective tax rate compared to people who make a similar amount in wages lilian faulhaber a tax law professor at georgetown university said the current tax code offers benefits for those who grow their wealth primarily through investments and consequently pay little income tax but when you look at inequality in our society it has real consequences she said samuel brunson a tax law professor at loyola university of chicago said it is unlikely that the wealthy will pay more taxes if the current system is preserved because of the realization requirement as long as wealthy people hold onto their assets they re not going to be paying taxes on their increase in wealth he said in an email like the article says it goes back about a century it s not completely clear whether the realization requirement is a constitutional requirement but it s what we have as long as they don t sell their appreciating assets they won t pay taxes on the gains the article focuses on a handful of people including bezos the ceo of amazon propublica said it examined bezos tax records from 2006 to 2018 bezos wealth increased by 127 billion according to forbes but he reported a total of 6 5 billion in income the article says the 1 4 billion he paid in personal federal taxes is a massive number yet it amounts to a 1 1 true tax rate on the rise in his fortune the tax foundation an independent tax policy nonprofit found that the average individual income tax rate is 14 6 percent a representative for bezos did not respond to a request for comment however the mega wealthy also use a second strategy borrowing money at a single interest rate and no tax propublica reported for example carl icahn whom forbes lists as the 40th wealthiest american has an outstanding 1 2 billion loan with bank of america according to propublica that means he is able to turbocharge his investment returns and then gets to deduct the interest from his taxes when asked whether it was appropriate that he should pay no income tax at all as he did in 2016 and 2017 icahn objected do you think a rich person should pay taxes no matter what i don t think it s germane he told propublica how can you ask me that question propublica also detailed the last part of the buy hold die strategy vast sums of wealth that can be passed largely tax free from one generation to the next in tax circles that is what is known as the step up in basis investments and assets that are passed on to a person s heirs are not subject to any capital gains taxes if they are sold as soon as they are received eliminating the step up basis rule or as president joe biden has called it the trust fund loophole could be one way to raise federal tax revenue to pay for many of the sweeping social programs he would like to enact we need to make a choice to eliminate the loophole biden said last month if a person passes away and leaves stock to their son or daughter don t have to pay anything on that multimillion dollar gain

rochester minn aduhelm the first treatment ever approved by the fda to target alzheimer s disease at the level of brain deterioration will likely be available only for limited populations at mayo clinic that s according to a clinic neurologist who studied the drug and has expressed concerns about its effectiveness i ve publicly expressed my views that i thought the data that showed there were clinical benefits were very weak mayo clinic neurologist dr david knopman said of the treatment whose generic name is aducanumab we re going to restrict it to people like those who were in the trial he said we re not going to treat patients with the drug who are too severe and we are not going to treat patients who are asymptomatic an intravenous medication manufactured by massachusetts based drugmaker biogen the monoclonal antibody attacks amyloid plaque dense proteins in the brain that are associated with the disease advertisement the drug is proven to reduce the plaque a so called biomarker of the illness but critics question whether doing so will reduce clinical features such as memory loss and cognitive decline the decision today by the fda was to approve the drug based on the fact that it lowered brain amyloid levels knopman said even though there was no acknowledgment by the fda that the drug had consistent clinical benefits for patients under fda rules two positive studies are needed to approve a drug for sale while two identical trials demonstrated aducanumab does cause a significant decrease in amyloid plaque only one showed positive effects on cognitive features of the disease and those were modest in one of the studies there was no delay in progression knopman said in the other there was a slight delay in progression of symptoms nobody got better nobody stayed the same they just found that people didn t get worse as quickly in the one study that showed some benefit dr david knopman photo mayo clinic the fda has retained the right to withdraw its approval of aducanumab if a follow up trial does not show clinical benefits but cited unmet need in giving the drug the green light under a lower regulatory threshold advertisement regulators gave the drug their nod over objections of their own panel of experts biogen announced on monday june 7 it plans to charge 56 000 for aduhelm its stock reached a record high following the announcement clinicians on monday strove to reduce expectations for the treatment access to which will likely prove galvanizing for the families of some 6 million americans afflicted with alzheimer s disease mayo clinic neurologist dr ronald peterson in the medical publication stat cautioned that this is not going to be penicillin for alzheimer s disease knopman a site investigator in one of the two trials of the drug was joined last fall by fellow mayo neurologist dr david t jones and a colleague from stanford in coauthoring a paper calling for more research on the drug the article cautioned that approval would have a massive impact on health care economics and the feasibility of conducting future clinical trials of the medication alzheimer s dementia which published their paper is the journal of the patient advocacy group the alzheimer s association it is an enthusiastic supporter of the drug the alzheimer s association will do everything in its power to ensure access to the drug the organization stated on its website monday advertisement it called aduhelm s approval historic and the start of an exciting era in alzheimer s and dementia treatment and research they know that i strongly disagree with their position says knopman who has served as vice chair to the organization s medical and scientific advisory council and who is currently a senior advisor so we respectfully disagree with one another there were two very large phase iii studies knopman said of the evidence for the new drug one of them showed some statistically significant evidence of benefits very small but statistically significant the other was designed in an identical manner was done identically and found no benefit at all if you approach it as a lay person you tried something once and it worked but you tried the same thing again and it didn t work would you conclude you d want to sail across the ocean in that ship you d want to test it a little more wouldn t you

i m worried about my seizures eddy s big blue eyes turn to me red from crying i don t want to die his bottom lip pulls his chin to his chest where hiccups of fear escape the tears come frequently now waves of sadness wash over us throughout the day sucking the joy from all our favourite things to do i know buddy he parrots back to me before i can even open my mouth he pats his delicate wee hand over mine to comfort me in the midst of his own distress he knows too much in the corner of eddy s bedroom our friend stephen s face crumples listening to ed speak he puts down his camera to wipe away his tears behind the microphone of pat brittenden s studio the former newstalk zb host removes his glasses to wipe his eyes in the middle of our interview at school another room 1 mum stops me in the school hall to say me her son cried when saw eddy on the news and bursts out crying herself the pain we share for eddy is so raw it sits just below the surface of our everyday interactions nothing is normal any more we have less than a week of cbd left now each day is measured with danger in the middle of the night a panicked mum messages me from the emergency room of starship her little girl is seizing uncontrollably being pumped full of midazolam and fentanyl and epilim and keppra and clobazam before her eyes as her daughter s oxygen plummets below 50 and nothing is working she has tried and failed to access cbd previously through her specialist and she is desperate for someone to consider charting it for her in ed in her hour of need my heart breaks into a million pieces for her i already know she won t access it tonight or at all during her stay in starship prescriber reluctance is second only to price in preventing patient access whether led or not by nzma president braddock who made then withdrew comments in support of the no vote in last year s cannabis referendum gp reluctance to prescribe medicinal cannabis for their patients is underpinned by some criminal negligence from the ministry of health the funded prescriber resource currently being developed by bpac should have been rolled out years ago when fundamental information gaps were highlighted by the medicinal cannabis advisory group from first meeting to last the secretariat was meant to action both dissemination of information to prescribers and increase avenues to education in 2019 the glaring lack of knowledge for dosing and titration per condition is evident at the pointy end of the patient experience and the start of their learning journey baby doctors need endocannabinoid system and medicinal cannabis training at med school too making me talk to registrars on the ward when we are is not good enough tdb recommends newzengine com that morning the ceo of an nz medicinal cannabis company is on the phone the ministry of health has never been slower at approving license to manufacture medicine at this rate it will be another 5 10years before you get your local market another helius with the first mover advantage has been caught up in an ongoing 12 months process to gain gmp certification and associated license to manufacture that no one has gained yet the gmp the testing and stability requirements have been extremely onerous admits eqalis ceo mitch cuevas via email we ve spent more than 20m so far manu caddie of rua tells me on the subject of affordability ongoing costs of production are high to maintain gmp certification which begs the question when 90 of the world s cbd is not manufactured to pharmaceutical gmp and gpp products from the us or canada cost 15 of what we pay here exactly why are we pursuing gmp still the international journal of drug policy compared the accessibility of cbd and regulatory frameworks of 9 countries including usa canada germany ireland united kingdom switzerland japan australia and new zealand as of may 2020 noting only new zealand and australia as exceptions requiring a clinician prescription to access cbd of course this is no longer relevant to australia who have since approved low cost over the counter access in a landmark deal with cannatrek and the discount chemist warehouse which leaves new zealand alone as the only barrier to access to cbd don t be foolish enough to think that a prescription will help you either we aren t alone you don t have to be disabled from birth to be disenfranchised by our government s approach to medicinal cannabis if you want your prescription funded by winz or acc you will need to take the case to court and have it ordered by a judge an oia on the acc website points to an embarrassment of claims upheld by acc in the past 5 years less than 4 in the years leading up the medicinal cannabis amendment 5 in 2018 climbing to 6 in 2019 and a whopping 8 last year no wonder patients are complaining the only affordable options available to them for relief of their symptoms as a result of an accident is the black market it s not that i want to pour 1000 s and 1000 s every month into the uk economy to fill eddy s prescription i don t have a choice there is no local alternative available here nor is there one on the horizon for certification and licencing every product variant is required to provide 6 months of shelf life stability data which costs ¼mill per product no new zealand company is going to develop a product to meet eddy s needs at that price point instead what we will see is multiple versions of the same product under different brands all grossly overpriced compared to our aussie neighbours the culpably careless mishandling of cbd as a medicine shows it must be taken out of the misuse of drugs act out of the medicines act and declassified immediately if it is ever to be made widely available at a low cost our doctor writes to medsafe highlighting the urgency of eddy s case and orders in bulk every last bottle in stock of what we need as medleaf step in to assist with import permits to help navigate the most unnecessarily inaccessible system in the world collectively we bite our nails to the quick because eddy has only days left to go on the cbd he has left and customs might destroy eddy s last hope of survival on a diminishing dose of cbd only days left to go he is scared of dying and i m scared too katy thomas is a tv presenter business owner and patient advocate she has a petition at her blog site wellfitmum com and you can learn more about her journey at instagram com iamkatythomas after eddy was refused ketogenic diet support for his epilepsy through adhb she started ketogenic food company keto happy co to improve patient access and support when she isn t working on that she is mum to eddy and harry
here s a good one jeff bezos michael bloomberg warren buffett and elon musk all walk into the irs but none of them in various years seem to have paid federal income taxes or how about this one the rich get richer because they don t always pay their fair share into the community chest jeff bezos chief executive officer of amazon recently announced plans to travel to space bloomberg via getty images this is us tax law and now we have a map of how the wealthiest people exploit it thanks to a bombshell report from propublica the investigative journalism nonprofit which claims to have obtained years of tax returns for the wealthiest people in the country from an anonymous source its first report it promises more to come is on the richest of the rich who in certain years claim losses that can wipe out their income tax bills this should sound familiar former us president donald trump did the same thing but that doesn t mean it shouldn t be a scandal that mr bezos the richest person on earth who has used his vast wealth to start a spaceship company that will take him into space where he will also be the richest person has in multiple recent years told the federal government he owed no income taxes according to propublica propublica also reports that mr musk the second wealthiest human on earth whose wealth has grown many billions in recent years and who also has a passion project space company told the government he owed no income tax in 2018 australia s top 10 richest people revealed view gallery the scandal is that these actions are perfectly legal mr bloomberg and mr buffett who have both supported raising tax rates for the wealthy have both had 0 income tax bills mr buffett at least has long acknowledged this infamously saying he paid a lower tax rate than his secretary mr bloomberg during his run for the 2020 democratic presidential nomination tangled with senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts over whether the government should tax extreme wealth in addition to income billionaire and former us presidential candidate mike bloomberg ap how is this possible the report analyses how this is possible and the reasons are many first us tax law is focused on income and much of the superwealth is tied up in company stock or other investments that have real value but aren t taxable year to year wealth vs income propublica cites guesstimates from forbes but it s an imperfect assessment it lists mr bezos as gaining us 99 billion in wealth between 2014 and 2018 but his income was much lower he reported us 4 22 billion and paid us 973 million in income tax in those years so he paid more than 20 per cent on his reported income the issue is that his wealth skyrocketed at the same time read more bezos to win billionaire space race this is something that plays out on a smaller scale for your average american homeowner or 401 k holder whose wealth grows without being taxed by the federal government every year the difference is in scale also everyday americans likely pay property taxes and utilised mortgages to buy their homes elon musk appearing to indicate how much income tax he paid in 2018 getty tax avoidance strategies the report does show how the wealthy finance their lifestyles with loans taken against assets like real estate or stocks rather than realising the value of an asset they ll pay less to the bank in interest than they would to the government in income tax carl icahn the investor gave an interview to propublica about his tax returns and it printed this illuminating response there s a reason it s called income tax he said the reason is if if you re a poor person a rich person if you are apple if you have no income you don t pay taxes he added do you think a rich person should pay taxes no matter what i don t think it s germane how can you ask me that question but in these cases the loans do act as the income other forms of tax it s also true that with so much of their wealth tied up in stock they effectively pay tax through their companies however the corporate tax rate of 21 per cent is far lower than the top rate of 37 per cent on income over us 523 000 for individuals notably mr bezos has endorsed raising the corporate rate mr trump and republicans slashed it back in 2017 but as cnn has reported it s still unlikely his amazon would pay anything close to either rate even on the income the superwealthy do claim often in the form of capital gains they often pay a lower rate than americans who make far less money warren buffett has long railed against the us tax system questioning his own low tax rate compared to his employees ap taxes are very much in the policy conversation at the moment president joe biden wants to raise both corporate tax rates and income taxes on the wealthy although it faces a tough path forward in the us senate where the minority republicans can block it globally and separate from this individual income tax conversation mr biden and his treasury secretary janet yellen are pushing for a global corporate minimum tax and other industrialised nations in the g 7 agreed to an outline this week the idea is that if everyone had at least a 15 per cent corporate tax rate it would keep companies from avoiding taxes all of this feeds into the growing frustration with extreme inequality and what governments should do to make sure everyone pays their fair share which is increasingly complicated when so much wealth is locked away from the tax man and more and more people think the government should be doing more to improve people s everyday lives why did they print this is it illegal less interesting to the larger world but really interesting to journalists like me was propublica s separate story about how it got the tax documents and why it decided to selectively print them it is technically against the law to publish an individual s tax information although propublica argues the public interest in an informed tax debate justifies the risk a spokesperson for at least one of the people whose taxes it dissects that s mr bloomberg is quoted as promising some kind of legal action although against whoever or whatever leaked the documents rather than propublica propublica doesn t seem to know who the source of the documents is and even suggests it could have been a foreign actor like china or russia that has shown an interest in stoking class resentment in the us that means the reporting needs to be considered against the backdrop of the mystery of its provenance it s notable that none of the billionaires mentioned in the story deny the accuracy of the tax returns and some argue they were simply following the rules others did not respond according to propublica when asked about the propublica report on tuesday white house press secretary jen psaki told reporters any unauthorised disclosure of confidential government information by a person of access is illegal and we take this very seriously she said the irs commissioner has referred the matter to investigators sunlight secrets given the status these men have in society the deference their wealth affords them and the fact

mcdonald s french fries carrots onions all of the foods that come from bill gates farmland by april glaser they are the landowners beneath the soil that grows the potatoes in mcdonald s french fries the carrots from the world s largest producer and the onions that americans sauté every night for dinner but they re far better known for their work in tech and saving the climate bill and melinda gates who recently announced they re getting divorced and are dividing their assets are deeply invested in american agriculture the billionaire couple in less than a decade have accumulated more than 269 000 acres of farmland across 18 states more than the entire acreage of new york city the farmland was purchased through a constellation of companies that all link back to the couple s investment group cascade investments based in kirkland washington data gathered by the land report and nbc news show that their land holdings range from 70 000 acres in north louisiana where their farmland grows soybeans corn cotton and rice to 20 000 acres in nebraska where farmers grow soybeans they purchased and later sold an additional 6 000 acres in georgia nbc news found in washington the gateses own more than 14 000 acres of farmland that includes potato fields so massive that they are visible from space and some of which are processed into french fries for mcdonald s and in florida farmers grow carrots on their property these land holdings are separate from their previous investments in companies that support large scale farming like monsanto and tractor manufacturer john deere but gates known for his philanthropic work solving some of the world s most pressing public health and climate problems has suggested that he does not treat his american farmland investments as part of his broader plans to save the planet my investment group chose to do this bill gates said on reddit when asked a question about his farmland purchases while promoting his latest book how to avoid a climate disaster it is not connected to climate he did acknowledge that more productive farming techniques can help reduce deforestation in other parts of the world though the gates are major owners of american farmland the couple s holdings only represent a fraction of the 283 million acres of farmland that is owned and rented out by non farmers but that could soon change about 40 percent of farmland is owned by seniors 65 or older according to 2014 estimates by the u s department of agriculture meaning more farmland is expected to come on the market soon that could spell an opportunity for young farmers hoping to get their start but for savvy investors scrambling for more places to put their money it also represents an opportunity financial titans like prudential and hancock have divisions specifically for investors looking to make money on farmland portfolios the trend worries young farmers who cannot compete with the likes of bill gates when buying land according to holly rippon butler a farmer in upstate new york and the land campaigns director at the national young farmers coalition if you re looking at what this means for farmers on the ground looking to access land there s significant competition from nonfarmers and that really affects young farmers because it means that the price that they re trying to compete with on the marketplace is driven and determined by people who are not dependent on a farming income rippon butler said adjusted for inflation average farm real estate values have seen a general steady rise since 1993 growing from less than 1 500 an acre in the mid 90s to over 3 000 an acre in 2020 according to the usda the agency further found that over 50 percent of cropland is rented to farmers who don t own their land the attraction that people have to investing in farmland is that it tends to be counter cyclical to the stock market it s a hedging strategy said daniel bigelow a professor of agricultural economics at montana state university who previously served as a usda research economist in other words when the economy is struggling the value of farmland generally doesn t depreciate cascade declined to comment on its interest in acquiring so much american farmland but a spokesperson for the firm charles v zehren said it is very supportive of sustainable farming he pointed out that in 2020 the acreage bill gates firm owns was all enrolled in a sustainability program that program ensures agriculture on the land is audited to meet standards like soil health and water management created by the nonprofit leading harvest which counts one of the subsidiaries of gates investment firm as a partner leading harvest requires farmland owners to work to continuously improve soil health biodiversity and water air and crop quality on their farms as well as contribute positively to local communities comply with regulations and provide a safe and respectful working environment for employees zehren said a shell of a shell public records suggest cascade investments has bought its farmland through a web of at least 22 limited liability shell companies across the country these shell companies have made it difficult to find out where and how much farmland the couple owns even for local farmers like john s quarterman a farmer and landowner who grows okra corn squash and other vegetables in lowndes county on the southern edge of georgia that s where the gateses began buying land in 2013 through two limited liability corporations registered to an address in kirkland by derek yursek then head of agriculture operations for cascade investments when quarterman first heard about gates firm buying land in the area he began digging through local property records linking addresses and business records from registered owners to kirkland washington based companies until he was able to piece together that the companies buying multiple tracts of land in the suwannee river basin were all a shell of a shell of a shell company investing for bill gates nbc news independently confirmed that there were in fact shell companies tracing back to gates s firm that purchased 6 021 acres across four counties in georgia in georgia and florida nbc news independently confirmed through research of property records that the gateses investment firm owns more than 7 000 acres through two limited liability companies lakeland sands and lakeland sands florida llc both of those companies were founded in 2012 with the same address as cascade investments in kirkland which later changed its mailing address to a louisiana post office box assigned to oak river farms another subsidiary of cascade nbc news also found that another 6 500 acres in north florida are owned by yet another company suwannee river terra which was also started with an address in kirkland and an email address from the bill and melinda gates investment firm which is now registered to the current chief counsel of oak river farms with a mailing address in kansas according to property records in every state where the gateses own land a tangled web of locally registered limited liability companies follow while those companies don t explicitly name cascade investments as the owner in their public records they do share the address of cascade in kirkland washington or the address of a cascade subsidiary list the names of cascade employees who registered the companies and sometimes even email addresses from the bill and melinda gates investment group fertilizer runoff but some farmers whose land is adjacent to that of the gateses have expressed disappointment that despite the couple s wealth they have not done more to preserve the environment quarterman also serves as the suwannee riverkeeper and advocates for conservation of the intricate network of springs and rivers in the region where water from the swamps of georgia flow into florida before they release in the gulf of mexico he said that this is where large tracts of rich farmland is used to raise livestock and grow many of the vegetables that end up in grocery aisles up and down the east coast all that farming has led to large water withdrawals from the floridan aquifer system and requires fertilizer which causes runoff into waterways emptying nitrogen that has led to destructive algae blooms and severe loss of fish and marsh habitats he hoped gates would have invested in different farming techniques that could help turn around the ecological damages from big agriculture well you d think if you re looking for somebody with enough capital to try that he would go first right but he didn t quarterman said he never did anything that different from before he got here and what other farmers were doing nearby quarterman guessed that may be because bill gates isn t the one doing the farming he s the landlord or rather the companies owned by his investment firm are the landlords and not all the renters are local but zehren of cascade noted that the firm has been working in florida and elsewhere to promote ecologically conscious agriculture and that it plans to continue to evaluate its farmland portfolio to improve its overall sustainability in enrolling in leading harvest cascade has implemented new initiatives on its farmland holdings ranging from adding additional pollinator habitat in nebraska to planting wildlife friendly trees on dry pivot corners in florida to hosting grain bin safety rescue training for the local community in louisiana to converting numerous diesel power units to electric to reduce carbon output to name a few zheren said carrots onions and french fries a survey of the gateses farmland holdings shows a broad range of vegetables that americans eat can be traced back to his land and that some of this land has also been owned by other billionaires starting in 2012 gates investment firm began buying family farms in south georgia one of those farms stanley farms specialized in vidalia onions and another coggins farms focused on growing carrots in 2014 cascade investments combined both of those companies and the land into generations farms which continued to grow vegetables some of that land including nearly 300 acres was sold in 2019 to the california based grimmway farms the world s largest carrot producer another 5 500 acres was sold to generation land georgia a company that shares an address with miami based optimum agriculture which bought generations farms in 2019 members of the stanley family now work for generations in north louisiana the gateses investment firm owns about 70 000 acres of land through at least three other shell companies there farmers primarily grow soybeans rice corn and cotton one of the largest plots of land owned by a subsidiary of the gateses investment arm in louisiana angelina plantation was previously owned by jailed former worldcom ceo bernard ebbers that land is now largely rented out to various farmers along the columbia river border between washington and oregon the gateses purchased 100 circles farm a 14 500 acre plot of land for 171 million in 2018 according to property and business records there on gates parcels an industrial farm grows potatoes for mcdonald s french fries cascade declined to comment on its specific land holdings but farmer advocates say the gateses large scale farm purchases don t make room for smaller farmers to break into the market after all few can out bid bill gates farmers just aren t owning the assets anymore someone else is owning that asset whether it s rented equipment or land someone else is building that equity on their back said johnathan hladik the policy director at the center for rural affairs who is also a farmer in nebraska when bill gates or whatever other investment arm owns the land a farmer still needs to farm it but they re just renting it so if now the best farmers can do if you want to stay in farming is rent this land you re not going to get the benefits that come with land ownership fake meat while the gateses are best known for their philanthropic work tackling large scale societal problems like funding the coronavirus vaccine and controlling malaria via the bill and melinda gates foundation they have also invested in some companies rethinking food production and have endorsed the use of genetically modified seeds as one way to increase farming productivity and feed more people globally in 2010 the gates foundation trust invested about 23 million in monsanto a genetically modified seed and chemical company though it sold its shares the next year following outcry from environmental groups bill gates was also an early investor in fake meat companies aiming to combat the environmental harms of raising livestock by creating more convincing plant based alternatives he backed impossible foods which relies on genetically modified soybeans and also held shares of beyond meat through the bill and melinda gates foundation trust though sec filings show those shares were sold in 2019 in may bill gates also transferred about 850 million in shares of the agricultural machinery company john deere to his wife melinda gates after the two shared publicly their plans to divorce besides the enrollment of their landholdings in leading harvest the gates foundation in 2020 also created an agricultural nonprofit gates ag one which focuses on bringing affordable solutions to small scale farmers in sub saharan africa and south asia to improve crop productivity the gates foundation said in a statement that its agriculture efforts do not extend to farming in the u s but those working on projects with both investors and farmers to create ecologically sustainable farming methods and support diverse and disadvantaged farming communities say rethinking agriculture and working to avert a climate crisis go hand in hand they add it will take those with large parcels of land like the gateses u s farmland holdings to do it we know that one of the best ways to sequester carbon is through the soil and that it s going to take big swaths of land like what bill gates has taken to do that said konda mason the founder and president of jubilee justice and potlikker capital which funds and supports regenerative agriculture projects owned by people of color mason notes that trying to draw hard lines between one s philanthropic work and one s investments does not work now you have a foundation where the mission on one side is to save the world and to do all these wonderful things surrounding climate and on the other side they re investing in the exact same things that are causing the harm that the mission side is trying to protect mason said it makes no sense nbc 8 june 2021

lakeland sands and lakeland sands florida llc both of those companies were founded in 2012 with the same address as cascade investments in kirkland which later changed its mailing address to a louisiana post office box assigned to oak river farms another subsidiary of cascade nbc news also found that another 6 500 acres in north florida are owned by yet another company suwannee river terra which was also started with an address in kirkland and an email address from the bill and melinda gates investment firm which is now registered to the current chief counsel of oak river farms with a mailing address in kansas according to property records in every state where the gateses own land a tangled web of locally registered limited liability companies follow while those companies don t explicitly name cascade investments as the owner in their public records they do share the address of cascade in kirkland washington or the address of a cascade subsidiary list the names of cascade employees who registered the companies and sometimes even email addresses from the bill and melinda gates investment group fertilizer runoff but some farmers whose land is adjacent to that of the gateses have expressed disappointment that despite the couple s wealth they have not done more to preserve the environment quarterman also serves as the suwannee riverkeeper and advocates for conservation of the intricate network of springs and rivers in the region where water from the swamps of georgia flow into florida before they release in the gulf of mexico he said that this is where large tracts of rich farmland is used to raise livestock and grow many of the vegetables that end up in grocery aisles up and down the east coast all that farming has led to large water withdrawals from the floridan aquifer system and requires fertilizer which causes runoff into waterways emptying nitrogen that has led to destructive algae blooms and severe loss of fish and marsh habitats he hoped gates would have invested in different farming techniques that could help turn around the ecological damages from big agriculture well you d think if you re looking for somebody with enough capital to try that he would go first right but he didn t quarterman said he never did anything that different from before he got here and what other farmers were doing nearby quarterman guessed that may be because bill gates isn t the one doing the farming he s the landlord or rather the companies owned by his investment firm are the landlords and not all the renters are local but zehren of cascade noted that the firm has been working in florida and elsewhere to promote ecologically conscious agriculture and that it plans to continue to evaluate its farmland portfolio to improve its overall sustainability in enrolling in leading harvest cascade has implemented new initiatives on its farmland holdings ranging from adding additional pollinator habitat in nebraska to planting wildlife friendly trees on dry pivot corners in florida to hosting grain bin safety rescue training for the local community in louisiana to converting numerous diesel power units to electric to reduce carbon output to name a few zheren said carrots onions and french fries a survey of the gateses farmland holdings shows a broad range of vegetables that americans eat can be traced back to his land and that some of this land has also been owned by other billionaires starting in 2012 gates investment firm began buying family farms in south georgia one of those farms stanley farms specialized in vidalia onions and another coggins farms focused on growing carrots in 2014 cascade investments combined both of those companies and the land into generations farms which continued to grow vegetables some of that land including nearly 300 acres was sold in 2019 to the california based grimmway farms the world s largest carrot producer another 5 500 acres was sold to generation land georgia a company that shares an address with miami based optimum agriculture which bought generations farms in 2019 members of the stanley family now work for generations in north louisiana the gateses investment firm owns about 70 000 acres of land through at least three other shell companies there farmers primarily grow soybeans rice corn and cotton one of the largest plots of land owned by a subsidiary of the gateses investment arm in louisiana angelina plantation was previously owned by jailed former worldcom ceo bernard ebbers that land is now largely rented out to various farmers along the columbia river border between washington and oregon the gateses purchased 100 circles farm a 14 500 acre plot of land for 171 million in 2018 according to property and business records there on gates parcels an industrial farm grows potatoes for mcdonald s french fries cascade declined to comment on its specific land holdings but farmer advocates say the gateses large scale farm purchases don t make room for smaller farmers to break into the market after all few can out bid bill gates farmers just aren t owning the assets anymore someone else is owning that asset whether it s rented equipment or land someone else is building that equity on their back said johnathan hladik the policy director at the center for rural affairs who is also a farmer in nebraska when bill gates or whatever other investment arm owns the land a farmer still needs to farm it but they re just renting it so if now the best farmers can do if you want to stay in farming is rent this land you re not going to get the benefits that come with land ownership fake meat while the gateses are best known for their philanthropic work tackling large scale societal problems like funding the coronavirus vaccine and controlling malaria via the bill and melinda gates foundation they have also invested in some companies rethinking food production and have endorsed the use of genetically modified seeds as one way to increase farming productivity and feed more people globally in 2010 the gates foundation trust invested about 23 million in monsanto a genetically modified seed and chemical company though it sold its shares the next year following outcry from environmental groups bill gates was also an early investor in fake meat companies aiming to combat the environmental harms of raising livestock by creating more convincing plant based alternatives he backed impossible foods which relies on genetically modified soybeans and also held shares of beyond meat through the bill and melinda gates foundation trust though sec filings show those shares were sold in 2019 in may bill gates also transferred about 850 million in shares of the agricultural machinery company john deere to his wife melinda gates after the two shared publicly their plans to divorce besides the enrollment of their landholdings in leading harvest the gates foundation in 2020 also created an agricultural nonprofit gates ag one which focuses on bringing affordable solutions to small scale farmers in sub saharan africa and south asia to improve crop productivity the gates foundation said in a statement that its agriculture efforts do not extend to farming in the u s but those working on projects with both investors and farmers to create ecologically sustainable farming methods and support diverse and disadvantaged farming communities say rethinking agriculture and working to avert a climate crisis go hand in hand they add it will take those with large parcels of land like the gateses u s farmland holdings to do it we know that one of the best ways to sequester carbon is through the soil and that it s going to take big swaths of land like what bill gates has taken to do that said konda mason the founder and president of jubilee justice and potlikker capital which funds and supports regenerative agriculture projects owned by people of color mason notes that trying to draw hard lines between one s philanthropic work and one s investments does not work now you have a foundation where the mission on one side is to save the world and to do all these wonderful things surrounding climate and on the other side they re investing in the exact same things that are causing the harm that the mission side is trying to protect mason said it makes no sense nbc 8 june 2021

rochester minn aduhelm the first treatment ever approved by the fda to target alzheimer s disease at the level of brain deterioration will likely be available only for limited populations at mayo clinic that s according to a clinic neurologist who studied the drug and has expressed concerns about its effectiveness i ve publicly expressed my views that i thought the data that showed there were clinical benefits were very weak mayo clinic neurologist dr david knopman said of the treatment whose generic name is aducanumab we re going to restrict it to people like those who were in the trial he said we re not going to treat patients with the drug who are too severe and we are not going to treat patients who are asymptomatic an intravenous medication manufactured by massachusetts based drugmaker biogen the monoclonal antibody attacks amyloid plaque dense proteins in the brain that are associated with the disease advertisement the drug is proven to reduce the plaque a so called biomarker of the illness but critics question whether doing so will reduce clinical features such as memory loss and cognitive decline the decision today by the fda was to approve the drug based on the fact that it lowered brain amyloid levels knopman said even though there was no acknowledgment by the fda that the drug had consistent clinical benefits for patients under fda rules two positive studies are needed to approve a drug for sale while two identical trials demonstrated aducanumab does cause a significant decrease in amyloid plaque only one showed positive effects on cognitive features of the disease and those were modest in one of the studies there was no delay in progression knopman said in the other there was a slight delay in progression of symptoms nobody got better nobody stayed the same they just found that people didn t get worse as quickly in the one study that showed some benefit dr david knopman photo mayo clinic the fda has retained the right to withdraw its approval of aducanumab if a follow up trial does not show clinical benefits but cited unmet need in giving the drug the green light under a lower regulatory threshold advertisement regulators gave the drug their nod over objections of their own panel of experts biogen announced on monday june 7 it plans to charge 56 000 for aduhelm its stock reached a record high following the announcement clinicians on monday strove to reduce expectations for the treatment access to which will likely prove galvanizing for the families of some 6 million americans afflicted with alzheimer s disease mayo clinic neurologist dr ronald peterson in the medical publication stat cautioned that this is not going to be penicillin for alzheimer s disease knopman a site investigator in one of the two trials of the drug was joined last fall by fellow mayo neurologist dr david t jones and a colleague from stanford in coauthoring a paper calling for more research on the drug the article cautioned that approval would have a massive impact on health care economics and the feasibility of conducting future clinical trials of the medication alzheimer s dementia which published their paper is the journal of the patient advocacy group the alzheimer s association it is an enthusiastic supporter of the drug the alzheimer s association will do everything in its power to ensure access to the drug the organization stated on its website monday advertisement it called aduhelm s approval historic and the start of an exciting era in alzheimer s and dementia treatment and research they know that i strongly disagree with their position says knopman who has served as vice chair to the organization s medical and scientific advisory council and who is currently a senior advisor so we respectfully disagree with one another there were two very large phase iii studies knopman said of the evidence for the new drug one of them showed some statistically significant evidence of benefits very small but statistically significant the other was designed in an identical manner was done identically and found no benefit at all if you approach it as a lay person you tried something once and it worked but you tried the same thing again and it didn t work would you conclude you d want to sail across the ocean in that ship you d want to test it a little more wouldn t you
mining giant bhp was last night embroiled in a major sex scandal after a worker was charged with the rape of a colleague in western australia the alleged assault is understood to be one of the catalysts for the ftse 100 company s recent crackdown on binge drinking as it tries to reduce the risk of booze fuelled attacks and harassment of female employees the anglo american giant was accused of violating workers human rights last month as it unveiled plans to ban miners from drinking beer after 9 30pm and limit them to four drinks a day poor working conditions bhp s vast south flank iron ore mine in pilbara western australia it said this move reflected changes to guidance from the australian government in december which now recommends that adults consume no more than four standard alcoholic drinks in any one day the curbs will come into force next month but the urgent need to tackle drunken behaviour at bhp s male dominated mining sites became clearer yesterday as western australian police charged a 35 year old employee over the alleged rape of a colleague near the company s enormous south flank iron ore operation in pilbara the man from vasse in south west australia has been refused bail and will appear in court in perth today he has already been fired by the company following an independent investigation fellow workers at the mine say a woman in her twenties was followed back to her accommodation at the camp known as mulla mulla village where she was allegedly attacked according to the west australian newspaper the incident occurred after the woman rejected advances from male colleagues in the mining camp s wet mess a dining area where workers often meet for drinks after their shift the alleged attack took place in november last year but was only reported to police earlier this year last night it also sparked a wider row over bhp s treatment of workers with a union leader claiming that the dehumanising conditions at mine sites are fuelling widespread alcohol and drug abuse and leading to more anti social behaviour as the rape allegations surfaced bhp revealed that it has also introduced a chaperone service offering a uniformed security guard to escort those too scared to return to their accommodation alone flyers for the walk to room service have been posted across its sites over the past year to make workers feel safer the flyer states residents and village staff can request to be accompanied to their rooms for different reasons these include if you feel uncomfortable for any reason while walking to your room a spokesman for bhp yesterday described sexual assault or harassment as unacceptable at bhp full stop he added that staff now have to go through mandatory training in respectful behaviours while extra lighting cctv and security has been installed at mining sites but yesterday mick buchan secretary of the construction forestry mining and energy union said bhp was partly to blame for driving workers to alcohol and drug abuse mine workers fly into remote sites and often work consecutive 12 hour days during a two week shift before they return home again he said there s no question that working manual labour for 12 hours a day 14 days straight incentivises the use of alcohol to wind down at night and other substances to get going in the morning scene of the crime mining accommodation in mulla mulla village where the woman in her twenties was allegedly attacked although bhp said it has invested heavily in its mining camps installing gyms and even meditation rooms buchan claimed that life has actually become harder for workers as the firm has tried to cut costs one key problem he said is the introduction of a system of hot bedding to save money whereby small huts called dongas are swapped between workers so they are never left empty previously workers would be allocated their own donga when they started a construction job this would remain their home for the entire project which could last up to two years and would be left empty when their shift finished workers would put up photos of loved ones and some would even plant vegetable patches to make themselves feel at home they would also develop a sense of place and community said buchan as they would get to know their neighbours but he said the move to hot bedding means workers often have no idea who is also in the room and cannot build any sense of community it s well known that having a sense of place and community protects against anti social behaviour he said we should have learned by now that when you take people away from the support network of their family and community it s not healthy a boom in iron ore prices has helped to deliver bumper profits for the firm and enabled it to dish out record dividends to shareholders but the rape allegations threaten to tarnish its reputation particularly if more allegations of sexual harassment and poor working conditions at its mines emerge rio tinto bhp s anglo australian competitor is still reeling from the reputational damage caused after it blew up some sacred aboriginal caves just over a year ago a spokesperson for bhp said we are absolutely clear on this and all employees contractors and those that come to our sites are made aware of their obligation to support a safe and respectful workplace we continue to strengthen our approach at all of our sites and offices
the road to digital disaster bitcoin mania is spiralling out of control and it could soon end in tears says victoria bischoff here at money mail we have made no bones about being deeply sceptical of cryptocurrency it has proven to be incredibly volatile and is more akin to gambling than sensible long term investing as we ve seen over the past week it takes only one comment by tesla founder elon musk or donald trump for the value of bitcoin to plunge overnight yet wherever i go if people aren t talking about covid they are talking about the crypto craze at a wedding recently i was stunned how many people admitted to having bought into these digital currencies and i was horrified to learn a friend s colleague had bet his house deposit on bitcoin despite never having invested in the stock market before it seems as though everyone has heard of a friend of a friend who has been able to get on the property ladder or give up work after making millions then fuelled by the fear of missing out fomo they have ploughed in assuming they will make a quick fortune too it is true that these digital coins have made some people and trading platforms very rich indeed but if you saw someone win big at a casino after risking 100 000 on black you surely wouldn t rush off to the nearest cash machine yet bitcoin mania continues to spiral out of control anyone who has bought cryptocurrency will not hear a bad word said about it because they know they need others to buy into the fantasy to keep pushing up the price around 12 000 bitcoin enthusiasts flocked to the biggest conference of its kind in miami last week in one video an american broadcaster and high profile bitcoin holder was screaming we re not selling to a buzzing crowd cheering wildly before saying something very rude about elon musk which i won t repeat here this is not behaviour you d associate with a serious investment opportunity it s more like a cult one that could soon end in tears so if you re tempted to dive in ask yourself why you think the price of cryptocurrency will go up as we reveal today experts say that the bitcoin phenomenon carries all the warning signs of a bubble set to burst cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value it s only valuable because people think it is yes it might still go up over time but it might also crash further especially over the coming summer months do you really like the sound of those odds and as with every single bubble in history it will implode when people cotton on to how foolish the whole thing is when that happens it will be ordinary investors who pay the price cash in hand on monday the post office launched a major campaign to save our cash it is calling on ministers to bring forward legislation to make cash a legal right for the millions who depend on it but access to cash is just one part of the problem since the start of the pandemic scores of retailers have introduced a ban on notes and coins they claim this is to protect customers and staff from covid despite assurances from experts that the risk is minimal just last week i was picking up a prescription from my local hospital and spotted a worrying sign that read due to current circumstances we are only accepting card payments this is unacceptable when paying for essential items such as medical supplies if you ve been turned away when trying to pay with cash write to us at moneymail dailymail co uk or money mail northcliffe house 2 derry street london w8 5tt car rip off fees last week i rather cynically suggested insurers may be plotting ways to boost their bottom line after the city watchdog ordered them to stop exploiting loyal customers at renewal time hey presto enter rip off admin charges money mail reader john campbell from essex said he was recently quoted a 30 renewal fee by his car insurer while renewal fees are not new they have been relatively uncommon up until now so we will be asking every insurer this week if they charge an admin fee to renew a home or car insurance policy how much it is and when it was introduced and know that we will be watching closely to see if this becomes a sneaky new trend v bischoff dailymail co uk
alex brummer aviva must get itself onto a war footing to keep the vultures at bay arguably if uk long investors did a better job of nudging ftse 100 companies into action vulture activist investors such as cevian and elliott advisers would not be afforded the space in which to operate cevian is seeking to dictate the future cost structure and payout strategy at aviva when newish chief executive amanda blanc has done considerably more than her many predecessors to define the future rather than poke the bear she is choosing to engage with cevian which has picked up a 5 per cent stake valued at 800million that may be the civilised approach to greenmail but in the case of cevian it could prove toxic the recent break up and sale overseas of britain s biggest general insurer the 300 year old rsa was triggered after cevian took a stake cevian headed by the butcher christer gardell may seem terribly reasonable but that s not what former executives at german steel and industrial giant thyssenkrupp have been saying they have accused activist investors which include cevian of waging psycho terror by placing lies in public one trusts that blanc and the aviva board headed by george culmer veteran of lloyds bank and rsa are not taking cevian at face value aviva must follow emma walmsley at pharma firm glaxosmithkline and place the insurance giant on a war footing since taking the helm blanc has moved rapidly to simplify the group and is focusing on three key markets britain canada and ireland blanc has sold eight offshoots raised 7 5billion in cash paid down 1 9billion of debt and pledged to redistribute proceeds to shareholders in her year in charge that is not as simple as cevian would have anyone believe several of the transactions including the 2 8billion sale of its french arm have yet to complete selling insurance assets and distributing capital is not like selling chip shops and offering the customers a free bag there are regulators to be satisfied on both sides of the channel and city enforcers need to make sure that aviva has a risk free capital cushion as the uk emerges from covid aviva itself doesn t have a great record of defending british firms it supported activist edward bramson when he sought to unseat jes staley at barclays led the assault on the deliveroo float and sided with elliott when it took aim at walmsley so it may find itself short of friends cevian is demanding a big share buyback an uplift in the dividend to 45p a share and at least 500million of cost cuts by 2023 it is outjumping blanc s promise of 300million of savings it is easy to demand people in britain be sacked from a designer swedish armchair in the hope of supercharged profits it appears too much of a coincidence that activists take aim at women ftse 100 bosses such as blanc and walmsley the reasons may be rooted in history in that after boards exhaust male succession candidates they turn to talented women but it is a terrible look for cevian and elliott power cut there can be no surprise that edf has decided to pull the plug on the dungeness b power station which has been supplying the nation since it opened in 1966 like much of the uk s edf owned nuclear fleet dungeness in kent is well past its sell by date the gmb union is stunned by the closure and rightly worried about the job security of the workers it need not be too concerned given that decommissioning can be a life s work the edf decision focuses attention on delays in getting finance together for a super station at sizewell as well as advancing work on rolls royce s small modular reactors ahead of cop 26 later this year fashion faux pas nigel farage can breathe easily again the former commodities trader was outraged when the hong kong owned london metal exchange called a halt to one of the last open outcry markets in the city and decided to go electronic that has now been rescinded and the screaming dealers in colourful jackets will return phew
thanks to a leak of internal revenue service records to propublica we know just how little some of the richest people in america have been paying in federal income tax in 2007 jeff bezos then a multibillionaire and now the world s richest man did not pay a penny a report published by the investigative news organization on tuesday begins he achieved the feat again in 2011 in 2018 tesla founder elon musk the second richest person in the world also paid no federal income taxes michael bloomberg managed to do the same in recent years billionaire investor carl icahn did it twice george soros paid no federal income tax three years in a row representatives for those mentioned would doubtless argue that some cherry picking went into that news lede the article later points out that between 2014 and 2018 bezos the founder and c e o of amazon paid nine hundred and seventy three million dollars to the feds in taxes while musk the c e o of tesla paid four hundred and fifty five million during the same period bloomberg the media magnate and former new york city mayor contributed 968 3 million to charitable causes in 2018 which helped to bring his over all income tax rate down to 3 7 per cent still the main thrust of the article cannot be denied in recent decades as the stock market has soared the vast fortunes amassed by some members of the plutocracy have largely escaped taxation in the words of jesse eisinger jeff ernsthausen and paul kiel the propublica journalists who wrote the report the irs records show that the wealthiest can perfectly legally pay income taxes that are only a tiny fraction of the hundreds of millions if not billions their fortunes grow each year this shouldn t be news to anybody unlike real estate which is subject to local property taxes most other forms of wealth in the united states aren t taxed on an annual basis the federal government supposedly takes a share whenever an asset is sold or transferred but there are loopholes in the tax system that allow the owners of vast fortunes to minimize the capital gains and inheritance taxes which they pay since the age of the economist henry george in the late nineteenth century the failure of the u s tax system to reach large agglomerations of wealth has attracted the attention of reformers in 1995 edward wolff an economist at new york university warned that a rising concentration of wealth represented a threat to american democracy and proposed an annual tax on the net worth of wealthy families more recently during the 2020 presidential campaign senator elizabeth warren called for a wealth tax that explicitly targeted the country s richest households warren revived her proposal early this year suggesting that the i r s would levy an annual tax of two per cent on fortunes of more than fifty million dollars and three per cent on fortunes of more than a billion dollars given the almost unimaginable wealth that some billionaires have the warren plan could theoretically raise a lot of revenue based on bezos s estimated worth roughly two hundred billion dollars he would be liable for an annual levy of more than five billion dollars under warren s proposal musk would stump up roughly four and a half billion mark zuckerberg the founder of facebook three billion compared with potential liabilities like these even during years when the überbillionaires do pay some taxes the sums involved are small the 25 richest americans collectively paid 0 17 of their wealth in taxes in 2018 gabriel zucman a berkeley economist who worked on warren s wealth tax proposal commented on twitter which no matter how you look at it implies tiny effective tax rates relative to income much lower than for the middle class one of the merits of the propublica piece is that it reminds us of the enormous variety of tax minimization options available to the extremely wealthy some are familiar holding onto stocks and other assets for as long as possible using investment losses to offset income investing in real estate which the tax code treats very favorably setting up charitable foundations but the article also emphasizes other less obvious tactics some principals of public companies avoid paying corporate dividends which are taxable to themselves and other stockholders warren buffett is an example of this many billionaires use their wealth as collateral for bank loans the interest on which may be tax deductible last year tesla reported that musk had pledged some 92 million shares which were worth about 57 7 billion as of may 29 2021 as collateral for personal loans the propublica piece states it goes on to report that in 2016 and 2017 the wall street billionaire carl icahn reported five hundred and forty four million dollars in adjusted gross income but because he had taken out so many loans he was able to take hundreds of millions of dollars in interest deductions which meant he avoided paying any federal income taxes i didn t make money because unfortunately for me my interest was higher than my whole adjusted income he told propublica as reports by the new york times about donald trump s federal tax returns also demonstrated it is not an exaggeration to say that there are two separate tax systems one is for ordinary people who make most of their money in wages and salaries the other is for members of the gilded class who make most of their money through the ownership of publicly traded assets private businesses and other forms of capital with one of the major political parties dead set against any changes that would make the system more progressive and an army of lobbyists for the rich waiting to pounce on any proposal reforming the tax code to make it fairer will be a big challenge but with enough political will it can be done the biden administration rejected warren s annual wealth tax idea but it did propose three important changes to the existing system first it suggested raising the corporate income tax rate from twenty one per cent to twenty eight per cent the burden of corporate taxes falls partly on shareholders so this move would effectively raise the tax rate of people like bezos and zuckerberg second the administration wants to raise the top income tax rate to 39 6 per cent and tax the capital gains of millionaires at that rate because the current tax rate for long term capital gains is only twenty per cent and because it s the same for all income groups this would make a big difference and finally the white house wants to eliminate the notorious step up in basis loophole which allows rich people to pass down property including financial assets to their heirs without either party paying any taxes on the appreciation in value under the biden proposal unrealized capital gains would be taxed at death none of these proposals has the headline value of imposing an annual wealth tax on the mega rich but they could have a significant impact according to the tax foundation a washington nonprofit that generally supports lower taxes the changes to the capital gains tax and the estate tax if combined with the existing estate tax could lead to a tax rate of sixty one per cent on the largest estates even if that estimate is too high the reforms that the white house is proposing would surely make the tax system more progressive at the very top a skeptic might object that the ultra rich with their armies of accountants will find a way to get around any tax system that is a counsel of despair with clear tax rules in place and a well financed i r s there to enforce them it is perfectly possible to shift the tax burden toward the ultra wealthy even if there is still some avoidance the revelations from propublica have provided another demonstration of why this change is so badly needed

reasons we love them plain and simple chocolate coated nuts are a not so secret indulgence for many people but frasca pastry chef alberto hernandez truly makes the best ones when we were shooting the photographs for this book we had to ask alberto to take them away because we couldn t stop eating them these are great as an any time of day snack and even better served alongside an espresso at the end of a meal note gianduja jee ahn doo yah chocolate is a piedmont specialty and consists of sweet chocolate mixed with 30 percent hazelnut paste think of a purer sophisticated nutella chocolate companies such as callebault and valhrona offer it in semisolid cream or block form but you can also use individually wrapped gianduja chocolates typically found in purveyors of fine italian products you can also use any fine milk chocolate of your liking in this recipe you will need deep frying thermometer or candy thermometer small silicone offset spatula optional ¾ cup sugar 2 tablespoons water 2½ cups roasted almonds 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon unsalted butter 2 cups gianduja chocolate pieces see note 2 cups cocoa powder directions 1 in a large heavy pot or dutch oven over medium low heat combine the sugar and water and stir until the sugar dissolves completely and the resulting syrup reaches soft crack stage 285 f on a candy thermometer 3 minutes 2 using a wooden spoon or silicone spatula stir the almonds into the sugar syrup mixing continuously to coat completely as you stir the sugar will crystallize and form a white coat around the nuts keep stirring until all the nuts are evenly coated the sugar coating may start to caramelize but don t worry if it doesn t give it another minute or two sprinkle in the salt and stir in the butter to coat the nuts 3 line a baking sheet with parchment paper and coat with nonstick cooking spray 4 spread out the nuts on the prepared baking sheet making sure they are not touching each other 5 in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water make sure the bottom of the bowl doesn t touch the water regularly stir the chocolate until melted about 2 minutes alternatively microwave the chocolate in short 10 to 15 second bursts stirring well after every burst until completely melted check the temperature as you re melting the chocolate it s important to temper it for a smooth even and crisp coating if you are using small gianduja chocolates rather than block chocolate for baking or regular milk chocolate melt the chocolate until it registers a temperature of no more than 104 f remove the chocolate from the heat and allow to cool until it reaches 86 f this will take 10 to 15 minutes if using another kind of chocolate refer to the temperature ranges specific to that chocolate on the back of the packaging when the chocolate is tempered you are ready to coat the nuts 6 put the cocoa powder in a large bowl set up a production line with the nuts the melted chocolate and the cocoa 7 working with one nut at a time dip the nut into the chocolate stir to coat and lift out using a small offset spatula or your fingers letting any excess chocolate drip off toss the dipped nut into the cocoa powder and shake the bowl to coat leave the nut in the cocoa powder while you continue to dip the remaining nuts in the melted chocolate followed by the cocoa powder move the coated nuts still in the cocoa bowl to a cool place not the refrigerator to rest for 1 hour while the chocolate sets 8 toss the nuts in a sieve or colander to discard excess cocoa powder and transfer to an airtight container the nuts will keep at room temperature for up to 2 weeks 4 linda hampsten fox the bindery chile gazpacho serves 4 6 this gazpacho resembles a famous tuscan recipe called pappa al pomodoro in that dish fresh

worthington with help wanted signs plastered on billboards posted at checkout counters and a bevy of advertisements published in local newspapers and online it s clear that businesses across worthington and throughout southwest minnesota are challenged to fill job vacancies it s evident in government too with several city and county positions still seeking viable candidates for some of its higher paid positions we have a labor shortage said carrie bendix who oversees the southwest minnesota private industry council in worthington marshall and montevideo locally its office is within the careerforce center inside the nobles county government center in downtown worthington we ve had a labor shortage since before covid and we have some of the highest vacancy rates in the state bendix added bendix who works in the 14 county region said part of the labor shortage is the result of declining populations in this part of the state with the exception of nobles county which continues to see growth due to new immigrants all other counties in the region note a population loss and therefore a reduction in its available workforce advertisement a lot of older people are retiring or nearing retirement age she said with covid that is probably playing a factor with their decision not to return to the workforce luke greiner minnesota department of employment and economic development deed regional analyst for southwest and central minnesota said rock county had the lowest unemployment rate at 1 9 for the month of april in the southwest region that compares to an unemployment rate of 3 7 among the 23 counties in the southwest region southwest minnesota was second only to southeast minnesota in april for its low unemployment rate april s average unemployment rate of 3 7 7 823 unemployed workers for the region was down from 4 6 in march and compares to 6 9 15 077 unemployed workers in april 2020 when many hospitality related jobs were temporarily cut due to the pandemic a major factor in the region s low unemployment rate is the drop in the labor force greiner said southwest minnesota s labor force dropped 5 6 from april 2019 to april 2021 12 570 workers which is rather severe considering the statewide decline came in at 1 7 what all of this means is that workers have options there are currently 8 job seekers for every available job in southwest minnesota statewide the rate is 1 1 job seekers for every vacancy we re back to what is it going to take to get somebody to come work for you when they re already working for someone else greiner said we have this huge decline in our labor force we don t know yet if they re ever coming back and we don t know who it is stay at home moms or retired workers the pandemic resulted in an unknown number of working parents leaving the workforce to care for young children at home and help older children with online learning when schools were using distance and hybrid learning models advertisement employers will need to address flexibility with child care safety for employees and health care issues if they expect to lure those who don t necessarily need a paycheck to return to the workforce greiner said meanwhile schools also need to return to more consistent scheduling to make it possible for parents to return to work if it s a retiree who has left the workforce greiner said phenomenal gains in the stock market which pads an individual s retirement may be what gets some retired people back to work the leading reason for early retirement in the country is because of health conditions not that you can afford to retire early greiner cautioned so what must employers do offer higher wages offer incentives offer bonuses anything to get a potential employee in the door and encourage them to stay it s going to take some creative strategies greiner said i ve seen some employers offering bonuses interview bonuses even greiner said one of the greatest issues employers are currently facing are applicants who are ghosting employers not showing up for job interviews and not calling back when they are offered a position he suggests employers act quickly when they find a potential fit with an applicant if you can correspond faster than your competitor i think that s an edge he said you re not going to sit around and wait if there are 50 openings available advertisement greiner said available jobs in the region run the gamut from entry level to high tech in the fourth quarter of 2020 the median wage paid in the region was 16 53 per hour which was 6 cents per hour less than the statewide median wage we re seeing wages for job offers grow pretty quickly in southwest minnesota greiner noted it probably has to do with the tight labor market the federal government continues to offer additional unemployment benefits to those who haven t returned to the workforce to the tune of 300 per month that s on top of the regular unemployment benefits an individual receives when they have lost their job greiner said it s difficult to say how much of an impact that additional money is having on people returning to the workforce i hear a lot about that from employers he said noting the 300 benefit will expire in september i believe employers are dealing with that to the extent we re not really sure regardless of unemployment insurance benefits we have a tight labor market he added back in worthington bendix said the careerforce is open and people are welcome to call for assistance in their job search we have funding to help people get retrained if they were laid off and we can help pay for training she said now is the time to do that before their unemployment runs out advertisement on thursday the southwest minnesota private industry council is collaborating with minnesota west community technical college and other partners to host a big ideas job fair from 10 a m to 6 p m in the college parking lot in worthington

singapore june 8 the expert committee on covid 19 vaccination under the singapore ministry of health moh has refuted online claims asserting that messenger ribonucleic acid mrna covid 19 vaccines are ineffective against viral variants it also said it is crucial that medical professionals do not spread unsubstantiated and unscientific information in a statement yesterday the committee said that based on its continued review of data and evidence the current mrna covid 19 vaccines used here pfizer biontech and moderna continue to be safe and highly effective and show protection against variants of concern the committee noted that some social media messages have also claimed that inactivated virus vaccines such as sinovac would provide superior protection advertisement the inactivated virus covid 19 vaccines have variable protection and there is currently no evidence to suggest that inactivated virus vaccines demonstrate higher vaccine efficacy against variants of concern than the mrna vaccines this clarification by the expert committee comes after several doctors aired their views against mrna covid 19 vaccines in the past weeks last week a petition was started online by a group of doctors urging the government to include sinovac in the national vaccination programme advertisement some doctors among this group also wrote an open letter earlier to parents asking them to think through carefully before choosing to inoculate their children against covid 19 a separate circulated whatsapp message by dr gabriel oon who led singapore s hepatitis b vaccination project in the 1970s and 1980s said that mrna vaccines are ineffective against the b1617 variant that was first detected in india heading the expert committee on covid 19 vaccination is dr benjamin ong senior advisor to the director of medical services at moh and senior vice president of health education and resources at the national university of singapore among the members of the committee is dr david lye who is the director of infectious disease research at the national centre for infectious diseases ncid dr lye had shot down some of the doctors claims in a facebook post yesterday adding that covid 19 vaccines using mrna technology are the most effective against the coronavirus including its variants he noted that on the other hand there is hardly any data on how the sinovac vaccine performs against the variants the committee added it is critical that medical professionals do not spread unsubstantiated and unscientific information the public has a right to expect medical professionals to give advice based on fact and not on unproven assertions the public should rely on reputable sources of scientific and medical information and verify opinions shared by others against these it added that the authorised pfizer biontech and moderna covid 19 vaccines are safe and effective and it is recommended that medically eligible persons in singapore should be vaccinated with them the expert committee said that pfizer biontech and moderna mrna vaccines have in various studies consistently shown to be highly efficacious at around 90 per cent especially in protecting against severe covid 19 disease and hospitalisation these were demonstrated in various trials and actual roll outs in the united states united kingdom and israel emerging data continues to show that the mrna vaccines are also effective against the b1617 variant for instance a study in the uk showed that two doses of the pfizer biontech mrna vaccine confer about 88 per cent protection against symptomatic covid 19 even with the delta or b16172 variant while further studies are required before a definitive conclusion can be made the available data globally indicates that substantial protection is preserved the committee said it acknowledged that protection conferred by any vaccine is not 100 per cent and that with the emergence of new variants vaccine breakthroughs where people still fall ill despite being fully vaccinated can occur however it added that the detection of asymptomatic to mild infections locally with the delta variant does not indicate a lack of protection rather the findings showed that the infected people have mild or no symptoms and this is in line with the global evidence that the mrna vaccines have a high level of protection against symptomatic and severe disease the pfizer biontech and moderna vaccines have been approved by multiple reputable international regulatory bodies and their manufacturers have publicly released their detailed study protocols and openly published their findings to be scrutinised by the scientific community after peer review there is reliable scientific evidence that pfizer biontech and moderna vaccines are safe and effective and the expert committee continues to strongly recommend that medically eligible persons should be vaccinated with them it added vaccines produced to fight the coronavirus need a spike protein to trigger the human body s immune system to develop antibodies the spike protein on the surface of the virus helps it to enter human cells and cause an infection a vaccine using the traditional inactivated virus approach has the whole spike protein whereas mrna vaccines do not have that but instruct cells to produce it to get an immune system response dr lye said in reply to comments on his facebook post committee s take on inactivated virus vaccines the committee noted that the sinovac vaccine has yet to meet the requirements for the health sciences authority s pandemic special access route which helps to facilitate early access to critical novel vaccines medicines and medical devices during a pandemic this is because more safety and quality data required for sinovac to meet the standards of evaluation under this route are still pending both pfizer biontech and moderna are authorised under this route the sinovac vaccine has shown variable protection across multiple studies carried out internationally the committee said with the most complete analysis of the vaccine showing a vaccine efficacy of 51 per cent on per protocol analysis the protection of sinovac against newer variants such as the delta variant and under real world conditions remains unknown the committee added it noted that sinovac has been qualified by the world health organisation who under its emergency use listing procedure for use only in persons aged 18 years and above dr oon had said in his circulated message that the sinovac vaccine may be suitable for children and even babies but at a lowered dosage the committee said however that sinovac has not been recommended by who for persons under 18 years old and so it will not be an option in the meantime for children and adolescents globally or in singapore moh said last friday that the 200 000 doses of sinovac vaccines that singapore has in stock will be released for free to licensed private healthcare providers to administer to adults under a special access route today

the road to digital disaster bitcoin mania is spiralling out of control and it could soon end in tears says victoria bischoff here at money mail we have made no bones about being deeply sceptical of cryptocurrency it has proven to be incredibly volatile and is more akin to gambling than sensible long term investing as we ve seen over the past week it takes only one comment by tesla founder elon musk or donald trump for the value of bitcoin to plunge overnight yet wherever i go if people aren t talking about covid they are talking about the crypto craze at a wedding recently i was stunned how many people admitted to having bought into these digital currencies and i was horrified to learn a friend s colleague had bet his house deposit on bitcoin despite never having invested in the stock market before it seems as though everyone has heard of a friend of a friend who has been able to get on the property ladder or give up work after making millions then fuelled by the fear of missing out fomo they have ploughed in assuming they will make a quick fortune too it is true that these digital coins have made some people and trading platforms very rich indeed but if you saw someone win big at a casino after risking 100 000 on black you surely wouldn t rush off to the nearest cash machine yet bitcoin mania continues to spiral out of control anyone who has bought cryptocurrency will not hear a bad word said about it because they know they need others to buy into the fantasy to keep pushing up the price around 12 000 bitcoin enthusiasts flocked to the biggest conference of its kind in miami last week in one video an american broadcaster and high profile bitcoin holder was screaming we re not selling to a buzzing crowd cheering wildly before saying something very rude about elon musk which i won t repeat here this is not behaviour you d associate with a serious investment opportunity it s more like a cult one that could soon end in tears so if you re tempted to dive in ask yourself why you think the price of cryptocurrency will go up as we reveal today experts say that the bitcoin phenomenon carries all the warning signs of a bubble set to burst cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value it s only valuable because people think it is yes it might still go up over time but it might also crash further especially over the coming summer months do you really like the sound of those odds and as with every single bubble in history it will implode when people cotton on to how foolish the whole thing is when that happens it will be ordinary investors who pay the price cash in hand on monday the post office launched a major campaign to save our cash it is calling on ministers to bring forward legislation to make cash a legal right for the millions who depend on it but access to cash is just one part of the problem since the start of the pandemic scores of retailers have introduced a ban on notes and coins they claim this is to protect customers and staff from covid despite assurances from experts that the risk is minimal just last week i was picking up a prescription from my local hospital and spotted a worrying sign that read due to current circumstances we are only accepting card payments this is unacceptable when paying for essential items such as medical supplies if you ve been turned away when trying to pay with cash write to us at moneymail dailymail co uk or money mail northcliffe house 2 derry street london w8 5tt car rip off fees last week i rather cynically suggested insurers may be plotting ways to boost their bottom line after the city watchdog ordered them to stop exploiting loyal customers at renewal time hey presto enter rip off admin charges money mail reader john campbell from essex said he was recently quoted a 30 renewal fee by his car insurer while renewal fees are not new they have been relatively uncommon up until now so we will be asking every insurer this week if they charge an admin fee to renew a home or car insurance policy how much it is and when it was introduced and know that we will be watching closely to see if this becomes a sneaky new trend v bischoff dailymail co uk

a top australian chef has revealed her surprising secret for seasoning meat and poultry to perfection and why fish and vegetables require a very different approach danielle alvarez head chef at fred s in paddington sydney said thick cuts of steak shoulders of lamb and whole chickens should be salted up to two days before cooking then kept covered in the fridge until you are ready to use it ms alvarez told good food australia that pre seasoning days in advance will make meat sweeter juicier and infinitely more tender than doing so during cooking she said fish is more delicate and should only be salted 10 to 15 minutes beforehand to prevent skin from becoming tough a top australian chef says thick cuts of steak shoulders of lamb and whole chickens should be salted up to two days before cooking stock image a chef s guide to perfect seasoning steak lamb and pork salt up to two days in advance cover and refrigerate until needed whole chickens salt up to two days in advance cover and refrigerate until needed fish salt 10 to 15 minutes before cooking vegetables generously salt pots of boiling water that will be used for cooking don t season veggies themselves source danielle alvarez advertisement danielle alvarez head chef at fred s in paddington sydney and when it comes to vegetables ms alvarez said she adds flavour by generously salting pots of boiling water instead of seasoning the greens themselves even if you cannot salt meat a day in advance some time is better than no time she said if you only have an hour or two salt the meat and leave it out at room temperature as cold temperatures impede the salt from doing its thing the cookbook author who has almost 15 years of experience in some of the world s best kitchens including four at the legendary chez panisse in berkeley california said waiting to season until food is fully cooked can leave it bland and salty ms alvarez said seasoning at the right time also reduces the amount of salt needed to pack a flavoursome punch making dishes healthier she said it s also important to be discerning about the type of salt you use ms alvarez s preferred choice of seasoning is sea salt because it gives food the cleanest most natural flavour stock image her preferred choice of seasoning is sea salt because it gives food the cleanest most natural flavour you should also be mindful about how much salt you use according to ms alvarez she said using roughly one percent of the total weight of whatever you are cooking is a good rule of thumb ms alvarez said it s crucial to season with just enough salt because too little leaves food tasteless and dull while too much makes it inedible

arguably if uk long investors did a better job of nudging ftse 100 companies into action vulture activist investors such as cevian and elliott advisers would not be afforded the space in which to operate cevian is seeking to dictate the future cost structure and payout strategy at aviva when newish chief executive amanda blanc has done considerably more than her many predecessors to define the future rather than poke the bear she is choosing to engage with cevian which has picked up a 5 per cent stake valued at 800million cevian is seeking to dictate the future cost structure and pay out strategy at aviva when newish chief exec amanda blanc has done far more than her predecessors to define the future that may be the civilised approach to greenmail but in the case of cevian it could prove toxic the recent break up and sale overseas of britain s biggest general insurer the 300 year old rsa was triggered after cevian took a stake cevian headed by the butcher christer gardell may seem terribly reasonable but that s not what former executives at german steel and industrial giant thyssenkrupp have been saying they have accused activist investors which include cevian of waging psycho terror by placing lies in public one trusts that blanc and the aviva board headed by george culmer veteran of lloyds bank and rsa are not taking cevian at face value aviva must follow emma walmsley at pharma firm glaxosmithkline and place the insurance giant on a war footing since taking the helm blanc has moved rapidly to simplify the group and is focusing on three key markets britain canada and ireland blanc has sold eight offshoots raised 7 5billion in cash paid down 1 9billion of debt and pledged to redistribute proceeds to shareholders in her year in charge that is not as simple as cevian would have anyone believe several of the transactions including the 2 8billion sale of its french arm have yet to complete selling insurance assets and distributing capital is not like selling chip shops and offering the customers a free bag there are regulators to be satisfied on both sides of the channel and city enforcers need to make sure that aviva has a risk free capital cushion as the uk emerges from covid aviva itself doesn t have a great record of defending british firms it supported activist edward bramson when he sought to unseat jes staley at barclays led the assault on the deliveroo float and sided with elliott when it took aim at walmsley so it may find itself short of friends cevian is demanding a big share buyback an uplift in the dividend to 45p a share and at least 500million of cost cuts by 2023 it is outjumping blanc s promise of 300million of savings it is easy to demand people in britain be sacked from a designer swedish armchair in the hope of supercharged profits it appears too much of a coincidence that activists take aim at women ftse 100 bosses such as blanc and walmsley the reasons may be rooted in history in that after boards exhaust male succession candidates they turn to talented women but it is a terrible look for cevian and elliott power cut there can be no surprise that edf has decided to pull the plug on the dungeness b power station which has been supplying the nation since it opened in 1966 like much of the uk s edf owned nuclear fleet dungeness in kent is well past its sell by date the gmb union is stunned by the closure and rightly worried about the job security of the workers it need not be too concerned given that decommissioning can be a life s work the edf decision focuses attention on delays in getting finance together for a super station at sizewell as well as advancing work on rolls royce s small modular reactors ahead of cop 26 later this year fashion faux pas nigel farage can breathe easily again the former commodities trader was outraged when the hong kong owned london metal exchange called a halt to one of the last open outcry markets in the city and decided to go electronic that has now been rescinded and the screaming dealers in colourful jackets will return phew
hong kong cnn business china s yuan is stronger than it has been since the start of the us china trade war that has left beijing in a pickle if the currency appreciates too quickly the country s financial markets could be rattled by a rapid influx of capital and the economy s fragile recovery could be thrown off track but government intervention to weaken the yuan could provoke washington which has long been suspicious of how much beijing controls its currency if china is trying to mend fences with the united states renewed accusations that it is a currency manipulator aren t going to help the rising value of the yuan isn t a completely new development the currency has jumped more than 10 over the past year but lately it has picked up even more steam recently climbing above 6 4 yuan per us dollar a boost attributable in part to the country s economic recovery and a weaker dollar the appreciation of the yuan indicates that the people s bank of china pboc has been willing to tolerate a stronger currency according to chaoping zhu global market strategist at jp morgan asset management he added in a research note this week that the central bank which allows the currency to trade every day within a narrow band may be trying to counter the escalating costs of commodities like steel and other building materials which are necessary for china s ambitious infrastructure plans too much too fast as with other aspects of china s economic and financial systems beijing is wary of too much happening too quickly if the yuan is too strong the country s exports could become less competitive and threaten the economic recovery robust export growth has helped the country continue to grow this year and that sector is a major source of employment in china financial stability is also a concern if too much unwanted money flows into the country that could fuel local asset bubbles and cause inflation our country must prevent a large influx of speculative money which could cause a disturbance to the financial market and pose problems to our independent monetary policy sheng songcheng a top government adviser and former pboc official told the state run xinhua news agency in a recent interview to temper the rally beijing announced this week that it would raise the reserve requirement ratio for foreign exchange holdings by 2 percentage points to 7 the first hike in 14 years the increase will force banks to hold more foreign exchange assets in reserve thus tightening the supply of foreign currency on the market and putting downward pressure on the yuan it s a rare move for the central bank which claims it has avoided direct intervention in the currency market since 2017 when it pledged to open up the flow of capital into and out of china and allow for a more flexible exchange rate it also signals that authorities may be willing to introduce more measures if necessary liu guoqiang deputy governor of the pboc said last week that the central bank will firmly crack down on currency speculation and the government s state council stressed at a recent executive meeting that it s necessary for the government to maintain the stability of monetary policy and keep the yuan basically stable while helping small and medium sized businesses cope with production and operation difficulties us china tensions whatever beijing does it has to be careful washington has long been wary of efforts by beijing to control the value of the yuan in 2019 the trump administration designated china a currency manipulator after the country s central bank allowed its currency to weaken amid the ongoing trade dispute china has denied that it rigs its currency the threat of escalating us china tensions hasn t gone away tariffs still remain on many chinese exports more than a year after the two countries reached a phase one trade deal and under president joe biden the united states and china have feuded over alleged human rights abuses in xinjiang and the origins of covid 19 the chinese central bank has so far refrained from using more effective measures to curb the yuan s rise according to ken cheung chief asian fx strategist for mizuho bank the banking authority could for example use a murky tool it introduced in 2017 that factors into its daily fixing of the yuan s value the pboc has never disclosed how exactly the tool works and suspended its use last october but markets have widely interpreted the tool as a way for the central bank to counter market forces that pull the yuan using that tool though could cause backlash for the us side and disrupt the trade talks cheung wrote in a research report this week should the central bank refrain from taking a more active role in curbing the yuan s value cheung suspected the currency will likely continue to be driven by the us dollar the greenback has weakened over the past few months weighed by a dovish federal reserve and rising inflation fears friday s us jobs report could continue to affect the dollar s strength as traders wait for more clues on the state of the country s economic recovery analysts at goldman sachs have suggested the yuan is likely to remain strong for a while even if that makes beijing uncomfortable that s in part because they expect foreign capital to continue coming into china and for the us dollar to keep weakening

why a judge has georgia vote fraud on his mind pristine biden ballots that looked xeroxed when fulton county ga poll manager suzi voyles sorted through a large stack of mail in ballots last november she noticed an alarmingly odd pattern of uniformity in the markings for joseph r biden one after another the absentee votes contained perfectly filled in ovals for biden except that each of the darkened bubbles featured an identical white void inside them in the shape of a tiny crescent indicating they d been marked with toner ink instead of a pen or pencil adding to suspicions she noticed that all of the ballots were printed on different stock paper than the others she handled as part of a statewide hand recount of the razor thin nov 3 presidential election and none was folded or creased as she typically observed in mail in ballots that had been removed from envelopes in short the biden votes looked like they d been duplicated by a copying machine all of them were strangely pristine said voyles who said she d never seen anything like it in her 20 years monitoring elections in fulton county which includes much of atlanta
president joe biden s border chief is inviting more lawfully deported migrants back into the united states so they can reunify with their left behind migrant children that is all good news for mark zuckerberg s fwd us investor group which is quietly funding a huge lobbying campaign for more amnesty and more migration the campaign leaders say the videos of emotional reunifications of the deported migrants are helping them to shift tv coverage away from the alarming inflow of economic migrants encouraged by president joe biden s immigration policies some of the family reunifications that we saw that sort of changed the coverage in may of this year and started humanizing what exactly is happening said xochitl hinojosa a director at fwd us s pr firm bully pulpit interactive she spoke during a may 26 video presentation to zuckerberg tied amnesty campaigners they were able to change national narrative at a time when their issue was under the absolute national spotlight said paulette aniskoff a partner at the pr firm the invited return of the lawfully deported migrants is being portrayed as reunifying families by alejandro mayorkas the secretary of the department of homeland security dhs that portrayal is possible because the deported migrant parents choose to leave their children in the united states to begin their own years long process of asking for asylum for themselves the migrant parents were sent home because they were found to be economic migrants who had no right to take jobs in the united states and no justification for legal asylum the department of homeland security is committed to the relentless pursuit of reunifying families who were cruelly separated by the previous administration mayorkas said in a dhs statement he continued when we reunified the first seven families last month i said that this was just the beginning in the coming weeks we will reunify 29 more families in close coordination with non governmental organizations legal and interagency partners the task force will continue this critical work the task force has also announced in its report the anticipated 29 additional families to be reunified in the united states in the coming weeks more reunifications are to follow as nearly 50 requests have been filed with u s citizenship and immigration services uscis thirty seven of these requests have already been reviewed and granted humanitarian parole once they enter the united states these individuals will be allowed to remain for an initial 36 month period with the opportunity to apply for work authorization this includes individuals from the families who were reunited in may as well as the 29 families that will reunite in the weeks ahead the big thing that i and others have taken away from this is defining the frame of what means most political important thing you can do said todd schulte who acts as the stage manager for fwd us s concealed orchestra of subsidized allies and front groups he spoke on may 26 with the pr executives schulte and his deputies said they try to reframe the national debate about migration around the tv magnified personal emotions of individual migrants the reframing is intended to exclude any media recognition of americans economic and ideological concerns about society law crime border violations and the huge impact of migration on wages and housing prices for example a march 9 fwd us funded polling memo advised pro amnesty legislators to avoid talking about the economics of migration it is better to focus on all of the aforementioned sympathetic details of those affected than to make economic arguments including arguments about wages or demand for labor as we have seen in the past talking about immigrants doing jobs americans won t do is not a helpful frame and other economic arguments are less effective than what is recommended above the group s reframing task is eased by the donor funded gop establishment gop leaders prefer that the media frame migration issue as all about chaos crime and border violations not americans wages jobs housing and opportunities however gop rep jim banks r in and his republican study committee are working hard to spotlight the public s worries about the economics of migration fwd us s reframing is deeply discordant with journalism s need to focus on the concerns of their readers and viewers in effect fwd us is prodding the news media to prioritize the concerns of foreign law breaking economic migrants above the economic and family concerns of roughly 30 million nightly viewers schulte declined to answer questions from breitbart news but the evidence indicates that he works under the guidance of david plouffe plouffe is the democratic strategist who was hired by zuckerberg in 2017 to block president donald trump s lower migration campaign promises above plouffe and schulte zuckerberg has spent tens of millions of dollars to build the orchestra of advocacy groups to argue for immigration increases the demand for more people makes sense for zuckerberg and his investor allies because every migrant young or old healthy or ill helps to spike consumer demand for the investors companies which include walmart uber grubhub and many more each additional migrant also spur demands for real estate and fwd us co founder bill gates is reportedly now the nation s largest landowner every additional legal or illegal migrant of working age adds to the pool of labor so nudging down wages and helping the investors boost profits and every extra dollar in profits creates roughly 20 in extra stock value on wall street dhs majorkas is staging open borders theater to please progressives sway women and push a narrative that enforcement is cruelty all to justify even more elite pushed migration into americans jobs neighborhoods neil munro neilmunrodc may 7 2021 for schulte plouffe and zuckerberg the pr problem began in march when the tv networks began broadcasting images of many migrants especially children crossing biden s border schulte said he continued to be pretty clear about it conditions on the ground with an increase in the number of children combined with what the media want to dub a crisis combined with the entire republican party deciding to go all in really created this huge spike and i want to be totally clear really bad media coverage for like two three weeks like super duper bad so you know we all looked around and decided whatever we were doing now wasn t working we decided to like dig in and see how could we like put a different situation to place hinojosa jumped in saying we had wall to wall coverage of especially on fox news pretty much all the networks not only of the border but we weren t telling the story about what the actual issue is which is asylum and a lot of people fleeing terrible conditions to seek asylum and part of that narrative is the trump administration he obviously made things worse and the biden administration has been working day and night to ensure that they are turning things around so what we quickly did is we changed the narrative and talked about and humanized the stories of people who are now reunified with their families we want to go ahead and show you this one clip that we were able to work with abc on it is a family who had been separated a mother who had been separated from her children in 2017 and hadn t seen her children since 2017 so this ended up getting covered on world news tonight good morning america and ended up on a number of networks this will just humanize what is actually happening as you can see this is a very moving story of a mother who is actually surprising her son she is from honduras and she was one of the first families who was reunified with her children this was because of the hard work of the administration we wanted to give you a sense of some of the family reunifications that we saw that sort of changed the coverage in may of this year and started humanizing what exactly is happening fwd us and its allies tweeted the videos 3 years 7 month 13 days watch the moment when mabel and her sons reunite mabel will be able to hold their kids in their arms again after years of agonizing separation this is why we do the work that we do this video says it all familiesbelongtogether pic twitter com ehwrgwy6x2 las americas immigrant advocacy center lasamericasiac may 5 2021 abc news did not respond to questions from breitbart news their coverage of the videos can be seen here and here mayorkas added his own voice to the campaign our highest priority is to reunite these families it s not about righting the wrong of the past it s about restoring the conscience of our government mayorkas said in a may 4 appearance on msnbc the big lesson over the last decade that is if you can pick the playing field and go on offense this is a huge winning issue said schulte if you sit back it gets really hard schulte continued i think you saw during that big spike was that the administration was allowing the opposition in a very crass and gross way to define the and so we have really seen as a sea change over the last two months as you ve seen the administration go on offense not only have they regained their footing on this police in like a big rebound of the polls on immigration and look from like some be clear like a hard hard hard march and so i think the big thing that jess and i and others have taken away from this is defining the frame of what this means is the single most politically important thing you can do one of the things we learned is your ability to drive conversation matters a lot said jess morales rocketto the president of families belong together her campaign is part of the national domestic workers alliance which gets funding from zuckerberg s fwd us rocketto continued when you re not driving conversation people are filling that with their unique sort of story and when you don t have people who drive conversation individuals organizations whatever it s very very difficult to get in the mix in the day to day on an issue and keep them there one of the things we re most proud of the families belong together is that we ve made it so that family separation is a front page issue whenever it comes up and that is really really important to the success of our efforts we need that media attention to keep driving the story that media narrative in particular social media s ability to turn around conversation is pretty critical it is also completely one sided but it is really critical so much has been put on the hundreds of groups that both todd and i have deep partnerships within our organizations around this work rocketto said adding when we are a chorus of voices talking about our work and really showing the connections that we have i believe that we are able to the sensationalized story is not the one that we will tell and instead will tell something more nuanced and ultimately more helpful to our longer term goals schulte and his networks use the parole videos to keep prodding reporters and activists to accept their reframing of the immigration dispute national tv ad of alejandra a military wife the mother of 2 u s citizen daughters who came home in time for mother s day after fighting for 3 yrs to be reunited with her family congress must pass a path to citizenship to ensure families like alejandra s stay together pic twitter com tanovlmzdr fwd us fwdus may 25 2021 schulte represents investors who are worth more than 300 billion and who also manage many additional billions of dollars for other investors so he made sure to motivate his online allies with a progressive message of a diverse multi cultural society ultimately i think what we were having a big conversation about this country and a fight about is are we going to become a diverse and diversifying democracy or not that s what voting rights restrictions are about that is what january 6 is about it is what conversations around immigration are ultimately about schulte insisted that amnesty is popular but also warned that the public is very sensitive to border chaos so like on the border in particular you know look this stuff gets trickier he said adding the big lessons we have here are people want a secure and orderly border i want to be very clear about that that is important and that is not important to republicans that is important to democrats and independents people want the idea that people will come legally to this country they view people s ability to come and seek asylum which is a legal right and they want a humane process but they don t really know what that has meant the big thing i would like everybody to understand about what s happening is that there are no good short term solutions when it comes to dealing with influxes of people within a fundamentally failed system and if you were advising candidates they should not defend a failed system just because their party may be the party in government right now then he made the investors pitch democrats should be the party who are in favor of a fundamental overhaul we should have a refugee system for the western hemisphere people should be able to work through a work based visa system we should have a family based immigration system schulte was a little coy as he pushed for a work based visa system but biden s january 20 amnesty bill is fwd us wish list and it includes a slightly hidden mechanism that would allow fortune 500 companies and their subcontractors to fill all their white collar jobs with an unlimited number of foreign graduates those foreign graduates would accept low wages and would work without complaint because biden s bill allows their executives to pay them with green cards and citizenship after 1o years of indentured servitude the resulting flood of foreign white collar labor would reduce wages for many american graduates pressure up their rents and force them to live further from work and friends for many years a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep non partisan and broad opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young u s graduates this opposition is multiracial cross sex non racist class based bipartisan rational persistent and recognizes the solidarity americans owe to each other the voter opposition to elite backed economic migration coexists with support for legal immigrants and some sympathy for illegal migrants but only a minority of americans mostly leftists embrace the many skewed polls and articles pushing the 1950 s corporate nation of immigrants claim migration moves money from employees to employers from families to investors from young to old from children to their parents from homebuyers to investors from technology to stoop labor from red states to blue states and from the central states to the coastal states such as new york

a bill that would allow unenrolled voters to participate in primary elections won bipartisan support in the state senate on tuesday suggesting potential momentum on an issue that has been debated in maine for years two years ago a proposal to allow unenrolled or independent voters to cast ballots in party primaries failed in both the maine house and the senate on tuesday however the senate voted 27 7 to give initial approval to a bill that would create semi open primaries enabling independent voters to vote in a political party s primary during each election cycle without having to enroll in that party six republican senators joined 21 democrats in supporting the measure l d 231 which now goes to the democratic controlled house for consideration if enacted the change would take effect for the 2024 elections meaning it won t be in effect for the congressional gubernatorial and legislative elections in 2022 sen chloe maxmin d nobleboro said the bill represented a step toward a more inclusive process given the proportion of maine voters who are not members of any political party but who as taxpayers still help pay for state elections according to data from the maine secretary of state s office 32 percent of voters were unenrolled in maine on election day last year the biggest thing that i heard from my constituents when i was campaigning is the need to feel heard and represented maxmin told her senate colleagues i think the fact that almost one third of our population here in maine cannot participate in our primary system is a good reason to not feel heard or represented and this bill is one step to creating a more inclusive representative democracy sen matthew pouliot an augusta republican who serves as his party s assistant minority leader agreed that it is important to allow unenrolled voters to participate in elections they subsidize but pouliot also acknowledged that engaging unenrolled voters in primaries could be a base building opportunity for republicans and democrats advertisement i believe this legislation will give both parties opportunity to engage more voters who may or may not choose to eventually join a party pouliot said during a senate floor speech this is common sense legislation that we should support for years unenrolled voters were the largest voting block in maine but democrats have made considerable headway in recent years particularly during the trump era and now account for 35 percent of the state s 1 1 million active registered voters roughly 28 percent of registered voters were enrolled in the republican party last november while 4 percent were enrolled in the green independent party related bill to open primaries in maine gains support from olympia snowe maxmin s bill would create semi open primaries in maine because it would still prohibit individuals registered with one party from casting ballots in another party s primary elections currently people who want to change their party registration must do so at least 15 days prior to a primary election caucus or convention in order to participate unless they are also changing their town of residence that would not change under maxmin s bill a group called open primaries maine has been advocating for the change this year and enlisting bipartisan support for the bill former republican u s sen olympia snowe for instance recently announced her support for the measure power resides with the people through the ballot box snowe said in a statement this month in order to help ensure that candidates better reflect the ideological pragmatism of most americans maine should enact semi open primaries the house will likely take up the bill in the coming days advertisement in other election related votes senate democrats defeated several bills that would have required voters to show a photo id in order to cast a ballot democrats already had voted overwhelmingly in the house to defeat photo id voting measures in other news the maine house narrowly rejected a measure that would have allowed towns and cities to impose an additional 1 percent local tax on lodging and prepared foods the bill failed on a 69 74 vote leaders in several of maine s larger towns and cities as well as tourism hotspots have been advocating for a so called local option sales tax for years supporters argue that the revenue would help reduce the burden shouldered by local property taxpayers for the upkeep of roads and other infrastructure as well as for providing police fire and social services the bill sponsored by rep mike sylvester d portland would require 60 percent of voters to support a local option sales tax during a referendum before city or municipal officials could impose it the measure would have allowed municipalities to keep 90 percent of the resulting revenues but would direct 10 percent to the maine state housing authority for rental assistance and property tax abatement if you are a town that doesn t want it you don t have to do it said rep benjamin collings d portland it s not going to cost you a penny and it s not going to hurt you but opponents called the tax regressive because it also would have to be paid by lower income individuals who buy prepared food they also warned that it could crack open the gate to future tax increases and could impact decisions tourists make about where to stay or dine advertisement in other state house action tuesday the house passed a measure that would require the state to meet a voter approved law that state government fund public education in maine at 55 percent the 133 9 house vote for the bill follows a 33 0 vote for the bill in the senate on monday the bill will face additional votes but essentially affirms the position of democratic gov janet mills who has included the funding in a proposed budget change package that is currently before the legislature the proposal would cost state government an additional 107 million a year starting in 2022 the senate passed a bill that would allow the secretary of state to reject vulgar and profane vanity license plates the bill passed the senate on a unanimous voice vote and now will move to the house for consideration several gun control measures were voted down in the house on tuesday including a measure that would require federal background checks for private gun sales that are advertised or for guns sold in private sales at gun shows another bill that would ban bump stocks in maine also was voted down in the house with opponents of the measure arguing the devices already are banned under federal law the senate voted 19 13 to give preliminary approval to a bill that would require the state to divest from all investment in fossil fuel companies the house had approved the bill l d 99 on a 80 57 vote last week additional votes are expected the house also overwhelmingly approved a bill sponsored by rep rachel talbot ross d portland that would incorporate african american studies into maine s statewide learning standards know as the maine learning results the bill also requires holocaust and genocide education be added to the learning standards for maine s public school students in grades k 12 maine children can go through their entire educational experience kindergarten through college in our public schools today with little exposure to this history talbot ross said in prepared statement following the vote its absence is not only detrimental to african american students but to all of us this measure brings forth efforts made by generations of maine s african american community to have their experiences taught as part of our state s history correction this story was updated at 8 19 a m on june 9 2021 to correct that a semi open primaries bill failed to pass the maine house in 2019 related headlines bill to open primaries in maine gains support from olympia snowe send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under
i recently published a story about propublica as part of a series about putting gold standard outlets under the microscope i had no intention of writing about them again for a while if ever i d said what i meant to say which was a roughly even mix of complimentary and critical i liked that they at least aimed high but then i came across this tweet on my feed this morning richard is the first employee and now outgoing president of propublica so his rather extreme framing here piqued my interest but it took about a minute of reading to realize that not only was his claim ah overstated but that this was the worst thing i ve ever read by propublica and a real contender for the worst thing i ve read so far in 2021 from a credible outlet and reading the rest along with its supplements did not disabuse me of those feelings my concerns i don t think anyone involved at propublica knows what tax avoidance means i don t think anyone involved at propublica grasps why virtually all developed countries don t tax unrealized capital gains i don t think anyone involved at propublica tried very hard at all to learn about what they didn t know before publishing this piece i don t think anyone involved at propublica gave nearly enough thought to the implications of violating privacy laws or at least norms to publish a non story as ever though to show is better than to tell so what follows will dive in we reward corrections see something wrong misleading or unfair say something it helps new readers can also learn more about our mission here also to make my biases clear i m fine with criticizing the rich i think we should do more of it but we have to make those criticisms count when journalism overstates an accusation it sacrifices trust in proportion we ought to appreciate the consequences of that by now deconstructing the main concern let s start with propublica s central thesis found in paragraphs 3 and 4 of their main article the first of a series of which it looks like four parts are out as of today propublica has obtained a vast trove of internal revenue service data on the tax returns of thousands of the nation s wealthiest people covering more than 15 years the data provides an unprecedented look inside the financial lives of america s titans including warren buffett bill gates rupert murdoch and mark zuckerberg it shows not just their income and taxes but also their investments stock trades gambling winnings and even the results of audits taken together it demolishes the cornerstone myth of the american tax system that everyone pays their fair share and the richest americans pay the most the irs records show that the wealthiest can perfectly legally pay income taxes that are only a tiny fraction of the hundreds of millions if not billions their fortunes grow each year their concern then gets more granular in paragraph 7 america s billionaires avail themselves of tax avoidance strategies beyond the reach of ordinary people their wealth derives from the skyrocketing value of their assets like stock and property those gains are not defined by u s laws as taxable income unless and until the billionaires sell so two things here delaying a tax is not avoiding a tax tax avoidance is a term of art distinct from tax evasion that speaks to maximizing deductions credits and optimizing income categorization not paying taxes on an asset you haven t sold and aren t planning to sell isn t tax avoidance it s just not selling a thing propublica made this mistake all throughout i have no idea how it got through editing they re right about the laws but incurious about why the laws are that way not just in the us but across the developed world instead of stepping back to wonder what the positive motivations might be for not taxing capital gains until they re realized i e until the underlying asset is sold propublica charged on bravely to immediately add to capture the financial reality of the richest americans propublica undertook an analysis that has never been done before we compared how much in taxes the 25 richest americans paid each year to how much forbes estimated their wealth grew in that same time period we re going to call this their true tax rate setting aside the reliability of forbes s estimates lmao i don t know how to explain how batshit this is without sounding hyperbolic but it borders on propaganda instead of asking why the tax code treats unrealized gains on things you haven t sold differently from realized gains on things you have sold they just invented a new measure to make it seem like folks with lots of unrealized gains are avoiding taxation there s a segment deep into the piece that raises the fair ish point that there are some trust schemes where inherited shares can avoid estate taxation but even there either the heirs are withdrawing money to spend or they aren t if they are it gets taxed if they aren t but are instead say borrowing against the value of the trust that s fine too for reasons we re about to get into but either way it s an aside to the basic miscomprehension here that delaying taxation is akin to avoiding it as the estate is already being taxed at 40 on assets above the baseline why we don t tax unrealized gains when you have to pay taxes on an asset you own where do you get the money to pay those taxes in many cases you ll have to at least partially liquidate the asset e g sell some stock and if you force lots of shareholders to do this especially at roughly the same time you cause the value of that stock to fall perhaps by a lot one thing about the modern world is that developed governments can borrow money very cheaply and in more complicated ways can even borrow it for free so when it comes to taxation their natural interest is in maximizing total inflows over time not in any immediate tax year if letting a pool of money grow would mean far more to tax later letting it grow is good the government can effectively borrow the money it would have taken from the pool then collect a larger sum later that repays said loan along with additional profit it wouldn t have otherwise had opportunity to collect another thing about the modern world is that stock markets are de facto savings pools which many of us have an interest in via pension and investment accounts so when this pool is bigger we all gain in paper wealth which is good but imagine that we forced lots of people to sell shares every april to pay for their gains there d be more sellers than buyers as everyone raced to raise cash and prices would go down and our collective wealth with it no one really wants this to the degree that anyone wants it it would be the rich as they have the collective borrowing power to buy back shares on the cheap while poorer folks can t so instead of this obviously bad system most countries use the very sane solution of staggering sales by only imposing a tax when an asset is sold while some people still need to liquidate a few stocks at tax time no one is forced to arbitrarily and most are able to defer payment to some future day now this is a very simple version of the story there are other angles though stock markets are mostly global savings accounts loosely tied to the value of the individual companies underneath those companies do things like grant employee stock options and sometimes sell stock to the public when they do this at higher valuations it generates more end taxation even if you only force the wealthy to liquidate they re going to start with their common shares and that will depress prices for all common shareholders i e everyone this is bad while some rich people take loans against the value of their stock that just kicks the can down the road which is fine while also stimulating the economy borrowing money against shares is also not necessarily tax avoidance as the underlying motivation is usually orthogonal to taxation if you think the value of a company you control will rise by more than the interest rate on your loan which lots of successful entrepreneurs believe then it s a good trade forcing serious stock liquidation every year will hurt smaller companies more which is harmful for long term innovation competition sometimes stock prices go down and that s generally not a write off so taxing the upside at an arbitrary point is unfair and kind of just silly successful companies induce enormous tax receipts for governments at all levels corporate taxes income taxes property taxes payroll taxes headcount taxes etc if bezos is paying less percentage wise today because he s holding his amazon stock where said holding makes amazon more valuable that s a good net deal the alternative world where he s routinely trimming his shares and thus reducing his economic stake in amazon s future isn t really ideal for anyone anyway the point here isn t to suggest this is the only way of looking at some folks mostly a few progressives at the far left end have their arguments for taxing unrealized gains while i ve never found any of them to be even a little intellectually compelling they do exist the point here is that propublica didn t even rise to a halfhearted adjudication between the sides of that debate they just assumed that not taxing unrealized gains is grift y and then moralized the shit out of it i have no idea what positive vision of journalism such an approach could possibly be consistent with but it wasn t even the most concerning thing about their take the privacy angle quoting now from one of the supplemental articles about why they published stolen data protected by personal privacy laws many will ask about the ethics of publishing such private data we are doing so quite selectively and carefully because we believe it serves the public interest in fundamental ways allowing readers to see patterns that were until now hidden even if we allowed that there s a public interest here which i very much disagree with given that this story is essentially a bad policy op ed disguised as a bombshell news feature let s be clear about the patterns part virtually everyone that knows anything about finance could have told you that the people in this article pay very little in personal income tax this is not a revelation bezos musk and buffett in particular are notorious for believing deeply in the value of their companies as exceptional holders of value the only part that s new is propublica leaking information from their personal tax returns to qualify exact amounts anyway they continue tax experts have long understood that the wealthiest americans reap outsized benefits from the federal tax code s emphasis on taxing income rather than assets like stock holdings and property yet when the new york times disclosed in 2020 that president donald trump had amassed so many deductions he paid no taxes in 11 of 18 years it was assumed that his case was an anomaly reflecting the unique breaks real estate developers receive under our tax system it is now clear that there isn t just one such taxpayer there are many in multiple industries we believe that disclosing the identities of billionaires who paid little to no taxes in years their fortunes grew by billions of dollars will help readers understand the magnitude of the tax advantages the ultrarich enjoy we also believe that disclosure of specific figures about the tax returns of people like jeff bezos michael bloomberg warren buffett and elon musk will deepen readers interest and understanding of this complex and arcane subject again propublica needs to get out more and talk to someone who knows anything about this subject anyone who assumed that trump was the only rich person to pay little to nothing in personal income taxes is unquotably ignorant here lots and lots of paper wealthy entrepreneurs are in this category this is the opposite of a secret that said i have no doubt that posting personal financial details about the rich and famous will interest propublica s readers that s half the tabloid business model it s just deeply sad to see propublica stoop to it anyway it gets even dumber we understand that nearly everyone who provides material to a reporter is doing so in ways that reflect their worldview agenda or biases we have long held that those motives are irrelevant if the information is reliable this is an insane statement both rationally and morally truth can t ever be a sole criteria for publishing it s necessary but not sufficient to suggest otherwise ought to flunk someone out of first year journalism school and then to bring us all the way to the bottom there is also a legal question here and we want you to know we have taken it seriously a federal law ostensibly makes it a criminal offense to disclose tax return information but we do not believe that law would be constitutional if applied to bar or sanction publication of a story in the public interest when the news organization did not itself remove the information from the control of the irs or solicit anyone else to do so as we did not and this is not our first experience with this law so they think what they ve done is legal and just morally swell because they didn t directly induce the theft of information when as an industry you wave a flag saying hey if any of y all find good dirt that will help us sell newspapers hit us up and we ll probably print it you re collectively inducing just that sort of theft people will leak things to you for all sorts of motivations many of them bad and if your only criteria for publishing are some measure of verification and some measure of newsworthiness that s a moral hazard the public has no right to private info where no crime or serious moral evil has been committed no crime is even being alleged here and holding on to one s shares because one believes in the company they re building is not last i checked either a great personal failing or a source of real public interest so far as precise details i get that it s popular to hate billionaires and perhaps some or even many of them do some shady shit tax wise let s look into it but this kind of reporting just makes the world worse and i find it incredible that an org like propublica mangled it so badly i explained this twice in the main text but still got a million comments emails attempted dunks about it let s imagine there are just two motivations for someone like bezos to hold his shares a because he wants to avoid taxation b because he wants to retain his economic ownership of amazon including his voting rights if his motivation is b that has nothing to do with tax avoidance he s just holding an asset that he thinks will rise in value and or ensuring he retains maximum control now read propublica s article again and determine for yourself how much room they left for b or really for anything except a whether or not one thinks bezos should be allowed to hold indefinitely is distinct from what his motivation is in doing it if no tax law requires you to sell a thing and you don t want to sell it anyway that s not tax avoidance in any meaningful sense if i ask you hey will you sell me your gaining in value house right now and you reply wut me saying aha tax avoider would be very silly as a related note the political winds have clearly been in favor of increased capital gains taxes and to a lesser degree also wealth taxes for a while so it s incredibly unlikely that these people are thinking hmm i could just hold these assets until some more favorable time to sell them arises from a tax perspective it s more arbitrary numbers here why would i sell something i don t have to if it s paying me 8 10 per year vs my 3 cost of borrowing against said shares the government has a similar incentive they can in their own way borrow against their share of those shares at a much lower cost than the increase in value to their share of shares with low risk a half dozen readers pointed out aha four countries in europe and maybe two elsewhere still have some type of wealth taxes that affect stocks while they re right so far as that goes that s a distinct thing from taxing unrealized gains directly in the same way that property taxes a classic wealth tax are not the same as making homeowners realize their gains while they re certainly related in that a wealth tax is a super tax that includes a usually quite small bit of unrealized gains two related things are definitionally two different things i also said virtually all countries and not all for a reason as smaller economies do experiment a bit that said i agree that i should have been clearer it the original text to avoid misleading ambiguity so i m awarding a general 25 bounty to charity so so much confusion around the double taxation thing first it s a general tax principle not a hard law something like we shouldn t tax the same thing twice unless there s a new commercial transaction involved with the exception of taxation happening concurrently at different levels of government as on income you can see one articulation of it here but there s no canonical version and i imagine many tax lawyers have many competing takes on it also some existing taxes e g on property already defy it but my point wasn t whether the principle is good or even fairly or consistently applied here my point was why the step up rule exists which exempts the inheritors from paying capital taxes on gains that the deceased never realized and as it happens it was introduced specifically to avoid double taxation vis a vis the estate tax currently a high end of 40 but don t take my word for it see page 31 from this congressional research service report which says quite unambiguously he purpose of the stepped up basis rule was to avoid double taxation lots of readers argued that many rich though not ultrarich inheritors get exempted from the estate tax and thus pay neither tax this is true but orthogonal maybe we should remove those exemptions or lower the cutoffs but the question of should some people pay neither of two taxes is separate from should other people pay two taxes and even with the latter it s fine to think that the double taxation principle is antiquated or wrong or to think that the estate tax should be higher there are arguments with tradeoffs we can make there but propublica without quoting anyone or linking anything just said flatly he step up in basis is widely recognized by experts across the political spectrum as a flaw in the code it s one thing to explain the positive intent behind a thing and then argue why one believes the decision still came short but their presentation makes it seem like a loophole rather than a deliberate tradeoff decision made within a definite context say amazon decides to sell shares directly to raise capital using arbitrary numbers they can do this at 1 000 or 1 100 if they do it at the higher number there are a few possible to likely advantages to government coffers to cover three 1 if they decided to sell a set amount of shares the extra money they get this way may make them more profitable which may increase the amount of corporate tax they pay 2 even if they don t pay more corporate tax in any immediate sense that extra money is likely to spark something positive that s taxable elsewhere like wages 3 if they decided to raise a specific amount of money their earnings per share because they didn t dilute themselves as much to raise the cash will increase in a relative sense which may make the market happier which could mean a relatively higher share price really large companies e g those in the s p 500 have two advantages over smaller ones when it comes to weathering storms first more of their shares are owned by index funds who can t sell any single specific stock second they generally have more ability to rebuy their own shares to stabilize prices the first is the bigger deal some commenters raised the counter of well we tax income at arbitrary points so why can t we do the same to capital gains three things here i cash income doesn t require market moving liquidation to become cash ii income is largely taxed after you ve earned a definite amount where its value is largely locked setting aside inflation or currency exchange etc iii we already let people opt out of some immediate taxation via 401k allowances etc where the logic rhymes a bit with unrealized gains i e we ll settle accounts later from their winnings as there are upsides to forgoing that cash today in order to let it experience market growth for an example of a let s tax unrealized gains directly plan one mentioned by propublica see senator wyden s the gist see page 9 was marking assets to market on dec 31st and then taxing them as income currently a top federal rate of 37 lots of people on twitter felt propublica s reporting kind of was a revelation in the sense that there s a big swathe of the reading public with no background here as far as the world of unrealized gains while my point was narrow to none of it being a revelation to people who already understood said world i agree that this was probably news to a lot of people i just wish they d had a more intellectually honest intro there s a quote propublica uses from lbj s treasury secretary we face now the possibility of a taxpayer revolt if we do not soon make major reforms in our income taxes i reckon this is true in a way people are getting angrier about wealth inequality and all anger will go somewhere hence why it s important to ensure their anger is well informed but this series won t help with that two readers one here one on hacker news pointed out that i said ruth can t ever be a sole criteria for publishing which as a side point should have been criterion where propublica didn t say it was while i d extended the thought later in the text to if your only criteria for publishing are some measure of verification and some measure of newsworthiness which are the main criteria that propublica posed i agree that there s an obvious tension here and that the first usage was wrong i m giving 15 to each of those who flagged it and donating 25 to propublica as a gesture though it s not a mistake i made in the main text here a journalist pointed out by dm that i d said elsewhere that bezos s long term capital gains rate would be 15 this was wrong is two ways first for people in higher brackets the baseline is 20 second there was a 3 8 surcharge added in the obama era so it s 23 8 as a show of good faith i m making a donation of 25 in his name to givewell

to bring back open outcry trading the affected websites seem to be back up with the problem looking like an issue with web hosting platform fastly inc nyse fsly but the outage seems to vindicate a move by the london metal exchange to return partly at least to open outcry for setting the price of industrial metals such as copper and zinc rather than all electronic trading the move coincidentally announced not long before the internet had a seizure came after some opposition from users to losing the sight of metals traders shouting loudly at each other in the so called ring at the exchange open outcry has of course been suspended during the pandemic but it will now return on 6 september there has been a compromise though to mollify those who wanted to go all digital the physical trading will only set the lunchtime official prices closing prices will be decided electronically the london metal exchange shelves plan to close its open outcry trading floor after a backlash from major users and will reopen the ring in september via markets anne pollak anneapollak june 8 2021 11 37am websites hit by internet outage a number of major websites ranging from amazon to the guardian to

partner christer gardell said aviva has been poorly managed for many years and its high quality core businesses have been held back by high costs and a series of bad strategic decisions russ mould investment director at aj bell said one might initially think this is an odd move given that activists often push for asset disposals and aviva has just finished a big spate of selling international operations however aviva is also sitting on a large amount of cash from these sales and it appears that cevian wants the insurer to be generous with cash returns to investors and to make deeper cost

history is being made today final climate commission report says net zero is doable eds congratulates the climate commission he pou a rangi on the release of its final advice report to government ināia tonu nei a low emissions future for aotearoa under the provisions of the climate change response act 2002 the commission s final report has taken into account more than 15 000 submissions from members of the public and key interest groups including from the environmental defence society eds said eds ceo gary taylor the key changes from the earlier draft version appear to be changes to the level of emission budgets which means a slightly harder job to meet net zero further integration of treaty obligations further explanation of alternative budget pathways for government to consider some recalibration of the pace and nature of changes required including decreased uptake of electric vehicles in the early years further consideration of the issues around the ndc more consideration of the ethical implications of change those changes are mostly welcome but it is disappointing to see continuing light obligations being placed on agriculture we remain skeptical at the ability of the primary sector s alternative emissions pricing mechanism he waka eke noa to deliver as promised and on time overall the big take out is that we now have a clear pathway towards a net zero economy by 2050 with emission reduction budgets every 5 years that will be monitored and reported on advertisement scroll to continue reading once adopted this will affect every aspect of our lives as we progressively reduce dependence on fossil fuels and lower methane emissions to stable and sustainable levels the global context is encouraging with big emitting countries like china japan the uk and now the usa moving aggressively to reduce emissions the paths set out by the commission are affordable and achievable using existing technologies we can do this if business and communities pull together and if government adopts the commission s recommendations and makes the policy shifts required yes there are challenges and the transition to net zero has to be fair to all given that the government has the rest of this year to respond to the commission s report and finalise its emissions reduction plan we d like to see some careful thought given to how climate change policy and biodiversity policy can be more closely aligned what s needed are additional pricing mechanisms to incentivise indigenous forest and wetland restoration that will sequester carbon and improve immediate environmental outcomes there is still an alarming emphasis on sequestration by pines versus natives which is not good from a wider environmental perspective the commission has said further work is needed on the ets to find a better way forward finally we will be working co operatively with business to plan our climate change and business conference 2021 in october which will be an opportunity to take early stock of progress and focus on the role of new zealand business in implementing change consistent with the commission s proposed budgets this journey is about modernizing our economy and making it fit for the future world it s a truly exciting plan 2021 is an historical turning point for aotearoa new zealand and is the point in time where we begin the transition to a new framing for our economy the climate commission has set out its plan and i expect the team of five million will rise to the challenge it has laid down gary taylor concluded scoop media

president joe biden s border chief is inviting more lawfully deported migrants back into the united states so they can reunify with their left behind migrant children that is all good news for mark zuckerberg s fwd us investor group which is quietly funding a huge lobbying campaign for more amnesty and more migration the campaign leaders say the videos of emotional reunifications of the deported migrants are helping them to shift tv coverage away from the alarming inflow of economic migrants encouraged by president joe biden s immigration policies some of the family reunifications that we saw that sort of changed the coverage in may of this year and started humanizing what exactly is happening said xochitl hinojosa a director at fwd us s pr firm bully pulpit interactive she spoke during a may 26 video presentation to zuckerberg tied amnesty campaigners they were able to change national narrative at a time when their issue was under the absolute national spotlight said paulette aniskoff a partner at the pr firm the invited return of the lawfully deported migrants is being portrayed as reunifying families by alejandro mayorkas the secretary of the department of homeland security dhs that portrayal is possible because the deported migrant parents choose to leave their children in the united states to begin their own years long process of asking for asylum for themselves the migrant parents were sent home because they were found to be economic migrants who had no right to take jobs in the united states and no justification for legal asylum the department of homeland security is committed to the relentless pursuit of reunifying families who were cruelly separated by the previous administration mayorkas said in a dhs statement he continued when we reunified the first seven families last month i said that this was just the beginning in the coming weeks we will reunify 29 more families in close coordination with non governmental organizations legal and interagency partners the task force will continue this critical work the task force has also announced in its report the anticipated 29 additional families to be reunified in the united states in the coming weeks more reunifications are to follow as nearly 50 requests have been filed with u s citizenship and immigration services uscis thirty seven of these requests have already been reviewed and granted humanitarian parole once they enter the united states these individuals will be allowed to remain for an initial 36 month period with the opportunity to apply for work authorization this includes individuals from the families who were reunited in may as well as the 29 families that will reunite in the weeks ahead the big thing that i and others have taken away from this is defining the frame of what means most political important thing you can do said todd schulte who acts as the stage manager for fwd us s concealed orchestra of subsidized allies and front groups he spoke on may 26 with the pr executives schulte and his deputies said they try to reframe the national debate about migration around the tv magnified personal emotions of individual migrants the reframing is intended to exclude any media recognition of americans economic and ideological concerns about society law crime border violations and the huge impact of migration on wages and housing prices for example a march 9 fwd us funded polling memo advised pro amnesty legislators to avoid talking about the economics of migration it is better to focus on all of the aforementioned sympathetic details of those affected than to make economic arguments including arguments about wages or demand for labor as we have seen in the past talking about immigrants doing jobs americans won t do is not a helpful frame and other economic arguments are less effective than what is recommended above the group s reframing task is eased by the donor funded gop establishment gop leaders prefer that the media frame migration issue as all about chaos crime and border violations not americans wages jobs housing and opportunities however gop rep jim banks r in and his republican study committee are working hard to spotlight the public s worries about the economics of migration fwd us s reframing is deeply discordant with journalism s need to focus on the concerns of their readers and viewers in effect fwd us is prodding the news media to prioritize the concerns of foreign law breaking economic migrants above the economic and family concerns of roughly 30 million nightly viewers schulte declined to answer questions from breitbart news but the evidence indicates that he works under the guidance of david plouffe plouffe is the democratic strategist who was hired by zuckerberg in 2017 to block president donald trump s lower migration campaign promises above plouffe and schulte zuckerberg has spent tens of millions of dollars to build the orchestra of advocacy groups to argue for immigration increases the demand for more people makes sense for zuckerberg and his investor allies because every migrant young or old healthy or ill helps to spike consumer demand for the investors companies which include walmart uber grubhub and many more each additional migrant also spur demands for real estate and fwd us co founder bill gates is reportedly now the nation s largest landowner every additional legal or illegal migrant of working age adds to the pool of labor so nudging down wages and helping the investors boost profits and every extra dollar in profits creates roughly 20 in extra stock value on wall street dhs majorkas is staging open borders theater to please progressives sway women and push a narrative that enforcement is cruelty all to justify even more elite pushed migration into americans jobs neighborhoods neil munro neilmunrodc may 7 2021 for schulte plouffe and zuckerberg the pr problem began in march when the tv networks began broadcasting images of many migrants especially children crossing biden s border schulte said he continued to be pretty clear about it conditions on the ground with an increase in the number of children combined with what the media want to dub a crisis combined with the entire republican party deciding to go all in really created this huge spike and i want to be totally clear really bad media coverage for like two three weeks like super duper bad so you know we all looked around and decided whatever we were doing now wasn t working we decided to like dig in and see how could we like put a different situation to place hinojosa jumped in saying we had wall to wall coverage of especially on fox news pretty much all the networks not only of the border but we weren t telling the story about what the actual issue is which is asylum and a lot of people fleeing terrible conditions to seek asylum and part of that narrative is the trump administration he obviously made things worse and the biden administration has been working day and night to ensure that they are turning things around so what we quickly did is we changed the narrative and talked about and humanized the stories of people who are now reunified with their families we want to go ahead and show you this one clip that we were able to work with abc on it is a family who had been separated a mother who had been separated from her children in 2017 and hadn t seen her children since 2017 so this ended up getting covered on world news tonight good morning america and ended up on a number of networks this will just humanize what is actually happening as you can see this is a very moving story of a mother who is actually surprising her son she is from honduras and she was one of the first families who was reunified with her children this was because of the hard work of the administration we wanted to give you a sense of some of the family reunifications that we saw that sort of changed the coverage in may of this year and started humanizing what exactly is happening fwd us and its allies tweeted the videos 3 years 7 month 13 days watch the moment when mabel and her sons reunite mabel will be able to hold their kids in their arms again after years of agonizing separation this is why we do the work that we do this video says it all familiesbelongtogether pic twitter com ehwrgwy6x2 las americas immigrant advocacy center lasamericasiac may 5 2021 abc news did not respond to questions from breitbart news their coverage of the videos can be seen here and here mayorkas added his own voice to the campaign our highest priority is to reunite these families it s not about righting the wrong of the past it s about restoring the conscience of our government mayorkas said in a may 4 appearance on msnbc the big lesson over the last decade that is if you can pick the playing field and go on offense this is a huge winning issue said schulte if you sit back it gets really hard schulte continued i think you saw during that big spike was that the administration was allowing the opposition in a very crass and gross way to define the and so we have really seen as a sea change over the last two months as you ve seen the administration go on offense not only have they regained their footing on this police in like a big rebound of the polls on immigration and look from like some be clear like a hard hard hard march and so i think the big thing that jess and i and others have taken away from this is defining the frame of what this means is the single most politically important thing you can do one of the things we learned is your ability to drive conversation matters a lot said jess morales rocketto the president of families belong together her campaign is part of the national domestic workers alliance which gets funding from zuckerberg s fwd us rocketto continued when you re not driving conversation people are filling that with their unique sort of story and when you don t have people who drive conversation individuals organizations whatever it s very very difficult to get in the mix in the day to day on an issue and keep them there one of the things we re most proud of the families belong together is that we ve made it so that family separation is a front page issue whenever it comes up and that is really really important to the success of our efforts we need that media attention to keep driving the story that media narrative in particular social media s ability to turn around conversation is pretty critical it is also completely one sided but it is really critical so much has been put on the hundreds of groups that both todd and i have deep partnerships within our organizations around this work rocketto said adding when we are a chorus of voices talking about our work and really showing the connections that we have i believe that we are able to the sensationalized story is not the one that we will tell and instead will tell something more nuanced and ultimately more helpful to our longer term goals schulte and his networks use the parole videos to keep prodding reporters and activists to accept their reframing of the immigration dispute national tv ad of alejandra a military wife the mother of 2 u s citizen daughters who came home in time for mother s day after fighting for 3 yrs to be reunited with her family congress must pass a path to citizenship to ensure families like alejandra s stay together pic twitter com tanovlmzdr fwd us fwdus may 25 2021 schulte represents investors who are worth more than 300 billion and who also manage many additional billions of dollars for other investors so he made sure to motivate his online allies with a progressive message of a diverse multi cultural society ultimately i think what we were having a big conversation about this country and a fight about is are we going to become a diverse and diversifying democracy or not that s what voting rights restrictions are about that is what january 6 is about it is what conversations around immigration are ultimately about schulte insisted that amnesty is popular but also warned that the public is very sensitive to border chaos so like on the border in particular you know look this stuff gets trickier he said adding the big lessons we have here are people want a secure and orderly border i want to be very clear about that that is important and that is not important to republicans that is important to democrats and independents people want the idea that people will come legally to this country they view people s ability to come and seek asylum which is a legal right and they want a humane process but they don t really know what that has meant the big thing i would like everybody to understand about what s happening is that there are no good short term solutions when it comes to dealing with influxes of people within a fundamentally failed system and if you were advising candidates they should not defend a failed system just because their party may be the party in government right now then he made the investors pitch democrats should be the party who are in favor of a fundamental overhaul we should have a refugee system for the western hemisphere people should be able to work through a work based visa system we should have a family based immigration system schulte was a little coy as he pushed for a work based visa system but biden s january 20 amnesty bill is fwd us wish list and it includes a slightly hidden mechanism that would allow fortune 500 companies and their subcontractors to fill all their white collar jobs with an unlimited number of foreign graduates those foreign graduates would accept low wages and would work without complaint because biden s bill allows their executives to pay them with green cards and citizenship after 1o years of indentured servitude the resulting flood of foreign white collar labor would reduce wages for many american graduates pressure up their rents and force them to live further from work and friends for many years a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep non partisan and broad opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young u s graduates this opposition is multiracial cross sex non racist class based bipartisan rational persistent and recognizes the solidarity americans owe to each other the voter opposition to elite backed economic migration coexists with support for legal immigrants and some sympathy for illegal migrants but only a minority of americans mostly leftists embrace the many skewed polls and articles pushing the 1950 s corporate nation of immigrants claim migration moves money from employees to employers from families to investors from young to old from children to their parents from homebuyers to investors from technology to stoop labor from red states to blue states and from the central states to the coastal states such as new york

frankfurt june 9 xinhua the european union eu announced last week that it would issue around 80 billion euros 97 billion u s dollars in long term bonds this year an important step to finance its landmark recovery plan after the pandemic it is also the first time that the eu is borrowing on such a large scale the european commission the bloc s executive arm said earlier in april that it would borrow a total of 800 billion euros 974 billion dollars from the capital market until 2026 to finance its recovery plan officially known as the nextgenerationeu eu recovery plan the european commission also announced earlier that the issuing of long term bonds to start later in june would be topped up by tens of billions of euros of short term eu bills to cover the remaining financing requirements the scheme would translate into borrowing volumes of roughly 150 billion euros 183 billion dollars per year on average between mid 2021 and 2026 which will make the eu one of the largest issuers in euros the commission said the announcement came one day after the council of the eu said it had received the green light from all 27 member states for eu recovery spending only with national ratification can the commission start raising resources to finance the recovery plan in july 2020 following an intense marathon summit european leaders agreed on the 750 billion euro 914 billion dollar nextgenerationeu package to tackle the economic fallout of the pandemic and achieve a greener and more digital recovery in the coming years the centerpiece of the package called recovery and resilience facility comprises both loans and non repayable grants to be distributed to all member states according to an analysis of the european central bank staff the nextgenerationeu s loans and grants to be earmarked for euro area countries amount to almost five percent of euro area gross domestic product gdp with a higher share of the funds earmarked for vulnerable countries the agreement was hailed as a historic moment for europe and widely deemed a major move forward in terms of european solidarity and integration analysts said reiner hoffmann head of the german trade union confederation told german newspaper the handelsblatt last week that the recovery plan is an important step towards deepening eu fiscal policy highlighting in particular the financing of the fund through the issuance of joint bonds calling for approval the commission had received 23 recovery and resilience plans as of early june and it takes about two months time for the assessment to be completed european commission president ursula von der leyen said in a tweet last week that the national recovery plans should be approved fast so that the nextgenerationeu funds will start as of this summer the time table is generally in line with previous estimates in a report published in april s p global ratings an american credit rating agency analyzed that the nextgenerationeu plan could add 1 5 percent to the eu s gdp under a low impact scenario by 2026 and 4 1 percent under a high impact scenario while assuming the funds will be spent from mid 2021 the novel approach of having the eu issue debt securities to finance the recovery plan could boost the international role of the euro as a green safe asset and help reduce the financial fragmentation of the public sector bond market denominated in euros the agency also pointed out the first funding plan which covers the period between june and december 2021 was outlined last week with the bond estimates however the plan would be subject to an update in september when the commission would have a more precise overview of the funding needs of the member states on the part of the member states a pre financing of 13 percent of the total amount allocated to each member state will not be disbursed until their own recovery and resilience plan gets approved by the commission the rest of the funds will be handed out taking into account the achievements of the milestones and targets set in the plans enditem
