washington d c newsroom nov 26 2022 12 00 pm cna when the u s catholic bishops first launched a nationwide initiative to help pregnant women in need the chair of their pro life committee envisioned every parish becoming a pro life hub our hope was that every parish ought to be a place where any woman can come archbishop joseph f naumann of kansas city told cna and the parish would be really prepared to connect them with the best resources in the area and hopefully we have somebody that would walk with them through that process today the bishops pro life parish based ministry walking with moms in need promises to do just that by encouraging catholics to support and walk in the shoes of local pregnant and parenting women facing difficult situations naumann oversaw its launch in 2020 when he served as chair of the united states conference of catholic bishops committee on pro life activities now two years later the 73 year old archbishop sees the ministry only gaining momentum after the supreme court overturned roe v wade in a ruling that frees states to decide abortion policy the pro life issue is a personal one for naumann his father was tragically murdered he disclosed when he was still in his mother s womb she had a difficult pregnancy with him as she did with his older brother growing up he watched as his mother who never remarried worked as a catholic school teacher and then a principal i could see the struggle that a single mother goes through he remembered at the same time he said those circumstances oddly probably contributed to me becoming a priest he pointed to his parish priest who took an interest in him and his brother because they grew up without a father naumann was ordained a priest in 1975 two years after roe v wade became the law of the land he first took an active role in catholic pro life leadership when in 1984 the archbishop in st louis invited him to lead the pro life apostolate in that archdiocese but he urged it was an issue i always felt strongly about a call to action speaking with cna at the bishops fall assembly in baltimore naumann recognized the overturning of roe as a significant decision and a call to action those states where they do have protective laws for women and children that means they need to even have more support for moms and for their children he said of states that have restricted abortion i think walking with moms is very important in those states naumann also expressed concern about states that remain largely unaffected by the supreme court s decision including his state of kansas where a pro life amendment on the ballot recently failed he also worried about states enacting laws maybe even more horrendous than roe v wade in those states it becomes very important too because the children we can t protect with the law we can with love and surrounding the mother and the child with the support system he said walking with moms in need in part began in anticipation of roe s reversal naumann revealed we saw that that was a possibility he said before adding but you know frankly i didn t think i would see it in my lifetime there was in my mind why if that happened are we really prepared to support women even more women and children he said and so i m really glad we took that initiative and the holy spirit kind of guided us he described how his own diocese is participating in walking with moms in need by making parishes aware of the resources available in addition to identifying the gaps where help is needed i ve told our pastors there s no excuse for any of our parishes not being able to connect women with the help they need and to be prepared to accompany them naumann stressed he called the bishops pro life pastoral plan multifaceted with a focus on four areas prayer education within and outside the church pastoral care and advocacy while much of the focus on abortion has been on the courts and legislation naumann emphasized the importance of building a pro life culture in the long run we have to build a consensus within the culture that killing our own children is not the way we want to address difficult pregnancies he said

flooding still counting the cost for many nigerians displaced by the recent floods which ravaged different parts of the country this development not only cost their lives and property but has further impoverished them considering the humongous losses they incurred vis à vis the cost of restoring and getting their lives back on an even keel ibrahim apekhade yusuf in this report examines the issues apparently smarting from the ugly episodes of the flooding crisis that is still ravaging his homeland the chief of staff to governor yahaya bello abdulkarim jamiu asuku told a packed audience in lagos that the enormity of the situation is indeed worrisome to say the least asuku s lamentation speaks at a time the country s economy is in doldrums as the recent flooding across the country has further rendered the economy in comatose literally in his observation obinna nweze a financial analyst has said things are pretty scary and for a time like this the government at all tiers just have to do something echoing similar sentiments the chief executive officer of cowry asset management limited johnson chukwu said the recent floods have huge negative economic impact on nigerians according to him loss of life has a more excruciating impact because the loss of a single life is highly regrettable just as emotional traumas from victims families as a result of losing their households or loved ones however the most tangible impact would be on the loss of farmlands reduction in the volume of food produced in the economy food inflation as well as the well being of households he stressed pressed further he said the impact on agricultural production can already be felt this is the time when you would see a material decline in the production of rice in nigeria of which we were not producing enough rice before not to talk of this flooding occurrence that made the situation deteriorate increasing the demand in the country the rippled consequence is inflation in food prices in the coming months loss of farm produce and livestock in large quantities would definitely have a huge negative impact on the economy so these losses matter particularly with the inflation level if food prices surge the standard of living would decline if there is no commensurate rise in income overall everyone would have a feel of the flooding even if it did not directly affect your locality because ultimately you would see that impact in the price of the food you eat the price of goods and services you buy and so on the recent flooding across 31 states of the federation has had devastating impact on the fragile food security situation of the country while the country is still grappling with the ripple effects of covid 19 insecurity banditry the russia ukraine war the flooding incidents unfortunately came at the peak of the harvest period and have further heightened the fears of food shortage in the country in the months ahead according to the ministry of humanitarian affairs and social development over 70 556 hectares of farmland were washed off by the flood though the federal ministry of agriculture the overseeing ministry for farmers is yet to come up with the exact number of farmlands affected by the flood farmers have continued to cry out to the federal government to provide them with succour to make up for their losses many of the farmers claim to have lost millions of naira to the flood and may be unable to return to farming aside from financial losses incurred by farmers and agribusiness entrepreneurs the destruction has been estimated to put 25 3million people across 26 states and the federal capital territory fct in acute food crisis between june and august next year this estimation is contained in the cadre hamonise report on the food security situation in the country by the food and agricultural organisation fao the report revealed that though about 17million nigerians including internally displaced persons and returnees are currently in a food crisis situation across the affected states it noted that if nothing was done to salvage the situation the number may increase to 25 3m people other factors are depreciation of naira insurgency in the northeast states of borno yobe and adamawa armed banditry and kidnapping in sokoto kaduna benue and niger states oxfam on its part said that west africa including nigeria is currently facing its worst food crisis in a decade with 27 million people set to go hungry due to a combination of factors including flooding the organisation predicted that the number could rise to 38 million an unprecedented level unless urgent action is taken in its official document made available to oxfam advised the federal government to urgently implement progressive taxation measures and use them to invest in powerful and proven measures that reduce inequality such as universal social protection schemes to tackle the immediate food price inflation the fao report revealed that some local councils in adamawa borno and yobe were currently experiencing crisis in food consumption stating that situation is projected to get worse by june next year due to market shocks and the attendant food prices relief from un in a related development the united nations on friday released a total of us 10 5 million from the nigeria humanitarian fund nhf and the central emergency response fund cerf to provide assistance to people affected and left vulnerable by floods across nigeria including those in north east nigeria who are already ravaged by conflict a 5 million nhf allocation will provide much needed water sanitation health care shelter and non food items support to over 264 000 people in the states of borno adamawa and yobe bay covered by the humanitarian response plan 2022 who are reeling from the combined impact of floods protracted conflict rising hunger and a cholera outbreak the nhf funds will complement a 5 5 million cerf rapid response allocation for the states most affected by flooding in nigeria that will help provide clean water sanitation hygiene emergency shelter and health care assistance for 495 000 people in anambra bayelsa kogi and niger states the funds will also help recovery in these states the allocation will complement ongoing response efforts by the federal government and the nigerian red cross red crescent in my visits to anambra adamawa and bayelsa i met and spoke with people who are struggling to put food on the table and to get clean water to drink many have no shelter and have lost all their possessions and livelihoods said resident and humanitarian coordinator matthias schmale under the leadership of the humanitarian coordinator in nigeria the nhf enables the timely allocation and disbursement of donor resources to address the most critical humanitarian needs defined in the nigeria humanitarian response plan the nhf strategically complements cerf with both intended to have a multiplier effect in terms of drawing in additional funding to respond to humanitarian crises in the aftermath of the flooding president of african development bank afdb dr akinwumi adesina had also stressed the need to act fast to avert food crisis in the country while stressing the need for greater action responsiveness and delivery adesina disclosed that the african emergency food production facility provided 134 million to nigeria in addition to the japanese international development agency s jica support with an additional 110 million making a total of 244 million availed for emergency food production in nigeria the flooding in nasarawa state affected one of the nation s largest rice farms olam rice farms the flood submerged the 4 500 hectares rice farms destroying crops worth over 15m the flood also destroyed infrastructure such as dykes canals and other facilities worth about 8m farmlands running into thousands of hectares in kogi benue taraba jigawa kano benue kebbi among other rice producing states in the north were also been reportedly washed away it was learnt that about 90 percent of farms were destroyed by flood in taraba while others are still counting losses though the minister of agriculture and rural development mohammed abubakar has also debunked fears of a severe food crisis in the country as a result of the flooding farmers and experts have insisted that unless proactive steps were taken by the federal government to mitigate the current situation the minister s statement may not hold weight chairman federation of commodities association of nigeria facan sadiq daware called on president muhammadu buhari to urgently direct the central bank of nigeria cbn governor godwin emefiele to release funds to the farmers to salvage the current situation the association has also demanded to meet with the president so as to tell him the challenges farmers are facing in increasing food production in the country of major concern to the farmers is the stoppage of the anchor borrowers programme by the cbn despite the gains recorded in rice and maize production under the programme president of all farmers association of nigeria afan farouk mudi noted that the impact of flood on nigerian farmers cannot be overemphasised adding a lot of farmers were affected and it will to a large extent reduce the tonnes of crops produced in the country president of the federation of agricultural commodity associations of nigeria facan dr victor iyama said prices of goods are bound to go up considering the magnitude of farms destroyed by the flood noting that the level of devastation is bound to lead to food shortage the national president of the soybeans farmers association of nigeria sofan professor nafiu abdu on his part warned that if care is not taken the current flooding challenge could lead to famine in the country because a lot of farmers lost their harvest the chief executive officer of green sahara farms plateau state suleiman dikwa also submitted that the cost of food commodities would get worse by next year starting from january noting that it may stabilise after the month of march when farmers are expected to release some hoarded produce other interventions include collaboration with the nigerian agricultural insurance cooperation naic to sensitise farmers on the importance of insuring their farms against possible disasters such as floods fire and drought among other interventions speaking on the need for farmers to embrace insurance wholly the head of corporate communications and market development naicom rasaaq salami said flood insurance in the sector is not mandatory to nigerians but by choice responding to enquiries on the extent of damage occasioned by the flood and possible the assistant general manager of corporate services nigerian agricultural insurance corporation naic magdalene omosimua said the flood is ongoing and as a federal government we are waiting for the flood to recede before knowing the extent of the damages the world food programme wfp estimates the total area of flooded cropland could be almost seven times higher more than 600 people have died and 1 3 million others were forced to leave their homes according to the latest figures given by the minister of humanitarian affairs sadiya umar farouq officials and residents blame climate change but also poor planning and the release of excessive water from dams a process that is meant to ease pressure the wfp and the un s food and agriculture organisation fao said last month that nigeria was among six countries facing a high risk of catastrophic levels of hunger even before the floods the fao representative in nigeria fred kafeero said he was deeply concerned as food supplies were expected to be low due to anticipated reduction in household production the aid official said the floods were also affecting livestock and had increased the risk of vector borne disease outbreaks such as cholera the floods have not just destroyed farmlands they have also prevented the transport of trucks and damaged roads and bridges further pressuring the food supply the last massive floods in nigeria in 2012 cost nearly 17 billion according to the world bank while immediate assistance is now needed the imf said it would be less costly to invest in preventive measures and policies but in the meantime the government said it was ramping up support to affected communities president muhammadu buhari approved the release of 12 000 metric tons of assorted grains from a national strategic reserve stock but farmers are not sure it will be enough buhari restricted the import of rice in 2015 to increase local production and self sufficiency weather forecast agencies have warned there could be more floods until the end of november way forward the best the government can do is to react proactively chukwu maintained adding that if we have dams that we can directly control and change the direction of the flood we would be able to moderate things nigeria he stressed is not like any country that suffers flooding you would observe that countries like the united states particularly the state of florida which was flooded by a tsunami indonesia pakistan and so on climate change is a natural phenomenon and there is no colour immune to climate change hence all hands must be on deck to reduce the level of carbon emission in the environment and plant trees to absolve some of these carbon emissions it is very essential to restore global climatic conditions thereby balancing the ozone layer reducing carbon emission with more trees and lazing the burning of fossil fuels to some extent we would need to replenish the ozone layer for businesses counting their losses he said if they took insurance cover to guide against such occurrences or eventualities such would have stood them in good stead they can be indemnified by the insurance company they are registered with however the sad part is that the small scale businesses may not be aware or knowledgeable on how to get their businesses insured this is where the government comes in to restart their lives the government he reiterated should identify those affected and help them to restart their lives the government should advance some level of grants to aid them in picking pieces of their lives back because they might have lost their source of livelihood due to the flood

confusion fear cloud chinas path zerocovid with megacities under lockdown infection numbers climbing and sporadic protests china s covid 19 policy has reached a stalemate as authorities persist with seeking to contain the virus while trying to keep the economy alive china is the only major economy still attempting to stamp out the domestic spread of the virus shutting down entire cities and placing contacts of infected patients into strict quarantine a series of new rules announced by beijing earlier this month appeared to signal a shift away from the strategy easing quarantine requirements for entering the country and simplifying a system for designating high risk areas yet daily cases driven by the evasive omicron variant have neared 30 000 low compared to most other large countries but reaching peaks unseen since the chaotic days of shanghai s harsh lockdown in the spring that has caused whiplash among china s urban residents as officials first eased restrictions before reimposing curbs all the while claiming to be finetuning the zero covid strategy personally championed by president xi jinping and the flip flopping has rattled investors causing global financial markets to wobble yanzhong huang senior fellow for global health at the council on foreign relations told afp it was too early to say if the new rules signal that the central leadership is willing to give up zero covid anytime soon local governments incentive structure has not been fundamentally changed by the new adjustments huang said noting that lower level officials were still being held accountable for outbreaks mixed signals chinese officials have responded to growing infections this month with vague and seemingly contradictory messaging that has sparked public confusion multiple cities cancelled mandatory regular covid tests last week with some backtracking within days one of the capital s largest districts chaoyang abruptly shuttered testing booths in its commercial areas early last week with the faint explanation that it was in line with the central government s new covid rules the closures were reversed the next day after local media reported that office workers had been left trawling residential compounds for hours in search of an open testing booth as public spaces tightened testing requirements over a surge in cases public anger over seemingly arbitrary restrictions and sudden disruptions has erupted in numerous protests in recent months including in southern china s guangzhou this month when hundreds of residents took to the streets most officials in china know that the policy as it is no longer makes sense but no one can fail to implement it as it is xi s policy and must be upheld steve tsang director of the soas china institute in london told afp we are seeing some adjustments being made without sufficient clarity he said alfred wu associate professor at singapore s lee kuan yew school of public policy said there was a growing tension between the goals of the central government and those of local officials the anger actually comes from ordinary people and also local public officials whose resources and time are spent overwhelmingly on zero covid measures wu told afp reopening risks another year of zero covid could mean the chinese economy will be derailed and social tensions may reach a tipping level which threatens regime stability and may even cause a legitimacy crisis huang of the cfr said but opening up too suddenly could also threaten stability as the country may face a viral wave that results in mass die off and quickly overwhelms its fragile healthcare system he told afp china has not yet approved more effective mrna vaccines for public use and only 85 percent of adults over 60 had received two doses of domestic vaccines by mid august according to chinese health authorities nomura analysts said on monday the road to reopening could be slow and bumpy reopening could be back and forth as policymakers may back down after observing rapid increases in cases and social disruptions they said in a report they predicted a negative impact on gdp growth when covid cases surge after the zero covid policy is lifted as a large percentage of the chinese population may still believe omicron has a high mortality rate messaging on the virus will be a major challenge for chinese authorities as they navigate a return to normality the scary propaganda about the virus and how other countries have fared worse than china ironically is coming back to bite ccp leaders who may now indeed be eager to relax the very invasive and costly anti covid measures fei ling wang international affairs professor at georgia tech told afp
karachi former central bank governor syed salim raza has said pakistan should avoid going for a piecemeal restructuring of its dollar denominated debt speaking at a recent seminar on national economic challenges the former chief of the state bank of pakistan sbp said that asking one of the many creditors to restructure the debt was unfair and tantamount to subsidising the other creditors it s reasonable that we think of one substantial restructuring he said his advice follows weeks of reporting by the local press on the rising level of credit default swap cds which is a tool that international bondholders use to protect themselves from a possible default by debt issuing sovereign nations last month finance minister ishaq dar said pakistan would seek the rescheduling of some 27 billion non paris club debt that islamabad owes mainly to china referring to the common framework for debt treatment that the group of twenty g20 recently came up with mr raza said the advanced economies have accepted that there s going to be a measure of strain with respect to loan repayments by developing countries it s better that the debt problem is handled pre emptively rather than waiting for defaults like in the 1980s or in the asian crisis which then feed on themselves and make matters much worse he said the new debt treatment forum is tasked with anticipating the repayment problems that the emerging markets are going to have and seeking debt restructuring on a pre emptive basis countries can apply for such rescheduling and the forum will then set up a creditor committee within six weeks to help the struggling borrowers he said as for the domestic debt he said the government has been crowding out the private sector whose share in the overall credit is less than one fifth we need an empowered centralised debt management office with support from market operators to lower the long term cost of debt he said the former sbp governor urged the government to create a yield curve varying interest rates on bonds having equal credit quality but differing maturity dates a liquid market where retail investors actively participate in government debt trading through an online portal will pave the way for the private sector to float fixed rate bonds that are currently absent he noted our big companies shouldn t be borrowing from banks it s cheaper to borrow from the bond market in america the bond market is about four times the size of corporate debt of banks our bond market is barely developed and one of the biggest reasons for that is the absence of the yield curve he said published in dawn november 27th 2022

exchanging gifts between chiefs kings presidents and premiers has been a custom since time immemorial symbolic offerings have paved the way for peaceful coexistence between people from the ancient civilizations of rome and egypt to the native tribes of north america and have been an important element of diplomatic communication the exchange of gifts is intended to welcome and honour delegates and cultivate beneficial diplomatic relationships advertisement gifts are enduring symbols of international cooperation and friendship as diplomatic tokens the official state visits are led with pomp and elaborate ceremonies which include formal dinners welcome addresses and gift exchanges gift giving between heads of state is now an important part of international relations though gifts from foreign leaders have symbolic value they also reflect the diversity and vibrancy of the world s nations these gifts also highlight the craftsmanship of local artists and the richness of local culture they range from prized pieces of a country s culture and heritage such as native art or antiques to gleaming gold and gemstones other gifts are unexpectedly sentimental representing national or personal friendship all of this strengthens the bonds between two countries and their leaders and often strengthens historical ties when two nations which are often separated by various oceans and beliefs briefly clasped hands history has been replete with examples of heads of state exchanging gifts for instance the pharaohs of ancient egypt presented stone vessels adorned with the royal cartouche which is a kind of monogram to the neighbouring hittites in the 2nd millennium bce the byzantine emperor constantine v gave pepin iii of francia a mechanical organ to indicate the superiority of byzantine technology gift exchange became a ritualised part of diplomatic contact by the middle ages in the 16th century diplomacy used all kinds of gifts including animals plates jewels along with portraits in fact the panda diplomacy practice from 1941 to 1984 was a very well known practice of sending giant pandas from china to other countries as a tool of diplomacy also read pm modi to gift kullu shawl kanal brass set to world leaders at g20 summit in bali one important psychological aspect of buying things or giving gifts is that it is not only a gesture targeted at someone but it is also a way to communicate about oneself we often stock our bookshelves with books we might not even read and gift books to others to depict what we think how we think what we believe in and what personality we want to depict of ourselves to others similarly diplomatic gifts are ways to communicate the strength of our cultures our civilization and the craftsmanship of our communities advertisement india recently in various state visits gifted arts handicrafts sculptures and other artefacts which have brought to the international stage unsung products of craftsmanship of various communities from across the country and empowered these communities while indulging in cultural diplomacy i briefly profiled some of the communities and their products which now find a place of pride in the offices and living rooms of heads of state across the world the mata ni pachedi and the vagharis the vagharis were nomads who lived along the edges of the sabarmati river in gujarat they are cultivators and agricultural workers and sell and exchange old goods around 300 years ago they became artists and creators of mata ni pachedi which is an impressive form of textile art that serves the purpose of a shrine for the marginalised and excluded of whom they were also a part jodhpuri wooden chest and the carpenters community the blue city of india jodhpur is not only known for its marvellous architecture and cultural heritage also has one of the finest wooden artistic furniture and crafts the suthars are the craft carpenters who have shifted to various art clusters within the city their craft making skills are transferred from one generation to another and one can witness their work on the beautiful windows and doors of the forts and palaces in rajasthan advertisement patan patola and the salvi silk weavers centuries ago the salvi silk weavers from maharashtra and karnataka made the state of gujarat the home of their renowned patola fabrics the salvis came to patan from maharashtra and karnataka in ad 1200 they were patronised by solanki rajputs who then ruled all of gujarat and parts of south rajasthan and malva with the capital at anahilwad patan also read uttarakhand tribal community gifts pm modi unique bhoj patra pithora and the rathwa artisans rathwa artisans are popularly known for their most prevalent and characteristic art tradition pithora wall paintings they are found in the regions of chhota udaipur naswadi and jetpur in gujarat and some areas of madhya pradesh also their traditional dance is known as chuum jhum and has a very unique cultural tradition and tattooing they mostly speak the dialect called rathvi which is a combination of bhil tribe a major tribe in gujarat words and gujarati dhokra art and the dhokra damar tribal community advertisement dhokra damar tribes are traditionally metalsmiths found in the eastern part of our country this ancient tribal art traces its history from over 4 000 years ago one of its most famous creations is the tree of life which has been appreciated by art lovers across the world they craft some of the finest metal artwork by using their lost wax technique moonj art and the women of purvanchal the rural women from prayagraj and areas around it weave and compose baskets for domestic use as well as used by mothers during wedding time for their daughters as a gift the free and wild grass moonj is widely available along the banks of rivers and harvested primarily in the months of october and november one can see massive women s involvement in this unique art of weaving kinnauri shawl and the kinnari community the kinnari community has consciously secluded themselves from modern civilization and their weaving is one of the finest and most time consuming weaves they have been weaving shawls for centuries mostly they do not weave for commercial purposes but to suffice the requirements of their family members gamocha and the barama block community the weavers which represent different groups also known as barama block weavers make the beautiful gamocha mekhla chadors dokhnas and lehengas they have a multicultural identity with great diversity in their local cultural practices clothing patterns and weaving style they have passed on this art and craft from one generation to another these communities even today take pride in their art and crafts culture and art have the ability to enhance the quality of life and promote economic growth there is an urgent need to connect these communities to modern marketing branding and selling practices and technology to make their products mainstream and reach new markets the inclusion of their products in gift giving by leaders as part of cultural diplomacy can be an effective instrument to bring these products to light we need more leaders who can promote such local communities through their unique art at a global level because when they support local art they are supporting today s new economy whose vital part is having well defined arts and culture pablo picasso once said the purpose of art is to wash the dust of daily life off our souls the combination of art and diplomacy can be an effective brand ambassador of indigenous arts and can empower communities both economically and socially
santa cruz calif ap netflix s trailblazing dvd by mail rental service has been relegated as a relic in the age of video streaming but there is still a steady albeit shrinking audience of diehards like amanda konkle who are happily paying to receive those discs in the iconic red and white envelopes when you open your mailbox it s still something you actually want instead of just bills said konkle a resident of savannah georgia who has been subscribing to netflix s dvd by mail service since 2005 it s a small pleasure that konkle and other still dedicated dvd subscribers enjoy but it s not clear for how much longer netflix declined to comment for this story but during a 2018 media event co founder and co ceo of netflix reed hastings suggested the dvd by mail service might close around 2023 when not if it happens netflix will shut down a service that has shipped more than 5 billion discs across the u s since its inception nearly a quarter century ago and it will echo the downfall of the thousands of blockbuster video rental stores that closed because they couldn t counter the threat posed by netflix s dvd by mail alternative the eventual demise of its dvd by mail service has been inevitable since hastings decided to spin it off from a then nascent video streaming service in 2011 back then hastings floated the idea of renaming the service as qwikster a bungled idea that was so widely ridiculed that it was satirized on saturday night live it finally settled on its current more prosaic handle dvd com the operation is now based in non descript office in fremont california located about 20 miles from netflix s sleek campus in los gatos california shortly before breakup from video streaming the dvd by mail service boasted more than 16 million subscribers a number that has now dwindled to an estimated 1 5 million subscribers all in the u s based on calculations drawn from netflix s limited disclosures of the service in its quarterly reports netflix s video streaming service now boasts 223 million worldwide subscribers including 74 million in the u s and canada the dvd by mail business has bequeathed the netflix that everyone now knows and watches today marc randolph netflix s original ceo said during an interview at a coffee shop located across the street from the post office in santa cruz california the 110 year old post office has become a landmark in silicon valley history because it s where randolph mailed a patsy cline cd to hastings in 1997 to test whether a disc could be delivered through the u s postal service without being damaged the disc arrived at hastings home unblemished prompting the duo in 1998 to launch a dvd by mail rental website that they always knew would be supplanted by even more convenient technology it was planned obsolescence but our bet was that it would take longer for it to happen than most people thought at the time randolph said with netflix s successful streaming service it might be easy to assume that anyone still paying to receive dvds through the mail is a technophobe or someone living in a remote part of the u s without reliable internet access but subscribers say they stick with the service so they can rent movies that are otherwise difficult to find on streaming services for michael fusco 35 that includes the 1986 film power starring a then youthful richard gere and denzel washington and

getting movies and having them blow my mind tabetha neumann is among the subscribers who rediscovered the dvd service during the throes of the pandemic lockdowns in 2020 after running out of things to

three discs at a time an option that currently costs 20 per month compared to 10 per month for the one disc plan when we started going through all the movies we wanted to see we realized it was cheaper than paying 5 per movie on some streaming services neumann said plus we have found a lot of old horror movies and that genre is not really big on streaming konkle who has written a book about

shrunk from producing more than 1 billion in annual revenue a year ago to an amount likely to fall below 200 in revenue this year katie cardinale a subscriber who lives in hopedale massachusetts says she now has to wait an additional two to four days for discs to arrive in the mail than she used to because they are shipped from a distribution center in new jersey instead of boston netflix doesn t

famous films and popular tv series that once were routinely available on the service instead netflix now sorts requests for titles such as the first season of the award winning ted lasso series a

santa cruz calif ap netflix s trailblazing dvd by mail rental service has been relegated as a relic in the age of video streaming but there is still a steady albeit shrinking audience of diehards like amanda konkle who are happily paying to receive those discs in the iconic red and white envelopes when you open your mailbox it s still something you actually want instead of just bills said konkle a resident of savannah georgia who has been subscribing to netflix s dvd by mail service since 2005 it s a small pleasure that konkle and other still dedicated dvd subscribers enjoy but it s not clear for how much longer netflix declined to comment for this story but during a 2018 media event co founder and co ceo of netflix reed hastings suggested the dvd by mail service might close around 2023 when not if it happens netflix will shut down a service that has shipped more than 5 billion discs across the u s since its inception nearly a quarter century ago and it will echo the downfall of the thousands of blockbuster video rental stores that closed because they couldn t counter the threat posed by netflix s dvd by mail alternative the eventual demise of its dvd by mail service has been inevitable since hastings decided to spin it off from a then nascent video streaming service in 2011 back then hastings floated the idea of renaming the service as qwikster a bungled idea that was so widely ridiculed that it was satirized on saturday night live it finally settled on its current more prosaic handle dvd com the operation is now based in non descript office in fremont california located about 20 miles from netflix s sleek campus in los gatos california shortly before breakup from video streaming the dvd by mail service boasted more than 16 million subscribers a number that has now dwindled to an estimated 1 5 million subscribers all in the u s based on calculations drawn from netflix s limited disclosures of the service in its quarterly reports netflix s video streaming service now boasts 223 million worldwide subscribers including 74 million in the u s and canada the dvd by mail business has bequeathed the netflix that everyone now knows and watches today marc randolph netflix s original ceo said during an interview at a coffee shop located across the street from the post office in santa cruz california the 110 year old post office has become a landmark in silicon valley history because it s where randolph mailed a patsy cline cd to hastings in 1997 to test whether a disc could be delivered through the u s postal service without being damaged the disc arrived at hastings home unblemished prompting the duo in 1998 to launch a dvd by mail rental website that they always knew would be supplanted by even more convenient technology it was planned obsolescence but our bet was that it would take longer for it to happen than most people thought at the time randolph said with netflix s successful streaming service it might be easy to assume that anyone still paying to receive dvds through the mail is a technophobe or someone living in a remote part of the u s without reliable internet access but subscribers say they stick with the service so they can rent movies that are otherwise difficult to find on streaming services for michael fusco 35 that includes the 1986 film power starring a then youthful richard gere and denzel washington and 1980 s the big red one starring lee marvin that s among the main reasons he has been subscribing to the dvd by service since 2006 when he was just a freshman in college and he has no plans to cancel it now i have been getting it for almost half my life and it has been a big part fusco said when i was young it helped me discover voices i probably wouldn t have heard i still have memories of

the most uplifting aspect of the sam bankman fried story was always that he guided his way to a putative cryptocurrency fortune of more than us 16bil rm71 64bil by following a philosophy of charitable giving known as effective altruism interviewers were dazzled by bankman fried s account of the epiphany he experienced over a lunch with will macaskill around the time he was graduating from the massachusetts institute of technology a british philosopher macaskill advocated a version of effective altruism asserting that if life s purpose was to do good then the moral imperative is to make as much money as one can and then give it away macaskill compressed this viewpoint into the edict earn to give according to bankman fried the encounter inspired him to alter his post graduation goal away from joining a nonprofit and toward going into finance eventually founding what was one of the world s leading cryptocurrency firms ftx adam fisher the author of a credulous profile of bankman fried published in september by the venture firm sequoia capital which invested in ftx asked his subject how much money would be too much so is five trillion all you could ever use to help the world the denouement of this story is now well known bankman fried s crypto firm has collapsed in a whirlwind amid indications that it may have defrauded customers who deposited their funds with ftx to buy cryptocurrencies billions of dollars are missing the corporate repairman hired to untangle the disaster john j ray iii says that from an operational standpoint ftx was a mess from top to bottom that points to the question of what the debacle says about effective altruism in principle and practice the short answer is nothing good ftx and effective altruism existed in a sort of symbiotic relationship bankman fried posed as a world beating philanthropist during an appearance in may before a house committee he boasted about personally committing to donating 99 of his wealth among other philanthropic initiatives he testified his firm had launched the ftx future fund to invest in ambitious projects aiming to improve humanity s long term prospects effective altruism institutions that had depicted bankman fried as a star donor including the future fund are now acknowledging that they may not have the money to honour grants they had promised recipients some that had lionised bankman fried have scrubbed their encomiums from their websites sequoia similarly removed fisher s lengthy piece from its website yet the siren call of bankman fried s wealth blinded macaskill and his colleagues to the void at the centre of the cryptocurrency concept itself it s a field rife with fraud and chicanery and lacking any cogent case for its usefulness that bankman fried would exploit his image as a philanthropist to obscure the flaws in his enterprise seems almost predetermined the entire future fund team resigned on nov 10 around the same time leaders of the movement have felt obligated to state outright that the precept of earning to give in no way justifies fraud as macaskill tweeted the impulse to specify this obvious precept suggests the vacuousness at the heart of effective altruism let s take a look at what it s all about to begin with there s nothing new under the sun when it comes to laundering wrongdoing through conspicuous displays of spiritual piety or good works consider the gilded age robber baron daniel drew one of that era s outstanding stock manipulators and con men who rarely missed a sunday in church or was seen in public without a well thumbed prayer book in hand to outsiders reported a biographer drew appeared modest and unassuming a kindly pious gentleman reticent and humble to a fault he founded drew theological seminary in madison n j with an ostentatious pledge of us 500 000 its formal opening in 1867 was attended by the largest group of methodist intellectuals and theologians ever assembled including nine bishops and four sectarian university presidents but when the time came for drew to make good on the gift nine years later he was bankrupt he died in 1879 still owing us 250 000 on his pledge forcing the seminary into a panicky round of fundraising to avoid extinction the institution he founded lives on today as drew university with an associated theological school but it rather downplays how its namesake and original benefactor made his money other eminent philanthropic works and institutions the ford and rockefeller foundations the 1 800 carnegie libraries across the us are also products of their creators desire to wipe their slates clean for posterity the 236 millionaires and billionaires who have signed the giving pledge a commitment to contribute most of their wealth to address some of society s most pressing problems are essentially signalling their intentions in advance without waiting for the reading of their wills among the signatories sam bankman fried effective altruism in its modern guise originated in the work of philosopher peter singer whose initial influence stemmed from his advocacy of animal rights and expanded into the view that we all have a moral imperative to prevent bad things from happening if we can do so without sacrificing anything nearly as important singer s most famous thought experiment involved the imperative to save a drowning child even if that meant muddying your clothes or even missing a crucial appointment his argument was that there was nothing fundamentally different from saving that child and alleviating the suffering of children in far off lands say by donating any funds you have beyond what s needed for the sustenance of yourself and those depending on you life is more complicated than that simple formulation suggests however it begs infinite questions about how to prioritise problems to be solved who we owe responsibilities to and how we factor in the source of our donations singer himself acknowledged some of this complexity by participating in exchanges with his critics that yielded a 640 page book peter singer under fire in 2009 macaskill has expanded on the bug he put in bankman fried s bonnet during that lunch by embracing what he calls longtermism as he put it in a recent book what we owe the future the idea is that positively influencing the future is a key moral imperative of our time he concedes that the future whether a generation ahead or thousands or even a million years ahead is uncharted terrain in which we don t know exactly what threats we will face or even exactly where we are trying to go exactly carries a lot of weight in that line the truth is we don t know anything about what threats we will face or where we re going there s a large component of hand waving underlying the purported principles of effective altruism the centre for effective altruism of which macaskill is the chair says it s devoted to using evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible are there philanthropists anywhere on earth who would cop to ignoring evidence and reason before deciding where to spend their money turning to the movement s defence that it never aimed to inspire bankman fried or anyone else to commit fraud to assemble fortunes to give away it only wants clean money the earning to give camp overlooks that the accumulation of great wealth is seldom morally neutral the concentration of enormous wealth in ever fewer hands increases inequality because so much of millionaires and billionaires wealth has come at the expense of workers customers suppliers and communities timothy noah of the new republic incisively identifies the most distinctive feature of effective altruism as the balletic deftness with which it tiptoes past targets likely to offend billionaires such as inequality jeff bezos pledge to give away most of his us 121bil rm542 08bil fortune during his lifetime for example obscures salient facts about how he acquired that fortune in part by underpaying the employees of amazon com and as has been widely reported subjecting them to inhuman and abusive working conditions balzac s line often paraphrased as behind every great fortune lies a great crime is relevant here then there s the related question of whether we want a small cadre of rich people the 1 of global population that controls nearly half the world s wealth to distribute their wealth according to their own personal preferences as opposed to subjecting it to public transparent judgments through government actions among other issues the rich tend to engage in charitable tax advantaged giving that reflects their own ideological preferences and personal interest which may not reflect the public interest that s why effective altruism as a movement tends to look like just another rationalisation for the accumulation of wealth in this case as the font of philanthropic efforts to benefit humanity into the limitless future there s no reason to suppose that the promoters of effective altruism are anything but sincere in their convictions as for the monied class that claims to believe in the movement the jury is out interviewed via text messages by kelsey piper of vox com bankman fried seemed to acknowledge as piper put it that the ethics stuff was mostly a front yeah he replied i mean that s not all of it but it s a lot it s what reputations are made of to some extent bankman fried rode that horse about as far as it could go before breaking down and his trusting admirers saluted as he galloped past macaskill for one admits to being humiliated by the experience sam and ftx had a lot of goodwill and some of that goodwill was the result of association with ideas i have spent my career promoting he tweeted in the aftermath if that goodwill laundered fraud i am ashamed but will he absorb the lesson that was already taught by daniel drew henry ford john d rockefeller and andrew carnegie among countless other financial barons that the getting of money comes first and the giving it away an afterthought the lesson was there to be learned long before sam bankman fried came on the scene and he ignored it at his own peril los

santa cruz calif ap netflix s trailblazing dvd by mail rental service has been relegated as a relic in the age of video streaming but there is still a steady albeit shrinking audience of diehards like amanda konkle who are happily paying to receive those discs in the iconic red and white envelopes when you open your mailbox it s still something you actually want instead of just bills said konkle a resident of savannah georgia who has been subscribing to netflix s dvd by mail service since 2005 it s a small pleasure that konkle and other still dedicated dvd subscribers enjoy but it s not clear for how much longer netflix declined to comment for this story but during a 2018 media event co founder and co ceo of netflix reed hastings suggested the dvd by mail service might close around 2023 when not if it happens netflix will shut down a service that has shipped more than 5 billion discs across the u s since its inception nearly a quarter century ago and it will echo the downfall of the thousands of blockbuster video rental stores that closed because they couldn t counter the threat posed by netflix s dvd by mail alternative the eventual demise of its dvd by mail service has been inevitable since hastings decided to spin it off from a then nascent video streaming service in 2011 back then hastings floated the idea of renaming the service as qwikster a bungled idea that was so widely ridiculed that it was satirized on saturday night live it finally settled on its current more prosaic handle dvd com the operation is now based in non descript office in fremont california located about 20 miles from netflix s sleek campus in los gatos california shortly before breakup from video streaming the dvd by mail service boasted more than 16 million subscribers a number that has now dwindled to an estimated 1 5 million subscribers all in the u s based on calculations drawn from netflix s limited disclosures of the service in its quarterly reports netflix s video streaming service now boasts 223 million worldwide subscribers including 74 million in the u s and canada the dvd by mail business has bequeathed the netflix that everyone now knows and watches today marc randolph netflix s original ceo said during an interview at a coffee shop located across the street from the post office in santa cruz california the 110 year old post office has become a landmark in silicon valley history because it s where randolph mailed a patsy cline cd to hastings in 1997 to test whether a disc could be delivered through the u s postal service without being damaged the disc arrived at hastings home unblemished prompting the duo in 1998 to launch a dvd by mail rental website that they always knew would be supplanted by even more convenient technology it was planned obsolescence but our bet was that it would take longer for it to happen than most people thought at the time randolph said with netflix s successful streaming service it might be easy to assume that anyone still paying to receive dvds through the mail is a technophobe or someone living in a remote part of the u s without reliable internet access but subscribers say they stick with the service so they can rent movies that are otherwise difficult to find on streaming services for michael fusco 35 that includes the 1986 film power starring a then youthful richard gere and denzel washington and 1980 s the big red one starring lee marvin that s among the main reasons he has been subscribing to the dvd by service since 2006 when he was just a freshman in college and he has no plans to cancel

tofarati ige writes about mothers who had trouble feeding their choosy babies and inadvertently turned to manufacturers of indigenous baby foods which they now sell to others making good money for 35 year old shalewa getting to feed her daughter could best be described as a herculean task the scene whenever she had to feed the eight month old omolewa could be likened to a royal rumble or a bout in a boxing ring based on the advice of several people ranging from her siblings parents in laws neighbours to church members and other concerned individuals she had tried several feeding options for omolewa but all was to no avail a bank worker juliana enwerem s experience was similar to what shalewa went through she gave her baby boy jerome breast milk exclusively for the first eight months of his life even though doctors generally recommend six month exclusive breastfeeding enwerem decided to go two extra months her belief was that once she was ready to start feeding jerome regular foods he would savour them all but as it happened things didn t turn out as she had expected on weaning jerome enwerem first introduced pap to him but the baby flatly rejected it when the disturbed mother spoke to a neighbour about her predicament she was advised to add soya beans ginger and some other ingredients to ostensibly make the pap more palatable for the baby but still jerome would have none of it if the food managed to enter into his mouth he would sooner vomit it enwerem was already at her wits end when one day while scrolling through instagram she saw a comment by a young mother narrating how she had had trouble feeding her infant until she found a way out of her predicament enwerem quickly sent a message to this person who then connected her to an indigenous baby food manufacturer local food worked like magic enwerem told our correspondent that contacting the local food manufacturer turned out to be the best decision she had taken as regards feeding her child she said shortly after i sent the lady a message on instagram she linked me up with the food manufacturer because of my prior experiences in that regard my hopes were not really high that the food would interest my baby but at that time i was eager to try anything that would make my child eat well incidentally the baby food i bought from the local manufacturer worked for my child who was ordinarily a picky eater enwerem stated that since she started giving her baby the food he had started to glow more and get bigger she added i think it is a wonderful initiative because nigerian infant food makers know the types of things nigerian babies like considering that they live here with us i think that is one reason many nigerian children are fussy about imported foods because the ingredients used in making them may not go well with them experience is the best teacher an indigenous baby food manufacturer adepeju jaiyeoba told our correspondent that her products came out of her experience dealing with her choosy child she said when i had my first son i was feeding him imported baby food because i am particular about nutrients as of then i had worked in the child health sector for more than 10 years whenever i went to the stores to buy baby food i always read the nutrients properly i noticed that most of the baby foods in the country were imported and they were very expensive one would then find oneself buying flavours such as blueberries and raspberries which affect the taste buds of the child in cases like that transitioning to locally made foods would be quite difficult jaiyeoba explained that she began making baby food amid the covid 19 pandemic and the attendant lockdown she said at the height of the covid 19 pandemic when i was sharing maternal health tips with women it became more prominent on my mind most of the palliatives that were distributed by the government did not cater for the need of children under the age of four yet it is at that age that the brain experiences the most development when some children under the age of five are struggling to cope in school people will think that something is wrong with the child not knowing that it is caused by the nutritional intake of the child i saw the pandemic as a period to help mothers by producing quality foods for their babies our first product was made in may 2020 another indigenous infant food manufacturer olufunmilayo idusuyi stated that she was inspired to go into that line of business because of the challenges mothers go through in feeding their babies we are having a generation of mothers who most times do not know how to feed their babies and give them the necessary nutrients they need back in the day we used to have grandmothers who would come around to help new mothers but now we have working class mothers who usually don t have time to prepare food for their babies that was one of the things that inspired me to start making baby food another reason is the fact that some babies have different types of allergies some babies reject foreign or imported foods because they do not appeal to their tastes yet another baby food maker nneka ogboi noted that she was motivated to start making infant food because of the experience she had as a first time mum she said it was based on my experience as a first time mum i realised that most baby foods are imported whenever i went to supermarkets to buy food for my baby i usually found that the products they had were for older children and most of the foods were produced a long time ago i felt very uncomfortable with that because i was looking for something natural and nutritious i had also observed that people who fed their kids with imported foods usually found it difficult getting those children to eat nigerian foods such as swallow later on i did not want to have to start retraining my kids taste buds it was on that basis that i started making food for my child from there colleagues started asking me to make for them as well gradually i started expanding to making for friends and family then i decided to get professional training in child nutrition and cooking to be able to do it better just like ogboi chinaza muoh s baby food manufacturing journey started out of curiosity according to her after she gave birth to her daughter in 2019 she was always wondering and asking for what she could feed her baby with however it wasn t until 2020 when the covid 19 pandemic was wreaking havoc all over the world that she had the impetus to start a business she said shortly after the birth of my daughter the world was in the grips of the covid 19 pandemic there was no income and people were stuck i started thinking of alternatives to feed my baby because the sources of income i had then were not reliable i started carrying out research and i saw that i could feed my baby fruits such as avocados and bananas all i had to do was combine those fruits to become a meal the first fruit i gave her was avocado puree and she finished everything i served her so i started giving her other foods and researching more on other things i could give her in the process i realised that different fruits could be mixed and meat could even be added i also discovered that when i started giving my baby those meals she became more active and i was able to cut down a lot of cost which i would have used to buy cereal as i kept giving her those foods and it was working i thought of sharing the knowledge with other mothers that was when i opened pages on instagram and facebook i then started educating mothers that there was another method of feeding their children aside from just buying cereal the more i was educating mothers the more they were trying it and it worked for them encouraging reception good business like other nursing mothers who inadvertently turned baby food manufacturers after discovering a solution to their babies s choosy tastes seun sangoleye has found gold since she developed a formula for her baby she has long overcome her challenge feeding her baby and now she s found an economic opportunity offering the solution to other mothers narrating her journey to sunday punch sangoleye recalled how she resorted to conducting a research after getting conflicting answers from her mother in law church members and colleagues on how to solve the problem of feeding her choosy baby who she just weaned her research led to some interesting discovery which worked for her baby and has now become a source of revenue for her she said after that i decided that i was going to share my new found knowledge with other mothers and before one could say food i had started amassing a great following on social media after advising mothers on the types of food they should give their babies they started asking for where they could buy them jaiyeoba has also got a good testimony to share in terms of sales she noted that the first set of mothers who discovered her product also facilitated for the products to be made available at stores near their homes for easy access and purchase she said since we started the company one of the things that we have had going for us are the mothers who first had enough interest in us to try out our baby food some of these mothers were tired of going to the factory to pick our products and they approached some stores to stock our products so that they could buy from there that has happened many times there were mothers who bought as many as six cartons from us because they were tired of coming to our location to buy from us all the time on her part idusuyi said since the introduction of her product into the market the reception from nigerian mothers struggling to find suitable foods for their babies has been good and encouraging she said the reception has been good and that is what has kept us in business we have got a lot of referrals from mothers who have tried our products for their babies after using our products and loving them they recommend them to other mothers people who buy our products have moved from being just our customers to being our partners our ultimate goal is to be a pan african business that will cater for african communities and provide them with what they will need to support the healthy growth and all round development of children she said for ogboi the feedback from her customers has also been amazing according to her many parents were relieved that they could get fresh products for their children on my part i also found out that those natural foods had a lot of benefits for example they helped babies with constipation i recall that a mum once told me that she had spent heavily on treating constipation in her daughter yet she was not seeing results when i sought to know what she was feeding the child with i realised it was starchy foods so i told her to give the baby more foods containing fibre and protein i made some changes to the baby s diet and she came back later to say that there was so much improvement and the baby was then able to poop properly fruits and vegetables are healthier than cereals and other processed foods thorough registration process jaiyeoba who is an alumnus of the technology incubation centre in agege lagos told sunday punch that the process of registering her products with the national agency for food and drug administration and control was thorough yet not stressful she said it was the normal process of registering food and drugs i did not go through the incubation centre i went through the normal nafdac route to get the certification the sensitive nature of the business cannot be accommodated under the category for small and medium scale enterprises one needs to go through the full scale industry registration process we had about 11 different specifications from nafdac they were very thorough right till the point when we started producing even then they still carry out random inspection of our facilities without notice i was actually impressed with the quality of work they did on our factory when it comes to baby food one cannot afford not to be thorough idusuyi hinted that nafdac had set high standards for local manufacturers of baby food which though positive made production very capital intensive on what she does to make sure her products are of good quality sangoleye said for baby foods there are international standards for us we try to match those international standards in terms of the formulation of our products we enjoy technical support from the technical university of denmark we have also been support by some retail outlets in my organisation we train our staff weekly i am grateful that nafdac and the standards organisation of nigeria take their jobs seriously while growing they pointed us in the right way to go we do a lot of things to ensure quality and that starts from when we are procuring our raw materials manufacturers challenges related news interactions with local baby food makers revealed that the market was still competitive for the indigenous baby foods as their imported counterparts still enjoy dominance though there had been campaigns by the government for nigerians to embrace made in nigeria products as a way of strengthening the naira the result is still very insignificant aside from that jaiyeoba identified unstable electricity supply as a major challenge in this line of business noting that it unnecessarily pushed up cost of production with a ripple effect on pricing she said the biggest challenge is irregular electricity supply one needs diesel to constantly power one s generating sets this is particularly so because of the sensitive nature of baby food which requires constant electricity to preserve i think the infrastructure around small scale business should be supported another challenge is access to funds it is very difficult to get funds when starting up and i am sure it is the same for most start ups we hear about funds allocated to smes to buy machines and we are looking forward to the implementation of these ideas by the government muoh said there were a lot of things government could do to help manufacturers in the sector she said if the government wants to help people like me it can do so by partnering with us and giving us loans they could also give us certain concessions in the area of taxes that will encourage us to keep pushing forward meanwhile for ogboi she acknowledged that though the sector was getting some form of support from the government things could be better she said we currently get some level of support because for baby foods and other products we manufacturers get exempted from certain things however we still need better electricity supply and funding to buy the type of equipment we need to make our products just like you mentioned this is an emerging industry and many of the equipment we use are imported so we need more financing in dollars which is the currency used to make most of our purchases it will really be helpful if we get access to foreign exchange at an affordable rate black market rates are really killing us speaking on the challenges she faced sangoleye lamented that some infant food manufacturers had got support from the governments of other countries but nigeria had not done anything to support them creating value chain sourcing for raw materials is undoubtedly one of the most important parts of the infant food making process without good raw materials they cannot produce foods of good quality sharing her experience in that area jaiyeoba said our quality control does not start when customers purchase our products it starts from gathering the seeds which are both perishable and non perishable we use a mixture of grains and seeds we have partnership agreements with some farms that produce our perishable seeds and we receive constant reports from them they also supply the perishable fruits we use for our production that partnership helps us to maintain a high level of quality for our grains we work with some farmers in the northern part of the country they are small scale farmers and are in different categories they come together to supply us in lagos we also have a team in kano state on her part idusuyi stated that she made use of local farmers and producers experts views an associate professor of food science and technology at mountain top university ogun state dr atinuke idowu advised mothers to give priority to made in nigeria foods for their children she said these products that are made locally are indigenous to us so they are cheaper more readily available and are easily digestible some of these weaning foods are made from a combination of fermented cereals such as sorghum millet and maize legumes vegetables fruits and others these products have high nutritional values protein energy malnutrition and micronutrients malnutrition have been reported to affect over 25 per cent of children in sub saharan africa leading to illnesses and high children mortality rate several efforts have been made to improve the nutritive value of ogi pap by fortifying it with food materials that are especially high in protein such as soybeans wheat offal crayfish and others on the other hand some of the imported processed weaning foods contain additives and they could have adverse effects on children idowu who is also a visiting professor at the university of manitoba canada further urged manufacturers of baby foods to do due diligence in terms of hygiene considering the weak immunity of babies she added indigenous baby food processors should make deliberate efforts to include those dietary supplements that are required for the growth of children children need a lot of protein and micronutrients such as vitamin a iron and calcium another nutritionist kemi babafemi stated that having a variety of indigenous foods for parents to choose from was a step in the right direction she said all over the world there are different foods that are particular to different kinds of people the type of food that an american child likes will be different from those that the nigerian kid fancies and vice versa that is why it is important to feed children with what is peculiar to their environment vast economic potential waiting to be unlocked beyond providing feeding alternatives some economic experts posited that if well harnessed the sector was a goldmine that would benefit the economy in the long run a report by the central bank of nigeria in january 2022 noted that the country spent about 1 8bn on food imports in nine months january september 2021 though it was not stated what percentage of the humongous sum was used in importing baby foods it would have gulped a huge amount during a bankers committee retreat held in lagos in december 2021 the governor of the cbn godwin emefiele had insisted that nigeria could produce enough food to feed its citizens he had said we believe that nigeria can feed itself nigeria can produce what to eat everything needs to be done for us to move away from a situation where everything is imported we need to get to a stage where we bring our manufacturing industries back to life again for us to say that there is sustainable inclusive growth in the country we as banks working with government must do everything possible to diversify the economy in 2020 abdulkadir mu azu a permanent secretary in the federal ministry of agriculture and rural development had estimated that nigeria spent about 1 5bn annually to import milk and other dairy products represented by winnie lai solarin the then acting director of animal husbandry services at the ministry mu azu stated that the huge bill was due to the long neglect of the livestock sector which had consequently put a lot of burden on the import bill of the country a renowned economist and a professor of economics and public policy at the university of uyo akwa ibom state akpan epko stated that if well handled the baby food manufacturing sector could provide a lot of employment and conserve foreign exchange he said it will generate employment and conserve foreign exchange which can then be used to grow the industry and its other sub sectors it will also lead to capacity building and deepen research on baby food in universities if the people in the sector are well trained they will in turn churn out high quality products also we could even be exporting the baby foods to other countries and earn foreign exchange as a matter of fact it is even risky to be importing every food eaten in the country i believe we have what it takes to produce those foods in the country ekpo who is also the chairman of the foundation for economic research and training urged the government to support the industry with funding in the form of loans with single digit interests and a long term repayment plan in an interview with our correspondent another economist muda yusuf who is the chief executive officer of the centre for the promotion of private enterprise and a former director general of the lagos chamber of commerce and industry noted that people usually imported foods for two major reasons to be assured of good quality and to cut cost he added that if the government gave baby food manufactures certain incentives such as tax waivers they would be able to bring down their operating costs and consequently compete favourably with foreign brands he said they manufacturers should be helped in the areas of tax breaks and waivers on things such as import duties on their equipment also if the skills of the people making these infant foods can be enhanced people would have no fear about their quality and they would be well patronised which would invariably lead to increased profitability another economist and the chief executive officer of cowry asset management limited johnson chukwu maintained that proper grooming of the industry would make the economic environment reproductive and attractive he added some of the challenges they manufacturers have are inadequate infrastructure poor power supply and logistics when they bring in equipment they sometimes stay so long are the seaport due to a lack of transporting infrastructure their quality of goods may not immediately match the ones that are imported but if the sector is consistently invested in things will gradually change for the better and the quality will increase the onus is on the government to provide basic infrastructure and reliable power supply that is the only way these small and medium scale enterprises can favourably compete with their foreign counterparts we used to have many local brands in the 80s but because the environment was not conducive for them to do business many of them have packed up while some have moved out of the country to places with a better business climate on how the sector can have a direct impact on the exchange rate prof ekpo said bringing down the exchange rate is a function of supply and demand if supply of foreign exchange is increased it will help to bring down the cost however that is not something that can be done in the short term it can only be achieved in the long run nafdac speaks the director of food security of the national agency for food and drugs administration and control eva edwards stated that as a regulatory body the agency did not have any special programme to encourage or promote infant food breast milk substitutes speaking with our correspondent nafdac s director of food security edwards said as a matter of fact we champion the policy for children to be fed with breast milk for 36 weeks because of that we cannot encourage infant food makers as it is not in tandem with the aforementioned policy also our purview is all foods and drugs in the country and we don t give preferential treatment to any sector we treat everybody the same way across board we always follow due process and do our due diligence we never compromise on our duty

for how much longer netflix declined to comment for this story but during a 2018 media event co founder and co ceo of netflix reed hastings suggested the dvd by mail service might close around 2023

advice gets on my nerves in the past i have lent an ear or read the flavour of the year mass market paperbacks from self help gurus most of the time they reinforce the tips that you already know after years in professional life at the end of the reading i am at sea as to what to accept what to adapt and what to ignore then comes the chapter labelled as top 5 things to do in and it would be contradicted by what you read on a similar topic a month later with all of the advice out there it can be confusing to sort out what to accept what to adapt and what to avoid everyone offers something different their generic version of how to solve our specific problems and often the advice can be quite contradictory for example stress is the sworn enemy of work life balance versus embrace stress

long term resident of denver and yet did not know this trivia time was up and with the answer not forthcoming i shared the answer denver is the portmanteau of the last three letters of golden and silver my brother an avid numismatist took this trivial one upmanship from me with the grace of a big brother as a consequence of this casual conversation i accompanied him along with our son on a road trip to the american numismatic association s edward c rochette museum also known as the money museum the museum is tucked away in colorado springs seventy miles south of denver co this museum archives fantastic documentation showcasing the evolution of money over the last 10 000 years and presenting the varied coinage from all the ancient civilizations and the quiet grandeur of the u s minted coins and paper currency the physical displays are a treat for any museum goer this visit reinforced my understanding that money since its evolution has been an important cog in the wheel of civilization a surrogate mark of status a significant characteristic that has never faded with time rather has been reinforced with the passage of time i had left self help books for a reason however its more compelling sibling is the quotable quotes the wordsmithing in quotes feels good when read because they relay a thought that one could agree with but has not been able to express as such in the nondescript corner of the basement of the museum was ensconced the children s corner and to my fortune i came across several wall hung quotable quotes on money which amused me because of their smart and pithy expression of words the quotes and the contradictions as we grew up we have been oft preached money cannot get us happiness to date i have been absorbing this truncated version here is what i found the appropriate full version to be while money cannot buy happiness it certainly lets you choose your own form of misery groucho marx then the quote from comedian spike milligan all i ask is the chance to prove that money cannot make one happy poor me the concern i had was to explain to my accompanying teen son which of these literal statements quotes are correct and what could be the right prescription for life incredulously he blurted out with utmost sincerity in his voice if money can make us miserable why does everyone need money or strive to earn money the recent events let us pause for a moment and see what is happening around us now the mass layoffs in large monopolistic technology companies which till recently seemed to be unshakeable have shaken people the companies are falling short of earnings and consequently the value of their stock price s the layoffs can be devastating for the individuals affected personally and the economy as a whole in response to shareholder demands to bolster profitability and improve the stock price the lay off is the most expedient solution so we see people s livelihoods get sacrificed at the altar of money profitability so if someone gives a saintly sermon that money is not everything should you politely beg to differ and say yes money is not everything but it is being treated as the only thing warren buffet the legendary investor mentioned plainly money is not everything but make sure you earn a lot before speaking such nonsense owing an explanation in their teenage years it is difficult to shake off the beliefs of kids when they pose a discomforting question as mentioned above as we left the museum parking lot i mustered all the intellectual effort to prepare my answer we stopped at the gas station to fill the fuel tank it is then i had a brainwave the explanation came to me money can buy fuel but can it get the experience of travel money can buy tickets to the museum but can it help imbibe the knowledge gained through the visit money can ensure our life but can it keep us safe as we drive down the highway money is a tool that will help us to get what we want but that want is rooted in one s own intellect it is simply a means to an end the relief i had when i explained these situational examples as we drove down the highway made me feel like a cool dad i gained that extra reverence from my teenage son who was expecting a response to his ambush of a question he turned and looked straight into my eyes with that unmistakable regard it made my day parting words being rich is a practical choice but being happy is an intelligent choice one might not be happy without money but then there is no guarantee that one would be happy with it someone rightly said that money can buy you leisure but not calmness calmness is in the mind which money cannot buy how about dusting off the classic 1976 abba disco hit money money money er the easier through youtube and finding guaranteed happiness for those 3 05

santa cruz calif ap netflix s trailblazing dvd by mail rental service has been relegated as a relic in the age of video streaming but there is still a steady albeit shrinking audience of diehards like amanda konkle who are happily paying to receive those discs in the iconic red and white envelopes when you open your mailbox it s still something you actually want instead of just bills said konkle a resident of savannah georgia who has been subscribing to netflix s dvd by mail service since 2005 it s a small pleasure that konkle and other still dedicated dvd subscribers enjoy but it s not clear for how much longer netflix declined to comment for this story but during a 2018 media event co founder and co ceo of netflix reed hastings suggested the dvd by mail service might close around 2023 when not if it happens netflix will shut down a service that has shipped more than 5 billion discs across the u s since its inception nearly a quarter century ago and it will echo the downfall of the thousands of blockbuster video rental stores that closed because they couldn t counter the threat posed by netflix s dvd by mail alternative the eventual demise of its dvd by mail service has been inevitable since hastings decided to spin it off from a then nascent video streaming service in 2011 back then hastings floated the idea of renaming the service as qwikster a bungled idea that was so

randolph netflix s original ceo said during an interview at a coffee shop located across the street from the post office in santa cruz california the 110 year old post office has become a landmark in silicon valley history because it s where randolph mailed a patsy cline cd to hastings in 1997 to test whether a disc could be delivered through the u s postal service without being damaged the disc arrived at hastings home unblemished prompting the duo in 1998 to launch a dvd by mail rental website that they always knew would be supplanted by even more convenient technology it was planned obsolescence but our bet was that it would take longer for it to happen than most people thought at the time randolph said with netflix s successful streaming service it might be easy to assume that

political group or party has a majority of councillors elected as things stand labour hold a strong majority on liverpool council with 61 seats out of 90 the next largest group is the liberal democrats on 11 councillors read more liverpool council spending appalling 100 000 extra a month on senior interim roles it is not a given that labour will be the largest party after may s elections and the party will expect to lose some seats over recent scandals and the problems that have landed the council with government commissioners but the odds are still on the party running things after those votes next year this means that whoever is voted in as the new leader of liverpool s labour group stands a very good chance of being the next leader of the city council the current city leader mayor joanne anderson is stepping down from the council altogether when her role is abolished in may meaning the party is preparing to elect a leader in waiting to replace her nominations opened for this position last week and following a round of interviews the party has produced a shortlist of three potential candidates these three councillors are currently gathering support ahead of a crunch

city council s cabinet member for neighbourhoods when abdul qadir had to step down because of a development investigation after years of divisions and factions within the liverpool labour group not to mention scandals and crises surrounding the ruling party s management of the city council he is seen by many as a safe pair of hands and someone who would work collegiately to try and bring the group together it is also thought that his trusted relationship with liverpool city region mayor steve rotheram and ability to work with government could be useful for a council that still finds itself under the watchful eyes of whitehall commissioners speaking about cllr robinson a labour source said liam robinson is the firm favourite and after labour s recent setbacks and scandals is seen as a safe pair of hands he s not exactly political hollywood but is competent and has proven his ability as a good cabinet member and as chair of merseytravel he is popular and has never been embroiled in

the djia closed at a seven month high this week the djia closed higher for seven of the last eight weeks it rallied 5 600 points 19 from its two year lows on october 13 and is now only 7 below its january all time highs all of the stock indices had a terrific rally from the march 2020 covid lows to their ath the nasdaq rallied 145 the s p 120 the djia 105 and the tse 99 all of the stock indices had a substantial decline from their ath to the october 13 lows the nasdaq fell 38 the s p 27 the djia 22 and the tse 20 the djia now only 7 below ath has rallied harder than any of the other indices from the october 13 lows the s p is 16 below its ath the nasdaq 30 and the tse 8 the most important thing driving stock indices down from their ath was the prospect of the fed ramming interest rates sharply higher to cool inflation in november 2021 the two year treasury yield was around 0 5 in november 2022 it was 4 5 the most important thing driving the stock market rally from the october 13 lows is the expectation that the fed will slow and then stop raising interest rates soon the stock market s reaction to the prospect of a less hawkish fed has been much more exuberant than the reaction in the credit and currency markets but then as howard marks likes to say in real life things fluctuate between pretty good and not so hot but in the stock market things go from flawless to hopeless people want to buy stocks would you short this chart how do we measure inflation the stock market s expectation that the fed will slow and then stop raising interest rates is based on the idea that yoy headline cpi inflation has peaked and will trend lower eddy markus chief analyst at ecr research in holland does not see us interest rates declining in 2023 he believes the fed needs to sustain higher interest rates to keep inflation expectations in check eddy posed an interesting question what measure of inflation will the market use going forward base effects will cause yoy inflation to fall but is that the proper metric to use my thought after reading eddy s latest piece is that the mom inflation rate might be better because it s the delta rate of change of inflation that is most important bonds bonds have had a horrible year the 10 year treasury yield hit a 14 year high in october and relative to stock indices they have had a very weak bounce after the considerable fall they suffered over the past twelve months bonds are probably catching a short term bid lately because of a looming recession but relentless qt from the fed and selling from foreign central banks will continue to weigh on prices the weak rally in bond prices may also signal a worry that inflation won t fall to 2 anytime soon and that a new era of higher inflation higher deficits and higher debt service costs is not a bond friendly environment longer term bonds are rallying relative to shorter term bonds this chart shows the ultra long us treasury futures contract rallying vs the 10 year tnote futures since the october lows the forward eurodollar curve is now pricing interest rates to peak in june 2023 last month the peak was expected to be march 2023 and to then fall 44 bps by december 2023 traders who think the fed will keep rates steady throughout 2023 might consider buying june selling december eurodollars traders who think a severe recession will cause the fed to cut interest rates sharply might consider selling june buying december eurodollars currencies the us dollar index hit a 20 year high in september up 29 from its january 2021 lows one critical support for that astonishing rally was the market s perception certainly over the last year that the fed would maintain a much more aggressive monetary policy than other central banks as markets now anticipate a slowing from the fed the usdx has weakened by 8 the consensus view in the fx market seems to be that the 20 year low in the euro in september and the 32 year low in the yen in october are major inflection points that may be correct but if the fed sustains higher interest rates to fight inflation especially if a recession seems likely or if asset prices stocks and real estate weaken then i expect the usd will rally this chart shows that non commercial speculators accounts have been aggressively buying euros over the past few weeks is buying the euro here the right move is a recession coming yield curves are inverted and inversions have historically foreshadowed a recession with the recessions starting once the inversions reverse commodity indices are falling as china slows high profile layoffs have been announced consumer sentiment is falling sharply mainly on inflation worries and credit card debt is at record levels a possible nationwide rail strike is brewing while the homebuilding industry struggles a recession looks likely the question is whether it will be mild or severe i m puzzled by this chart if a recession is coming why is cat going up you might think that if people saw a recession coming they would not be buying this stock is it simply a result of big money rotating out of big cap tech and it has to go somewhere so it goes into other big cap stocks would you short this stock energy front month wti futures registered their lowest weekly close 76 50 of the year this week down 53 41 from the highs made after the russian invasion the rolling premium of the 6 month forward wti contract over the front month has fallen to its lowest level nearly zero in two years following the russian invasion 6 month forward wti was 24 premium to spot when wti forwards were in steep backwardation traders saw that as a bullish signal european natgas prices are down 50 from this year s highs while nymex natgas prices are down 30 from this year s highs share prices of many north american oil and gas companies remain near this year s highs despite the sharp declines in nymex energy futures why is that my short term trading i started this week with short euro and s p positions established last week i covered both positions on monday good profits on the euro a slight loss on the s p i took two more small losses shorting the s p on monday and tuesday but i got turned around and bought it tuesday i covered that position on wednesday ahead of the fomc minutes for a decent profit i shorted cad euro and the s p on thursday and friday but covered all three for minimal losses i had small open gains in all three positions but with the dow surging higher i decided to get flat when the trades turned against me this is the seasonally strong time of the year for stocks i sold the s p short at the end of friday and held that position into the weekend the market seems too bullish to me but if it opens higher sunday afternoon i ll cover the trade on my radar scheduled events this coming week include jolts ism pce and ue data and a powell speech i m inclined to think the market is getting ahead of itself in expecting the fed to back off if i m right the usd should rally against other currencies and gold and stock indices should weaken despite my hunches i ll make my trading decisions based on price action the archive readers can

the man who brought us charlie brown snoopy and the whole peanuts gang would be turning 100 today cartoonist charles schulz died in february 2000 the night before his final comic strip ran in the sunday paper but the characters he created and developed over the course of five decades still endure in the form of reruns beloved tv specials a movie and a museum dedicated to schulz s work so too does the comfort they provide that s according to schulz s widow jeannie schulz and gina huntsinger the director of the charles m schulz museum in santa rosa calif they spoke to morning edition about schulz s life and legacy which huntsinger calls pervasive sfipt schulz museum charles schulz and jean schulz pictured in 1975 she says he s had a global influence from popularizing the term security blanket looking at you linus to inspiring peanuts fans from around the world to visit the museum the most common comment she gets is that people feel comforted by revisiting something nostalgic that still makes them laugh jeannie schulz offers another explanation for the comic s lasting and widespread appeal i always say that sparky expressed the human condition he wrote about real emotions that kids are feeling and it s always delivered with a little bit of humor she says anybody can read that strip in four seconds and get comfort from it because it talks about humanity alamy stock photo in oct 1950 the first peanuts comic strip first appeared in seven newspapers across the u s more than 2 600 newspapers carried it by the end of its run in 2000 peanuts broke ground aesthetically and emotionally peanuts centers on the adventures and perspectives of children famously tuning out any off screen adults and it grew out of another schulz comic about precocious kids after serving in world war ii schulz who always wanted to be a cartoonist started working at his alma mater art instruction inc on a weekly panel comic called li l folks one of the principals at art instruction schools where he worked as a corrector of peoples art lessons said i think you should stick with the little kids jeannie schulz recalls that s what he turned in to all the syndicates to see if he could get a contract little kids no parents peanuts worldwide llc charlie brown looked a little different in his official debut in 1950 schulz told npr s fresh air decades later that he regretted drawing that strip because he thought i hate him was too strong a declaration schulz s original submission to united feature syndicate was a panel cartoon rather than a strip meaning it had no definite characters schulz himself recalled in a 1990 interview with npr s fresh air when he went to new york to sign the contract he brought half a dozen strips with him and the syndication service immediately said they d rather go with a strip because they were easier to market they said well you ll have to create some definite characters schulz remembered so i said well that s no problem because i already knew i liked to draw a little dog and i just went home and i asked my friend charlie brown if i could use his name and he said that was fine and so i created patty and shermy and those were the four lead characters the first peanuts strip appeared in newspapers across the country in october 1950 and they weren t like the other cartoons on the funny pages at that time

santa cruz calif ap netflix s trailblazing dvd by mail rental service has been relegated as a relic in the age of video streaming but there is still a steady albeit shrinking audience of diehards like amanda konkle who are happily paying to receive those discs in the iconic red and white envelopes when you open your mailbox it s still something you actually want instead of just bills said konkle a resident of savannah georgia who has been subscribing to netflix s dvd by mail service since 2005 it s a small pleasure that konkle and other still dedicated dvd subscribers enjoy but it s not clear for how much longer netflix declined to comment for this story but during a 2018 media event co founder and co ceo of netflix reed hastings suggested the dvd by mail service might close around 2023 when not if it happens netflix will shut down a service that has shipped more than 5 billion discs across the u s since its inception nearly a quarter century ago and it will echo the downfall of the thousands of blockbuster video rental stores that closed because they couldn t counter the threat posed by netflix s dvd by mail alternative the eventual demise of its dvd by mail service has been inevitable since hastings decided to spin it off from a then nascent video streaming service in 2011 back then hastings floated the idea of renaming the service as qwikster a bungled idea that was so widely ridiculed that it was satirized on saturday night live it finally settled on its current more prosaic handle dvd com the operation is now based in non descript office in fremont california located about 20 miles from netflix s sleek campus in los gatos california shortly before breakup from video streaming the dvd by mail service boasted more than 16 million subscribers a number that has now dwindled to an estimated 1 5 million subscribers all in the u s based on calculations drawn from netflix s limited disclosures of the service in its quarterly reports netflix s video streaming service now boasts 223 million worldwide subscribers including 74 million in the u s and canada the dvd by mail business has bequeathed the netflix that everyone now knows and watches today marc randolph netflix s original ceo said during an interview at a coffee shop located across the street from the post office in santa cruz california the 110 year old post office has become a landmark in silicon valley history because it s where randolph mailed a patsy cline cd to hastings in 1997 to test whether a disc could be delivered through the u s postal service without being damaged the disc arrived at hastings home unblemished prompting the duo in 1998 to launch a dvd by mail rental website that they always knew would be supplanted by even more convenient technology it was planned obsolescence but our bet was that it would take longer for it to happen than most people thought at the time randolph said with netflix s successful streaming service it might be easy to assume that anyone still paying to receive dvds through the mail is a technophobe or someone living in a remote part of the u s without reliable internet access but subscribers say they stick with the service so they can rent movies that are otherwise difficult to find on streaming services for michael fusco 35 that includes the 1986 film power starring a then youthful richard gere and denzel washington and 1980 s the big red one starring lee marvin that s among the main reasons he has been subscribing to the dvd by service since 2006 when he was just a freshman in college and he has no plans to cancel it now i have been getting it for almost half my life and it has been a big part fusco said when i was young it helped me discover voices i probably wouldn t have heard i still have memories of getting movies and having them blow my mind tabetha neumann is among the subscribers who rediscovered the dvd service during the throes of the pandemic lockdowns in 2020 after running out of things to watch on her video streaming service so she and her husband signed up again for the first time since canceling in 2011 now they like it so much that they get the a plan that allows them to keep up to three discs at a time an option that currently costs 20 per month compared to 10 per month for the one disc plan when we started going through all the movies we wanted to see we realized it was cheaper than paying 5 per movie on some streaming services neumann said plus we have found a lot of old horror movies and that genre is not really big on streaming konkle who has written a book about marilyn monroe s films says she still finds movies on the dvd service such as the 1954 film cattle queen of montana featuring future u s president ronald reagan alongside barbara stanwyck and the 1983 french film sugar cane alley that help her teach her film studies classes as an associate professor at georgia southern university it s a viewing habit she doesn t usually share with her classes because most of my students don t know what a dvd is said konkle 40 laughing but for all the dvd service s attractions subscribers are starting to notice signs of deterioration as the business has shrunk from producing more than 1 billion in annual revenue a year ago to an amount likely to fall below 200 in revenue this year katie cardinale a subscriber who lives in hopedale massachusetts says she now has to wait an additional two to four days for discs to arrive in the mail than she used to because they are shipped from a distribution center in new jersey instead of boston netflix doesn t disclose how many dvd distribution centers still operate but there were once about 50 of them in the u s konkle says more discs now come with cracks or other defects in them and it takes forever to get them replaced and almost all subscribers have noticed the selection of dvd titles has shrunk dramatically from the service s peak years when netflix boasted it had more than 100 000 different movies and tv shows on disc netflix no longer discloses the size of its dvd library but the subscribers interviewed by the ap all reported the narrowing selection is making it more difficult to find famous films and popular tv series that once were routinely available on the service instead netflix now sorts requests for titles such as the first season of the award winning ted lasso series a

ostensibly i m here to interview the renowned psychotherapist andrew jamieson about his latest book which sets out a paradigm shifting take on the infamous midlife crisis not only is the midlife crisis good for you jamieson contends it is actually an essential part of the human story and the definitive path to making us all better people however the conversation soon takes a turn towards my life and jamieson begins analysing me i mention that his book midlife humanity s secret weapon really chimed with me i saw echoes in my own life an hour later and i have learned that i have gone through my own midlife crisis and didn t even know it i m 52 but over recent years i have basically ticked off much of the midlife crisis checklist quit a job unexpectedly tick resigned as a newspaper editor health scare tick hospitalised with kidney problems that nearly finished me off psychological upset tick diagnosed with ptsd related to a mock execution that happened when i was a reporter in northern ireland changes in personal circumstances tick purged people who i felt were toxic to be around lifestyle change tick i no longer smoke hardly drink after years of overindulgence and despite a lifetime of indolence now regularly exercise changing opinions tick i m more mellow politically and hopefully more empathetic even my cultural tastes have altered i no longer gorge on dark tv horror movies extreme fiction and angry music i m now more likely to be found listening to classic fm or contentedly watching paddington movies have i become a bit boring probably am i happier yes 100 per cent psychotherapist andrew jamieson says a midlife crisis is an essential part of the human story image newsquest forget the harley the key to understanding jamieson s thoughts on midlife crisis is this it s not about some 50 year old buying a harley davidson and running off with the au pair or plumber it s about reaching a mature stage in life and realising probably subconsciously that you haven t been the person you could be the best you from there you start changing in significant sometimes very hard ways which bring about enough of an alteration in how you live your life that you become closer to the person you always wanted to be it s not magic you don t suddenly stop picking your nose or become jesus you are still a flawed imperfect foolish human you just learn to be more comfortable in your skin after taking honest stock of who you are and how you can be better first world problems some would say certainly there is truth in that if you are hungry or at war there is no time or energy to work on whatever new version of you needs to be created but we live in the developed world we are humans made of flesh and blood and if we can improve ourselves without hurting others why not so what is a midlife crisis the curve of life goes through a series of stable patches interrupted by a sudden unstable phase when suddenly everything seems out of kilter and wrong jamieson says a midlife crisis can take place anywhere between the late 20s and the end of life although old age is the worst time to experience these upheavals as there are few years left to enjoy the benefits of change the peak period though is from the late 30s to the early 50s when perhaps boredom has set in around work or relationships children have grown up and there s a sense of time ticking away death looms in the imagination killer whale theory basically a midlife crisis is like a boil on the body years of psychological pressures from childhood to the present day just build up and have to pop otherwise you will be poisoned jamieson notes that only two species of mammal experience midlife and have a post reproductive life that lasts longer than their reproductive life killer whales and humans orcas are led by older wiser females who have been through every challenge the seas can throw at them and know the best hunting grounds to keep their pod alive in humans midlife crisis jamieson posits also creates older wiser members of the group who provide a balance between the energy vigour and competitiveness of those in the first half of life and the experience dignity and wisdom of those in the second the power of midlife is most evidenced in tribal societies where age is still venerated unlike in the west where youth is idolised in tribal societies elders who have lived hard lives and come through are guardians of the ethical approach to life a society which simply follows the young warrior class is doomed in other words for human society to be its best it needs both youthful energy and older knowledge midlife provides the bridge jamieson s theories make intuitively good sense though not for a minute am i claiming to have suddenly become a sage i m just less wild and more comfortable being me cuban missle test jamieson notes how in moments of group crisis it is often older people who have crucially gone through the rigours of midlife and emerged in better shape than when they went in who come to the fore offering wise counsel the us diplomat adlai stevenson he says experienced intense distress in midlife leading to the collapse of his marriage he was central though to providing the patience and calm needed to shepherd a still youthful john f kennedy through the cuban missile crisis averting armageddon humans however have a strange relationship to both midlife and midlife crisis often older people particularly women are sidelined yet we seek the counsel of elders in moments of extremis humanity both fears and mocks midlife just look at movies like american beauty or falling down however a cursory perusal of world culture shows we have always known just how important it is homer s odyssey tells the story of a man who goes through intense torment in midlife before becoming older and wiser the divine comedy begins with dante writing these lines midway upon the journey of life i found myself within a dark forest for the straightforward path had been lost oh how hard a thing it is to say dante literally goes to hell bides a while in purgatory then discovers paradise the midlife crisis jamieson says always comes with a liminal stage a period of waiting between dark crisis and positive change just like purgatory midlife crisis he says is an evolutionary move to produce a cadre of elders who keep society in balance each and everyone one of us will experience midlife crisis it s how we deal or don t deal with it that matters so jamieson notes the life of mary ann evans the victorian writer who experienced enormous upheaval and shame in her 30s over an adulterous relationship she quite literally reinvented herself post crisis and is better known today as george eliot the trump factor however for every adlai stevenson and george eliot there s a trump or putin they just stick says jamieson they either can t or won t change in midlife the fact so many of these types nearly all men display narcissistic traits probably explains the refusal to reevaluate their lives and tackling ego is as jamieson says central to navigating midlife successfully horribly not dealing with a midlife crisis can potentially have devastating consequences one of jamieson s clients stopped therapy mid crisis and later killed herself most of our psychological troubles lie as we know in childhood clearly the process of birth is intensely traumatic we might not remember it but as newborns jamieson explains we re flooded with fear and anxiety hormones as babies it is impossible to deal with such trauma much of early childhood also remains intensely traumatic as infants we are completely dependent on our parents especially our mothers whom we bond most closely with any sense of abandonment mum or dad going to work say drenches us again in fear and anxiety this all leaves an indelible wound jamieson explains all of us grow up creating psychological mechanisms to protect us from fears like abandonment to heal ourselves we sublimate our fears hiding from our true feelings we build up a tough outer shell that is essentially fake this all makes for a toxic egotistical mix of narcissism and grandiosity says jamieson these defences are a great pool of dysfunctionality projection denial regression and deflection he adds the mask that means our true self is pushed down hidden in essence we wear a mask a persona that helps us get through this cruel world we all live in but no one can live inside a mask forever if the mask eventually comes off says jamieson quoting abraham lincoln then we free the better angels of our nature the lincoln quote is crucial lincoln also went through intense agonies in midlife seeing himself as a complete failure only to emerge as one of the wisest presidents in american history fundamentally a midlife crisis is about finding a way to become less ego orientated and therefore of more use to society through being our true selves jamieson lived through his own midlife crisis until his 40s he was a successful promoter of classical music concerts then life caught up with him and he just collapsed completely he was tended to by a psychotherapist who had been a patient of carl jung one of the founders of modern psychiatry when he recovered jamieson now 71 recreated himself he retrained as a psychotherapist and became the successful practitioner he is today i found a second life he says but there s always a wound which creates the turmoil of midlife crisis ironically that wound is he says an enormous potential gift jamieson s wound lay deep in childhood his mother adored her father jamieson s grandfather after jamieson was born she returned to her parental home jamieson s father a naval officer was at sea however within days of jamieson s mother returning her beloved father died her grief gravely disrupted her ability to parent so there jamieson was a baby who grew into a child flooded with feelings of fear anxiety and abandonment as an adult his intense workaholic existence was a perfect way to hide from all those issues eventually though life the past childhood caught up with him and emotionally he was knocked for six conformist hell society school and work reinforce all these negative aspects of our characters school and work demand both conformity and a form of ego driven narcissism to succeed teachers and bosses don t care about your feelings to survive you must be extremely selfish and without conformity you re not going to make progress jamieson says but these defences corrupt your true nature they suffocate the person you could be counterintuitively success can often trigger midlife crisis people get to the top and then realise they ve used the wrong ladder he explains they have lived lives that don t suit them and they need to reverse that s why crisis and opportunity go hand in hand you ve got to reconfigure your life without causing too much collateral damage clearly though if handled wrong midlife crisis can end in divorce and family rupture however if you navigate it right a midlife crisis says jamieson will leave you without constant past regrets that hound you and without fear of the future psychotherapists call this process individuation if a midlife crisis is properly explored examined and overcome jamieson adds the real self comes out our anxieties and depression will lift he adds the manner in which we conduct our closest relationships will be transformed our compassion will deepen as our self centredness diminishes our capacity for humility will be extended our concerns about our mortality will diminish elements of our creativity which have lain dormant for years will be revealed our sense of soulfulness and our interest in spirituality will emerge such is the power of the kind of self realisation which can be the eventual consequence of the midlife crisis the shadow jamieson says you can often spot someone who has come out the other side of a midlife crisis as the changes in their character are so marked a little suffering means you are more likely to feel empathy for others that s what we should all be aiming for he says it s about looking inward and confronting the darkest aspects of your nature the shadow as jamieson calls it it is not about killing off the shadow but integrating it and coming to terms with the fact it exists that means facing our worst flaws especially ones we deliberately shy away from rage sexuality or weakness jamieson says we all know these truths deep within us even if we fear to act on them it is no coincidence that one of the earliest philosophical maxims came from the elderly socrates before his death the unexamined life is not worth living mummy merkel jamieson notes the life of angela merkel a woman intensely conflicted between her upbringing in communist east germany and her personal christianity merkel s greatest act was opening her country s doors to one million syrian refugees almost as if she was atoning for the terrible things germany did in the past in germany she s nicknamed mutti merkel mummy merkel the ultimate moniker for a wise kind older woman boris johnson he suggests shows all the characteristics of a man going through an unresolved midlife crisis he has early childhood trauma his mother had mental health problems and his father was allegedly violent he grew up intensely narcissistic the infamous world king quote seems to sum that up plus he has been through marriage break up and just lost a top job if johnson worked on the crisis he is going through jamieson suggests he would be transformed in some ways jamieson contends the entire human race might be undergoing a midlife crisis we have had our terrifying infancy all that scrabbling for survival as hunter gatherers our lonely confused childhood that staggered on until the medieval period our successful ego driven adulthood that took us past the industrial revolution and into the 20th century and now from maybe 1914 onwards we are in an intense crisis which if not handled correctly could destroy us nuclear war and climate change might metaphorically be the harley davidson and stupid affair that brings us to our knees humanity jamieson suggests needs to find the emotional intelligence which comes from successfully navigating midlife if we don t we re in trouble midlife therefore is an evolutionary issue to survive we must make cultural changes towards empathy and compassion if humanity has a collective consciousness then war is simply the lashing out of an angry stupid adult who never grew up and discovered how to manage conflict the carving knife the process of resolving a midlife crisis can be deeply traumatic some of jamieson s clients fantasise about burying a carving knife in their parents chest many negative feelings link back to childhood and that fear of abandonment or the sense that parents are the ones responsible for someone s low self esteem after his own midlife crisis jamieson resolved his problems with his mother one of the key triggers for midlife crisis is our sense of imminent mortality that come 40 or 50 we re closer to death we ve just a handful of decades time is so bloody short jamieson says resolving our psychological problems in midlife allows us to better spend the time that remains to us and enjoy the fruits of this transformatory experience carl jung who formulated many of the psychological ideas jamieson follows also went through a midlife crisis a successful highly ambitious young man he crashed in midlife breaking friendships and cheating on his wife jung emerged from a deep depression to do his greatest work he killed his ego jamieson says jung is a perfect example of the break it to create it aspect of midlife crisis self sabotage is often a precursor that s why the midlife crisis is so linked to that notion of the harley davidson or stupid affair in the popular imagination midlife he says is a thrust towards self realisation we exist in order to develop adding yet this development can only be achieved through much exacting and painful experience including the key phase in our middle years that we ve come to call the midlife crisis despite the agony it always brings happy endings if it s worked out properly if you re prepared to take on the challenge you ll be transformed we finish our conversation and jamieson invites me to meet him again next week to take our discussions further i d be a fool not to accept nobody turns their back on synchronicity and there s definitely much work still to do from november 21 to november 30 2022 the herald is running a black friday subscription offer which provides full access to our unrivalled coverage of news that matters for just 1

santa cruz calif ap netflix s trailblazing dvd by mail rental service has been relegated as a relic in the age of video streaming but there is still a steady albeit shrinking audience of diehards like

rural hoosiers desperately need state leaders and lawmakers to make greater investments in indiana s lesser populated regions especially as the younger and more educated workforce moves to more urban areas of the state that s according to a new report released earlier this month by the indiana community action poverty institute an indianapolis based advocacy group that seeks to prevent and end poverty in the state the 38 page report is based on surveys of more than 1 000 hoosiers including business leaders elected officials economic developers and financially vulnerable residents rural researchers were also interviewed in depth data analyses and policy reports specific to 40 rural indiana counties helped inform the briefing too at the heart of the report is a message to policymakers and other stakeholders that in order to boost the rural hoosier economy and make rural businesses profitable rural people need to thrive that isn t the case currently however rural indiana s economy is increasingly vulnerable to job loss population decline and shrinking prosperity as educated young people leave for more opportunities in urban areas and low paying service jobs replace good paying manufacturing jobs according to the report according to a kelley school of business report census data shows the 44 indiana counties that are part of a metropolitan statistical area combined to grow by 6 3 percent over the past decade meanwhile the state s 48 non metro counties as a group declined by 0 9 percent over the same period in our area the report uses purdue university data to identify brown and jennings counties as rural that is having a total county population of less than 40 000 and a largest city of less than 10 000 people bartholomew and jackson counties are categorized as rural mixed meaning they each have total populations of less than 100 000 and or a largest city with a population of 10 000 to 30 000 people rural economic struggles as the rural economy struggles business vulnerability is also rising automation offshoring and low educational attainment in the workforce threaten business competitiveness that challenge is heightened by a lack of critical industrial infrastructure including broadband and insufficient quality housing stock to attract workers of all incomes the hoosiers who rely on those struggling employers for their financial well being are also increasingly vulnerable the report notes it s becoming harder to find good jobs that pay enough to support their families even when those jobs are available a lack of affordable childcare and unreliable transportation make it even harder to commute to work and stay employed tragically hard work just isn t enough to get ahead anymore for too many struggling hoosiers in rural communities the report said collectively rural counties are home to nearly 900 000 hoosiers accounting for 13 of the state s residents not all bad news by most high level economic measures rural indiana performs quite well according to the policy institute in rural indiana counties median household income 52 237 is only slightly lower than in urban non rural indiana 56 491 the unemployment rate 2 3 is slightly lower than in the state as a whole 2 5 as of may 2022 a rural poverty rate for black indigenous and other non white families is lower than in urban areas although the poverty rate is still twice as high as the poverty rate for white families in rural indiana the report attributes much of this success to the abundant assets in rural hoosier communities like natural resources a strong base of experienced manufacturing workers and a great quality of life emphasizing that rural hoosiers love their communities moreover rural hoosiers interviewed for the report expressed a strong satisfaction for the quality of place in their communities more than two thirds of financially well off rural hoosiers reported being satisfied with the safety schools and overall quality of their neighborhoods more than half of financially vulnerable hoosiers said they feel the same according to survey results this reinforces the message we heard over and over again rural hoosiers love their communities and want to stay there the report s authors wrote increasingly vulnerable but rural indiana s economy continues to be vulnerable to job loss and shrinking prosperity manufacturing jobs are particularly at risk largely due to increased automation estimates from ball state university s center for business and economic research and rural policy research institute shows that 11 of the 17 indiana counties most at risk of automation are in rural indiana only 4 of the 19 counties with the lowest automation risk are in rural indiana as a result of that transformation the second and third largest employment sectors in rural indiana are now retail trade equal to 10 of all rural jobs and accommodations and food service 6 of rural jobs sectors that the indiana community action poverty institute says are dominated by ultra low wage jobs thanks to these changes in the rural economy hard work isn t always enough anymore to provide people with middle class financial security the report notes to be clear this growth in poor people didn t happen because more rural people got lazy or stopped working it s the result of a massive economic transformation affecting the entire american economy that eliminated the kinds of jobs that working families depended on to earn a living and replaced them with jobs that paid significantly less in other words rural hoosiers didn t stop working hard hard work stopped paying off the report s authors continued manufacturing remains the largest source of jobs in rural indiana employing almost a third of the rural workforce while the report s authors say this is good news in the short term for rural workers since manufacturing tends to pay better wages than jobs in other sectors the long term trends are more concerning that s because manufacturing jobs have declined steadily throughout the entire state for decades a trend that shows no sign of improvement in rural communities this means rural workers are forced to depend on a sector that is steadily vanishing of the rural residents surveyed 62 of those who are low income said that good jobs were needed very much in their rural community and that without them too many people s lives are dominated by significant economic hardship and financial vulnerability just over half of respondents working full time and 62 of respondents working part time indicated that they wouldn t be able to pay for an emergency expense if one were to occur other findings other survey data revealed that 58 of respondents working full time and 63 1 working part time do not have a savings account 70 of respondents working full time and 87 9 working part time do not have a retirement account 31 of those employed part time and 36 7 employed full time are behind on medical debt transportation is an additional challenge for those living in rural indiana one out of every three rural hoosiers travel outside of their communities to urban centers to find work suggesting that rural workers can t find jobs that pay enough or that they re qualified for within rural places according to the report it also suggests that the low unemployment rates and competitive household income levels in rural counties may be due in large part to the strong job markets in the state s urban areas meaning urban indiana may be propping up the economy in rural indiana making matters more complicated the report points out that while indiana s urban cities have experienced robust population growth of about half a million people from 2000 to 2020 rural population has remained stagnant or in many counties actually declined the numbers reinforce the story we heard repeatedly in interviews many rural areas are experiencing significant brain drain as the next generation of rural hoosiers leave their rural places to find better paying work in the suburbs and cities the report says the indiana community action poverty institute recommends seven specific priorities for achieving what it calls rural prosperity priority 1 provide residents with access to reliable affordable transportation that connects them to essential goods services and jobs the institute called on policymakers in indiana to invest in expanded transportation options for rural hoosiers including ridesharing approaches such as carpooling or vanpooling as well as vouchers that low income riders can exchange for rides lawmakers are additionally encouraged to enact policy that enables more electric vehicle use mostly through investments in public charging stations and rebates for the sale or lease of electric vehicles priority 2 ensure all hoosiers have access to high quality affordable housing the report says policymakers can increase the supply of high quality affordable housing by enforcing habitability standards increasing investments in the state s housing trust fund providing funds for appraisal gap financing and making regulatory changes that spur housing development or increase the appraised value of existing housing especially manufactured homes priority 3 all businesses in rural indiana have an adequate supply of appropriately skilled workers despite recent efforts to get hoosiers better educated indiana still lacks the skilled workforce needed to grow our economy the report says among the policy institute s recommendations to help increase the skills or educational attainment of adults already in the workforce is a call for a pilot program that would allow indiana to provide supportive and wrap around services to help financially vulnerable hoosiers attain more skills and education the state should also put greater emphasis on increasing education and training options available to hoosiers participating in indiana s temporary assistance for needy families tanf and supplemental nutrition assistance program snap priority 4 rural areas fully integrate immigrant residents into their communities supporting immigrant participation in existing small business development programs is critical at the statewide level according to the policy institute policymakers and state economic development leaders should additionally encourage local economic development strategies and systems to explicitly include immigrants priority 5 businesses and their employees have access to high quality and affordable broadband services in all rural communities to boost broadband access in rural indiana policymakers in indiana should consider investments that build on existing state efforts to support internet providers in providing access to fast and reliable internet services in their service areas indiana should also leverage federal resources to boost broadband access in rural parts of the state and invest in nonprofits that deploy free wi fi networks in low income apartment buildings priority 6 provide workers in rural indiana with access to good jobs with living wages the primary recommendation is for lawmakers and local governments to raise the minimum wage for public employees and workers although the policy institute did not give specific numbers for such increases policymakers can also enact family friendly workplace policies including those pertaining to paid family medical leave insurance programs state lawmakers can further mandate that all private and public sector employers provide paid sick days to their employees priority 7 ensure rural hoosier families have adequate access to high quality and affordable childcare quality affordable childcare is critical for helping hoosiers in rural communities go to work according to the report lawmakers in indiana should increase state funding to expand access to childcare like additional investments in on my way pre k as well as childcare subsidies for children aged 0 3 the policy institute additionally called on the state to invest in the childcare industry including both high quality early childhood training programs and paying reimbursement rates that support and reward providers who pay higher wages and provide benefits

santa cruz calif ap netflix s trailblazing dvd by mail rental service has been relegated as a relic in the age of video streaming but there is still a steady albeit shrinking audience of diehards like amanda konkle who are happily paying to receive those discs in the iconic red and white envelopes when you open your mailbox it s still something you actually want instead of just bills said konkle a resident of savannah georgia who has been subscribing to netflix s dvd by mail service since 2005 it s a small pleasure that konkle and other still dedicated dvd subscribers enjoy but it s not clear for how much longer netflix declined to comment for this story but during a 2018 media event co founder and co ceo of netflix reed hastings suggested the dvd by mail service might close around 2023 when not if it happens netflix will shut down a service that has shipped more than 5 billion discs across the u s since its inception nearly a quarter century ago and it will echo the downfall of the thousands of blockbuster video rental stores that closed because they couldn t counter the threat posed by netflix s dvd by mail alternative the eventual demise of its dvd by mail service has been inevitable since hastings decided to spin it off from a then nascent video streaming service in 2011 back then hastings floated the idea of renaming the service as qwikster a bungled idea that was so widely ridiculed that it was satirized on saturday night live it finally settled on its current more prosaic handle dvd com the operation is now based in non descript office in fremont california located about 20 miles from netflix s sleek campus in los gatos california shortly before breakup from video streaming the dvd by mail service boasted more than 16 million subscribers a number that has now dwindled to an estimated 1 5 million subscribers all in the u s based on calculations drawn from netflix s limited disclosures of the service in its quarterly reports netflix s video streaming service now boasts 223 million worldwide subscribers including 74 million in the u s and canada the dvd by mail business has bequeathed the netflix that everyone now knows and watches today marc randolph netflix s original ceo said during an interview at a coffee shop located across the street from the post office in santa cruz california the 110 year old post office has become a landmark in silicon valley history because it s where randolph mailed a patsy cline cd to hastings in 1997 to test whether a disc could be delivered through the u s postal service without being damaged the disc arrived at hastings home unblemished prompting the duo in 1998 to launch a dvd by mail rental website that they always knew would be supplanted by even more convenient technology it was planned obsolescence but our bet was that it would take longer for it to happen than most people thought at the time randolph said with netflix s successful streaming service it might be easy to assume that anyone still paying to receive dvds through the mail is a technophobe or someone living in a remote part of the u s without reliable internet access but subscribers say they stick with the service so they can rent movies that are otherwise difficult to find on streaming services for michael fusco 35 that includes the 1986 film power starring a then youthful richard gere and denzel washington and 1980 s the big red one starring lee marvin that s among the main reasons he has been subscribing to the dvd by service since 2006 when he was just a freshman in college and he has no plans to cancel it now i have been getting it for almost half my life and it has been a big part fusco said when i was young it helped me discover voices i probably wouldn t have heard i still have memories of getting movies and having them blow my mind tabetha neumann is among the subscribers who rediscovered the dvd service during the throes of the pandemic lockdowns in 2020 after running out of things to watch on her video streaming service so she and her husband signed up again for the first time since canceling in 2011 now they like it so much that they get the a plan that allows them to keep up to three discs at a time an option that currently costs 20 per month compared to 10 per month for the one disc plan when we started going through all the movies we wanted to see we realized it was cheaper than paying 5 per movie on some streaming services neumann said plus we have found a lot of old horror movies and that genre is not really big on streaming konkle who has written a book about marilyn monroe s films says she still finds movies on the dvd service such as the 1954 film cattle queen of montana featuring future u s president ronald reagan alongside barbara stanwyck and the 1983 french film sugar cane alley that help her teach her film studies classes as an associate professor at georgia southern university it s a viewing habit she doesn t usually share with her classes because most of my students don t know what a dvd is said konkle 40 laughing but for all the dvd service s attractions subscribers are starting to notice signs of deterioration as the business has shrunk from producing more than 1 billion in annual revenue a year ago to an amount likely to fall below 200 in revenue this year katie cardinale a subscriber who lives in hopedale massachusetts says she now has to wait an additional two to four days for discs to arrive in the mail than she used to because they are shipped from a distribution center in new jersey instead of boston netflix doesn t disclose how many dvd distribution centers still operate but there were once about 50 of them in the u s konkle says more discs now come with cracks or other defects in them and it takes forever to get them replaced and almost all subscribers have noticed the selection of dvd titles has shrunk dramatically from the service s peak years when netflix boasted it had more than 100 000 different movies and tv shows on disc netflix no longer discloses the size of its dvd library but the subscribers interviewed by the ap all reported the narrowing selection is making it more difficult to find famous films and popular tv series that once were routinely available on the service instead netflix now sorts requests for titles such as the first season of the award winning ted lasso series a release that can be purchased on dvd into a saved queue signaling it may decide to stock it in the future depending on demand knowing the end is in sight randolph said he will lament the death of the dvd service he brought to life while taking comfort its legacy will survive netflix s dvd business was part and parcel of who netflix was and still is he said it s embedded in the company s dna
let s face it water is boring sure it s essential to your health and few beverages can be more crisp or refreshing but most bottled water brands are fairly bland and uninspiring featuring the same interchangeable references to mountains springs or both over a decade ago mike cessario started wondering if he could change that what if he could actually make water cool that s the relatively simple origin story behind liquid death the ironically named canned water brand that cessario trademarked in 2017 and officially launched two years later it might sound like a joke at first and it kind of was but there s nothing funny or boring about how quickly liquid death has become a dominant force in a bottled water market that s worth up to 350 billion globally according to pitchbook get dfw local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc dfw newsletters from its viral social media posts to its super bowl commercial liquid death suddenly seemed to be everywhere along with its cheeky tagline murder your thirst that social cachet is reflected in the jump in its sales which were 2 8 million in 2019 and are on track to be 130 million in 2022 i didn t think it would be this big cessario a marketing professional with a background in design and the underground music scene said he initially thought his water would have only a niche following i didn t think it would be this big cessario 40 told cnbc make it i think one of the most surprising things to everybody with this was how wide the audience really was the liquid death ceo envisioned the idea catching on with punk rock musicians looking to stay hydrated during long sets and any of their straight edge in other words sober fans looking to keep up while drinking something healthier than alcohol or sugary energy drinks instead it s found a wide range of fans from young people who love the brand s cool name and design to moms who want their kids to drink something healthy cessario said liquid death packages its mountain water in a 16 9 fluid ounce tallboy can emblazoned with a melting skull logo reminiscent of craft beers or energy drinks such as monster and rockstar also taking notice are deep pocketed investors such as live nation entertainment and science ventures and celebrity backers including comedian whitney cummings and members of music group swedish house mafia collectively investors have pumped about 195 million into liquid death valuing the brand at 700 million cessario said liquid death s meteoric rise in just three years makes the company more than just a clever name even though cessario admits that might be his product s biggest selling point at the end of the day we re really creating an entertainment company and a water company he said we want to actually entertain people make them laugh in service of a brand and if you can do that they re going to love your brand because you re giving them something of value you re actually making them laugh inspiration at the warped tour the seed of the idea was planted in 2009 cessario said he was living in denver and watching some friends perform with their band at the vans warped tour music festival monster energy drinks were a sponsor on the tour so the musicians were drinking out of monster cans but they d replaced the energy drink with water to stay hydrated during their sets he said it started making me think about why aren t there more healthy products that still have funny cool irreverent branding cessario said because most of the funniest most memorable irreverent branding marketing is all for junk food then in 2014 cessario was working on a public service ad campaign about the health risks of sugary energy drinks his idea he said doing a canned water that was sort of just geared as a stunt to poke fun at energy drinks the client didn t like it but cessario kept tinkering with the concept in his free time it took him roughly two years to hone the concept he said and most importantly settle on a name liquid death had to be insanely interesting to survive cessario knew that if he launched his own water brand he wouldn t have enough money to market it to the masses in traditional ways that meant the name and the brand identity needed to be the perfect mix of funny edgy and cool memorable enough for people to share on their social media feeds creating free advertising the only way the brand would have a chance at survival is the actual product itself has to be so insanely interesting where so much of the marketing is baked into the product he said so cessario turned to a marketing trick he said his team at liquid death still uses today what s the dumbest possible idea if you try to think of a smart idea then your brain is hard wired to think about successful examples that already exist he explained you kind of have to trick your brain to come up with a bad idea to truly be thinking in innovative territory he said it works really well because you start thinking like oh what s the dumbest possible name for a super healthy safest beverage possible liquid death probably the dumbest name once cessario trademarked the name in 2017 he felt that he was on to something if someone i knew saw that in a store i m pretty sure they re going to have to pick that up and be like what is this he said and once someone picks something up you ve basically won social media was asking is this real cessario hoped liquid death could generate its own marketing but he still needed money to turn it into a real product he could sell initially potential investors and people in the beverage industry told him that the design for liquid death s cans looked too much like beer which could potentially confuse customers and that retailers will never put something on the shelf that says death on it he said nobody was going to just write a check for that idea because it was so out there he said to prove liquid death was a viable brand cessario took a 3d rendering of his can design and created a facebook page in 2018 to make liquid death look like a legitimate product he shot a two minute commercial starring his wife s actress friend that cost him 1 500 and dipped into his savings to spend another few thousand dollars in paid media to promote it four months in the video had 3 million views cessario said the page had almost 80 000 followers which was more than aquafina on facebook at the time we had hundreds of messages and comments from people this is the greatest thing ever is this real cessario said people contacted the facebook page to ask where they could buy liquid death beverage distributors got in touch looking for a salesperson so they could stock it in stores cessario said that reaction was enough for investors after two years of floating the idea to potential backers cessario landed 1 6 million in seed funding from science ventures in january 2019 liquid death started selling cans of water to customers through its website that same month how long can the joke last today liquid death has more than 250 000 followers on facebook and 1 4 million on instagram in 2020 the brand expanded into whole foods stores and it had roughly 10 million in sales for the year that number jumped to 45 million last year as chains such as 7 eleven and publix joined in earlier this year liquid death launched a line of flavored carbonated waters with irreverent names such as berry it alive and severed lime now the brand is sold in more than 60 000 retail locations nationwide including kroger and target where the cans retail for 1 89 apiece liquid death is amazon s top selling still water brand and second bestselling sparkling water brand cessario said liquid death is definitely expecting to double its revenue next year suggesting a total of roughly 260 million in sales in 2023 but how far can a canned water brand based on a good joke go many of the biggest bottled water brands are owned by massive conglomerates such as the coca cola company which owns dasani and smartwater and pepsico which owns aquafina any of them could launch their own irreverent water brand too but cessario appears unconcerned by the prospect it s really hard to replicate the marketing he said really hard people think it s easy and you ll see people come out trying to do it and fall completely flat on their face want to earn more and work

the man who brought us charlie brown snoopy and the whole peanuts gang would be turning 100 today cartoonist charles schulz died in february 2000 the night before his final comic strip ran in the sunday paper but the characters he created and developed over the course of five decades still endure in the form of reruns beloved tv specials a movie and a museum dedicated to schulz s work so too does the comfort they provide that s according to schulz s widow jeannie schulz and gina huntsinger the director of the charles m schulz museum in santa rosa calif they spoke to morning edition about schulz s life and legacy which huntsinger calls pervasive sfipt schulz museum sfipt schulz museum charles schulz and jean schulz pictured in 1975 she says he s had a global influence from popularizing the term security blanket looking at you linus to inspiring peanuts fans from around the world to visit the museum the most common comment she gets is that people feel comforted by revisiting something nostalgic that still makes them laugh jeannie schulz offers another explanation for the comic s lasting and widespread appeal i always say that sparky expressed the human condition he wrote about real emotions that kids are feeling and it s always delivered with a little bit of humor she says anybody can read that strip in four seconds and get comfort from it because it talks about humanity alamy stock photo alamy stock photo in oct 1950 the first peanuts comic strip first appeared in seven newspapers across the u s more than 2 600 newspapers carried it by the end of its run in 2000 peanuts broke ground aesthetically and emotionally peanuts centers on the adventures and perspectives of children famously tuning out any off screen adults and it grew out of another schulz comic about precocious kids after serving in world war ii schulz who always wanted to be a cartoonist started working at his alma mater art instruction inc on a weekly panel comic called li l folks one of the principals at art instruction schools where he worked as a corrector of peoples art lessons said i think you should stick with the little kids jeannie schulz recalls that s what he turned in to all the syndicates to see if he could get a contract little kids no parents peanuts worldwide llc peanuts worldwide llc charlie brown looked a little different in his official debut in 1950 schulz told npr s fresh air decades later that he regretted drawing that strip because he thought i hate him was too strong a declaration schulz s original submission to united feature syndicate was a panel cartoon rather than a strip meaning it had no definite characters schulz himself recalled in a 1990 interview with npr s fresh air when he went to new york to sign the contract he brought half a dozen strips with him and the syndication service immediately said they d rather go with a strip because they were easier to market they said well you ll have to create some definite characters schulz remembered so i said well that s no problem because i already knew i liked to draw a little dog and i just went home and i asked my friend charlie brown if i could use his name and he said that was fine and so i created patty and shermy and those were the four lead characters the first peanuts strip appeared in newspapers across the country in october 1950 and they weren t like the other cartoons on the funny pages at that time huntsinger says aesthetically schulz s lines were simple and minimalistic using only what was necessary to tell the story and creatively huntsinger says he was a genius we could relate to his strip like we could see ourselves as charlie brown our kite s stuck in a tree again or the frustration of something happening she says and also charles schulz was the first one to really talk about emotions in the strip so it changed the cartooning industry he was so different than what was on the page when he first started brennan spark photography brennan spark photography the charles m schulz museum and research center in santa rosa calif says it has welcomed more than 1 million visitors from around the world since it opened in 2002 and has the largest collection of original comic strips on display at any given time it remains a source of comfort even in reruns schulz spent a lot of time with his characters over the decades as did the public by 2000 peanuts was running in more than 2 500 newspapers in 75 countries and he related to each of them telling fresh air that he doubted it would be possible to do something every day with a group of characters without each one of those characters being a little bit of myself that s probably why they changed in little ways over time he added i try to be consistent in their personalities but i also think that none of us is ever really consistent in the things that we do and say he said we all have our little good points and bad points this is what the characters have and while the universe he created lives on schulz was very clear that he didn t want anyone reviving peanuts after him his syndicate contract stipulated that when he stopped drawing the strip would stop schulz himself told fresh air that his children were the ones who insisted on that clause because they said we don t want anybody else drawing dad s strip peanuts worldwide llc peanuts worldwide llc after his colon cancer diagnosis schulz announced in december 1999 that he would stop drawing new peanuts cartoons and that the last strips would run in the new year he died in february 2000 the night before the final sunday strip published i hope that no one else ever touches the strip because the strip is me he said so while plenty of artists may have wanted to fill schulz s shoes jeannie says the peanuts cartoons that people herself included see in newspapers today are all reruns and what amazes me is that it s still funny she says you still want to read it right now snoopy s going to needles or somewhere to find spike and it s just funny she said that many people remember being comforted by the peanuts crew as kids like running home from school to shut themselves in their room with the paperbacks and still seek comfort in them now huntsinger agrees sfipt schulz museum sfipt schulz museum schulz in the 1990s we ve been listening to so many people talk around the centennial and one of the cartoonists said you know people are trying to sell us things all the time like you re supposed to be happy you re supposed to do this and charles schulz sort of said it like it was so people were like yeah i get these characters i feel a part of this they speak to me the interviews for this story were conducted by a martínez produced by taylor haney and edited by hj mai copyright 2022 npr to

research survey found that the percentage of adults who said they ever use twitter skews young with 42 percent of 18 to 29 year olds and 37 percent of 30 to 49 year olds having experienced the platform compared to smaller shares of older demographics a quarter of men and slightly more than a fifth of women said they had ever used the platform meanwhile a slightly greater share of adults identifying as black only 29 percent had used it compared to 22 percent who identified as white only and 23 percent who identified as hispanic those who used the platform for news rather than just for entertainment or other purposes were more likely to be democrats college educated and relatively young pew found only 8 percent of those who used twitter as a source of news said it was their most important way of keeping up with news but 63 percent of twitter news consumers said they sometimes or often encountered stories on the site that they wouldn t have come across elsewhere and about 70 percent said they used twitter to follow live news events twitter has traditionally displayed blue checkmarks on accounts where users passed a verification process and the company had confirmed the accounts to be authentic notable and active on nov 9 users lost the ability to apply for verification but anyone who d already completed the process retained their blue checkmarks the icons were then only newly awarded to people who purchased them through a 7 99 month subscription service called twitter blue this has led to confusion in distinguishing between verified accounts and those belonging to twitter blue subscribers who are posing under someone else s name because both will display blue checkmarks there is a reality now that someone could buy a blue checkmark and then they could suddenly say they are a government agency telling you to evacuate for instance the washington emergency management division tweeted so even a blue checkmark might not mean what it used to mean you might want to take other steps to confirm the author columnist with sen ed markey s permission created a twitter blue account impersonating the senator in a few minutes another well publicized example saw insulin maker eli lilly s stocks drop following a tweet from a twitter blue account masquerading as the company the washington emergency management division advised users to vet accounts for themselves by checking that they link to official websites and googling for the entities names plus twitter which is likely to turn up the real twitter account the division also recommended checking the account s age the older the more likely it s real and its followers governments often follow each other as fake accounts proliferated twitter explored offering a separate gray official label for

santa cruz calif ap netflix s trailblazing dvd by mail rental service has been relegated as a relic in the age of video streaming but there is still a steady albeit shrinking audience of diehards like amanda konkle who are happily paying to receive those discs in the iconic red and white envelopes when you open your mailbox it s still something you actually want instead of just bills said konkle a resident of savannah georgia who has been subscribing to netflix s dvd by mail service since 2005 it s a small pleasure that konkle and other still dedicated dvd subscribers enjoy but it s not clear for how much longer netflix declined to comment for this story but during a 2018 media event co founder and co ceo of netflix reed hastings suggested the dvd by mail service might close around 2023 when not if it happens netflix will shut down a service that has shipped more than 5 billion discs across the u s since its inception nearly a quarter century ago and it will echo the downfall of the thousands of blockbuster video rental stores that closed because they couldn t counter the threat posed by netflix s dvd by mail alternative the eventual demise of its dvd by mail service has been inevitable since hastings decided to spin it off from a then nascent video streaming service in 2011 back then hastings floated the idea of renaming the service as qwikster a bungled idea that was so widely ridiculed that it was satirized on saturday night live it finally settled on its current more prosaic handle dvd com the operation is now based in non descript office in fremont california located about 20 miles from netflix s sleek campus in los gatos california shortly before breakup from video streaming the dvd by mail service boasted more than 16 million subscribers a number that has now dwindled to an estimated 1 5 million subscribers all in the u s based on calculations drawn from netflix s limited disclosures of the service in its quarterly reports netflix s video streaming service now boasts 223 million worldwide subscribers including 74 million in the u s and canada the dvd by mail business has bequeathed the netflix that everyone now knows and watches today marc randolph netflix s original ceo said during an interview at a coffee shop located across the street from the post office in santa cruz california the 110 year old post office has become a landmark in silicon valley history because it s where randolph mailed a patsy cline cd to hastings in 1997 to test whether a disc could be delivered through the u s postal service without being damaged the disc arrived at hastings home unblemished prompting the duo in 1998 to launch a dvd by mail rental website that they always knew would be supplanted by even more convenient technology it was planned obsolescence but our bet was that it would take longer for it to happen than most people thought at the time randolph said with netflix s successful streaming service it might be easy to assume that anyone still paying to receive dvds through the mail is a technophobe or someone living in a remote part of the u s without reliable internet access but subscribers say they stick with the service so they can rent movies that are otherwise difficult to find on streaming services for michael fusco 35 that includes the 1986 film power starring a then youthful richard gere and denzel washington and 1980 s the big red one starring lee marvin that s among the main reasons he has been subscribing to the dvd by service since 2006 when he was just a freshman in college and he has no plans to cancel it now i have been getting it for almost half my life and it has been a big part fusco said when i was young it helped me discover voices i probably wouldn t have heard i still have memories of getting movies and having them blow my mind tabetha neumann is among the subscribers who rediscovered the dvd service during the throes of the pandemic lockdowns in 2020 after running out of things to watch on her video streaming service so she and her husband signed up again for the first time since canceling in 2011 now they like it so much that they get the a plan that allows them to keep up to three discs at a time an option that currently costs 20 per month compared to 10 per month for the one disc plan when we started going through all the movies we wanted to see we realized it was cheaper than paying 5 per movie on some streaming services neumann said plus we have found a lot of old horror movies and that genre is not really big on streaming konkle who has written a book about marilyn monroe s films says she still finds movies on the dvd service such as the 1954 film cattle queen of montana featuring future u s president ronald reagan alongside barbara stanwyck and the 1983 french film sugar cane alley that help her teach her film studies classes as an associate professor at georgia southern university it s a viewing habit she doesn t usually share with her classes because most of my students don t know what a dvd is said konkle 40 laughing but for all the dvd service s attractions subscribers are starting to notice signs of deterioration as the business has shrunk from producing more than 1 billion in annual revenue a year ago to an amount likely to fall below 200 in revenue this year katie cardinale a subscriber who lives in hopedale massachusetts says she now has to wait an additional two to four days for discs to arrive in the mail than she used to because they are shipped from a distribution center in new jersey instead of boston netflix doesn t disclose how many dvd distribution centers still operate but there were once about 50 of them in the u s konkle says more discs now come with cracks or other defects in them and it takes forever to get them replaced and almost all subscribers have noticed the selection of dvd titles has shrunk dramatically from the service s peak years when netflix boasted it had more than 100 000 different movies and tv shows on disc netflix no longer discloses the size of its dvd library but the subscribers interviewed by the ap all reported the narrowing selection is making it more difficult to find famous films and popular tv series that once were routinely available on the service instead netflix now sorts requests for titles such as the first season of the award winning ted lasso series a release that can be purchased on dvd into a saved queue signaling it may decide to stock it in the future depending on demand knowing the end is in sight randolph said he will lament the death of the dvd service he brought to life while taking comfort its legacy will survive netflix s dvd business was part and parcel of who netflix was and still is he said it s embedded in the company s dna ___
lora conrad reviews nine useful resources for plant identification in iowa whether you are new to learning about iowa wildflowers and native shrubs and trees or have been studying them as a hobby for some years you are sure to see a plant or flower that you just can t identify before posting a question for the experts on your local wildflower or flora facebook page you might want to see what you can learn about the plant and determine yourself three types of resources are widely available plant identification applications for a smart phone public web pages from authoritative sources and books each source can be useful but not always sufficient the purpose of this article is to compare the reference books that have helped me most in identifying plants in the woodlands prairies waysides river banks and roadsides of iowa as well as in my untamed yard these are recommendations from a determined wildflower enthusiast not from a botanist so with that caveat please read on key factors describing the unknown first of all where in iowa is this plant growing if you are looking at a plant in southeast iowa that plant is likely found more widely in iowa and possibly in illinois or missouri or minnesota that is across the midwest iowa is entirely in the tall grass prairie area of pre european settlement despite having little prairie remaining now the references discussed here will address what is broadly useful in most of iowa though the author lives in southeastern iowa then in what habitat is the unknown plant growing woodlands prairie wetlands or disturbed ground like a yard or garden this factor can quickly narrow your book selection next are you seeking to identify a woody or non woody plant flower or fruit then when are you seeing this plant is it not blooming yet or when did you first see it blooming each flower has a season so the timing can be critical in identifying which plant you have for blooming non woody plants a close inspection of the flower can often define what you are looking for starting with color size and structure of blossoms blooming or not the leaf shape type and arrangement can be critical in plant identification woody plants are often separated by tree vs shrub or vine not by flower size and bark as well as flower fruit can be important for distinguishing these knowing your reference material is also important what region do the books cover what habitat how are the entries sequenced by bloom time flower color type of plant common name or botanical name growth habit or other criteria to use a book successfully you need to understand how it s organized references for non woody flowering plants the first book i d like to introduce to you is wildflowers of southeastern iowa volume 1 spring by don weiss don has photographed and recorded 180 different species in southeastern iowa most can be found throughout the state and even in neighboring states this volume published in early 2021 after about five years of research and photography covers those wildflowers found in southeastern iowa during the spring months of march april and may don included a full page photo of each often with an inset photo to add clarification along with a full page description of the plant flowers leaves and habitat the book also provides the plant family and the botanical name as well as where it can be found in iowa its abundance and whether the species is a u s and or iowa native volume 2 covering almost 200 species that begin blooming in june through september became available in june 2021 the entries in both volumes of wildflowers of southeastern iowa are sequenced alphabetically by common name within the month they first bloom in southeastern iowa together they cover more than 375 wildflower species now found in southeastern iowa and the surrounding area including many similar species rarities and uncommon wildflowers many introduced or naturalized flowers found in iowa are also included these two books are the most comprehensive available collection of photos and descriptions of blooming plants found in iowa they are also the most expensive of the books reviewed here both are in stock at burlington by the book contact chris at 319 753 9981 for the prices for a signed copy the books are typically priced between 68 and 99 per copy at this and other bookstores the standby reference books on wildflowers for iowans for many years now have been the three led by sylvan t runkel one of iowa s best known and well respected naturalists now in their second edition all remain authoritative and useful with improved photos and updates the one i use the most is wildflowers of iowa woodlands second edition by sylvan t runkel and alvin f bull 2009 this book was designed to help the casual observer become better acquainted with the more interesting wildflowers of the state s woodlands note it does not attempt to be comprehensive but covers the most interesting a total of 128 flowers the species are listed by approximate order of flowering time earliest to latest but but it does not say where in iowa the pages are titled with the common name but also show the botanical name though there is not a table of contents both names are conveniently listed in the index the photos in this edition are sharp clear and well printed thus very helpful for identification the second of the runkel books wildflowers and other plants of iowa wetlands 2014 was coauthored with dean m roosa the 149 entries cover all major wetland species in the state this book which has an excellent introduction to wetland botany is organized by habitat then by taxonomic group the sections are terrestrial flowering herbs ferns fern allies and lower vascular plants trees shrubs and vines and herbs growing in water the plants are listed alphabetically within those sections by common name the third book is wildflowers of the tall grass prairie university of iowa press sells new copies of all three books for 29 95 to 35 each the second editions of all have updated photos and additional technical information however many of the photos focus on the flowers without showing enough of the leaf or stem for help in identification if purchasing used copies be sure to verify which version you are getting edition 1 or 2 as the titles are the same the publication date and edition number are different my favorite prairie wildflower book is tallgrass prairie wildflowers by doug ladd with photos by frank oberle a nature conservancy book 1995 this book is available new from amazon for 49 99 but available on the used market via alibris for about 2 plus shipping i find this book so useful for several reasons first it includes a 25 page guide on how to use the book that may sound excessive but if you are a fairly new wildflower enthusiast it is essential even if you have been exploring for years it is still very helpful second i really appreciate that it is organized first by blossom color then by the sequence of bloom within color if a plant color is hard to determine as for species with multiple colors or a blossom that could be considered pink or purple then you may need to look at more than one section but most of the time this book s format allows the reader to sift through fewer pages when trying to identify a flower the book is intended as a guide to the common wildflowers of the tall grass prairie region which includes all of iowa the author points out that more than 900 flowering plant species are native to the tall grass prairie they have selected 295 of those prairie wildflowers primarily the most common and a few rare ones one half to one page is devoted to each species showing the plant s common name and botanical name along with a description habitat range notes and a color photo most but not all pictures include both the flower and enough of the leaves and plant structure to assist identification the index includes both common and botanical names now i d like to introduce you to a more narrowly focused plant identification jewel by teresa marrone common backyard weeds of the upper midwest 2017 it is available used or like new for about 10 from alibris or new for 14 95 or less from bookstores at first i was put off by the term weeds but i quickly realized this book s value it includes non woody commonly found plants that pop up by roadsides in gardens fields or other disturbed ground opportunistic perhaps troublesome plants we may encounter but not know each plant is identified as native or non native features plants range from the invasive garlic mustard to the much planted highly desirable common milkweed the book is organized by the plants growth pattern creeping upright vining or grassy and within each section by the color of its flower it is 215 pages long and only 5 7 inches but packed with useful information and good color photos of the plants and their flowers identifying plants by their fruit fruit develops much later than flowers so guides that focus on blossoms may not be helpful whether woody or non woody for fruit identification you can turn to another reference by teresa marrone llinois iowa and missouri wild berries and fruits 2010 the glue binding of the cover may be weak on this little book but then it is ten years old already it is available new from bookstores for between 12 and 14 95 this book can be quite the asset in plant identification when you are not sure about that little blue berry you just sampled and there are no blossoms to help you identify it with 284 entries this book devotes two pages each to various wild plants with berries or other fruits edibility habitat growth leaves fruit and season are given coded at the top of each entry is type of plant leaf style where it grows an amazing amount of useful information in compact form the author has provided an excellent guide on how to use the book the photos include both the fruit and the leaves sometimes with insets to show various ripening stages it is conveniently sequenced by the color of the fruit identifying woody plants to identify the woody shrubs and vines you find blooming in forested areas and along roadsides and fence rows an indispensable resource is shrubs and woody vines of indiana and the midwest 2012 by sally weeks and harmon weeks jr it is available new from bookstores for between 36 and 45 per copy it focuses on the identification wildlife uses and landscaping value of shrubs and woody vines shrubs are defined as a woody plant with multiple stems from a common base that grows no taller than 20 feet though a few exceptions are included it is organized by native shrubs subdivided as to conifers then broadleaf native vines introduced shrubs then introduced vines three identification keys have been developed summer keys winter keys and species keys with an explanation of how to use them this large book has 463 pages with two pages of detailed information and several photos devoted to each shrub or vine the photos include the plant flowers fruit leaves and bark in most cases a county level map shows where in the midwest the plant is found to identify trees the iowa standard is forest and shade trees of iowa third edition by peter j van der linden and donald r farrar 2011 this is a bur oak guide and is available from the university of iowa press for 34 95 this book has 436 pages of tree identification information with summer and winter keys and an outstanding lead in article though it is the best available for iowa i am disappointed in its limited number of entire tree and bark photos and only occasional color foliage photos the leaf and fruit photos are very useful though the separate section on flowering trees is confusing because most of the photos for identifying them are not there but in the description of tree species section final thoughts these books are certainly not the only ones you might find valuable especially if you live in western iowa i also use other books on occasion however the titles discussed here in combination with online resources cover most of my plant identification needs i hope you find these reviews and comparisons helpful

nato running low on weapons for ukraine as 20 of its members are pretty tapped out nato running low on weapons for ukraine as 20 of its members are pretty tapped out sputnik international the us and its nato allies are struggling to assemble enough weapons to arm the kiev regime as their own stockpiles are being depleted 2022 11 27t06 27 0000 2022 11 27t06 27 0000 2022 11 27t08 54 0000 world nato ukraine russia howitzers javelin jens stoltenberg the us and its nato allies are finding it increasingly difficult to assemble enough weapons to arm the kiev regime while topping up their own diminishing stockpiles according to sources cited by a us media report the alliance of western countries intent on continuing to funnel military and financial assistance to ukraine is beginning to run low on weapons for this purpose as washington and its nato allies persist in fanning the flames of the ukraine conflagration this dogged policy is increasingly devouring the modest stockpiles of artillery ammunition and air defenses of some of europe s more modest armies thus smaller member states of the north atlantic treaty organization have already exhausted their potential and 20 of the alliance s 30 members are at present pretty tapped out a nato official was cited as saying the remaining 10 including germany france italy and the netherlands are allegedly still in a position to provide more military assistance for ukraine resupply maintenance challengesthere are a myriad problems facing the western coalition providing weapons support for ukraine washington albeit the self appointed ringleader of this assistance has but limited stocks of the kind of weapons the ukrainians need the media report said loath to divert critical weapons from regions such as taiwan and korea and as stockpiles of costly air defense missiles and anti tank javelins sent to ukraine fade the us has reportedly been scrambling to find soviet era equipment and ammunition for ukraine this refers to s 300 air defense missiles t 72 tanks and soviet caliber artillery shells the problem with shells is becoming particularly pressing as the ukrainian side is using a staggering amount of ammunition according to cited nato officials recalling how many artillery rounds were fired daily by nato forces in afghanistan for example camille grand a defense expert at the european council on foreign relations was cited as saying that a day in ukraine is a month or more in afghanistan the united states produces only 15 000 artillery rounds each month stated the sources pointing out that western defense industries were being warned to get set for much longer term contracts furthermore there is ostensibly chatter about employing more shifts of workers and sprucing up older factory lines ammunition purchases from countries such as south korea are also allegedly being looked at to backfill stocks hollowed out because of the ukraine conflict nato is even believed to be mulling investing in some old factories located in slovakia bulgaria and the czech republic to launch the production of soviet caliber 152mm and 122mm shells for ukraine as the latter still relies to a great degree on artillery armory dating back to the soviet era furthermore nato countries have delivered advanced western artillery to ukraine that utilizes the alliance s standard 155mm shells but as other nato countries frequently make the shells differently these systems are often incompatible the us stockpiles of 155mm artillery rounds had purportedly been dwindling as of september with the numbers of guided rockets rocket launchers howitzers javelins and stingers also limited an earlier report had stated that maintenance of the armaments was becoming a problem as no less than a third of the estimated 350 western made howitzers supplied to kiev were out of action at a given moment because of wear and tear export controls were another hurdle the report highlighted as some of the countries have legal restrictions on selling guns and ammunition to a country intending to deliver them to another one which is engaged in a conflict describing the plethora of diverse systems that the western countries have been channeling into ukraine one alliance official wryly called it nato s petting zoo in reference to the animal names used for weapons such as the german gepard cheetah 35mm self propelled anti aircraft gun mechanism or the french crotale rattlesnake air defense system the mixed bag as the source put it makes both resupply and maintenance a challenging business the alliance has failed to work on creating weapons that could be used interchangeably by nato countries added insiders overall nato countries have provided an estimated 40bln of weaponry to ukraine the report added almost equal to france s entire annual defense budget for example incidentally paris is cited as being reluctant to provide more to ukraine after giving it about 20 percent of all its existing artillery in the form of 18 modern caesar howitzers and yet nato s secretary general jens stoltenberg has been openly haranguing reluctant alliance members reminding them that despite the bloc s guidelines requiring members to maintain stockpiles their depletion is no excuse to limit arms exports to ukraine russia began its special military operation on 24 february responding to calls for help from the breakaway people s republics of donetsk and lugansk amid intensified aggression from the kiev regime western countries responded by imposing sweeping sanctions against moscow and ramping up their military support for kiev moscow has consistently pointed out that assisting kiev is only drawing out the conflict and could cause further conflagration as nato risks being drawn fully into the conflict furthermore there have been reports of us weaponry bound for ukraine often vanishing only to resurface on the black market ukraine russia sputnik international feedback sputniknews com

remote part of the u s without reliable internet access but subscribers say they stick with the service so they can rent movies that are otherwise difficult to find on streaming services christmas movies for kids a guide to 100 family films to stream this holiday season holiday deals you can get hbo max for 1 99 month for three months with this early black friday markdown for michael fusco 35 that includes the 1986 film power starring a then youthful richard gere and denzel washington and 1980 s the big red one starring lee marvin that s among the main reasons he has been subscribing to the dvd by service since 2006 when he was just a freshman in college and he has no plans to cancel it now i have been getting it for almost half my life and it has been a big part fusco said when i was young it helped me discover voices i probably wouldn t have heard i still have memories of getting movies and having them blow my mind tabetha neumann is among the subscribers who rediscovered the dvd service during the throes of the pandemic lockdowns in 2020 after running out of things to watch on her video streaming service so she and her husband signed up again for the first time since canceling in 2011 now they like it so much that they get a plan that allows them to keep up to three discs at a time an option that currently costs 20 per month compared to 10 per month for the one disc plan when we started going through all the movies we wanted to see we realized it was cheaper than paying 5 per movie on some streaming services neumann said plus we have found a lot of old horror movies and that genre is not really big on streaming konkle who has written a book about marilyn monroe s films says she still finds movies on the dvd service such as the 1954 film cattle queen of montana featuring future u s president ronald reagan alongside barbara stanwyck and the 1983 french film sugar cane alley that help her teach her film studies classes as an associate professor at georgia southern university it s a viewing habit she doesn t usually share with her classes because most of my students don t know what a dvd is said konkle 40 laughing but for all the dvd service s attractions subscribers are starting to notice signs of deterioration as the business has shrunk from producing more than 1 billion in annual revenue a year ago to an amount likely to fall below 200 million in revenue this year katie cardinale a subscriber who lives in hopedale massachusetts says she now has to wait an additional two to four days for discs to arrive in the mail than she used to because they are shipped from a distribution center in new jersey instead of boston netflix doesn t disclose how many dvd distribution centers still operate but there were once about 50 of them in the u s konkle says more discs now come with cracks or other defects in them and it takes forever to get them replaced and almost all subscribers have noticed the selection of dvd titles has shrunk dramatically from the service s peak years when netflix boasted it had more than 100 000 different movies and tv shows on disc what does netflix offer on dvd netflix no longer discloses the size of its dvd library but the subscribers interviewed by the ap all reported the narrowing selection is making it more difficult to find famous films and popular tv series that once were routinely available on the service instead netflix now sorts requests for titles such as the first season of the award winning ted lasso series a release that can be purchased on dvd into a saved queue signaling it may decide to stock it in the future depending on demand knowing the end is in sight randolph said he will lament the death of the dvd service he brought to life while taking comfort its legacy will survive netflix s dvd business was part and parcel of who netflix was and still is he said it s embedded in the company s dna
