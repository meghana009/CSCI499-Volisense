apple inc began the new year by revealing it would miss a quarterly revenue target for the first time since 2002 but consumers and investors heard much more than that there was the sound of the curtain falling on two of the growth stories of the past decade smartphones and china then came the din of second guesses to apple s strategy of consistently raising prices and finally came the worries that nothing as profitable as the rise of mobile computing has been for investors over the past decade will soon emerge to succeed it where is that next spark that will light us all up kara swisher technology journalist asked in a new york times column friday apple late wednesday said revenue for the last three months of 2018 missed expectations chiefly due to weakness in china the effect of the statement rippled more than most corporate warnings because apple s products are so ubiquitous its connections to other companies so broad its stock so valuable and trouble real trouble for the company so rare in minnesota apple s announcement reverberated in share drops of maplewood based 3m co the diversified manufacturer that sells many products in china and provides materials in smartphones and richfield based best buy co the nation s largest electronics retailer and top seller of apple products shares in both recovered in a broad market rally friday and two of the most prolific and closely followed analysts of apple gene munster of loup ventures and piper jaffray s mike olson both from minneapolis went into overdrive trying to assess what it all meant in interviews both said the company is at a crossroad and so are investors but their reasons varied shedding light on the broader debate around apple munster who became known nationally in the early 2000s when as a piper jaffray analyst he made an early call on apple s hypergrowth said the reaction to last week s warning showed that the future of apple s stock hinges on the company s ability to lead the way on another next big thing as it did when computing shifted to mobile devices a decade ago investors don t value earnings they value revenue growth munster said the question is does apple take an approach of investing more in growth olson said he thinks investors in most tech companies care more about revenue than growth but that apple s investors balance them out for him the company s revenue warning signified a slip in the company s ability to execute the real concern for many investors is that the company has lost its ability to provide the right products in the right markets at the right time and that apple management has lower visibility into the company s future performance than what it had historically he said apple shares fell 10 percent thursday their steepest one day drop since 2013 the company in august became the first u s firm to have a market value of 1 trillion but its shares started to fall after reaching an all time high in early october as investors began to get nervous about whether new iphones would meet prior year sales levels the shares closed friday 37 percent below the october peak for several weeks news from apple suppliers in taiwan and elsewhere hinted that iphone sales would not live up to expectations its warning confirmed those reports and zeroed in on china the company s third largest market after the americas and europe china has been the world s largest market for cellphones for more than a decade and in a sign of its rising wealth the country s consumers upgraded to smartphones nearly as quickly as those in more developed markets but sales of smartphones have leveled off there as well as globally where unit shipments have hovered around 1 4 billion since 2015 and actually fell in 2017 and likely in 2018 as well with the pace of new features in smartphones slowing down consumers are hanging on to them longer apple s response to that development has been to raise prices in hopes of preserving revenue but last week s announcement showed that strategy may not be working in china where it competes with several domestic producers like huawei and xiaomi that offer comparable phones at lower prices like many analysts olson lowered his price target on apple s stock for munster the timing of apple s announcement couldn t have been worse it came just days after he made several predictions for the tech sector in 2019 including one that apple s stock would outperform the other u s tech giants google amazon facebook and netflix we re still standing behind that though this is not how i wanted the year to start out he said he said he believes that apple s fundamental drive to sell several technology devices to consumers and then deliver services on top won t change but he is waiting to see whether executives signal bigger spending in three areas of potentially large growth entertainment content wearable devices and automobiles while the growth bet is up in the air he said apple is on the verge of offering a service that has long been a feature of other industries where products are expensive financing they re going to make it easier for people to purchase their products on a subscription basis munster said i think you ll see news out in the next year around that

in june when he got his first job out of college nick studenski did what most americans are told to do he started saving for retirement the 23 year old from eagan invested heavily in his company s 401 k plan and on the advice of his dad contributed additional money to an individual retirement account in a few months studenski set aside more than 5 000 of his salary in a few weeks more than 20 percent of that money disappeared the dip in share prices and volatility that fueled the worst annual stock market performance in a decade have left tens of millions of investors like studenski shaken if not scared across minnesota and the nation working people have spent several months watching helplessly as big chunks of their investment savings roil in a stew of rising interest rates trade war fears and concern about how long the economy will stay healthy i know people say you don t pull out when it s bad said studenski an economics major with a master s in data analytics but it s tough to stomach logging into your account and seeing it keep going down like many americans studenski has entrusted his investments to mutual fund managers he is not planning to withdraw all his money from the market although he has cut back what he is putting in but like most americans he simply wishes that things would calm down the world of finance and the world at large just seems unhinged he said for investment strategist jim paulsen of the leuthold group in minneapolis panic marked the last two weeks of 2018 trading but people like paulsen see panic as a reason to hunt for bargains not bail out if you sell on panic and buy on optimism you re never going to get ahead paulsen said i would suggest that the average investor not do a lot keep putting the maximum amount in retirement plans that have an employer match he advised what will determine the trend from the current market madness is whether the country goes into a recession analysts say personally said paulsen i don t think we re going to have a recession the normal signs aren t there according to paulsen the great recession of 2008 2012 scared people enough to curtail risky financial behavior instead americans saved money and built household worth the ratio of financial obligations to disposable income is going down not up the federal reserve reports u s labor department statistics show that american employers added a robust 312 000 jobs in december with wages on the rise still as china s economy slows and a tariff war between china and the united states continues some analysts are not as optimistic that the economy is recession proof financial pros have warned for months that after years of strong growth the stock market was due for a correction a fall of at least 20 percent but the recent swings exacerbated by a trade war a ballooning federal deficit and domestic political warfare including a partial government shutdown strain the system and stress those invested in it a commentator on the cnbc business channel described the market as sick with sales of apple iphones down in china and with the company slashing revenue predictions the dow jones industrial average slipped 660 points thursday it bounced back friday based on the strong jobs report and reassurance from the chairman of the federal reserve university of minnesota finance prof rick nelson recalled an adage in looking at the market upheavals in the short term the market reflects expectations in the long term it reflects the actual growth of companies americans are apt to overlook past gains in the face of current losses he said since the end of the great recession the stock market has grown considerably the standard poor s market index was down only about 4 percent in 2018 if you factored in dividends paid to shareholders that same index dropped 37 percent in 2008 nelson said what have people lost since 2015 he asked they haven t lost anything they have made a lot of money the timing of this downturn still matters to those who are about to retire and counting on investment income he continued but the real story is volatility driven by concerns about corporate and government debt whether corporate tax cuts generate one time gains or ongoing benefits and uncertainty about global growth and trade relations with china are by far the biggest factor in the stock market s duress according to russell price chief economist of minnesota based ameriprise financial price says the united states needed to deal with chinese theft of american intellectual property and unfair trade practices but trump s strategy of protective tariffs on china the world s second largest economy and other major trading partners has taken a toll on some u s businesses raising costs and cutting sales on thursday minnesota based agricultural giant cargill reported a double digit dip in profits for the second quarter of its fiscal 2019 compared to 2018 the drop was attributable in part to trade issues in china the greatest risk the trade war poses to the stock market said price is if it dismantles globalization and disrupts international supply chains that s not what americans signed up for when they agreed to contribute significant portions of their pay to market based savings plans nor did they sign up for a market regularly spooked by white house tweets many young investors were teenagers during the great recession which dealt an economic gut punch to their parents and left behind lessons not soon unlearned when they started earning paychecks of their own it made people like amanda schibline 28 cautious about investing a depressing realization greeted her friday when she checked her retirement account and saw it had dropped 13 percent in recent months i was expecting 3 to 5 percent but not double digits said schibline a minneapolis energy efficiency consultant others say the recession taught them not to sweat market gyrations sarah robinson 27 who works at the minneapolis tech company when i work has been stashing 10 percent of her salary in her 401 k and frankly isn t sure how much value it s lost i know what goes down comes back up and vice versa coming through the recession i saw that she said i try not to get too rattled it can still be a jarring lesson for young professionals who ve become used to seeing their retirement accounts climb when st paul resident lauren tott 25 checked her 401 k at thanksgiving it sat at 15 000 evidence of her careful savings since college it had dipped to 13 900 when she last looked two weeks ago that s a huge drop said tott who works in admissions at capella university in minneapolis it has been a little nerve racking the wild swings spurred her to step back her 401 k savings rate from 8 to 6 percent while still maxing out her employer match like others new to investing tott is leaning on parental advice to avoid obsessing over month to month changes it s not about the short term payoff tott said it s the long term bill stevens of stevens foster financial advisors works with many ceos at his bloomington financial planning business he has counseled them to be calm and patient as they wait for the eventual recovery he fully expects this is not a market based on fundamentals he said this is a market based on fear of trade policies and tweeting the fundamentals are ok people are afraid of what more craziness can happen stevens remembers october 1987 when the dow crashed nearly 23 percent in a single day it came back by december but stevens harbors few hopes of such a quick fix in 2019 for studenski similar doubts have him stashing money in the bank now rather than his 401 k and ira i ve certainly lost confidence that putting money into a mutual fund he said is the best way to save jim spencer

house democrats voted to approve part of its new rules package thursday evening sending a message about ethics sexual harassment and good government on their first day back in the majority a signal of how they intend to target president donald trump in the coming session as part of a routine resolution laying out the protocols for how the house will operate the rules package outlines sexual harassment guidelines says that lawmakers who have been indicted for serious crimes should resign from committee and leadership roles and bars lawmakers and staffers from serving on corporate boards among other things in her opening remarks house speaker nancy pelosi said that an upcoming legislative package of ethics reforms would restore integrity to government so that people can have confidence that government works for the public interest not the special interests advertisement advertisement the vote comes as democrats begin oversight of everything from white house security clearances to the child separation policy at the border and continue investigations into the 2016 election and potential conflicts of interest related to trump s businesses but with the trump administration facing an unusually high number of scandals democrats see an opening to differentiate themselves matt glassman a senior fellow at georgetown university s government affairs institute said that things like the house rules with key ethics components will be one of the ways democrats are actually able to get that message out given that it s going to be difficult for them to pass legislation just controlling the house and not the senate or the presidency they really want to sharpen their message over the next two years he told time the message being that the trump administration and the republicans are corrupt and there s also ethics violations so we re cleaning up the house of representatives first because that s what we have to do and we re going to try and clean up the executive branch through oversight of the departments and then you should vote for us in 2020 because then we ll have the power to control the government and clean it up in total advertisement advertisement talking points circulated by the national republican congressional committee indicated that the rules package would prove tricky for the gop since republicans largely voted against the rules package that meant they might face tough questions about voting against a rule to allow the speaker to intervene in a legal case on pre existing conditions a rule that would ban discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity and a rule barring sexual relationships between lawmakers and staffers of committees on which they serve among other red flags highlighted in an email to gop lawmakers acquired by time the email suggested that republicans counter by noting that the rules also reinstated a rule that automatically raises the debt ceiling when the house passes a budget and removed budget offset requirements which the gop says would make it easier to raise taxes and increase spending some of the rules are set to bring the house of representatives up to standards the senate already enforces one of which is the ban on corporate board membership sen sherrod brown advocated in favor of the proposed house rule via twitter on wednesday in a follow up statement to time the ohio democrat currently mulling a 2020 presidential campaign said legislators should not be using their statuses for personal gain advertisement advertisement members of congress are serving the american people not their stock portfolios he said after multiple scandals in which members of congress have been found buying and selling stocks in certain industries it s time for more accountability and transparency the rules aren t necessarily binding however one proposed guideline would require members to be given 72 hours to review significant bills before voting on them but glassman says that can end up being waived if a time sensitive bill needs to get to the floor given the lack of staying power bruce oppenheimer a professor of public policy at vanderbilt university also argued some of the rules are simply symbolic of democratic intent advertisement advertisement it does sort of point a finger at the executive branch and all the various if not conflicts of interest or ethical violations things which or probably were not tolerated in previous administrations he told time so i think it sets a standard and says if we re willing to clean house maybe you should be willing to clean house or put some onus on the executive branch but even if you can t get everything you want accomplished glassman argues you have to start somewhere tightening ethics rules a little bit for 435 members of the house isn t like changing the world he said but i think a lot of times the best political messaging on the hill is this lead by example messaging

the internet has revolutionised the way people invest no longer beholden to financial advisers or to investment companies investors can now put their own portfolios together easy if done through an online investment platform where at the click of a button and the entry of a password or two they can review their investments under one umbrella indeed they can log in to their account and buy or sell holdings in a couple of minutes the emergence of the do it yourself investor is welcome but such emancipation is not without its dangers constructing an appropriate portfolio from the mass thousands of investment funds available can prove a daunting exercise diy investing most investment platforms have put together lists of best in class funds most investment platforms have recognised this problem by putting together lists of best in class funds that investors can use to find ideas but how good are these here we rate those who rate investment funds ii co uk 4 stars out of 5 interactive investor has just launched its super 60 a list of 60 high quality investments spanning funds investment trusts and low cost exchange traded funds it says funds are rigorously appraised before getting on to its list they must offer value for money in terms of charges and in the case of active managers have a proven record of delivering superior returns compared to their peers in the case of funds that track the performance of a specific market they must demonstrate little deviation from the index tracked an internal committee of investment experts then boils down the selections 260 to 60 what interactive investor says moira o neill head of personal finance says the list is designed to offer a selection of investments appropriate for all investors whether they are new to investing or experienced our objective is to provide a menu of high quality choices across a variety of markets and investment types what we say this list is inclusive because it embraces investment trusts and exchange traded funds this makes great sense in specialist investment areas such as commercial property where an investment trust is more investor friendly in times of sliding property prices funds are categorised by sector with each given a description core adventurous income low cost and smaller cap each super 60 choice is backed by performance data and comparative data with peers

platform an online way to manage an investment portfolio fidelity provides a 50 strong list of select fund choices that includes nine own branded investment funds the list compiled using a mix of quantitative and qualitative criteria is put together by the investment manager s multi asset investment team that claims it is expert in this field the choices are reviewed every six months although investment funds can be removed from the select list at any time three funds were removed last july its list contains well established funds such as lindsell train uk equity baillie gifford japanese and fidelity special situations there are also lesser known funds such as maple brown abbott asia pacific excluding japan as well as funds with a variety of investment strategies absolute return gold investing in german equities what fidelity says for many investors there is a tyranny of fund choice select 50 is our answer to this dilemma it does not claim funds will be the best performers but rather that they exhibit the characteristics that are likely to lead to good investment outcomes over time what we say the list is succinct information on each fund is to the point and charges including any discounts fidelity has managed to extract are transparent investors can look at supporting performance graphs and are given the star rating awarded by fund scrutineer morningstar one drawback is that the selected funds do not include any stock market listed investment trusts fidelity says it would not rule out investment trusts if there was sufficient customer demand there is also only one passive fund a property trust the presence of nine fidelity funds on the select 50 could be interpreted as a form of nepotism one nice touch is that investors can get broad exposure to select 50 by investing in the select 50 balanced fund it has at least 80 per cent of its assets invested in funds on the list fundcalibre com 3 stars out of 5 unlike rivals fundcalibre is a fund ratings website only it does not provide a facility for investors to build a portfolio its objective is to provide a truly independent source of information to the public that they can trust more than 160 funds including a dozen investment trusts have earned fundcalibre s elite badge to get this award a fund must pass its quantitative test which seeks to identify fund manager skill fundcalibre also identifies radar funds these are usually newish investment funds which do not have a long enough performance record to merit an elite rating what fundcalibre says in a world of self directed investors we provide help and guidance our ratings are not infallible but on average should give investors a head start what we say fundcalibre s analysis of individually rated funds is well presented it includes a pithy description of why the fund is liked and the individual and investment company behind it all the key facts including charges are provided plus a clock indicating the fund s riskiness fundexpert co uk 4 stars out of 5 fundexpert is alone in charging for fund ratings the fee is 1 in the first month and then 29 20 a month for the next 11 with a promise of money back if investors do not feel they have received value for money once investors decide whether they are after income or growth and opt for their preferred asset allocation fundexpert will provide them with the three top fund selections in each of the sectors chosen it then prompts investors to review their holdings every six months to see whether they are still fit for purpose or if better funds are available investors can also apply stop losses which means funds are automatically sold if they fall below an agreed price what fundexpert says brian dennehy managing director says the fund rating services i encountered in the past were lacking to say the least we have come up with a process that is underpinned by objectivity and clarity and so far has generated extra investment return i don t know whether it is better than anyone else s but i have yet to find anyone else who matches our criteria for identifying top rated funds what we say fundexpert s analysis involving the rating of 3 500 funds across 35 sectors each month is meticulous and methodical it is also robotic some may baulk at its price while others may be disappointed that investment trusts do not get a look in bestinvest co uk 3 stars out of 5 bestinvest is best known for its spot the dog analysis highlighting investment funds that are not performing up to scratch but it also publishes a half yearly top rated funds report funds that get included must achieve a minimum three out of five star rating some 100 funds passed muster last time around including both active and index tracking funds a research team of 30 analyse individual funds a big emphasis is placed on meeting investment managers to get a clear idea of their investment approach although the report is published every six months funds are added or removed throughout the year with investors informed via bestinvest s website what bestinvest says jason hollands a director of wealth manager tilney that owns bestinvest says providing clients with details of those funds we rate highly helps them navigate the huge amount of choice out there the strength and integrity of a top rated fund list depends on what process stands behind it ours is rigorous what we say bestinvest s top rated funds report is slickly put together as a result it reads more like a marketing tool than a rigorous fund research document nice touches are details of both

might be moving too fast in raising borrowing costs said phil orlando chief equity market strategist at federated investors the fed s interest rate and bond portfolio policies were at the top of the list of things we were concerned about which is why the statement powell made today is so supportive of the market orlando said the fed understands that what they attempted to communicate last month

washington in 2017 nearly everything investors touched made money major stock indexes were up about 20 percent or more bonds turned in another solid year of gains and the housing market was sizzling with median home prices in southern california up 8 2 percent from a year earlier to top the bubble era high reached in 2007 and 2018 was looking to be even more promising after all big new tax cuts kicked in on jan 1 and were supposed to provide what president trump called rocket fuel for the u s economy analysts expected that would help push an already soaring stock market to new heights instead 2018 was a dud for investors across the board all the four major u s stock indexes declined at least 4 6 percent and finished with negative annual returns for the first time since 2008 and the poor performance was broad based nine of the 11 sectors in the benchmark standard poor s 500 index were in the red as interest rates rose bond returns fell with one benchmark fund down about 3 percent gold didn t fare much better and don t talk about bitcoin the cryptocurrency whose value plummeted by nearly three fourths even residential real estate markets have slowed and in some parts of the country gone into decline for the first time in years the best annual returns came from keeping your money in cold hard cash and holding it in savings accounts money market funds or certificates of deposit that have seen their interest rates rise from rock bottom levels just stuffing cash in the mattress where its buying power eroded by the approximately 2 percent annual inflation rate would have beaten the 7 percent loss incurred this year from a fund tied to the s p 500 the long bull market now is close to the slaughterhouse the year ended with wild weeks of financial market volatility triggered by worries about the u s china trade war a slowing global economy unforced errors by the trump administration the turnover of the house majority to democrats a partial federal government shutdown and worries about a u s recession if you go back to last december shortly after the tax package was passed people looking ahead to 2018 felt universally bullish said patrick schaffer a global investment specialist at jp morgan private bank in los angeles now at the end of 2018 looking ahead to 2019 there are very few reasons to be optimistic he said wall street is close to a bear market defined as a sustained decline of at least 20 percent from recent highs that often is a precursor of a recession economists said the risk of a recession in the next couple of years is rising as the recovery from the great recession is 9½ years old the second longest in u s history but just as 2018 didn t turn out as anticipated next year also could provide surprises a full fledged bear market might not develop in 2019 analysts said and the big stock declines at year end pushed major indexes lower than warranted by still solid corporate earnings and economic conditions opening the door for gains next year the estimated price to earnings ratio for s p 500 companies over the next 12 months a key gauge of stock valuations has declined in recent months and now is just below the 10 year average the major u s stock indexes ended the year a far cry from the records they hit in the late summer and early fall the dow jones industrial average has declined 14 percent from its oct 3 all time high while the s p 500 has fallen 15 percent from the record level it hit less than two weeks earlier the technology focused nasdaq composite is teetering near bear market territory down 19 percent from its aug 29 record close as big silicon valley names such as apple inc and facebook inc saw their share prices battered over the last few months all three of those indexes are officially in a correction which is a decline of at least 10 percent from a recent high the russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks is already in a bear market off 23 percent from the all time high it reached on aug 31 much of the stock market s problems have emanated from washington where trump s policies and erratic style have fueled investor concerns about the economy trade relations with china and the cherished ability of fed officials to make monetary policy decisions independent of political ramifications the biggest single problem for the stock market is the president ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics wrote in a research note last thursday stocks had a fantastic 2017 the dow gained 25 1 percent the s p 500 was up 19 4 percent and the nasdaq soared 28 2 percent trump made sure everyone knew about it frequently touting the gains on twitter and in speeches the stock market is smashing one record after another and has added more than 7 trillion in new wealth since my election trump boasted in january to corporate and political leaders at the annual world economic forum gathering in davos switzerland but trouble was brewing on wall street the republican tax cuts which included slashing the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent were a rare injection of fiscal stimulus into a solid economy already at full employment then trump signed a two year budget bill that added even more stimulus by boosting spending about 400 billion more than planned those moves raised fears the economy would grow too fast while also increasing the already large federal budget deficit they led the fed to raise interest rates more quickly than anticipated to head off high inflation stock prices turned negative in february after never dropping 1 000 points in a trading session in its 122 year history the dow plunged that much twice in four days the dow s p 500 and nasdaq all saw declines of about 10 percent from highs they had reached just days before then in march trump launched a trade war with china by unveiling the first of a series of tariffs on imports from there china responded with its own retaliatory tariffs on u s goods still after a volatile february and march investors calmed down stocks climbed to new record highs through the spring and summer as washington and beijing worked to resolve their differences but as autumn set in so did investors jitters trump was publicly criticizing his hand picked fed chairman jerome h powell for the central bank s interest rate hikes the china trade dispute escalated and economic growth in the united states and abroad began slowing the democratic takeover of the house in the november midterm elections raised the prospect of more washington dysfunction with a divided government those concerns played out this month with a partial federal government shutdown after democrats balked at trump s demand for 5 billion to build a border wall with mexico he had promised repeatedly during his 2016 campaign that mexico would pay for the wall i think that the showdown over funding for the border wall is just an example of what we might expect in 2019 with this congress as we head into a national election in 2020 said michael arone chief investment strategist at asset manager state street global advisors this bipartisan bickering is raising concerns about whether a divided government can handle important issues it s looking less and less likely he called the resulting effects on stock prices the discord discount the fed has been undaunted in its efforts to stay above the discord and bring interest rates back to normal after holding them down for years and buying financial assets to boost the economy during and after the great recession the tax cuts boosted u s economic growth to a strong 4 2 percent annual pace in the second quarter of the year but that could be the high point of the stimulus growth slowed to a 3 4 percent annual rate in the third quarter and forecasts call for it to slip further to a still solid 2 5 percent in the fourth quarter fed officials this month forecast 2 3 percent growth next year another small fed rate hike on dec 19 freaked out investors as central bank officials indicated they would continue with their efforts to normalize monetary policy even as economic growth was slowing the week before christmas went down as the worst week for the dow since the 2008 financial crisis trump added to the turmoil with more unprecedented public criticism of the fed amid reports that he had discussed whether he could fire powell fed officials can only be fired for cause and most experts said a dispute over monetary policy probably would not fit that definition trump administration officials tried to tamp down the concerns declaring powell s job was safe and trump gave the stock market a vote of confidence on christmas day we have companies the greatest in the world and they re doing really well he told reporters so i think it s a tremendous opportunity to buy but as the partial government shutdown is set to extend into the new year investors should be prepared for more chaos if markets keep slipping the plunge could worsen significantly and consume the new year stocks have declined an average of 30 4 percent in bear markets since world war ii according to analysis by goldman sachs and cnbc those bear markets have lasted an average of 13 months and after hitting bottom it has taken an average of 21 9 months to recover the market tends to recover those bear market losses within a handful of years said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com a financial information website selling into a downturn is a strategy sure to be filled with regret fortunately keeping your money in cash isn t a bad move these days after years of low interest rates the average one year cd is paying 0 89 percent more than double what it did a year ago with the highest yield at 2 9 percent according to bankrate a year ago the best you could get on a one year cd was 2 percent money market and savings accounts are paying as high as 2 4 percent interest it s the first time in a decade that savers can actually earn a rate of return that s ahead of inflation mcbride said holding off on new investments also can leave people ready to pounce when opportunities develop schaffer said it s important for investors to think about having the ability to be more tactical which ultimately means you have to have some more liquidity to capitalize as prices swing too far one way or the other he said

millions of americans could face going without the benefit that allows them to purchase food if the government shutdown continues into february the supplemental nutrition assistance program known as snap or food stamps costs an average of around 4 8 billion per month according to the u s department of agriculture but because of the government shutdown the program has only 3 billion in emergency reserves for february more than 19 million households in the united states receive food stamps accounting for nearly 39 million people each household receives on average 245 28 per month but because of the shutdown usda has no money to pay for the program in the ensuing months the agency also had to furlough approximately 95 percent of food and nutrition services the office that oversees the snap program the white house and the usda did not respond to requests for comment about their plans to address the shortfall but experts say there is cause for concern for the millions potentially impacted if the 1 8 billion shortfall for february benefits were spread evenly across the 19 million households that receive snap benefits each would see a cut of about 90 per month for their overall grocery budget according to dottie rosenbaum a senior fellow at the center for budget and policy priorities cbpp if the political standoff that began dec 22 continued into march these households would receive no money to buy food even if the president and congress resolve the shutdown by february depending on the decisions the administration makes in the coming one to two weeks households could experience a substantial delay in receiving their full snap allotment for february because of the operational challenges that states and ebt contractors face rosenbaum said in an email robert powell is another american who might have a reason to worry although he doesn t use the benefits himself powell owns a grocery store called the town country market in atoka oklahoma a small town of about 3 000 people where the store has been a fixture since 1967 a fair amount of his customers use food stamps powell said later adding that these lost benefits could have a negative impact on his customers as well as his business there s going to be rioting in the streets when they cut the stamps off powell said get your timber ready businesses are a secondary victim if the shutdown causes the program to run out of cash the money spent by snap beneficiaries is typically split between small business owners like powell and major retailers like walmart tens of billions of dollars could be on the line for hundreds of thousands of businesses across the u s in fiscal year 2017 snap participants redeemed 63 billion in snap benefits for food purchases at about 260 000 retailers 80 percent of which were considered small businesses according to an april 2018 cbpp report the lost benefits would spread out to affect all retailers it would also impact supermarkets and big box stores where more than 80 percent of that 63 billion is spent the report found gary philbin enterprise president of dollar tree noted in an earnings conference call last year that the company s stock prices had been impacted by the more than 500 000 people removed from snap in 2016 considering the millions of people who would lose their consumer power without the benefits they depend on to buy food the shutdown could have a major impact on retailers especially those that serve low income populations if the government does not find a way to make up for the 1 8 billion loss in february that s a 1 8 billion loss across the whole country stacy dean the vice president for food assistance policy at cbpp explained but it will have a disproportionate impact on groceries and small businesses that serve poor communities where shoppers are more reliant on snap benefits and those communities often include some of the most vulnerable individuals as well such as veterans cbpp concluded in a separate report from november 2018 that the snap program is used in nearly 1 4 million households where veterans live thousands of veterans would be affected in every state of the country if these benefits were cut in an interview with nbc news rep karen bass d calif called the shutdown a distraction from issues that congress should be focused on and she noted that the ongoing divide between president trump and democrats could impact those who depend on food stamps if the shutdown continues then you will literally have millions of people that will not be able to afford food bass said and i think this is just absolutely unconscionable i think it s another example him the congresswoman added referring to the president either he literally doesn t understand or doesn t care

secretive short sellers are gearing up for a bumper 2019 after wiping 2 7billion off the value of british companies last year data compiled for the mail on sunday reveals five mysterious short selling firms have caused carnage with critical reports on firms they targeted and according to one exponent of the controversial tactic this year is going to be even bigger fraser perring a former social worker who exposed accounting irregularities at poundland owner steinhoff said money is cheap so it s easy to ignore fraud and aggressive accounting predator carson block runs short seller muddy waters when money becomes more expensive as it is getting all of a sudden you have to weigh a few more risks and i think if short sellers don t have a heyday in 2019 i don t know when they will he pointed to last week s dive in the share price of apple after it reported a slowdown in iphone sales only two analysts on wall street were advising clients to sell ahead of the near 10 per cent fall it s about time people speak up perring said how can you have 20 analysts with a buy note and a share price collapsing if i walked into your office with all my limbs missing you d either call an ambulance or wonder if it s too late but you wouldn t recommend that i d go in for the marathon and that s what they re doing short sellers often hedge funds borrow shares from an investor sell them and then hope to buy them back when the share price falls in order to make a profit they normally keep a low profile but an increasing number are speaking out about companies they believe are overvalued or in some cases guilty of aggressive accounting or even fraud viceroy research perring s little known firm last year attacked online gambling outfit jackpotjoy and packaging giant rpc causing their shares to dive 30 per cent and 13 per cent respectively its attacks wiped nearly 600million off the combined stock market values of jackpotjoy and rpc most short listed companies include defence giant babcock and packaging firm rpc other firms to have suffered similar fates last year include babcock the defence giant whose largest customer is the ministry of defence an anonymous outfit called boatman capital research issued a report in october claiming that babcock had systematically misled investors by burying bad news about its performance boatman also attacked chairman mike turner and chief executive archie bethel saying they are not up to the job and claimed babcock s relationship with the mod had broken down babcock dismissed the allegations as false and malicious but its value has since fallen by around 800million now it has hired corporate investigators at kroll to discover who is behind boatman there is a reason these figures often remain in the shadows two years ago after perring had dropped his daughter at school two men with eastern european accents trapped him in his car threatened his family and demanded to know if he was behind anonymous reports into payments firm wirecard perring lied and said he was not last year it emerged he was behind viceroy which published a report in december 2017 on steinhoff the south african retailer which in the uk owns poundland bensons for beds and harveys despite never having trained as an accountant perring raised questions about steinhoff s accounts two days later the company shocked the retail industry

london one in new york and another in oregon he likes to race supercars and recently returned from california where he was testing his 200 000 mercedes amg another victim of short sellers is iqe a

submarines and warships muddy waters is run by carson block an american who made his name shorting chinese firms at the start of the decade many of which he alleged were committing fraud he claims investors have a duty to go after companies guilty of immoral behaviour he told a new york conference last month i think activists can occasionally take short selling to what i say is another level and that we can short a stock for reasons that have to do purely with the immorality of the company that hasn t been expressly done before and i think it can be done and it should be done former analyst matthew earl known in the city as the dark destroyer runs shadowfall which has also set its sights on first derivatives a software consultancy based in ireland but listed on london s aim market in a note in october shadowfall claimed historical profits have been significantly bolstered through one off factors or by clever accounting the note hit first derivatives share price and has wiped 500million off its value rpc which makes plastic packaging for household names was also targeted by short sellers the mail on sunday analysis by breakout point also includes kier group because hedge fund kuvari partners set out its case against the troubled construction firm in november just 24 hours before the share price crashed by a third mayfair based kuvari does not produce reports on companies like the others do but its investment chief vikram kumar warned a london short selling conference of kier s narrowing margins in an already low margin sector and questioned the true health of its balance sheet a day later kier shocked the market with an emergency rights issue to raise 250million which hit the share price and has since cut 500million off its market value short sellers have been accused of manipulating the market by cashing in from their damning reports however perring points the finger at analysts who he says publish positive reports far more often than negative ones he says they are often paid to write research or are hoping to win new clients from it steinhoff is still waiting on the results of an investigation into its accounting scandal after questions

lynn evans guest columnist there is nothing like a government shutdown to make us more appreciative of government s services even if the new congress manages to pull off a budget deal there will still be a lot of collateral damage left behind as usual the wild card is president trump one large problem was dealt with last week when the fha announced it could after all begin to issue federal flood insurance again in response to pressure from congress and business groups buyers for about 40 000 homes had been told their applications for flood insurance were on hold meaning they could not close on their houses which meant that home sales of those 40 000 houses could not be finalized affecting not only the buyers but the sellers and two sets of real estate agents grinding that part of the economy to a halt some farmers anticipating usda payments have so far not been so lucky farm loans and disaster assistance programs as well as direct payments to counter losses from the tariff war with china that had not yet been certified have been on hold no new rural development loans or grants including new loans for rural housing or for upgrades of electric or telecom infrastructure will be made until the shutdown ends since the start of the shutdown on december 22 about 800 000 federal employees have been either furloughed without pay or are working as essential employees without pay nine government agencies agriculture commerce hud treasury transportation justice homeland security interior and the epa had to shut down operations because their budget was not passed by congress or signed by the president altogether about 25 percent of the government was left unfunded the impasse has been due to our president s insistence on a 5 6 billion appropriation for a beautiful wall between the us and mexico despite the fact that the people in charge of safeguarding our border including our own bennie thompson incoming house chairman of homeland security advise that 5 6 billion would be wasteful spending because more border walls will not stop or significantly slow down illegal immigration the president himself says he is insisting on the wall because otherwise i would look foolish the good news is that school lunches and wic are still funded at least through february our military except for the coast guard will still get paid and food inspections will still happen federal prisons will not shut down even though prison guards will not get paid social security checks will keep coming and medicare and medicaid payments will still go out this is no way to run a railroad the common wisdom was that washington politicians had learned their lesson with the 1996 shutdown that pitted house speaker newt gingrich against president bill clinton that did not turn out so well for gingrich or the gop americans began to see that it was their friends and family members who were suffering the effects of the shutdown not some faceless bureaucrats in d c high on americans wish list for the new year is that washington politicians including the commander in chief stop bickering and showboating and instead work in a bipartisan manner to address the needs and concerns of the country a little more steadiness at the wheel might also reassure our allies as well as the us stock market we americans built our government to serve and protect us there are certainly times when some usually those with money position and power get more than their fair share but shutting down the government is no solution to a partisan disagreement too much collateral damage for us all more is funding public education going back to court

the stranger than sitcom american presidency opened 2018 with a big tease about mutual nuclear destruction from two leaders who then found love not war it seems president donald trump and north korea s kim jong un were just playing hard to get the presidency ends the year saturated in tumult with the government in partial shutdown and trump tweeting a video of himself warbling a parody of the theme song from green acres a television sitcom from the 1960s to mark his signing of a farm bill throw in a beer loving and very angry supreme court nominee an unhappy departing defense secretary trump s parallel universe of facts and his zillion tweets and you can see that the president s world this year was touched by the weird the traumatic and the fantastical also known as wtf there was no holding back the self described very stable genius with the very very large brain some serious and relatively conventional things got done in 2018 there was a midterm election many more democrats are coming to congress and not quite all of them plan to run for president divided government dawns in january when democrats take control of the house republicans retain their grip on the senate an overhaul of the criminal justice system was accomplished and in an unusually bipartisan way though it took a dash of reality tv s kim kardashian west to move it along gun control actually was tightened a bit with trump s unilateral banning of bump stocks trump shocked allies and lost defense secretary jim mattis over a presidential decision to pull u s troops out of syria quickly following up with indications that up to half the troops in afghanistan might be withdrawn too self described tariff man started one trade war with china and headed off a second by tweaking the north american free trade agreement and giving it an unpronounceable acronym usmca he withdrew the u s from the iran nuclear deal putting action behind his twitter shout we are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence death trump placed his second justice on the supreme court in two years after brett kavanaugh accused of alcohol fueled sexual assault in his youth raged against the allegations at a congressional hearing and acknowledged only i liked beer i still like beer but i never sexually assaulted anyone there were frustrations and fulminations aplenty for the president particularly about the steaming ahead russia trump campaign investigation by special counsel robert mueller special councel in some trump tweets nor did he make much progress on his promised border wall boarder wall which he renamed artistically designed steel slats in december in what he regarded as a concession to wall despising concrete cursing democrats the concession did not work large parts of the government closed saturday over the wall induced budget impasse he took heat for a zero tolerance policy that forced migrant children from their parents until he backed off inaccurately blaming democrats for child seperation it was a very good year for jobs it was a check your smartphone right now pass the smelling salts year for the stock market trump who assailed the unemployment rate as a phony measure when he was a candidate couldn t speak of it enough as obama era job growth continued on his watch he went mum about the market a prime subject for his boasting before it took a sustained dive trump s approval rating in polls was one of the few constants on this swiftly tilting planet 42 percent approval and 56 percent disapproval in the associated press norc s latest and 38 percent 57 percent via gallup neither much different than in january through it all the mainstreaming of the bizarre proceeded apace and north korea s kim set that tone right on jan 1 with his new year cheer to americans across the ocean it s not a mere threat but a reality that i have a nuclear button on the desk in my office all of the mainland united states is within the range of our nuclear strike trump responded the next day with a tweet about size and performance i too have a nuclear button but it is a much bigger more powerful one than his and my button works once they got that out of their system things quickly improved helped along by kim s letters to trump which the u s president called beautiful there was no more talk about trump being a mentally deranged dotard or kim being a maniac the musty insults of an earlier time in june they held history s first meeting between a north korean leader and a current u s president we fell in love trump later said at a west virginia rally kim had previously vowed to visit fire and fury on the u s but the fire and fury that made trump livid early this year was the book of the same name michael wolff s insider account of the trump white house that was a different sort of missile the president took particular exception to observations in the book by his former chief strategist tweeting about sloppy steve bannon who cried when he got fired and begged for his job now sloppy steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone too bad they are said to be on better terms now over the course of the year trump spoke at more than 40 campaign rallies kept up his twitter barrage 40 000 tweets since 2009 on his realdonaldtrump account and answered plenty of questions in infrequent but lengthy news conferences and sit down interviews so what stands out in this blizzardy whiteout of unconventionality how about this farewell to his secretary of state rex tillerson he was dumb as a rock and i couldn t get rid of him fast enough he was lazy as hell the president usually reserves dumb as a rock for journalists or his description of stormy daniels paid to stay quiet about their alleged affair as horseface or this description of his attorney general jeff sessions as scared stiff and missing in action before sessions was finally out in november will history long remember that in 2018 the president called democratic rep adam schiff little adam schitt on twitter and nations in africa shithole countries in a private meeting or that he correctly predicted hurricane florence would be tremendously wet or told the ap i have a natural instinct for science in july trump appeared to side with russian president vladimir putin when he stood by putin s side at a helsinki summit news conference and gave weight to putin s denial that russia meddled in the 2016 election despite the firm conclusion of u s intelligence agencies that it had i don t see any reason why it would be russia trump said but while it s been hardly noticed in a capital consumed by the shutdown drama mattis syria steel slats and market convulsions 2018 draws to a close as it started with warnings of a nuclear armageddon this time from putin putin s prompt was trump s intention to walk away from one arms control treaty and his reluctance to extend another that said putin could lead to the destruction of civilization as a whole and maybe even our planet maybe he s just playing hard to get ap polling director emily swanson and ap writers darlene superville zeke miller catherine lucey jill colvin jonathan lemire and nancy benac contributed

each february for the past ten years outside and mountain magazine have met up at snowbird utah to test skis this year we met with reps from 25 ski companies and set out to test dozens of new models over three days our testers sample as many as 18 pairs of skis each for this review we ve focused on skis that performed well in a wide range of conditions and terrain types our favorite pair of skis for all mountain use völkl s m5 mantra was one of the most versatile skis in this test equally as comfortable on hardpack as it is in fresh powder here s a deep dive on the m5 plus six other models more specialized to either hardpack or powder but with the versatility to perform on any day best all mountain ski courtesy völkl völkl m5 mantra 700 völkl has been building and revising a ski called the mantra for 12 years this year s version the m5 is brand new and we think it s the best new ski of the year over the past decade the ski industry has tried to turn every ski into a powder ski and in keeping with that trend the mantra grew steadily fatter and more rockered in reality though most all mountain skis need to rip groomed or packed snow about half the time and fat heavily rockered skis aren t great at that the new m5 reflects this understanding its sidecut is a bit deeper it has camber underfoot and its 96 millimeter waist is now four millimeters narrower than last year s version these changes give the m5 more rebound on hard snow and let it glide better and maintain more contact with the snow while up on edge what makes it stand apart from others in its class is its physical construction völkl is famous for building damp stable skis with wood cores sandwiched between two sheets of titanium alloy for the m5 völkl developed what it calls titanal frame a sandwich setup with the metal installed around the perimeter of the ski s fore and aft sections shedding weight from the center line as a result the m5 is a modest but noticeable 50 grams lighter in each ski compared with its predecessor meanwhile the tip has some carbon fiber consistent with current industry trends which makes it a little easier to initiate turns out on the hill the m5 was the most versatile ski of the test it s damp meaning it doesn t chatter or transmit vibrations but still lively it floats in resort powder but carves like a ski built for hardpack it s lightweight and precise at the same time said one of our testers i expected it to carve well but i was surprised by how well it runs off trail any skilled skier could excel on it the sweet spot is huge dimensions 134 96 117 buy now best all mountain ski for aggressive skiers courtesy blizzard blizzard bonafide 700 last year blizzard introduced a freeride line of skis designed to be surfier and more playful than its line of all mountain freeride skis the bonafide with its longer effective edge length and deeper sidecut is part of the all mountain line and we thought it remained fun in deep snow while becoming noticeably more stable on hardpack like the m5 mantra and just about every modern all mountain ski the bonafide has carbon fiber in the tips to reduce swing weight and its profile includes both rocker and camber the difference between these skis is power output while the mantra accommodates a wider range of skier types the bonafide is built for skiers who charge hard you either need to be big fast or both for this ski to perform you can go full tilt off trail or on said one tester and while plowing through chunks of unruly snow said another the bonafide is a cruel steamroller the bonafide is built with a beech and poplar core and two sheets of titanium alloy we d recommend it as a daily driver for skiing in the west where we d expect to use it 70 percent of the time off trail slashing turns in chalky alpine snow or using those lightweight rockered tips to pivot through loosely spaced steep bumps on trail it arcs a fun gs turn but even with the added sidecut it s not an all day carver so much as an all day high speed cruiser that can really lay it over in a turn with a 98 millimeter waist it s not a powder ski but it s a pretty good one ski quiver if you live in a place where the snowmaking equipment only comes out in the fall and if you re willing to sacrifice a little performance on the truly deep days dimensions 135 98 119 buy now best all mountain powder ski courtesy kästle kästle bmx105 hp 1 149 the first thing to address about the bmx105 hp is that it s at least 300 more expensive than the average ski in this category that fact left a few broke ski testers wondering how they d ever buy a pair according to kästle the sticker price reflects a high level of handwork and the materials come out of an elite race room shop in austria hp stands for high performance kästle constructed the bmx105 hp with silver fir and beech cores instead of cheaper woods and the bases are cut from the same sintered graphite that world cup athletes run sintering means baking a powder into a solid even the sidewalls and edge material are spec d from high grade stock ultimately that should produce a long lasting ski that delivers energy return and stability after other skis have gone soft and dead we ve put three years of hard skiing on a pair of kästles with this same build and they ve shown no loss of life but durability wouldn t matter if the bmx105s didn t ski well and they did earning the second highest scores in our all mountain powder test at snowbird the hollowtech tips swing weight reduction again make them nimble and the big turn radius 21 meters in the 181 centimeter length lets you run them in breakable crust and weird alpine snow without feeling hooky said a tester ripped everywhere and was super forgiving even while it displayed no speed limits it s easy to initiate turns and it doesn t mind if you want to drive the tail through the transition you could ski it in a big mountain comp or just cruise around so who should buy it anybody with resources first of all but especially people who spend most of their ski days at big western resorts that see ample snowfall like fernie jackson the gems of little cottonwood and squaw valley oh and that person should be adept at avoiding rocks and keeping their gear well honed for the long term as for body types the 105 has range our biggest strongest and fastest skier had it as his top pick as did a lightweight tester who prefers to slash rather carve his turns stable at all speeds but slices and dices pow in the trees too said a tester if you like a ski that never gets bucked around look here dimensions 134 105 123 buy now best all mountain frontside ski courtesy rossignol rossignol experience 88 ti 750 rossignol s redesigned experience 88 ti is a top pick if you live and ski in new england or even summit county colorado during a dry year we liked former versions of the experience line but it had grown dated largely because of an extended sidecut that brought the widest part of the ski to the very tip that made for fun carving but off trail that much sidecut made the experience line tough to handle the fix taking a cue from its 7 series powder skis rossignol built the new experience line with subtle tapering in the tip and tail with the new design it s actually more fun to rip around on groomed snow and it s way more nimble off trail in variable snow and terrain which allowed testers to butter and dump speed or redirect to a better line the ski has been improved with what rossignol is calling line control technology lct lct is a central rail that reduces the counter flexing of the ski at the apex of the turn smoothing out the ride and boosting edge grip another update includes new dampeners made from a viscous compound which we thought may have added to the 88 s ability to hook up and hold on perfect carving on trail said a tester it absolutely rails turns but the flex is smooth and accessible and you can sluff the tips and tails around if you need to bail out as for who should buy it the door is open it s a one ski quiver tool for the biggest chunk of the market but if you already own a pair of fat skis over 100 millimeters underfoot the new 88 will complete your quiver and make days with packed snow all that more fun this ski rips said a tester so easy to get up on edge but you can slink through bumps and trees too dimensions 140 86 130 buy now best backcountry crossover ski courtesy black diamond black diamond boundary pro 107 749 it s been awhile since a ski from black diamond has impressed our testers recently however bd shifted its ski production from china to blizzard s factory in austria and the quality of the finished product improved fivefold the boundary pro 107 which was redesigned with a poplar core has a comfortable sweet spot you can easily find the center of the flex coupled with a damp but lively ride and solid edge hold the same could not be said of previous bds we re featuring the boundary pro here as a backcountry crossover ski because it s lightweight enough for touring and because of its shape the more you ski off trail the less sidecut you want as deep sidecuts get hooky in weird wind and sun affected wild snow in the 184 centimeter length we tested the turn radius is a long 20 meters but here s the thing the boundary pro s ample tip and tail rocker abetted by tapering in the same zones made it easy to pivot and smear at will these are vital qualities in the backcountry where the tightest trees are often the only safe way down on hardpack you can check turns with confidence but you can t settle into a deep arc it s a touring ski for folks who care far more about shredding than setting uphill speed records we d pair it with a salomon shift binding the best crossover binding ever built and ski it all day long in places like revelstoke or silverton one of the top off trail skis of the day said one tester loose and slinky in tight places damp and easy to steer in the wide open alpine tons of rocker and taper for surfing pow dimensions 138 107 123 buy now how we test skis typically around 25 ski manufacturers bring their entire fleets to our annual test which means more than 250 pairs of skis for three days testers grab skis from a rack quickly adjust the bindings skate to the lifts burn a lap on varied terrain appropriate for the category swap skis and repeat all the while taking notes this happens up to 18 times a day for something like 100 000 vertical feet of shredding it usually dumps powder on us which is the best perk back at the home office we pour a mountain of data into spreadsheets and tabulate winners and losers how to choose a pair of skis buying skis can be confusing but it gets easier if you read the above reviews and ask yourself two key questions am i adding to a quiver or replacing the daily driver that i ski on 80 percent of the time if you re looking to round out a quiver you re probably in the market for a specialty ski built wide for powder or thin for carving turns on hardpack skis that are beyond the purview of this review such skis excel in very specific conditions but tend to flounder in routine all mountain conditions but if you ski a ton pure powder and pure frontside skis can really liven up your ski action if you re looking for a one ski quiver it s time for question two which is a two parter where do i ski the most and what are my favorite conditions how you answer these prompts determines whether you re in the market for an all mountain powder ski around 105 millimeters underfoot an all mountain ski around 95 millimeters or an all mountain frontside ski around 85 millimeters these versatile skis are all built similarly but they re distinguished by waist width and depth of rocker if you live near a steep and deep resort like alta alpine meadows jackson or mammoth and ski off trail most of the time a chubby all mountain powder ski with a healthy dose of rocker might be your daily driver if you live in a place with moderate snowfall summit county colorado we re looking at you then look for an all mountain ski one that s a touch skinnier and with less rocker which will let you mix up on trail and off trail skiing and if you live where machine groomed hardpack and chalky tree skiing is more common than bottomless blower say the east coast you should start with all mountain frontside skis with just a hint of rocker and a waist width that makes for easy and powerful edging they re still all mountain skis they just let you better rip carved turns bumps and tight trees when you aren t storm skiing what to look for in skis lee cohen stiffness back in the day when everyone skied on modified slalom and gs skis stiffness was often the deciding factor in ski selection today though unless you re either extralarge and powerful or petite and laid back almost all recreational all mountain skis are built with a round turn flex that s accessible to most skiers meaning you don t need to actively muscle them to get them to arc turns think you need a softer or stiffer ski before you change models consider changing lengths see the next entry length thanks to a smart blend of rocker taper sidecut and new materials modern all mountain skis are stable but lively surfy but powerful and dynamic but not demanding a side benefit to all that innovation we can ski them shorter than skis made 15 years ago but don t throw out all reason in the process ski size charts like this one are a good place to start but while they re close to spot on for easy skiing intermediates they tend to run five to ten centimeters short for aggressive experts also know that flex patterns stiffness again typically change with length so if you want a stiffer ski you might want a longer ski that s designed for a bigger skier too and vice versa sidecut sidecut is the hourglass shape of a ski when you put a ski on edge and bend it into a carved turn on packed snow the depth or radius of that sidecut helps to determine if you re going to make a short 14 meter turn or a long 20 meter arc counterintuitively in powder bumps and trees less sidecut can make for quicker turns in those conditions you aren t carving so much as pivoting or floating your turns and in soft snow less sidecut helps a ski cut loose in general though opt for more aggressive sidecuts if you live for arcing race turns on groomers and opt for less cut if you prefer to ski off trail in soft snow backcountry skis typically offer the least amount of sidecut because excessive hourglassing can cause the ski to catch unexpectedly in weird backcountry snow rocker it s subtle on most skis but rocker is that three dimensional shaping reminiscent of the upturned nose of a surfboard or the hull of a rodeo kayak just a hint of rocker makes it easier to tip an all mountain ski on edge to carve turns deeper rocker meanwhile helps float a ski to the surface of soft snow and gives a ski a surfy or slashy feel in powder as with width you want more rocker for pure powder skiing and less rocker for pure carving where it can make a ski feel less stable at high speed weight all skis are getting lighter these days and in general we think that s a good thing women are now able to run gear that s proportionally more in line with their body weight in bounds skiers who hike for their turns benefit from skis that are easier to shoulder backcountry skiers obviously need lighter skis for touring uphill and slightly lighter skis can feel more playful off trail in soft snow but unless you re a ski mountaineer racer buying skis based solely on weight is a bad idea eventually shaving weight comes at the expense of stability and dampness and many skiers know that feathery backcountry planks tend to skitter on resort hardpack and of course even the heaviest wood and metal skis don t feel heavy when you re riding lifts and going 45 miles an hour on groomers if you rarely hike weight isn t much of an issue

here are three financial sector stocks that could be great long term buys after the recent market drop the stock market s performance hasn t been pretty lately and bank stocks have been hit particularly hard while nobody enjoys watching their portfolio s value drop situations like this produce some of the best long term investment opportunities with that in mind here s why three of our contributors think synchrony financial syf 1 36 first hawaiian fhb 1 68 and american express axp 0 03 are worth a look right now a beaten down buffett bank stock that s worth a look matt frankel cfp synchrony financial there are many great bargains in the financial sector after the recent stock market plunge but one that i m keeping a close eye on right now is synchrony financial if you aren t familiar synchrony is a bank with two major business activities the company is a massive issuer of store branded credit cards with partners such as amazon lowe s and dozens more and synchrony has a rapidly growing high yield savings account platform here s why synchrony is such a great business store credit cards tend to have sky high interest rates when compared with traditional credit cards they do have slightly higher delinquency rates but the high interest income more than makes up for it and even though synchrony s deposit platform pays significantly higher interest than most bank savings accounts it is an excellent source of low cost capital think of it this way if you can lend money out at aprs of close to 30 borrow at 2 2 the current yield of synchrony s savings accounts and about 5 of your loans end up defaulting there s lots of room for profit this is an oversimplification of course but even after accounting for loss reserves and other factors synchrony s net interest margin is a staggering 16 4 synchrony has been especially hard hit recently for a few reasons obviously the broader market sell off didn t help in addition synchrony s business is seen as especially recession prone and it is so recession fears have caused concern and synchrony recently lost a major partner walmart and it will take some time to replace the lost revenue in a nutshell this is an excellent business to invest in especially while it s beaten down due to recession fears and lost revenue that it should ultimately recover check out the latest synchrony earnings call transcript surf s up for this bank stock jordan wathen first hawaiian the hawaiian banking market is unlike anything in the lower 48 u s states just two banks first hawaiian and bank of hawaii control 67 of the state s deposits making them the go to banks for local consumers and commercial customers alike less competition for loans and deposits means first hawaiian can earn attractive returns on its loan portfolio while paying a pittance on deposits consider that it doesn t pay any interest at all on nearly 35 of its deposits and on those on which it does pay interest it pays very little just 0 71 annualized in the most recent quarter first hawaiian shares have been battered this year as the market worries that interest rates may not rise as high as once thought which is fair given the bank s earnings are highly sensitive to interest rate fluctuations even still first hawaiian earned attractive returns even during the banking doldrums of 2011 to 2015 when near zero interest rates weighed on bank earnings across the industry and with little local competition it s hard to believe that it will be forced to pay higher deposit rates if rates simply level out from here at current market prices wall street has effectively priced first hawaiian as if to remove any expectation of increased earnings from rising rates thus shareholders are paying only for what they get a well run banking institution in an attractive market and pay no premium for the potential lift that rising rates give to the bank s margins that kind of free upside makes first hawaiian a very attractive investment for buy and hold investors check out the latest first hawaiian earnings call transcript don t leave home without this stock dan caplinger american express most people see american express solely as the provider of its namesake charge cards which has been a successful business almost since its inception many american express cardholders are willing to pay pricey membership fees in exchange for the cachet that the company s cards have among luxury merchants and despite stiff competition from other credit card network providers amex has been able to sustain much of its competitive advantage yet what many investors don t realize about american express is that it s working hard to keep up with the rapid pace of change in the payment processing industry a recent partnership with paypal holdings and venmo allows users to pay their monthly amex bills and send payments using the paypal and venmo platforms and that could drive further revenue growth for the banking company amex s consumer banking unit is another potential growth driver the company offers online savings accounts and certificates of deposit and that gives it a chance to cross sell card customers with banking products even as the stock has taken a tumble on increased fears of an economic slowdown amex s delinquency rates have thus far remained healthy and that makes the stock look like a relative bargain at these levels check out

how to hit russia where it hurts russia s 2014 annexation of crimea its war in eastern ukraine its interference in the 2016 u s presidential election and other aggressive acts against the united states and its allies demand a strong western response for the past four years that response has been dominated by sanctions and other coercive economic measures u s and european officials have hoped that the economic measures would not only exact a cost for such actions but also deter the kremlin from escalating its assault on american and european interests the economic pressure has certainly had an effect the imf estimated that the sanctions linked to the 2014 invasion of ukraine cost russia 1 to 1 5 percent of its gdp by mid 2015 the sanctions also hurt the russian treasury s bottom line since russia had to make up for lost western capital by spending billions of dollars to prop up large companies that depended on western funds the more recent sanctions announced in april 2018 in response to russia s interference in the u s election rattled russian financial markets and put pressure on the value of the ruble specific people and companies have also felt the squeeze the net worth of oleg deripaska the pro putin oligarch for example has tumbled because of u s sanctions and yet sanctions have done little to change moscow s ways not only has russia refused to make concessions on its military intervention in ukraine but in november 2018 it seized three ukrainian naval ships transiting the kerch strait according to a recent report by u s director of national intelligence dan coats sanctions did not stop russia from interfering in the u s midterm elections in 2018 and indeed coats said that china and iran tried to interfere as well nor have they dissuaded moscow from abetting north korea s efforts to bypass international sanctions propping up syrian president bashar al assad or using a military grade nerve agent in the salisbury attack on sergei skripal a russian exile living in the united kingdom the united states and europe need a tough coherent strategy to contain russia s economy and to have a meaningful chance of affecting russian decision making targeted sanctions remain useful in punishing individual officials oligarchs and companies when they attack western interests but simply imposing such measures from time to time in response to russian provocations will never change russia s behavior instead a more ambitious long term approach is needed that focuses not only on specific officials and oligarchs but on russian government revenues and the russian economy as a whole in a best case scenario a more ambitious economic strategy could raise political tensions in russia and convince putin to curb his aggression but even in the more likely scenario where economic pressure fails to alter putin s strategic calculus an ambitious strategy is key to undercutting russia s ability to achieve putin s objectives for an example of an effective program of economic pressure policymakers need look no further than the end of the cold war in 1983 u s president ronald reagan signed national security decision directive 75 nsdd 75 stating that u s policy was to contain and over time reverse soviet expansionism the directive identified four intermediate economic goals to ensure that western relations with the soviet union did not facilitate soviet military power to avoid subsidizing the soviet union so as to increase internal economic stresses over time to minimize soviet economic leverage over u s allies in europe and around the world and to permit some trade such as grain trade that was mutually beneficial and offered no strategic advantage for all that has changed over the past 35 years reagan s economic campaign against the soviet union still provides a useful template for a modern approach to containing russia a better strategy any economic pressure campaign likely to affect russia s outlook has to starve the country s military industrial complex the united states and europe know this they adopted export controls against russian defense industries in 2014 and in 2017 the u s congress passed a law sanctioning foreign companies and governments that engage in significant transactions with the russian defense sector these sanctions threaten russia s ability to export military equipment a trade that is worth billions of dollars to russia annually and helps extend the country s global influence in september of this year the trump administration sanctioned a senior chinese military official and the chinese military s equipment development department for purchasing russian combat aircraft and a russian air defense system washington should press this advantage further still persuading u s partner countries such as india and turkey to cancel planned purchases of major russian defense systems in doing so the trump administration should rely not only on the threat of sanctions but also on positive inducements such as the potential for greater u s military cooperation washington s decision late last month to authorize the sale of patriot missiles to turkey for example allows a u s ally to use u s military equipment instead of russian technology at the same time the united states can put pressure on russia s military supply chains although russia produces most of its defense equipment domestically it still imports component parts and dual use equipment technology that has both military and non military uses technological innovations with major military applications such as autonomous vehicles are dominated by u s firms and will likely increase u s and european leverage in this area any measures western governments can take to constrain russia s access to such emerging technologies are worth pursuing western policymakers are already aware of the need to withhold resources from russia s military but military sanctions are only one piece of a larger and more complex effort to diminish russia s economy and state revenues on this score since 2014 policymakers in washington and brussels have been reluctant to impose the most severe sanctions on russia such as blacklisting the largest russian banks or kicking russia out of the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication swift international payments network out of concern for the effect such sanctions might have on global financial and energy markets with russian european trade alone amounting to nearly 200 billion euros approximately 230 billion each year and russia remaining one of the world s dominant energy producers the collateral costs of suddenly unwinding trade and financial relationships could be very high indeed the u s treasury department was forced to partly roll back the sanctions it imposed on deripaska who made his fortune in global metals markets after the sanctions caused global aluminum prices to rise 20 percent in the weeks after they were announced indeed in late december the treasury departmentannounced that it would remove several of deripaska s companies from u s sanctions lists in exchange for deripaska divesting a part of his shares u s and european officials are right to be concerned about how sanctions could affect market stability but there are still viable options sanctions and tough diplomacy could be used to deter new large scale investments in key russian export sectors such as energy which in 2018 reached a post soviet record level of production and which continues to attract significant new western investment the goal of new sanctions should not be to cause a near term disruption in this and other commodity exports which could raise global prices and have significant adverse consequences instead they should be designed to deter new investments in russia with the goal of reducing the long term volume and value of these exports and other major sources of russian revenue over time this gradual decline would give alternative suppliers time to enter the breach in addition russia s leverage over major global energy companies would gradually weaken as the companies refrain from making new investments in russia restrictions on moscow s access to international capital markets including its sovereign borrowing are another useful tool and would reduce the capital available for investment inside russia taking these steps would gradually make russia s adventurism harder to sustain even while the kremlin would be forced to make stressful tradeoffs among domestic economic priorities to increase the discomfort u s and european officials should continue to try to drive a wedge between putin and a russian oligarch class that has profited handsomely off of his tenure but the efficacy of oligarch sanctions has its limits landing on u s and european sanctions lists has if anything forced some oligarchs to tie themselves even more tightly to the kremlin given the lack of alternative business opportunities for example one of the first oligarchs sanctioned in 2014 longtime putin confidant and childhood judo partner arkady rotenberg ended up becoming the contractor putin hired to build the bridge connecting mainland russia to the occupied crimean peninsula this suggests that oligarch sanctions may be stronger in the threat than in the execution policymakers should therefore make very clear what steps russian oligarchs can take to distance themselves from putin in order to avoid sanctions ultimately an economically weakened russia is a russia with less leverage over other nations including the united states and europe but loosening those bonds requires a dedicated effort one that policymakers should aggressively make since 2014 the european union has taken steps to reduce its dependence on russian energy pledging to import more liquefied natural gas from the united states this step is a positive one but just last year russian oil giant rosneft announced plans to acquire one of india s largest refiners essar washington and allied governments should use diplomacy and international investment restrictions to encourage governments to block such acquisitions particularly by russian state linked companies because they provide russia with long term leverage in the countries where they occur in the united states the trump administration can use the recently reformed committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius review process to restrict russia s ability to acquire stakes in technology firms doing so will not only reduce russian leverage over u s businesses but also prevent russia from gaining access to cutting edge u s technology congress could step up disclosure requirements around russian real estate purchases which have become a gray market haven for russian money and congress should enact legislation requiring greater disclosure about who owns companies in the united states which a 2012 study found ranks as the second easiest country in the world in which to establish a shell company the lack of disclosure around real estate purchases and corporate ownership creates loopholes for putin s cronies to move money into the united states taken together these tactics will significantly increase the economic pressure on russia but even as they pursue this plan the united states and europe should be careful not to hinder mutually beneficial trade just as reagan recognized 35 years ago with the soviet union some business can serve both countries interests western exports of consumer products automobiles and other non sensitive goods for example generally benefit ordinary russians as opposed to the russian state russia remains a profitable export market for the western manufacturers of such goods new tools in putting this strategy into practice policymakers would rely on familiar tools sanctions export controls and national security reviews of foreign investments but they should think of creative new ways to put additional pressure on moscow reagan after all also authorized large scale covert attacks on russia s energy pipeline infrastructure in 2011 for example the european union initiated an antitrust investigation into the state controlled russian oil company gazprom the eu settled the investigation in may 2018 in exchange for price concessions allowing gazprom s european customers to resell gas across national boundaries the eu should vigorously enforce this agreement and impose heavy fines on gazprom and other russian government controlled companies should they engage in future anticompetitive activities litigation can also play a role in the strategy ukraine has already sought billions of dollars from russia over the latter s failure to reliably supply gas since the countries 2014 conflict began ukraine has also brought a legal challenge at the international court of justice over russia s seizure of crimea the u s and european governments can encourage other victims of russia s malign activities ranging from assassinations to cyberattacks to bring suit russia can claim sovereign immunity a legal doctrine that generally limits citizens right to sue foreign governments for governmental actions to oppose such lawsuits russia for example is seeking to invoke sovereign immunity to block the democratic national committee s lawsuit over russia s hacking of the its computer servers during the 2016 election western governments could provide would be plaintiffs with legal tools by limiting sovereign immunity as a defense in cases involving election interference and certain other major crimes much as the u s congress has limited terrorist supporting countries right to claim sovereign immunity as a defense a heightened risk of private litigation and the possibility that victims of malicious russian activities will be awarded russian assets could chill moscow s enthusiasm for extending its influence through such means playing the long game containment through economic pressure is a long game just as it was during the cold war reagan did not expect his strategy to result in immediate soviet policy shifts in central asia latin america or europe back in 1983 and he noted that it was unlikely to yield a rapid breakthrough in bilateral relations today there is always a chance that raising economic pressure will ultimately convince putin to curb his attacks on the united states and its allies especially if doing so forces russia to begin cutting domestic spending on key programs and state subsidies to close allies that underpin his government s popularity the more likely scenario however is that putin will continue to challenge the west in that case a strategy designed to gradually weaken the russian economy and bring about

youtube after fueling impeachment calls in the election some democratic leaders are trying to tamp down on the issue despite the filing of impeachment articles on the first day of the session the leaders could now have a serious problem in controlling dozens of members who secured their fees in part on impeachment pledges that was obvious this week when newly elected rep rashida tlaib d mi proclaimed the intention to impeach the motherf ker at a reception for the liberal group moveon the statement obviously delighted the crowd but undermined the credibility of the new democratic majority in seriously examining the basis for impeachment in a measure of the distemper that has taken over our politics tlaib has refused to apologize tlaib quoted her son telling her look mama you won bullies don t win tlaib reportedly replied you re right they don t and we re gonna go in and impeach the motherf ker there may or may not be grounds for impeachment in the mueller report expected however being a bully is not one of them more importantly the glee expressed by tlaib is concerning enough but there also seems a lack of concern over the actual proof of a high crime and misdemeanor under the constitutional standard impeachment is not meant to be a partisan tool or some cathartic act that might be a better and less profane lesson to share with one s son share this twitter reddit facebook email

a bluefin tuna sold for a record 3 1 million at the first auction of the year at tokyo s new fish market on saturday but behind the celebrations hides a worrying tale of overfishing and dwindling stocks kiyoshi kimura who owns the sushi zanmai restaurant chain paid 333 6 million yen for the 613 lb fish at the first auction of the year and the first to be held at tokyo s new toyosu fish market after last year s the move from the famous tsukiji market the price at the predawn auction was nearly 10 times higher than the price paid at last year s auction albeit for a considerably smaller fish and roughly double the previous record also set by kimura in 2013 there was an intense bidding war with a rival buyer who had won last year the winner said he was very satisfied with the quality of the fish but admitted he had paid much more than he had expected the tuna looks so tasty and very fresh but i think i did pay a little too much kimura told reporters outside the market later according to news agencies kimura said a single piece of the tuna would be served to customers in his restaurants later that day the fish was caught off the coast of northern japan s aomori prefecture by fishermen from the small town of oma which has a nationwide reputation for the quality of its tuna catch bluefin tuna is highly valued for its taste in sushi restaurants but decades of overfishing have sent stocks plummeting the iucn red list of threatened species classifies the pacific bluefin tuna or thunnus orientalis as vulnerable with a decreasing population the celebration surrounding the annual pacific bluefin auction hides how deeply in trouble this species really is said jamie gibbon associate manager of global tuna conservation at the pew charitable trusts its population has fallen to less than 3 5 percent of its historic size and overfishing still continues today in response to the growing scarcity of the fish japan and other governments agreed in 2017 to strict quotas and restrictions on fishing in an attempt to rebuild stocks from 20 percent of historic levels by 2034 that has caused considerable unhappiness and some hardship in oma oma tuna is known as the black diamond of tuna because fishermen still use traditional manual fishing methods rather than trawling allowing them to catch the fish intact but to stick to the quota fishermen there said they decided to go slow in the summer and concentrate instead on fishing in the fall and winter when tuna fetches a higher price however when they ventured out they found tuna harder to find than usual and catches low leading to fears in november that the oma tuna could eventually disappear from the nation s sushi bars although december s catch was better hundreds of japanese fishermen also protested against the new quotas outside the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food in june while oma also canceled its annual tuna festival in october in protest but gibbon lamented that japan and other countries were already lobbying for higher catch quotas for 2019 just one year into the 16 year recovery plan while also noting reports of japanese fishermen discarding and not reporting dead bluefin to avoid exceeding their quotas it s time for countries including japan to support pacific bluefin recovery fund the necessary science and commit to enforcing fishing limits to ensure that there will still be bluefin left to auction he said pacific bluefin tuna reach a maximum length of nearly 10 feet and a maximum weight of 1 200 lbs a top ocean predator they have been described as twice the size of a lion and faster than a gazelle they are built like torpedoes with a hydrodynamic shape retractable pectoral side fins and unlike other fish eyes set flush to their body according to wwf they have two main breeding grounds off the coast of japan most remain in the western pacific all their lives reaching from russia s sakhalin island in the north to new zealand in the south but others when they reach one to two years of age make a 6 000 mile 11 000 km migration to rich waters off california and mexico s baja peninsula returning after two to four years to spawn in the same western pacific waters where they began life pew charitable trusts say pew says fishermen mainly from japan south korea and mexico often take fish before they reach maturity which has badly undermined the population according to the mongabay nature news website bluefin are difficult to rear in captivity with highly sensitive reactions to light and sound they rarely spawn in captivity and often swim at top speed and die on impact with the sides of tanks or nets first published in the washington post

washington ap federal reserve chairman jerome powell said friday that he will not resign if asked to do so by president donald trump and that he is prepared to be patient in deciding when to raise interest rates again both of those messages cheered stock market investors who had been worried about trump s repeated attacks on his hand picked choice to lead the nation s central bank and also the fed s seemingly inexorable march to higher rates there is no pre set path for policy powell said during an appearance at a conference of economists in atlanta with the muted inflation readings we have seen coming in we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves private economists viewed powell s comments as a strong signal that the fed which in december had projected another two rate hikes in 2019 may end up deciding to pause hikes for several months with chairman powell s remarks today i would say they will do just one hike or maybe no hikes this year said sung won sohn chief economist at ss economics powell is definitely trying to calm the markets wall street which opened sharply higher after a report showing 312 000 jobs gained in december surged even higher during powell s appearance the dow jones industrial average finished the day up 746 points or 3 3 percent federal reserve chairman jerome powell speaks at a conference friday jan 4 2019 in atlanta powell said that he will not resign if asked to do so by president donald trump a message that heartened investors who had been concerned by trump s repeated attacks on his hand picked choice to lead the nation s central bank ap photo annie rice powell called the jobs report very strong and said he was also encouraged by the rise in the labor force participation rate and gains in wages which he said for me at this time does not raise concerns about too high inflation trump has complained that the fed has pushed rates higher despite the fact that there is no evidence that inflation was getting out of control the president s attacks had become so intense that they had raised concerns that he might be considering firing powell a development which could send the market into a tailspin trump would appear to be on shaky legal ground if he tried to fire powell under the law that governs the federal reserve a president can only remove a fed chairman for cause courts in cases that involved other agencies have interpreted that language to not cover policy differences asked if he would resign if trump asked him to do so powell responded with a short no powell s willingness to be flexible on interest rates was welcome news to investors many of whom worried that fed chair risked cutting off the current economic expansion by continuing to raise interest rates despite signs the u s economy was cooling off a little on friday powell said we are always prepared to shift the stance of policy and to shift it significantly if necessary to meet the goals of maximum employment and stable prices powell gave as an example the fact that in 2016 when janet yellen was fed chair the central bank began the year with a projection that it would raise rates four times that year but ended up raising rates only once because the economy hit a soft patch appearing on a panel with his two predecessors yellen and ben bernanke powell also said that the fed could alter its approach to trimming its huge balance sheet if it determines such a change is needed the pace of fed rate hikes and the lowering of the balance sheet which tends to put upward pressure on interest rates had both been concerns of investors in recent months the stock market has seen stomach churning declines since october a development that trump has blamed on the fed s continued rate hikes although the president s trade dispute with china as well as concerns about global economic growth also played a part in the market volatility the fed had increased the size of its balance sheet four fold to a record 4 5 trillion in an effort to push long term interest rates lower but it has been gradually reversing that stance over the past year although the balance sheet still remains above 4 trillion but some investors have worried that that process could push long term rates higher at a time when the economy was slowing powell on friday stressed that the fed was prepared to adjust the pace at which it trimmed the balance sheet if necessary to support economic growth while trump has sent out a number of tweets criticizing powell and calling the fed the biggest threat to the economy powell said that he had not received any direct pressure from the white house asked if he had had any face to face meetings with trump powell said he had not although he said previous fed leaders have had discussions from time to time with previous presidents asked if any future meeting with trump was scheduled powell said i have no news on that nothing is scheduled federal reserve chairman jerome powell speaks at a

pity poor nancy pelosi the california congresswoman reclaimed the speaker s gavel this week after a campaign against her democratic party rivals and critics that was so terrifyingly and efficiently brutal that it even impressed breitbart s matt boyle to those with a cinematic frame of mind it recalled the godfather s baptism of fire sequence depicting michael corleone relentlessly eliminating rivals for his family s control of american organized crime as is now traditional when an opposition party seizes control of the house of representatives the democrats promptly shut down the federal government in fact somehow the democrats shut down the government even before formally taking control of the house this was accomplished through the machinations of chuck schumer the new yorker who leads the democratic minority in the u s senate nearly a week before pelosi s ascension a timeline that capitol hill sources insist was in no way schumer s clever ploy to deprive pelosi of the time honored oppositional house majority leadership role of leading the shutdown enjoyed by speakers newt gingrich in 1995 and 1996 and john boehner in 2013 the shutdowns of yore however were attended by a least some sense of national crisis not so the current shutdown it has barely shown up as a blip on the radar screen of our public life netflix s claims about the viewership of birdbox garnered more attention and more controversy even the last shutdown initiated by schumer and pelosi a year ago at least had a pretense to consequence down on wall street no one appeared to notice the government had been mothballed the drama of the week revolved around trade negotiations federal reserve policy and apple falling far from the china tree the market tanked tanked again and then tanked some more but no one pretended the shutdown had entered into their calculation of the proper value of equity shares and when the market rallied on friday thanks to the addition of 312 000 jobs in december and jerome powell seeming to retreat to a view of monetary policy much closer to that of donald trump and cnbc s jim cramer it only highlighted the irrelevancy of the shutdown not that shutdowns have ever had a big impact on stocks if anything stocks tend to rally by the end of shutdowns although this may be simply a reflection that at any given point of time stocks tend to be higher than they were at most points in the past but they were at least shown some attention and deference wall street analysts had to set out to reassure clients that shutdowns did not tend to produce anything bad for stocks brokers back when we still called them that had to entertain calls from clients worried about what it all meant mark haines would interview men in ties and women in skirt suits and respectable pumps about what they thought the shutdown would mean for say the consumer discretionary sector even the calm at least had the courtesy to greet the shutdown with a shrug not this time conversations with financial advisers as the brokers are now known reveal that there has been no hue and cry from the heartland s investors or retirees about the shutdown not even some concerned text messages you would have had to watch cnbc in slow motion to catch a mention of the shutdown and even as pelosi and schumer revealed that trump had told them the shutdown could last for years the market relentlessly rallied on friday pelosi s first act as new speaker managing the shutdown for the house majority was less than irrelevant on wall street in the first week of 2019 it was as if the thing that has consumed her first days in office were not happening at all
action film simmba has produced a super star and we do not say this irresponsibly just like hollywood super heroes bollywood heroes can surely do the impossible of course without capes they come with little or no back story as in the case of simmba being an orphan is good enough the front story as it were is neatly split between the hero and the villain along with a prologue epilogue heroine comedian extras and the all important takiya kalaam stock refrain tell me something i don t know the motivation like with super hero flicks is rather rudimentary saving a girl is as good as repeatedly saving the world what matters is how the super star by sheer dint of his vigorous personality where you can t distinguish between the actor and character carries along an entire movie and indeed the audience on his strong shoulders alone once the image is set the penny drops and while the going is good the super star on screen is good enough to ensure audiences in theatres and there s got to be a reason why no star ever since the 1990s in a real sense has been able to convincingly play this part that we suspect is the hardest to hit home with anyway once the image is set the penny drops and while the going is good the super star on screen is good enough to ensure audiences in theatres and there s got to be a reason why no star ever since the 1990s in a real sense has been able to convincingly play this part that we suspect is the hardest to hit home with anyway actor ranveer singh does just that actor ranveer singh does just that and how part govinda from raja babu type pictures in the 90s part anil kapoor from ram lakhan in the 80s but wholly holding his own in a typically rohit shetty action entertainer ranveer singh adds tremendous credibility to a character that had begun to tire us over time for one given his robust résumé you know he isn t casually reprising a role given a captive audience he puts in as much effort into simmba as he might into a bajirao mastani say mastering the marathi twang killing it softly with well written one liners setting the dance floor on fire romancing like a dude doing action like a proper desi hero you fall for inspector sangram bhalerao a cartoonish corrupt cop who wants to eventually right the society s wrongs essentially because you fall for the stupendous singh on steroids every scene works because he does and vice versa the net result is a movie that within the same space seems better than ajay devgn s singham but for the middling soundtrack it would ve been better than salman khan s dabangg either way what you won t go looking for is the picture s plot based on the telugu potboiler temper because you already know what to expect singh as a hero sonu sood as a villain villain ke haraami brothers hero ki abla nari sister and the rape and the revenge drama that follow we are unsure if one adequately appreciates how hard bordering on the near impossible it is to engagingly pull off a masala melodrama such as this shetty knows more than a thing or two about this timeless genre yet this may well be one of his rare movies where the connoisseur and the crackling masses are most likely to seamlessly converge as an audience the only way to know if a film of this sort is working is when you find yourself smiling responding and along with a packed theatre reacting to shenanigans on screen whether they entirely make sense or not is not the point the script can be full of holes you hope your brain isn t this is how we caught this picture with folk in the front benches whistling clapping making loud noises and then going quiet during dramatic sequences this only brings back strong memories of large single screen cinemas on the verge of extinction with people on both cheap and super expensive seats sharing entertainment as a common tribal experience that s where you should go for this as if on cue to devgn walks in as singham as does kumar announcing his next film cop flick with shetty sooryavanshi you might think this is meant to be a singh starrer piggy backing on 90s super stars inhabiting the same marvel like super hero cinematic universe look at him i think it was the other way round published in daily times january 6th 2019

kiyoshi kimura president of kiyomura corp poses with a newly purchased tuna at a sushizanmai restaurant in tokyo on saturday the record price was more than double the previous high set in 2013 according to masayuki fukuda an official in charge of trading operations at the tokyo market bloomberg photo by keith bedford tokyo a bluefin tuna sold for a record 3 1 million at the first auction of the year at tokyo s new fish market on saturday but behind the celebrations hides a worrying tale of overfishing and dwindling stocks kiyoshi kimura who owns the sushi zanmai restaurant chain paid 333 6 million yen for the 613 lb 278 kg fish at the first auction of the year and the first to be held at tokyo s new toyosu fish market after last year s the move from the famous tsukiji market the price at the predawn auction was nearly 10 times higher than the price paid at last year s auction albeit for a considerably smaller fish and roughly double the previous record also set by kimura in 2013 there was an intense bidding war with a rival buyer who had won last year the winner said he was very satisfied with the quality of the fish but admitted he had paid much more than he had expected the tuna looks so tasty and very fresh but i think i did pay a little too much kimura told reporters outside the market later according to news agencies kimura said a single piece of the tuna would be served to customers in his restaurants later that day the fish was caught off the coast of northern japan s aomori prefecture by fishermen from the small town of oma which has a nationwide reputation for the quality of its tuna catch advertisement bluefin tuna is highly valued for its taste in sushi restaurants but decades of overfishing have sent stocks plummeting the iucn red list of threatened species classifies the pacific bluefin tuna or thunnus orientalis as vulnerable with a decreasing population the celebration surrounding the annual pacific bluefin auction hides how deeply in trouble this species really is said jamie gibbon associate manager of global tuna conservation at the pew charitable trusts its population has fallen to less than 3 5 percent of its historic size and overfishing still continues today in response to the growing scarcity of the fish japan and other governments agreed in 2017 to strict quotas and restrictions on fishing in an attempt to rebuild stocks from 20 percent of historic levels by 2034 that has caused considerable unhappiness and some hardship in oma kiyoshi kimura president of kiyomura corp give a thumbs up to a vendor as he walks with a newly purchased tuna towards a sushizanmai restaurant in tokyo japan on saturday jan 5 2019 kiyomura operator of the sushizanmai restaurant chain across japan made the winning bid of 333 6 million yen about 3 1 million for a 278 kilogram bluefin tuna at toyosu market on saturday bloomberg photo by keith bedford oma tuna is known as the black diamond of tuna because fishermen still use traditional manual fishing methods rather than trawling allowing them to catch the fish intact but to stick to the quota fishermen there said they decided to go slow in the summer and concentrate instead on fishing in the fall and winter when tuna fetches a higher price however when they ventured out they found tuna harder to find than usual and catches low leading to fears in november that the oma tuna could eventually disappear from the nation s sushi bars although december s catch was better hundreds of japanese fishermen also protested against the new quotas outside the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food in june while oma also canceled its annual tuna festival in october in protest but gibbon lamented that japan and other countries were already lobbying for higher catch quotas for 2019 just one year into the 16 year recovery plan while also noting reports of japanese fishermen discarding and not reporting dead bluefin to avoid exceeding their quotas it s time for countries including japan to support pacific bluefin recovery fund the necessary science and commit to enforcing fishing limits to ensure that there will still be bluefin left to auction he said pacific bluefin tuna reach a maximum length of nearly 10 feet 3 meters and a maximum weight of 1 200 lbs 550 kg a top ocean predator they have been described as twice the size of a lion and faster than a gazelle they are built like torpedoes with a hydrodynamic shape retractable pectoral side fins and unlike other fish eyes set flush to their body according to wwf they have two main breeding grounds off the coast of japan most remain in the western pacific all their lives reaching from russia s sakhalin island in the north to new zealand in the south but others when they reach one to two years of age make a 6 000 mile 11 000 km migration to rich waters off california and mexico s baja peninsula returning after two to four years to spawn in the same western pacific waters where they began life pew charitable trusts say pew says fishermen mainly from japan south korea and mexico often take fish before they reach maturity which has badly undermined the population according to the mongabay nature news website bluefin are difficult to rear in captivity with highly sensitive reactions to light and sound they rarely spawn in captivity and often swim at top speed and die on impact with the sides of tanks or nets
washington ap president donald trump declared friday he could keep parts of the government shut down for months or even years as he and democratic leaders failed in a second closed door meeting to resolve his demand for billions of dollars for a border wall with mexico they did agree to a new round of weekend talks between staff members and white house officials trump met in the white house situation room with congressional leaders from both parties as the shutdown hit the two week mark amid an impasse over his wall demands democrats emerged from the roughly two hour meeting which both sides said was contentious at times to report little if any progress the standoff also prompted economic jitters and anxiety among some in trump s own party but he appeared in the rose garden to frame the upcoming weekend talks as progress while making clear he would not reopen the government we won t be opening until it s solved trump said i don t call it a shutdown i call it doing what you have to do for the benefit and the safety of our country trump said he could declare a national emergency to build the wall without congressional approval but would first try a negotiated process trump previously described the situation at the border as a national emergency before he dispatched active duty troops in what critics described as a pre election stunt trump also said the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are furloughed or working without pay would want him to keep going and fight for border security asked how people would manage without a financial safety net he declared the safety net is going to be having a strong border because we re going to be safe president donald trump speaks during a news conference in the rose garden of the white house after meeting with lawmakers about border security friday jan 4 2019 in washington ap photo manuel balce ceneta democrats on the other hand spoke of families unable to pay bills and called on trump to reopen the government while negotiations continue senate democratic minority leader chuck schumer said it s very hard to see how progress will be made unless they open up the government friday s white house meeting with trump included eight congressional leaders the top two democrats and republicans of both chambers people familiar with the session but not authorized to speak publicly described trump as holding forth at length on a range of subjects but said he made clear he was firm in his demand for 5 6 billion in wall funding and in rejecting the democrats request to reopen the government trump confirmed that he privately told democrats the shutdown could drag on for months or years though he said he hoped it wouldn t last that long said trump i hope it doesn t go on even beyond a few more days house democrats muscled through legislation thursday night to fund the government but not trump s proposed wall however senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has said those measures are non starters on his side of the capitol without the president s support a variety of strategies are being floated inside and outside the white house among them trading wall funding for a deal on immigrants brought to the country as young people and now here illegally or using a national emergency declaration to build the wall while trump made clear during his press conference that talk on daca the deferred action for childhood arrivals program would have to wait and that he was trying to negotiate with congress on the wall the conversations underscored rising republican anxiety about just how to exit the shutdown seeking to ease concerns the white house sought to frame the weekend talks as a step forward as did mcconnell who described plans for a working group though people familiar with the meeting said that phrase never actually came up trump designated vice president mike pence homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen and adviser jared kushner to work with a congressional delegation over the weekend that meeting is set for 11 a m saturday the white house said some gop senators up for re election in 2020 voiced discomfort with the shutdown in recent days including cory gardner of colorado and susan collins of maine putting additional pressure on republicans but with staff level talks there is always an open question of whether trump s aides are fully empowered to negotiate for the president earlier this week he rejected his own administration s offer to accept 2 5 billion for the wall that proposal was made when pence and other top officials met at the start of the shutdown with schumer during his free wheeling session with reporters trump also wrongly claimed that he d never called for the wall to be concrete trump did so repeatedly during his campaign describing a wall of pre cast concrete sections that would be higher than the walls of many of his rally venues he repeated that promise just days ago an all concrete wall was never abandoned as has been reported by the media some areas will be all concrete but the experts at border patrol prefer a wall that is see through thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides makes sense to me he tweeted on dec 31 trump was joined by pence in the rose garden as well as house republican leaders kevin mccarthy and steve scalise mcconnell who went back to the capitol unaware of the press conference said it was encouraging that the white house officials and the congressional contingent would meet over the weekend to see if they can reach an agreement and then punt it back to us for final sign off schumer said that if mcconnell and senate republicans stay on the sidelines trump can keep the government shut down for a long time the president needs an intervention schumer said and senate republicans are just the right ones to intervene adding to national unease about the shutdown are economic jitters as analysts warn of the risks of closures that are disrupting government operations across multiple departments and agencies at a time of other uncertainties in the stock market and foreign trade in their first votes of the new congress house democrats approved bills thursday night to re open government at previously agreed upon levels several republicans crossed over to join them white house and department of homeland security officials have spent recent days trying to make both a public and private case that the situation at the border has reached a crisis point polls show a majority of americans oppose the border wall although

washington ap days after reclaiming the house majority democrats are introducing gun control legislation timed for the anniversary of the shooting of former democratic rep gabby giffords speaker nancy pelosi and other democrats will introduce a bill to expand background checks for sales and transfers of firearms on tuesday the eighth anniversary of the day giffords was shot in the head at a constituent meeting in arizona giffords who co founded a gun safety group with her husband mark kelly said in a statement friday she was thrilled that her former house colleagues were responding to a gun violence epidemic that killed nearly 40 000 people in 2017 the bill expanding background checks marks a critical first step toward strengthening america s gun laws and making our country a safer place to live work study worship and play giffords said i stand ready to do everything in my power to get this legislation across the finish line democrats promised swift action on gun control after the party regained the house majority following eight years of republican rule pelosi called the bill on background checks a common sense measure and cited polls showing 97 percent of americans support background checks for all gun sales house speaker nancy pelosi of calif speaks to reporters as she arrives back at the capitol building after meeting with president donald trump about border security in the situation room of the white house in washington friday jan 4 2019 ap photo andrew harnik our democratic majority will press relentlessly for bipartisan progress to end the epidemic of gun violence on our streets in our schools and in our places of worship pelosi said enough is enough rep mike thompson d calif who leads a gun violence prevention task force in the house said he and other lawmakers from both parties have been pushing years to expand background checks and approve other gun related bills but have been stymied by republican leaders noting that many freshman democrats ran on the issue of preventing gun violence thompson said political momentum to address gun violence is growing the american people have been demanding we take action and this new congress will deliver he said the background checks measure is likely to face opposition from the republican controlled senate and the white house where president donald trump has promised to protect the second amendment jennifer baker a spokeswoman for the national rifle association said a federal background check did not prevent giffords shooting adding that so called universal background checks will never be universal because criminals do not comply with the law lawmakers should deal with the root cause of violent crime instead of trying to score political points and push ineffective legislation that doesn t stop criminals from committing crimes baker said the trump administration moved last month to ban bump stocks the firearm attachments that allow semi automatic weapons to fire like machine guns bump stocks became a focal point of the gun control debate after they were used in october 2017 by a gunman in las vegas who fired into a crowd at a country music concert killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more a new regulation gives gun owners until late march to turn in or destroy the devices
us job creation vaults higher in 2018 the surge in us employment in december was helped by a jump in manufacturing jobs notably for durable goods us job creation rocketed higher last month a jolt of unexpected good news for president donald trump as his economic agenda comes under increasing strain with an unexpectedly strong finish to 2018 the blowout us jobs numbers were a reminder that the world s largest economy remains in good health for the moment sharply contrasting with gloom on global financial markets in recent weeks fears over a slowing world economy last month caused stock prices to tumble and confidence waned among corporations who foresee dwindling demand and weakening sales in 2019 but the december jobs news helped prompt a rebound on wall street with all three major indices rallying after thursday s rout employers added a whopping 312 000 net new positions for the month smashing economists expectations and wages rose steadily gaining 3 2 percent for the year the unemployment rate ticked up by two tenths of a point to 3 9 percent but mostly because the labor force grew as more workers joined the job hunt according to the closely watched report and net job gains in october and november were revised up a combined 58 000 the labor department said job creation last year rose to a monthly average of 220 000 positions far higher than the 182 000 recorded in 2017 but lower than 2014 and 2015 a sign that 2018 was boosted by unusual tax cuts and fiscal stimulus the fresh signal that although wall street may be ailing the real economy is chugging along was sure to delight trump rising interest rates however the new evidence of a strong economy could add to the case for the federal reserve to continue to raise interest rates this year something trump has aggressively and publicly complained about the us unemployment rate ticked up two tenths in december but that was largely due to more workers joining the labor force forecasts from fed officials last month indicated they expect just two rate hikes in 2019 amid signs of weakness rather than three jim o sullivan of high frequency economics said the unemployment rate is already low enough to put upward pressure on labor costs the recent turmoil in markets is raising the likelihood of some slowing ahead although these data provide a reminder of how strong the trend has been before whatever slowing occurs he said wall street forged higher following the jobs news aided by an announcement that us china trade talks were due to resume next week in beijing the rally kicked into high gear and the dow jones industrial average ended with a posting a 3 3 percent gain also helped by federal reserve chairman jerome powell who said the us central bank would be patient in deciding on any further increases in the benchmark lending rates trump faces protracted political battles in 2019 and the danger he could be blamed should the economy stumble amid a government shutdown and a stinging trade war with china hiring last month jumped in healthcare bars and restaurants construction and notably in manufacturing especially for durable goods fabricated metal products and computers and electronics all sectors that complain of lower profits and lost sales due to global trade tensions the report also suggested there was rising hope among job seekers the labor force participation rate a measure of the total supply of employed people and those available and searching for work rose to its highest level since september 2017 at 63 1 percent of the working age population the 3 2 percent wage gains compared to 2017 also meant workers saw increased purchasing power as consumer inflation over the same period was a slower 2 2 percent the sudden jump in hiring could be explained by weather effects as much of the nation experienced unusually cold temperatures during the november survey week while december was unseasonably warm we expected a strong payroll number after the distortions of recent months due to two hurricanes the california fires and the very cold november survey week but this is spectacular said economist ian shepherdson of pantheon macroeconomics advertisement but he cautioned that this pace can t be sustained

jinping agreed dec 1 to postpone further hikes the two countries hope to have positive and constructive discussions said a chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang the trade war has its roots in american anxiety about china s emergence as a competitor in telecoms solar power and other technologies and complaints by washington europe and other trading partners that beijing s tactics violate

industries trump and xi agreed to a 90 day postponement of more tariff increases due to take effect jan 1 but economists say that is too little time to resolve the sprawling disputes that bedevil u s

ap norc poll immigration among the top concerns in 2019 as much of the u s government remains shut down over president donald trump s insistence on funding for his border wall nearly half of americans identify immigration as a top issue for the government to work on this year an associated press norc center for public affairs research poll conducted shortly before the shutdown began finds that both republicans and democrats are far more likely to include immigration in their list of top issues facing the country this year compared with a year ago overall 49 percent mentioned immigration in an open ended question as one of the top five problems they hoped the government addresses in 2019 by contrast 27 percent mentioned immigration in december 2017 partisan divides on the best solutions remain deep republicans continue to be more likely to cite immigration as a top issue than democrats an indication of the gop s greater intensity on the issue but it s an increasingly important issue to members of both parties the poll found that 65 percent of republicans say immigration is one of the top five problems facing the country up from 42 percent in 2017 among democrats 37 percent cite immigration as a top issue compared with just 2 in 10 a year ago roughly two thirds of those who named immigration as a top priority express little confidence in the government to make progress this year including a third who say they are not at all confident about a third say they are at least moderately confident in the government to make progress on immigration this follows a year of

top priorities for the government other polls show that their opinions on the issue diverge dramatically for example a december poll by cnn found that 78 percent of republicans and just 8 percent of democrats supported building a border wall and with their party still in control of the white house and the senate republicans are more optimistic about the government making progress on immigration this year among those who prioritize immigration republicans are more than three times as likely as democrats to express some confidence that the government will make progress that includes david hoyt

asylum as more migrants from central america try to do so at the mexican border we re america we re the wealthiest nation in the world in terms of resources and saying we re not going to take in the poor huddled masses butino said we can maintain our own safety but we can also be generous the economy remains a top priority for americans with 62 percent citing related issues including mentions of jobs unemployment taxes and trade nearly half of americans also identify health care as one of the top five issues facing the country unchanged from one year ago a traditionally democratic issue health care is named by democrats more than republicans 56 percent versus 43 percent there was a sharp rise in environmental and climate issues after a year of wildfires and hurricanes a change that is largely driven by democrats overall about a quarter of americans mention the environment as a top issue about 4 in 10 democrats include the environment as a priority compared with just 8 percent of republicans the share of democrats naming the environment has grown 11 percentage points since a year ago the poll was conducted in december before the stock market gyrations and government shutdown gil parks a retired cpa who s become a rancher in texas is fine with the shutdown it s only 25 percent of the government he said parks a 59 year old republican is optimistic the country could be in for a long stretch of economic growth in part because of the partisan acrimony fueling the shutdown if you look back in history the economy did best when government couldn t get in the way he said with democrats assuming control of the house of representatives the inevitable gridlock could preserve the economic expansion parks argued republicans are more likely than democrats to be optimistic but feelings about the country are mixed even within the gop six in 10 americans are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country as a whole including 79 percent of democrats and 42 percent of republicans among republicans that s a slight increase from 33 percent who were dissatisfied with the state of the country in october still republicans are far more likely than democrats today to say they re satisfied with the way things are going in the country 39 percent to 9 percent the unhappiness on both sides of the aisle is palpable to john rossetti a 47 year old code enforcement officer in youngstown ohio there s a really different negative environment rossetti said everywhere you go it s there just a very negative atmosphere rossetti describes himself as a moderate to conservative democrat who didn t support trump in 2016 but was rooting for him to succeed now he s disillusioned and pessimistic about the future and he s not alone americans are more likely to think things in the country will get worse in the next year than that they will get better 42 percent to 32 percent more americans do think 2019 will be a better year for them personally than think it will get worse 37 percent to 18 percent but another 45 percent say there won t be much difference rossetti has only had two small raises in the past 12 years he s worked for youngstown

washington ap u s employers went on a hiring spree in december adding a surprising 312 000 jobs and providing a dose of reassurance about the economy after a turbulent few months on wall street the job gains reported friday by the labor department came despite a trade war with china a global slowdown and a partial government shutdown now entering its third week the nation s unemployment rate rose slightly to 3 9 percent last month but that too was considered a positive sign reflecting an increase in americans beginning to look for work and average hourly pay improved 3 2 percent from a year ago stocks surged on the news along with word that the u s and china will hold trade talks next week and comments from federal reserve chairman jerome powell that the fed will be flexible in judging whether to raise interest rates further the dow jones industrial average shot up 747 points or 3 3 percent president donald trump called the job growth great on twitter the torrid hiring in december far outstripped the 180 000 jobs investors had been anticipating and could help ease fears that the economy s expansion now in the middle of its 10th year may be coming to an end file in this nov 2 2017 file photo a recruiter from the postal service right speaks with an attendee of a job fair in the cafeteria of deer lakes high school in cheswick pa even with fear of a global economic slump depressing stock markets friday jan 4 2019 jobs report for december is expected to offer reassurance that the u s economy remains sturdy and on track to expand for a 10th straight year ap photo keith srakocic file the labor market is very strong even though the economy appears to be slowing said eric winograd senior u s economist at the investment management firm alliancebernstein those two things cannot coexist for very long either weakening demand will lead firms to dial back the pace of hiring or the robust pace of hiring will lead firms to ramp back up production in recent weeks financial markets have plunged amid concerns that the u s could be in a recession by 2020 the dow suffered its worst december since the middle of the depression in 1931 major companies such as apple say their sales are being jeopardized by the tariff war between washington and beijing and an important gauge of u s manufacturing posted its steepest decline in a decade thursday china the world s second largest economy is also mired in a slowdown its consumers losing much of their appetite for real estate iphones ford vehicles and jewelry from tiffany co the u s government shutdown and trump s attacks on the fed and its chairman over the central bank s rate increases have also worried investors though powell may have eased some of those concerns friday when he stressed that he would not resign if the president told him to do so the strong job growth suggests employers believe u s consumer spending will stay robust health care and education added 82 000 jobs last month the largest jump in nearly nine years restaurants and drinking places posted a net gain of 40 700 jobs builders added 38 000 construction jobs while manufacturers increased their payrolls by 32 000 workers businesses are still searching for more workers fresh coat painters based in cincinnati plans to nearly double the 300 employees who paint homes and businesses as it expands this year across this country the franchiser is also launching an apprenticeship program to attract workers in addition to providing higher pay and benefits tara riley president of fresh coat said that franchise owners are having to actively search for workers instead of simply posting ads we realized it was a mindset change you have to be recruiting rather than hiring riley said still kevin hassett chairman of the white house council of economic advisers cautioned on thursday that the jobs report for january could be weak if the shutdown continues job totals could be lowered by hundreds of thousands of government employees being temporarily put out of work so when we see the january jobs number it could be a big negative hassett said in 2018 employers added 2 6 million jobs or an average of nearly 220 000 a month according to the labor department at some point even if the economy remains healthy monthly job gains will likely downshift to a more gradual pace this is because there is a dwindling pool of unemployed people there were 6 3 million people looking for a job in december down from 6 5 million a year ago people should not get used to numbers like the one we saw this month said martha gimbel director of economic research at the jobs site indeed eventually job growth is going to start slowing down when that happens we shouldn t panic
in another attack on the second amendment the boulder colorado city council voted unanimously on may 15th 2018 to ban the sale and possession of many semi automatic rifles pistols shotguns bump stocks and magazines holding more than 10 rounds boulder has never seen a murder committed with one of the banned firearms but it has with a baseball bat so perhaps they should have banned baseball bats instead this unconstitutional move did nothing to address actual crime but instead criminalized and demonized law abiding gun owners according to the boulder daily camera the day after the vote a federal lawsuit was filed that claims the ordinance violates the plaintiffs constitutional rights a claim council members had contested saying the second amendment doesn t guarantee the right to an assault rifle residents who owned any of the illegal firearms before june 15th 2018 could grandfather their guns in the city s this is not a registry program and get a certificate this program ended on dec 31 boulder residents weren t very interested in obeying this new law according to the washington times only 342 assault weapons or semiautomatic rifles were certified by boulder police before the dec 31 deadline meaning there could be thousands of residents in the scenic university town of 107 000 in violation of the sweeping gun control ordinance i would say the majority of people i ve talked to just aren t complying because most people see this as a registry said lesley hollywood executive director of the colorado second amendment group rally for our rights boulder actually has a very strong firearms community the firearms community in boulder they may be democrats but they love their firearms said ms hollywood herself a former boulder resident the times adds judging by the numbers however most boulder firearms owners have chosen to do none of the above albeit quietly what makes this nullification of the new law even more interesting is that boulder is considered the most liberal city in colorado in fact unless the population drastically in the past fifteen months boulder is a very democratic area some boulder residents have chosen not to be quiet about it some are banding together and publicly defying the city s un american move they ve launched a we will not comply movement jon caldara president of the free market independence institute columnist for the denver post and host of a public affairs show on colorado public television called devil s advocate has publicly announced his noncompliance with the new law in boulder if your core beliefs include dressing as the opposite gender or following the teachings of the koran our city government will bend over backward to protect you from those who wish to separate you from your community you d never be forced to self identify to government authorities to submit to inspection to be registered and made to pay fees to keep your core beliefs my strong belief in my second amendment rights is core to who i am i know that is not understood by many today however i am not asking to be understood i m asking to be left alone i am asking for progressives who run city government to live up to their assertion of tolerance and just let me be because i own a long gun with a pistol grip and a detachable magazine i had to the end of december to self identify to the police present myself for investigation and my gun for inspection pay fees in order to receive a police issued permission slip all to avoid jail time monetary penalties and the confiscation and destruction of my gun i have never been convicted or even charged with a crime in my 54 years of life but this week i became a criminal i am no different than potentially thousands of other boulderites who cannot bring themselves to submit to this ugliness and yes i know most people today don t see this as ugly or intolerant but simply a reasonable thing to do about this epidemic after all something needs to be done for publicly stating that i will not comply my daughter has been targeted at her boulder school the one with posters celebrating tolerance and diversity all over the walls my refusal to submit has been commented on by teachers in front of their classes she has been ganged up on by students and bullied because her father is a murderer she is worried that i will be taken to jail as a single dad to her and her handicapped brother i have to admit i m worried about that too i respect the police greatly the cops i know hate the idea of enforcing this intolerance i ask them when they come to arrest me and confiscate my guns they give me enough warning so my kids aren t around when they do it it s not the boulder police that should get involved it s the state police because the new boulder law not only violates the second amendment to the u s constitution but it breaks colorado state law c r s 29 11 7 103 a local government may not enact an ordinance regulation or other law that prohibits the sale purchase or possession of a firearm that a person may lawfully sell purchase or possess under state or federal law any such ordinance regulation or other law enacted by a local government prior to march 18 2003 is void and unenforceable the objection to this boulder colorado gun law is bi partisan it s long past time for it to be overturned on a bi partisan basis and quickly followed by recalling the city council members or voting them out of office h t godfather politics
however it still marks a significant reversal for an event which has jokingly been referred to as the chinese electronics show in recent years as big names such as huawei technologies and fleets of component suppliers from the pearl river delta region have flocked to the casino town to show off their latest wares not a big surprise perhaps given the current us china trade stand off and a rising war of words between the world s two biggest economies over leadership in a range of cutting edge technologies and innovations such as artificial intelligence and 5g mobile networks the annual ces consumer electronics trade show in las vegas the biggest technology and consumer electronics exhibition in the world with around 175 000 expected attendees and 4 000 exhibitors will kick off this week with about 20 per cent fewer chinese merchants chinese companies are concerned about tariffs from the trade war said shaun rein managing director of shanghai based china market research group attending a show like ces is expensive and with trump s rhetoric towards chinese technology companies in china are rethinking their strategy of investing in the us in this file photo taken on january 7 2017 a woman wears a flir virtual reality simulator during ces in las vegas nevada photo afp a total of 1 211 chinese companies have registered to be part of the trade show this year according to the ces exhibitor directory as of january 4 compared to 1 751 companies from the us the chinese number is down about 20 per cent from a record 1 551 last year according to statistics provided by ces organiser the consumer technology association cta china remains a top international market at ces with many chinese companies exhibiting at the show to build their brand and forge partnerships said cta in a statement on sunday pointing out that the actual floor area taken up by chinese exhibitors was roughly equal to 2018 due to slightly more space offered to bigger exhibitors and slightly less to smaller merchants specifically we have seen notable growth from large chinese companies such as alibaba baidu changhong byton dji haier hisense jd com konka lenovo suning and tcl looking to build brand awareness and form global partnerships at ces said cta the dip in chinese representation comes amid a 90 day truce in the months long us china trade war which has seen both superpowers slap each other with billions of dollars in tariffs a slowing of china s economy and stock market slides around the world tensions have also been exacerbated by canada s arrest of huawei chief financial officer meng wanzhou at the behest of the us which has accused her of fraudulently representing huawei to get around us sanctions on iran within china though the move has been widely seen as a politically motivated step by the us to gain leverage during trade war negotiations a view that was encouraged when us president donald trump said in an interview in december that he would intervene with the us justice department in the case against meng if it would help secure a trade deal with beijing this has fanned nationalist sentiment in china leading to fears of a patriotism fuelled boycott of us products when you re facing an economic slowdown companies need to refocus and ask themselves what their core business is and identify the markets they are more confident in where they can get market share said kitty fok managing director of industry research firm idc china for a lot of chinese companies china is still their primary market so it s not surprising that they shy away from the us at this time of economic uncertainty some hard economic realities remain though the us is still the world s largest consumer market with americans spending us 12 5 trillion in 2017 nearly three times as much as china according to capstone advisory group this has made the us a big draw for chinese companies for years many of whom view breaking into the us as a major milestone and an important marker in their quest to go global this explains why although some chinese companies are adopting a more cautious approach to ces this year there will nevertheless still be a sizeable chinese presence shanghai based abilix an educational robot maker that was an exhibitor at ces 2018 has decided not to participate this year on concerns it could incur tariffs on its products by selling to the us amid the trade war currently we still sell to the american market but it is not our major focus said an abilix marketing employee surnamed li in a phone call li declined to give her full name as staff were not authorised to speak to media meanwhile wang a sales employee with a shenzhen based cosmetic devices company said that the firm was adopting a more careful approach towards its budget for 2019 and had decided to focus on other more trade specific events that are better value for money we considered a booth at ces but the booth location was not ideal said wang who also declined to give a full name with the economic uncertainty many companies are being more conservative with their spending this subdued approach applies not only to smaller firms but also to large chinese companies that were the focus of last year s show unlike last year no chinese companies are part of the line up of keynote speakers at ces 2019 during ces 2018 huawei s consumer devices chief richard yu was a keynote speaker and the chinese telecoms giant was widely expected to announce a deal with us carrier at t to sell its devices to us consumers during yu s keynote the company also had huge billboards and adverts put up of huawei celebrity spokeswoman gal gadot of wonder woman fame advertising its mate 10 pro smartphone presaging current troubles the huawei and at t deal fell through at the last minute over national security concerns and yu put on a brave face in front of a crowded ballroom during his keynote defending huawei s privacy record and calling the us carrier s snub a bigger loss for consumers who do not have the best choice in the market this year it is understood that huawei will scale back its presence at ces focusing instead on the mobile world congress in barcelona spain in february the faraday future ff91 electric car is unveiled in 2017 at ces in las vegas nevada photo bloomberg meanwhile xpeng motors the chinese electric vehicle start up that made a splash at ces in 2018 by debuting its first mass production vehicle is not expected to exhibit this year and has put its primary focus on the domestic market trump s trade war makes it impossible for chinese companies to be treated fairly and invest properly especially in the tech sector so do not want to go said cmrg s rein and because of the meng situation chinese are also afraid of travelling to the us in case they get arrested this year s situation needs to be kept in perspective though the 1 200 exhibitors from china this year still represent close to a third of all exhibitors at ces it s still the chinese electronics show over 1 200 exhibitors is crazy no other country sends this many companies to ces said jeffrey towson an investment professor at peking university both the us and china are big markets neither can ignore the other he said the us and china will always do business together although today s uncertainty may prevent irreversible investment shorter term stuff like deals are still easy to do this article appeared in the south china morning post print edition as fewer chinese firms on show at tech expochinese companies cut back presence at world s biggest electronics event

washington ap federal reserve chairman jerome powell said friday that he will not resign if asked to do so by president donald trump and that he is prepared to be patient in deciding when to raise interest rates again both of those messages cheered stock market investors who had been worried about trump s repeated attacks on his hand picked choice to lead the nation s central bank and also the fed s seemingly inexorable march to higher rates there is no pre set path for policy powell said during an appearance at a conference of economists in atlanta with the muted inflation readings we have seen coming in we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves private economists viewed powell s comments as a strong signal that the fed which in december had projected another two rate hikes in 2019 may end up deciding to pause hikes for several months with chairman powell s remarks today i would say they will do just one hike or maybe no hikes this year said sung won sohn chief economist at ss economics powell is definitely trying to calm the markets wall street which opened sharply higher after a report showing 312 000 jobs gained in december surged even higher during powell s appearance the dow jones industrial average finished the day up 746 points or 3 3 percent powell called the jobs report very strong and said he was also encouraged by the rise in the labor force participation rate and gains in wages which he said for me at this time does not raise concerns about too high inflation trump has complained that the fed has pushed rates higher despite the fact that there is no evidence that inflation was getting out of control the president s attacks had become so intense that they had raised concerns that he might be considering firing powell a development which could send the market into a tailspin trump would appear to be on shaky legal ground if he tried to fire powell under the law that governs the federal reserve a president can only remove a fed chairman for cause courts in cases that involved other agencies have interpreted that language to not cover policy differences asked if he would resign if trump asked him to do so powell responded with a short no powell s willingness to be flexible on interest rates was welcome news to investors many of whom worried that fed chair risked cutting off the current economic expansion by continuing to raise interest rates despite signs the u s economy was cooling off a little on friday powell said we are always prepared to shift the stance of policy and to shift it significantly if necessary to meet the goals of maximum employment and stable prices powell gave as an example the fact that in 2016 when janet yellen was fed chair the central bank began the year with a projection that it would raise rates four times that year but ended up raising rates only once because the economy hit a soft patch appearing on a panel with his two predecessors yellen and ben bernanke powell also said that the fed could alter its approach to trimming its huge balance sheet if it determines such a change is needed the pace of fed rate hikes and the lowering of the balance sheet which tends to put upward pressure on interest rates had both been concerns of investors in recent months the stock market has seen stomach churning declines since october a development that trump has blamed on the fed s continued rate hikes although the president s trade dispute with china as well as concerns about global economic growth also played a part in the market volatility the fed had increased the size of its balance sheet four fold to a record 4 5 trillion in an effort to push long term interest rates lower but it has been gradually reversing that stance over the past year although the balance sheet still remains above 4 trillion but some investors have worried that that process could push long term rates higher at a time when the economy was slowing powell on friday stressed that the fed was prepared to adjust the pace at which it trimmed the balance sheet if necessary to support economic growth while trump has sent out a number of tweets criticizing powell and calling the fed the biggest threat to the economy powell said that he had not received any direct pressure from the white house asked if he had had any face to face meetings with trump powell said he had not although he said previous fed leaders have had discussions from time to time with previous presidents
a local man lays out various arguments about the alr food security housing and more dear editor will eliminating monster homes help or hurt the alr with a turnover in provincial government the ndp didn t waste time in implementing several policies to strengthen one legacy that many british columbians regardless of partisanship are proud of the agricultural land reserve one such policy intended on protecting the alr from speculators is the recent legislation to limit house sizes on the alr to 5 400 sq ft throughout the province in response to the mansions being built within its city limits the new richmond council is pushing it a step further and voted to limit homes on farmland to 4 300 sq ft i say this as a staunch supporter of the agricultural land reserve limiting home sizes could hurt small business in bc and promote massive corporate takeovers of local farms limiting home sizes is a damaging way allegedly fight one type of speculation only to open the door to another while also risking our regional food security in the process with the township of langley council throwing monster homes toward a council priority planning meeting it s time to convey a better argument against this than boohoo i want to build my big house and now i can t sorry but no one has pity for people who want 10 000 sq ft homes first of all reducing home sizes doesn t really fight speculation at all speculation is defined as investment in stocks property or other ventures in the hope of gain but with the risk of loss when someone purchases alr land to build a massive home there is no speculation there is zero increase in land value when the massive home is built there is no risk in the purchase because the buyer knew exactly what the limitations of the property were when they bought it and built a building within those rules in fact building a massive home actually decreases the chance of speculation because speculators want to pay the least amount possible for the land for future development buying land with a substantial improvement value such as huge mansion is an incredible deterrent to speculation speculation on the alr happens when a buyer believes that the land he she they are purchasing on the cheap may be excluded from the alr in the future for the purposes of re development or re zoning for smaller lots and now ironically smaller homes hence substantially increasing their home value this legislation does nothing to defend the alr from this in fact the legislation might actually stir many homeowners who intended to build larger homes to now change their strategy and try to get an exclusion which leads me to the crux of my argument farmers don t become farmers by accident it is becoming increasingly rare for elderly farmers to pass down the family business to younger generations farming doesn t have the same appeal as it use to especially for young people in metro vancouver surrounded by many other opportunities there will now be even less incentive to be a farmer than there was before your farm business needs to more than compensate for the lack of housing appreciation for it to make sense a business minded person can t underestimate the expected appreciation of the housing market if all other home appreciate 6 when yours appreciates 2 that should be considered a loss what is the main way to make farming viable in a capitalist society co housing or keeping it in the family hiring outside help is expensive so what we see are farmers often immigrants or those of indo canadian descent who come from a very different culture where multiple generations living in the same household is the norm so instead of three or four families buying off site properties or trying to build multiple homes on one property they build one large one not only is it more economical for the family it is actually a vastly reduced footprint which is better for the environment even one 10 000 sq ft house with a 3 400 sq ft footprint is more sustainable than three 4 500 sq ft homes with 1 500 sq ft footprints will substantially reducing home size limits deter rich buyers from building massive estates on farmland certainly but it will also deter middle class farmers from getting into or even continuing to work the land which is more important for our regional food security not only will farmland have an even harder time to appreciate relative to other properties which means it will make it harder for them to sell retire but now they can t improve their land relative to non alr properties either what happens when all those who were going to farm their land are now deterred from farming they will sell who will they sell to in an industry already desperate to attract farmers and now with multiple generational farming families being attacked by the government enter the corporations as in the united states where large corporations have all but taken over due to the economy of scale expect the same to happen here there is already a major saturation of farmland already on the market as i write this on december 28 2018 a usual low inventory period there are currently 357 homes over 5 acres for sale in the fraser valley with few buyers there have been 61 sales in the fraser valley over the last 90 days an average of 20 per month a sales to listing ratio of 5 6 there is a disproportionate number of 65 year old baby boomer farmers looking at late retirement in the coming 5 10 years this combination can expect increased inventory and decreased land value potential which will push land prices down while the intent of a short sited government was to reduce farmland prices for young farmers that isn t what is likely to happen instead it has created an environment ripe for corporations looking to consolidate 10 100 acre parcels into larger american style mega farms instead of owner operators and small business entrepreneurs large farming corporations will push the agricultural industry to reduce full time employment automate farming systems and empower an american style powerful anti regulation lobby that has an extreme interest in capital instead of food security and health welcome to the land of unintended consequences the real solution if the provincial government richmond council and future municipalities really wanted to tackle the problem of estates on the alr that is homeowners who buy farmland to live on fancy estates instead of use the land for farming all they would have needed to do is change the tax legislation one of the incentives for people to people to buy on farmland whether they farm the property or not is the farm tax exemption the current exemption threshold however is quite frankly a joke a 10 000 on land less than 8 hectares 1 98 acres b 2 500 on land between 8 hectares 1 98 acres and 4 hectares 10 acres c on land larger than 4 hectares 10 acres you must earn 2 500 plus five per cent of the actual value of any farm land in excess of 4 hectares d 10 000 in order to qualify unused land where the area in production by the owner makes up at least 25 per cent of the portion of the parcel outside the alr some sales of qualifying agricultural products must occur every year how quickly do you think someone could gross 2 500 or 10 000 with one of the many different qualified farm uses literally a few legal marijuana plants could get you a tax exemption don t quote me on the legalities or plant yields it isn t my specialty regardless showing the government such low gross revenue to gain a massive tax exemption doesn t exactly promote sustainable farming in anyway to promote farming and fight both speculation and non farm uses of alr land this threshold needs to be substantially increases and i believe farm exemptions should be approved by the alc on a case by case basis to prove to the alc that the farm is actually a farm otherwise let them pay an exorbitant tax on their 10 000 sq ft estate even on a sliding scale so that the larger the property the greater tax percentage you pay for not farming on farm land it isn t as if this wasn t considered before the bc liberal government looked into this in 2016 but that apparently went no where the ndp had the opportunity to do the right thing but for whatever reason dropped the ball on this one and is instigating a witch hunt against a small demographic in two industries they don t understand a personal note the hardest thing about writing this argument is that it puts me at odds with many of the people i look up to and appreciate richmond councillor harold steeves and many others have fought tirelessly to protect the alr from sprawl exemptions and other invasions while i completely agree with the intent i simply believe the majority of my pro alr peers are too focused on their lobby instead of looking at the larger picture this issue shows why allies in other industries are needed as we provide a different paradigm developers investors and speculators and realtors think differently than farmers politicians and activists if we are to protect the alr we need to see the bigger picture and anticipate how the capitalist system evolves and

actually 2018 was a pretty good year the year 2018 will be deplored by pundits as a bad year of more unpredictable donald trump headlined by wild stock market gyrations the melodramas of the robert mueller investigation and the musical chair tenures of officials in the trump administration the government is still shut down talk of impeachment by the newly democrat controlled house of representatives is in the air seemingly every day there are sensational breakthroughs scandals and bombshells that race through social media and the internet only to be forgotten by the next day in truth aside from the washington hysterias 2018 was a most successful year for americans in december the united states reached a staggering level of oil production pumping some 11 6 million barrels per day for the first time since 1973 america is now the world s largest oil producer since trump took office the u s has increased its oil production by nearly 3 million barrels per day largely as the result of fewer regulations more federal leasing and the continuing brilliance of american frackers and horizontal drillers it appears that there is still far more oil beneath u s soil than has ever been taken out american production could even soar higher in the months ahead in addition the united states remains the largest producer of natural gas and the second greatest producer of coal the scary old energy related phraseology of the last half century energy crisis peak oil oil embargo no longer exists near total energy self sufficiency means the u s is no longer strategically leveraged by the middle east forced to pay exorbitant political prices to guarantee access to imported oil or threatened by gasoline prices of 4 to 5 a gallon the american economy grew by 4 2 percent in the second quarter of 2018 and by 3 4 percent in the third quarter american gdp is nearly 1 7 trillion larger than in january 2017 and nearly 8 trillion larger than the gdp of china for all the talk of the chinese juggernaut three chinese workers produce about 60 percent of the goods and services produced by one american worker in 2018 unemployment fell to a near record peacetime low of 3 7 percent that s the lowest u s unemployment rate since 1969 black unemployment hit an all time low in 2018 for the first time in memory employers are seeking out entry level workers rather than vice versa the poverty rate is also near a historic low and household income increased there are about 8 million fewer americans living below the poverty line than there were eight years ago since january 2017 more than 3 million americans have gone off so called food stamps abroad lots of bad things that were supposed to happen simply did not after withdrawing from the paris climate accord the u s exceeded the annual percentage of carbon reductions of most countries that are part of the agreement north korea and the u s did not go to war instead north korea has stopped its provocative nuclear testing and its launching of ballistic missiles over the territory of its neighbors despite all the trump bluster nato and nafta did not quite implode rather allies and partners agreed to renegotiate past commitments and agreements on terms more favorable to the u s the united states and increasingly most of the world is at last addressing the systematic commercial cheating technological appropriation overt espionage intellectual property theft cyber intrusions and mercantilism of the chinese government the middle east is still chaotic but it is a mess that is now far less important to the u s for a variety of reasons energy wise america is not dependent on oil imports from corrupt gulf monarchies or hostile islamic states strategy wise the new fault lines are not arab and islamic cultures versus israel or the united states instead it is internecine strife within the islamic world mostly with iran and its shiite satellites opposing the sunni arab monarchies and more moderate middle eastern regimes for all the pro and anti trump invective and media hysteria the brett kavanaugh confirmation circus and the bitter midterm elections the u s was relatively calm in 2018 compared with the rest of the world there was none of the mass rioting demonstrations and street violence that occurred recently in france and none of the existential and unsolvable divides over globalization and brexit that we saw in europe europe s three most powerful leaders angela merkel or germany emmanuel macron of france and theresa may of the united kingdom have worse approval ratings than the embattled donald trump in sum the more media pundits claimed that america was on the brink of disaster in 2018 the more americans became prosperous and secure c 2019 tribune content agency llc
a little optimism could go a long way in driving these oil stocks higher this year last year was the best of times and then the worst of times for the oil industry oil prices went from scorching hot touching a four and a half year high in early october to turning cold by year end closing nearly 20 lower for the year that sell off in the oil market took most oil stocks down with it as the s p oil gas exploration and production etf which holds nearly 70 oil stocks slumped 28 6 in 2018 however last year s slump could lead to a big bounce back in 2019 if oil prices begin rebounding off their lows while that rising tide would likely lift all boats noble energy nbl devon energy dvn 0 95 and cimarex energy xec could be among the best performers here s why doing everything right noble energy s stock sank 35 6 last year that slump comes even though 2018 was a strong year for the oil and gas company production rose sharply through the third quarter with its output in the u s up 18 year over year while its israeli assets set sales records meanwhile the company did a great job keeping a lid on costs as capital expenses came in at the low end of its guidance range while operational costs were below expectations noble energy also continued shoring up its balance sheet by closing 358 million in asset sales which boosted its liquidity to 4 7 billion that strong balance sheet when combined with its cash flow enabled noble to continue paying its dividend while repurchasing 233 million in its stock noble energy s performance last year puts it in a solid position for 2019 the company s low cost business has it set up to grow production at a 20 compound annual growth rate cagr through 2020 while its cash flow could expand at a 35 cagr assuming oil averages 50 a barrel which is right around the current price moreover noble estimates that it can generate 1 5 billion in excess cash over that time frame giving it even more money to repurchase its beaten down stock those dual fuels of growing at a high rate while returning more cash to investors could enable noble to produce high octane returns in 2019 if it can just get a little nudge from higher oil prices a shrinking supply of stock shares of devon energy tanked last year falling 45 6 that plunge came even though the company made significant strides one of the biggest has been on its balance sheet where debt declined 40 due in part to the sale of the company s midstream businesses for 3 125 billion those sales when combined with some other noncore asset divestitures as well as the free cash flow generated by devon s operations put an extra 5 billion into its coffers last year devon is currently using 4 billion of that money to buy back stock it had already spent 2 7 billion through the third quarter of last year to retire 13 of its outstanding shares it expects to complete its current program in early 2019 which could reduce its share count by more than 20 meanwhile with more cash likely coming in the door during 2019 devon could increase its buyback program which could send shares higher this year especially if oil prices improve reshuffling its portfolio to deliver better performance cimarex energy was among the worst performers in its peer group its stock plunged nearly 50 last year that crash comes even though the company made several smart moves among the biggest were cashing in on some noncore assets that bolstered its balance sheet which cimarex then used to acquire rival resolute energy for 1 6 billion in cash and stock resolute energy s assets fit perfectly with cimarex energy s position in the delaware basin thanks to them cimarex can generate higher returns while reducing its costs which should enable the combined company to produce higher earnings and cash flow during 2019 than cimarex could have done as a stand alone entity those stronger results which would be even better if oil improves could provide plenty of fuel for cimarex energy s stock to rebound this year like a phoenix rising from the ashes last year was a tough one for oil investors as the market went from euphoric buying to panic selling in a matter of weeks that sell off however could end up being a great buying opportunity in hindsight because oil stocks that cratered in 2018 could be among this year s biggest gainers if oil prices bounce back that s why investors might want to consider taking a contrarian approach and buying solid oil companies like noble energy devon and cimarex that are coming off a rough year since they stand the best chance at bouncing back in 2019 check out the latest noble energy devon energy and cimarex energy earnings call transcripts

here are three financial sector stocks that could be great long term buys after the recent market drop the stock market s performance hasn t been pretty lately and bank stocks have been hit particularly hard while nobody enjoys watching their portfolio s value drop situations like this produce some of the best long term investment opportunities with that in mind here s why three of our contributors think synchrony financial syf 1 36 first hawaiian fhb 1 68 and american express axp 0 03 are worth a look right now a beaten down buffett bank stock that s worth a look matt frankel cfp synchrony financial there are many great bargains in the financial sector after the recent stock market plunge but one that i m keeping a close eye on right now is synchrony financial if you aren t familiar synchrony is a bank with two major business activities the company is a massive issuer of store branded credit cards with partners such as amazon lowe s and dozens more and synchrony has a rapidly growing high yield savings account platform here s why synchrony is such a great business store credit cards tend to have sky high interest rates when compared with traditional credit cards they do have slightly higher delinquency rates but the high interest income more than makes up for it and even though synchrony s deposit platform pays significantly higher interest than most bank savings accounts it is an excellent source of low cost capital think of it this way if you can lend money out at aprs of close to 30 borrow at 2 2 the current yield of synchrony s savings accounts and about 5 of your loans end up defaulting there s lots of room for profit this is an oversimplification of course but even after accounting for loss reserves and other factors synchrony s net interest margin is a staggering 16 4 synchrony has been especially hard hit recently for a few reasons obviously the broader market sell off didn t help in addition synchrony s business is seen as especially recession prone and it is so recession fears have caused concern and synchrony recently lost a major partner walmart and it will take some time to replace the lost revenue in a nutshell this is an excellent business to invest in especially while it s beaten down due to recession fears and lost revenue that it should ultimately recover check out the latest synchrony earnings call transcript surf s up for this bank stock jordan wathen first hawaiian the hawaiian banking market is unlike anything in the lower 48 u s states just two banks first hawaiian and bank of hawaii control 67 of the state s deposits making them the go to banks for local consumers and commercial customers alike less competition for loans and deposits means first hawaiian can earn attractive returns on its loan portfolio while paying a pittance on deposits consider that it doesn t pay any interest at all on nearly 35 of its deposits and on those on which it does pay interest it pays very little just 0 71 annualized in the most recent quarter first hawaiian shares have been battered this year as the market worries that interest rates may not rise as high as once thought which is fair given the bank s earnings are highly sensitive to interest rate fluctuations even still first hawaiian earned attractive returns even during the banking doldrums of 2011 to 2015 when near zero interest rates weighed on bank earnings across the industry and with little local competition it s hard to believe that it will be forced to pay higher deposit rates if rates simply level out from here at current market prices wall street has effectively priced first hawaiian as if to remove any expectation of increased earnings from rising rates thus shareholders are paying only for what they get a well run banking institution in an attractive market and pay no premium for the potential lift that rising rates give to the bank s margins that kind of free upside makes first hawaiian a very attractive investment for buy and hold investors check out the latest first hawaiian earnings call transcript don t leave home without this stock dan caplinger american express most people see american express solely as the provider of its namesake charge cards which has been a successful business almost since its inception many american express cardholders are willing to pay pricey membership fees in exchange for the cachet that the company s cards have among luxury merchants and despite stiff competition from other credit card network providers amex has been able to sustain much of its competitive advantage yet what many investors don t realize about american express is that it s working hard to keep up with the rapid pace of change in the payment processing industry a recent partnership with paypal holdings and venmo allows users to pay their monthly amex bills and send payments using the paypal and venmo platforms and that could drive further revenue growth for the banking company amex s consumer banking unit is another potential growth driver the company offers online savings accounts and certificates of deposit and that gives it a chance to cross sell card customers with banking products even as the stock has taken a tumble on increased fears of an economic slowdown amex s delinquency rates have thus far remained healthy and that makes the stock look like a relative bargain at these levels check out

around christmas day karl krause and daan colijn started receiving emails from their fans telling them their pictures were being used to promote pedophilia in several viral posts on twitter they were outraged emails krause said they were saying how can that be you are not pro pedophilia i know that krause and colijn are gay travel bloggers who tell their followers of gay friendly and lgbtq owned businesses and communities throughout the world they had no idea their faces were being used to promote an idea they found abhorrent one of their pictures which features krause and colijn kissing in front of a rainbow flag had been stolen by a twitter troll who went by the name alex an account that was created in december the account then tweeted messages promoting pedophilia it s frustrating to see someone misusing our image for political purposes basically supporting an argument against the lgbtq community with our work krause said the account successfully spread across twitter the deliberately defamatory idea that pedophilia is an acceptable part of lgbtq life over the last half decade that concept has become a staple of far right internet trolls on websites like the fringe message board 4chan and the troll s message quickly gained internet traction some far right news websites wrote articles based on the tweet including the federalist papers which published a post with the headline resistance member says pedophilia is sexual orientation claims bigotry one tweet from the troll s account which used the handle vaceyi stated that pedophilia is a sexual orientation you bigots that tweet has drawn more than 16 000 replies and received attention on far right parts of the internet drawing scathing responses from right wing commentator and former major league baseball pitcher curt schilling and pizzagate conspiracy theorist jack posobiec among others they took the fake message seriously and used it to suggest that the lgbtq community supports the sexual abuse of children they are actually trying to argue that pedophiles are an oppressed minority posobiec wrote on twitter attaching screenshots of vaceyi s tweets many warned this day would come various efforts to tie the lgbtq community to pedophilia have been linked back to 4chan including the creation of a fake rainbow flag for gay pride month that supposedly was designed to show acceptance of pedophilia the flag and a fake lgbtp acronym were debunked by the fact checking organization snopes in 2016 a 4chan post stated if they want to demand that society accept their horses identities then it s time we slip in one of our own and implored users to convince them pedos deserve rights too shortly after vaceyi s tweets went viral one 4chan user posted posobiec s tweet mentioning the account wondering if posobiec knew that vaceyi is a troll does know he s being trolled by you guys and just going with it to look good or does he think the person tweeting this is serious the user asked the user behind vaceyi did not respond to a request for comment the vaceyi account used strategies that have become common among efforts to spread misinformation and propaganda on social media building up a small following by tweeting pro lgbtq hashtags and retweeting gay and lesbian aid organizations before sending the pro pedophilia messages krause said he and his followers repeatedly reported the vaceyi account using his identity to twitter which insisted he provide proof of his identity the account later changed its profile picture to a stock photo of two black men kissing twitter permanently suspended vaceyi on thursday night after nbc news asked about the account twitter rules do not allow the promotion of child sexual exploitation the company s rules also bars impersonation and hateful conduct this type of deliberate attempt to undermine and disrupt the health of the public conversation has absolutely no place on our service a twitter spokesperson said in an emailed statement coordinated activity of this nature including running multiple accounts and adopting fake personae is a violation of the twitter rules we are aggressively taking action pursuant with our policies zeke stokes the vice president of programs for the lgbtq advocacy group glaad told nbc news that platforms need to work faster to cut down on this sort of defamation against the lgbtq community social media platforms have the right and the responsibility to protect their products from being weaponized and their users from being targeted by those who wish to spread hate misinformation and malicious rhetoric stokes said anti lgbtq leaders have long tried to surface these debunked lies about lgbtq people despite the fact that our culture knows these fear tactics are blatantly false smears that have attempted to tie the lgbtq community to pedophilia are decades old according to thomas g plante a psychologist and professor at santa clara university who has studied the psychopathology behind pedophilia for more than 30 years the critical thing is that sexual orientation in and of itself is not a risk factor for psychopathology for anything let alone pedophilia plante said in an interview the majority of people who are pedophiles are step fathers older brothers next door neighbors or others like that it has to do with access impulse control problems and other kinds of psychopathology the recent spate of anti science talking points about pedophilia from extremists drives me kind of crazy plante said you ve got plenty of people out there who are experts in this stuff who treat and evaluate people plante said all of that gets discarded because there s someone out there who has an anonymous twitter account who s much louder in the meantime krause said this experience has emboldened him to continue his work showing spaces gay travelers can go without harassment through out the world we see our work as activism said krause people should know about this part of our work don t fall for this other thing we try to tell people that we just want to be treated equally
by binoy kampmark the worm has gotten into apple and is feasting with some consistency revenue has fallen chief executive tim cook is cranky the celebrated front of apple s wealth the iphone with its range of glittering models has not done as well as he would have hoped dreams of conquering cathay or in modern terms the chinese market have not quite materialised in a letter to apple s investors cook explained that our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance this somewhat optimistic assessment came with the heavily stressed caveat while it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates the reasons outlined were various but cook in language designed to obfuscate with concealing woods for self evident trees suggested that the launches of various iphone types would affect our year to year compares that said it played out broadly in line with our expectations while cook gives the impression of omniscience he is far from convincing why go for the unprecedented number of new products to ramp resulting in supply constraints which led to limiting our sales of certain products during q1 such is the nature of the credo where matters were not so smooth to predict were those macroeconomic matters that do tend to drive ceos potty with concern while there was an expectation that the company would struggle for sales in emerging markets the impact was significantly greater than we had projected china in fact remained the hair tearing problem singled out as the single biggest factor in revenue fall in fact goes cook s letter of breezy blame most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and over 100 percent of our year over year worldwide revenue decline occurred in greater china across iphone mac and iphone the slowing of china s economy in the second half of 2018 with a slump in the september quarter being the second lowest in the last 25 years deemed a significant factor the irritating tangle of world politics also features as ever apple can hardly be responsible for errors or misjudgements and prefers when convenient to point the finger to the appropriate catalyst the united states has not made matters easy for the apple bottom line in its trade war spat with beijing we believe that the economic environment in china has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the united states while it is never wise to consult the view of economists without caution their oracular skills leave much to be desired the feeling among the analysts is that a further contraction is nigh we expect a much worse slowdown in the first half followed by a more serious and aggressive government easing stimulus centred on regulating the property market in big cities claims chief china economist at nomura ting lu but chin up a rebound is bound to happen in the latter part of 2019 the apple vision is however dogmatically optimistic an indispensable quality to any cult china remains customary dream and object a frontier to conquer it is stacked with apple friendly innovators the ios developer community in china is among the most innovative creative and vibrant in the world and loyal customers who have a very high level of engagement and satisfaction product fetishism only carries you so far the iphone models are not exactly blazing a trail of enthusiasm in other countries either users in brazil india russia and turkey can count themselves as being more reluctant some of this dampening is due in no small part to a certain cheek on the part of the tech giant one nurtured by years of enthusiastic entitled arrogance in late 2017 for instance the company revealed that it was slowing down iphones with old batteries in an attempt to prevent undesired shutdowns but the company did not feel any great desire to inform users of this fiddling and it took the published findings of an iphone user to replace his iphone 6 s battery thereby restoring performance to accepted levels to kick the hornets nest as chris smith explains the fix was implemented via an update last january but apple didn t accurately inform users of what was going to happen to chemically aged batteries class action suits followed in the united states brazilian authorities insisted that the company inform iphone users on how to have their batteries replaced within 10 days the bite on apple has had its predictable shudder on the markets investors ran off some 75 billion on the company s stocks the nasdaq fell by 3 percent the dow jones industrial average fell 2 8 percent an environment of chaos has greeted us in 2019 and fittingly apple remains at the centre of it a company as responsible for modern technological worship as any as with any central dogma disappointments are bound to happen an irrepressible function of misplaced belief
the 612 pound tuna had to be wheeled into its new owner s sushi restaurant on a low platform its mouth agape sushi chain owner kiyoshi kimura purchased the immense pacific bluefin tuna in an auction on saturday at a tokyo fish market the fish sold for a record 333 6 million yen more than 3 million the associated press reported the kiyomura corp which kimura runs footed the bill at over 5 000 per pound the fish usually sells for up to 40 per pound though the price can fluctuate to more than 200 per pound the gigantic tuna will translate to more than 12 000 pieces of sushi for the company s sushi zanmai chain the tuna looks so tasty and very fresh but i think i did pay a little too much kimura told reporters outside the tokyo market according to reuters the frequent auction winner has been known to pay well above market price for the immense fish this purchase more than doubles the last record he set of 1 76 million for a slightly smaller fish in 2013 but many environmental groups would argue the price is still too low for a species that has floated ever closer to extinction experts say demand for pacific bluefin has led to overfishing causing stocks of the fish to fall to just 2 6 percent of their historic size the celebration surrounding the annual pacific bluefin auction hides how deeply in trouble this species really is jamie gibbon associate manager for global tuna conservation at the pew charitable trusts told the ap conservation groups blame demand from the sushi and sashimi industry for the rapid decline in population japan consumes 80 percent of the world s bluefin tuna along with countries including mexico korea and the united states it has exceeded its fishing quotas in recent years the international union for conservation and nature has listed the pacific bluefin tuna as vulnerable which means a species is likely to become endangered unless the circumstances threatening its survival change the atlantic bluefin tuna a close relative to the pacific bluefin is listed as endangered recovery efforts for the atlantic dweller have shown some success over the past decade as npr has reported but the fish s population is still falling another relative the southern bluefin is critically endangered the two groups responsible for managing pacific bluefin tuna agreed in 2017 to work toward restoring the fish s population to 20 percent of historic levels by 2034 if the western and central pacific fisheries commission and the inter american tropical tuna commission succeed in their goal the bluefin tuna population is projected to increase sevenfold from current levels

a bluefin tuna sold for a record 3 1 million at the first auction of the year at tokyo s new fish market on saturday but behind the celebrations hides a worrying tale of overfishing and dwindling stocks kiyoshi kimura who owns the sushi zanmai restaurant chain paid 333 6 million yen for the 613 lb fish at the first auction of the year and the first to be held at tokyo s new toyosu fish market after last year s the move from the famous tsukiji market the price at the predawn auction was nearly 10 times higher than the price paid at last year s auction albeit for a considerably smaller fish and roughly double the previous record also set by kimura in 2013 there was an intense bidding war with a rival buyer who had won last year the winner said he was very satisfied with the quality of the fish but admitted he had paid much more than he had expected the tuna looks so tasty and very fresh but i think i did pay a little too much kimura told reporters outside the market later according to news agencies kimura said a single piece of the tuna would be served to customers in his restaurants later that day the fish was caught off the coast of northern japan s aomori prefecture by fishermen from the small town of oma which has a nationwide reputation for the quality of its tuna catch bluefin tuna is highly valued for its taste in sushi restaurants but decades of overfishing have sent stocks plummeting the iucn red list of threatened species classifies the pacific bluefin tuna or thunnus orientalis as vulnerable with a decreasing population the celebration surrounding the annual pacific bluefin auction hides how deeply in trouble this species really is said jamie gibbon associate manager of global tuna conservation at the pew charitable trusts its population has fallen to less than 3 5 percent of its historic size and overfishing still continues today in response to the growing scarcity of the fish japan and other governments agreed in 2017 to strict quotas and restrictions on fishing in an attempt to rebuild stocks from 20 percent of historic levels by 2034 that has caused considerable unhappiness and some hardship in oma oma tuna is known as the black diamond of tuna because fishermen still use traditional manual fishing methods rather than trawling allowing them to catch the fish intact but to stick to the quota fishermen there said they decided to go slow in the summer and concentrate instead on fishing in the fall and winter when tuna fetches a higher price however when they ventured out they found tuna harder to find than usual and catches low leading to fears in november that the oma tuna could eventually disappear from the nation s sushi bars although december s catch was better hundreds of japanese fishermen also protested against the new quotas outside the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food in june while oma also canceled its annual tuna festival in october in protest but gibbon lamented that japan and other countries were already lobbying for higher catch quotas for 2019 just one year into the 16 year recovery plan while also noting reports of japanese fishermen discarding and not reporting dead bluefin to avoid exceeding their quotas it s time for countries including japan to support pacific bluefin recovery fund the necessary science and commit to enforcing fishing limits to ensure that there will still be bluefin left to auction he said pacific bluefin tuna reach a maximum length of nearly 10 feet and a maximum weight of 1 200 lbs a top ocean predator they have been described as twice the size of a lion and faster than a gazelle they are built like torpedoes with a hydrodynamic shape retractable pectoral side fins and unlike other fish eyes set flush to their body according to wwf they have two main breeding grounds off the coast of japan most remain in the western pacific all their lives reaching from russia s sakhalin island in the north to new zealand in the south but others when they reach one to two years of age make a 6 000 mile 11 000 km migration to rich waters off california and mexico s baja peninsula returning after two to four years to spawn in the same western pacific waters where they began life pew charitable trusts say pew says fishermen mainly from japan south korea and mexico often take fish before they reach maturity which has badly undermined the population according to the mongabay nature news website bluefin are difficult to rear in captivity with highly sensitive reactions to light and sound they rarely spawn in captivity and often swim at top speed and die on impact with the sides of tanks or nets first published in the washington post

because it represent growth in the economy today s solid report numbers suggest financial market traders may have it all wrong and that the economy is not headed toward a recession the numbers actually suggest the economy still has considerable forward momentum and this may bode well for future crude oil demand weaker manufacturing pmi numbers in the u s the ism manufacturing pmi came in at 54 1 well below the 57 5 consensus and november s 59 3 driven by the new orders subindex which slumped to 51 1 from 62 1 the drop in the main index closely mirrors the sharp weakness recently seen in the equivalent china pmi import sub index earlier in the week crude oil prices fell in response to weak manufacturing number from the u s and china forecast we re definitely headed toward confusing times if we continue to see manufacturing weakening and the labor market strengthening ultimately it looks as if the fate of the crude oil market will be determined by whether the u s and china can cut a trade deal additionally the tone of the u s federal reserve should have an impact on crude oil prices since it is moving in lock step with the stock market if the fed remains hawkish and stays on its tightening path in an effort to prevent the economy from overheating then this could hurt the stock market and subsequently drive crude oil prices lower crude oil is also getting a boost at the end of the week from increased appetite for risky assets a strong stock market rally should extend the upside move in crude stocks could be bolstered if fed chair powell softens his tone toward further rate hikes weekly technical analysis advertisement click to enlarge the main trend is down according to the weekly swing chart but momentum appears to be shifting to the upside it s going to take a while to change the main trend to up firstly the buying has to be strong enough on this first leg up from its low to drive out the weaker shorts secondly the market has to form a higher bottom and build a support base this type of chart pattern will indicate the presence of new buyers the minor trend is also down this week s price action helped form the first minor bottom at 42 36 in four weeks if crude oil can produce a second week of a higher high and a higher low then a new main bottom will form we haven t seen one of those since mid august the new minor range is 54 77 to 42 36 its 50 to 61 8 retracement zone is the first upside target it comes in at 48 57 to 50 03 since the main trend is down sellers are likely to come in on the first test of this area taking out 50 03 will indicate the buying is getting stronger this move is likely to agitate the weaker shorts if this move can generate enough upside momentum then we could see an acceleration to the upside with the next major targets 54 77 to 54 82 it s going to take a change in the fundamentals and increased appetite for risk to drive this market sharply higher in the meantime the market is expected to be underpinned by the opec led plan to reduce supply and stabilize prices as long as they stay true to the plan to cut output and there is optimism over a u s china trade deal then there is a chance the market will build a support base this will eventually lead to higher prices
millions of americans could face going without the benefit that allows them to purchase food if the government shutdown continues into february the supplemental nutrition assistance program known as snap or food stamps costs an average of around 4 8 billion per month according to the u s department of agriculture but because of the government shutdown the program has only 3 billion in emergency reserves for february more than 19 million households in the united states receive food stamps accounting for nearly 39 million people each household receives on average 245 28 per month but because of the shutdown usda has no money to pay for the program in the ensuing months the agency also had to furlough approximately 95 percent of food and nutrition services the office that oversees the snap program the white house and the usda did not respond to requests for comment about their plans to address the shortfall but experts say there is cause for concern for the millions potentially impacted if the 1 8 billion shortfall for february benefits were spread evenly across the 19 million households that receive snap benefits each would see a cut of about 90 per month for their overall grocery budget according to dottie rosenbaum a senior fellow at the center for budget and policy priorities cbpp if the political standoff that began dec 22 continued into march these households would receive no money to buy food even if the president and congress resolve the shutdown by february depending on the decisions the administration makes in the coming one to two weeks households could experience a substantial delay in receiving their full snap allotment for february because of the operational challenges that states and ebt contractors face rosenbaum said in an email robert powell is another american who might have a reason to worry although he doesn t use the benefits himself powell owns a grocery store called the town country market in atoka oklahoma a small town of about 3 000 people where the store has been a fixture since 1967 a fair amount of his customers use food stamps powell said later adding that these lost benefits could have a negative impact on his customers as well as his business there s going to be rioting in the streets when they cut the stamps off powell said get your timber ready businesses are a secondary victim if the shutdown causes the program to run out of cash the money spent by snap beneficiaries is typically split between small business owners like powell and major retailers like walmart tens of billions of dollars could be on the line for hundreds of thousands of businesses across the u s in fiscal year 2017 snap participants redeemed 63 billion in snap benefits for food purchases at about 260 000 retailers 80 percent of which were considered small businesses according to an april 2018 cbpp report the lost benefits would spread out to affect all retailers it would also impact supermarkets and big box stores where more than 80 percent of that 63 billion is spent the report found gary philbin enterprise president of dollar tree noted in an earnings conference call last year that the company s stock prices had been impacted by the more than 500 000 people removed from snap in 2016 considering the millions of people who would lose their consumer power without the benefits they depend on to buy food the shutdown could have a major impact on retailers especially those that serve low income populations if the government does not find a way to make up for the 1 8 billion loss in february that s a 1 8 billion loss across the whole country stacy dean the vice president for food assistance policy at cbpp explained but it will have a disproportionate impact on groceries and small businesses that serve poor communities where shoppers are more reliant on snap benefits and those communities often include some of the most vulnerable individuals as well such as veterans cbpp concluded in a separate report from november 2018 that the snap program is used in nearly 1 4 million households where veterans live thousands of veterans would be affected in every state of the country if these benefits were cut in an interview with nbc news rep karen bass d calif called the shutdown a distraction from issues that congress should be focused on and she noted that the ongoing divide between president trump and democrats could impact those who depend on food stamps if the shutdown continues then you will literally have millions of people that will not be able to afford food bass said and i think this is just absolutely unconscionable i think it s another example him the congresswoman added referring to the president either he literally doesn t understand or doesn t care

china and the united states will hold vice ministerial level trade talks in beijing on jan 7 8 as the two sides look to end a dispute that is inflicting increasing pain on both economies and roiling global financial markets the two nations have been locked in a trade war for much of the past year disrupting the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods and stoking fears of a global economic slowdown a working team led by deputy u s trade representative jeffrey gerrish will come to china to have positive and constructive discussions with chinese counterparts china s commerce ministry said in a statement on its website the ministry said the two sides confirmed the dates in a phone call on friday morning but did not provide other details at a summit in argentina late last year president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping agreed to a ceasefire deciding to hold off on imposing more tariffs for 90 days starting dec 1 while they attempt to negotiate a deal now china and the united states face a key march deadline for talks to end the damaging trade war or washington could proceed with a sharp hike in u s tariffs on chinese goods originally set for jan 1 and beijing could retaliate trump has said talks toward a deal are progressing well but it is unclear if beijing will yield to key u s demands over trade imbalances market access and alleged chinese abuses of intellectual property data this week showed a marked loss of momentum in the world s two largest economies at the end of last year u s factory activity slowed more than expected in december according to the institute for supply management ism while chinese data on monday showed its manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in more than two years
the health of the chinese economy is becoming a big worry for some international firms buffeted by the ongoing trade war between beijing and washington not to mention an already anticipated slowdown in domestic growth engines the world s second largest economy has drawn negative commentary out of sectors ranging from consumer technology to autos on wednesday apple ceo tim cook cut his company s revenue forecast laying some of the blame on falling sales in china and the trade war that has levied high tariffs over the last several months across hundreds of different products and commodities sold between the world s two largest economies stocks in asia traded mostly lower on thursday and u s futures pointed to another volatile session for wall street following cook s comments china sales growth slows as the trade war tariffs continue to take their toll despite an agreement between president donald trump and his chinese counterpart president xi jinping not to apply any new levies during a 90 day negotiation period there are plenty of signs that china s growth is slowing the chinese academy of social sciences a government led think tank recently cut its growth estimate for china s economy from 6 5 percent this year to 6 3 percent while that seems like a small difference it signifies a big drop in consumer spending when spread out over the country s 1 4 billion people we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration particularly in greater china cook said in a letter to shareholders wednesday although apple has faced significant pressures in china since before the trade war kicked off cook told cnbc it s clear that the economy began to slow there for the second half and what i believe to be the case is the trade tensions between the united states and china put additional pressure on their economy it s a big market intel chief financial officer and interim chief executive officer bob swan said on an earnings call in october that china is a big market for us adding that the company was working with customers and suppliers to adapt to any new tariffs it s going to be a wait and see as we go into 2019 he said hp ceo dion weisler told investors in november that china was a very strategically important market for us we obviously continue to assess the situation and the potential impact on our business and our plans that we may or may not need to make as a result but again we re not chasing ghosts but we re also not sticking our heads in the sand either he said of the trade war the tariffs have already cost u s automakers especially ford whose ceo jim hackett complained earlier this year that the tax penalties on steel and aluminum were costing it 1 billion last year alone that pain has been exacerbated by a slowdown in car sales in china in recent months auto sales there fell 14 percent in november over the same month in 2017 according to the chinese association of automobile manufacturers ford s sales in china fell more than 30 percent during the first 11 months last year compared with the same time frame in 2017 in november ford s china sales fell more than 50 percent over the same month in the prior year this is the first sustained downturn in memory said michael dunne ceo of zozogo a firm that advises automakers on doing business in china we would have to go back to the asian financial crisis in 1998 1999 to see the last time china had flat or down sales for four months or more in a row tesla meanwhile is speeding up construction of a factory outside of shanghai and has cut prices on some of its models in china to try to offset the trade war s impact on sales there the company said it was operating at a 55 to 60 percent cost disadvantage to local manufacturers in the country wells fargo analyst ike boruchow told investors wednesday there are high levels of uncertainty around potential new tariffs in 2019 raising fears that the rhetoric between the two governments will lead to a backlash against american brands that operate in china this has already played out between china and canada chinese consumers were reportedly boycotting the canada goose brand due to the recent tension between the two countries chinese tourists retailers are getting hit particularly hard on china related news even if the impact hasn t quite hit their bottom line tiffany s shares fell 9 6 percent on nov 28 after the

oil prices fell slightly on thursday amid volatile currency and stock markets coupled with concerns that an economic slowdown in 2019 will curb fuel demand just as crude supplies are surging markets were buffeted by a 4 4 percent slump in the u s dollar and after tech giant apple cut its sales forecast for the first time in nearly 12 years the slowdown in china and turmoil in stock and currency markets appears to be making investors nervous including in oil markets this is a continuation of the volatility afflicting commodities and oil with the last 24 hours marked by the release of various weak economic data points for major economies said consultancy jbc energy top exporter saudi arabia is expected to cut february prices for heavier crude grades sold to asia by up to 50 cents a barrel due to weaker fuel oil margins respondents to a reuters survey said on thursday fears of future economic and earnings growth continue to be the main driver in causing market jitters singapore based brokerage phillip futures said oil markets are also under pressure from a surge in supply just as demand growth is expected to slow u s crude production stood at a record 11 7 million barrels per day in late 2018 making america the world s biggest oil producer speaking to reporters on wednesday president donald trump said u s pressure had kept production high among allies in the organization of the petroleum exporting countries people see that gasoline is way down and the reason it s way down is because i called up some of the opec people trump said i made calls i said you better let that oil that gasoline flow and they did trump added others are not sitting idle with russian output reaching a record of more than 11 million bpd in 2018 supply from iraq the second biggest producer in opec is also up with december exports at 3 73 million bpd versus 3 37 million bpd in november
everything was going right for the stock market until oct 3 then everything went wrong up to that point the dow jones industrial average had been up about 8 percent for the year a solid gain if not quite as gaudy as the year before more importantly the fundamental backdrop was solid the economy was growing at a better than 3 percent clip corporate profits were around their highest levels in eight years and the federal reserve seemed in control of monetary policy and interest rates the market traded flat that day with little indication that there was anything that should disrupt the powerful bull run into the end of the year then it happened in a seemingly off the cuff remark in a pbs interview after the market had closed fed chairman jerome powell said interest rates were a long way from what he considered neither stimulative nor restrictive the central bank s holy grail of neutral where it could stay put over at least the medium term the comment garnered headlines but didn t seem to generate an inordinate amount of attention the dow dropped about 157 points the next day a notable decline but not particularly scary for a blue chip average that was knocking on the door of 27 000 but then the next day it fell some more and then some more and then still more ultimately the index very briefly edged into bear market territory a 20 percent drop more importantly the market s worst fear was exposed namely that a fed that had been so generous in underpinning the bull market with scads of liquidity and low interest rates was now ready to change direction we believe fed triggered market panic of 2018 tom lee managing partner at fundstrat global advisors wrote as the days and weeks progressed wall street suddenly had a new reality to face a market that seemed bulletproof was now susceptible to a whole range of worries gains that had been taken for granted over the course of the last nine years were in jeopardy a wobbly economy an uncertain future with interest rates and a president who wouldn t stop talking about the stock market posed grave dangers worries become worrying lee termed the sell off a midlife crisis for the market and not a recession the market has a lot to overcome though to make him right while the powell statement in itself was enough to set off a minor tidal wave in selling it released a cascade of other concerns that investors had heretofore ignored and couldn t be overcome even after the fed chief tried to walk back the long way from neutral gaffe suddenly the u s china trade battle of which wall street had largely taken the optimistic view i e that it would be settled with little global disruption seemed an existential danger ditto for the global slowdown a messy brexit and the general chaos that had pervaded washington since president donald trump s election for his part trump didn t help as wall street wobbled the president turned up the heat on powell and his colleagues intensifying criticism that had begun earlier in the year trump wondered aloud whether he had made the right choice in replacing former fed chair janet yellen with powell and said over and over again that the central bank s rate hikes were the biggest threat to the u s economy he went so far as to take on the fed on christmas eve during a violent sell off the only problem our economy has is the fed they don t have a feel for the market they don t understand necessary trade wars or strong dollars or even democrat shutdowns over borders the fed is like a powerful golfer who can t score because he has no touch he can t putt donald j trump realdonaldtrump december 24 2018 trump s strategy tying the stock market s performance to the economy under his watch had always been a risky one and with a potential bear market looming it became even riskier and it seemed the more he talked about the market the worse things got and investors continued to worry where the bottom would come looking ahead looking up still there s reason for optimism the economy remains strong despite a wall street consensus that the pace of growth will slow unemployment is holding around a 50 year low and job growth continues apace despite persistent conventional wisdom that there s not much more room to expand and a worsening in labor conditions also could be in the cards corporate profits after growing just north of 20 percent for 2018 probably will slow as well though an earnings recession seems nearly as unlikely as a conventional economic one factset estimates earnings will grow 8 percent for all of 2019 a substantial decline but still a move forward consumer and business sentiment has edged lower but is still well above historical norms moreover there s not a single strategist of the major wall street firms who thinks the market will finish 2019 lower than it started and even the fed issues could fade from view current futures pricing anticipates zero rate hikes and the central bank historically has been loathe to surprise the market even though fed officials currently project two increases before 2019 closes with the last fed decision of the year behind us and the market having gone through a dramatic pullback since we believe that barring an appearance of a black swan event or the shock of a bolt from the blue the worst of the declines experienced by stocks in 2018 are behind us john stoltzfus chief market strategist at oppenheimer said in a note echoing the white house position as expressed through treasury secretary steven mnuchin stoltzfus blamed programmed trading and technical factors rather than a deterioration in economic and corporate fundamentals as the reason for the fourth quarter selling in the big picture stoltzfus expects the s p 500 to end 2019 at 2 960 the good news is that represents a 19 percent jump from friday s close the bad news is it s a hair below the year end 3 000 target he had for the large cap index at the start of 2018 we believe investors should view this as an opportunity to gain equity exposure at attractive valuations to market segments that appear oversold he said indeed investors can take some solace in that the year ended with a mild santa claus rally on wall street albeit under volatile conditions the gains bought the major averages up more than 6 percent apiece following the disastrous christmas eve dive however stoltzfus like many of his wall street colleagues believes the market in 2019 will endure some more pain and volatility before finally straightening out and climbing higher

newly installed president jair bolsonaro targeted brazil s indigenous groups descendants of slaves and the lgbt community with executive orders in the first hours of his administration moving quickly after a campaign in which the far right leader said he would radically overhaul many aspects of life in latin america s largest nation sao paulo s stock market meanwhile jumped 3 56 percent to a record closing of 91 012 points as new cabinet ministers reinforced the intent to privatize state owned companies and a brazilian arms maker benefited from bolsonaro s plans to loosen gun controls similar spikes in stock prices also occurred during the presidential campaign one of the orders issued late tuesday hours after bolsonaro s inauguration likely will make it all but impossible for new lands to be identified and demarcated for indigenous communities areas set aside for quilombolas as descendants of former slaves are known are also affected by the decision another order removed the concerns of the lgbt community from consideration by the new human rights ministry in a move favorable to his allies in agribusiness which have criticized giving large swaths of lands to the indigenous bolsonaro transferred the responsibilities for delineating indigenous territories from the justice ministry to the agriculture ministry the new agriculture minister tereza cristina is part of the agribusiness caucus in brazil s lower house and has opposed requests from native communities bolsonaro a former army captain and longtime congressman said during his presidential campaign that he would stop making what he calls concessions to native brazilians and quilombolas less than one million people live in those places isolated from the real brazil he tweeted wednesday they are explored and manipulated by nonprofits together we will integrate those citizens and give value to all brazilians the justice ministry previously handled demarcation of indigenous lands through the funai agency which also oversees other initiatives for indigenous groups such as health care housing and language preservation bolsonaro s order is raising uncertainties about funai by shifting it to a new ministry for family women and human rights that is headed by an ultraconservative evangelical pastor observatorio do clima a network of 45 brazilian civil society groups criticized the executive orders calling them only the first step on meeting bolsonaro s campaign promises of dismantling environmental governance stripping indigenous peoples of their rights and opening up indigenous lands for business the attack on funai goes beyond the wildest dreams of the rural caucus who had tried for years to pass a constitutional amendment transferring the demarcation of indigenous lands from the president to congress the nonprofit said bolsonaro solved the problem by transferring them directly to farmers the far right leader said last year that he also wants to annul land demarcation decisions made by previous administrations but legal experts say recent brazilian supreme court rulings could block such move new health minister luiz henrique mandetta also suggested on wednesday that there will be spending cuts in health care for the indigenous we have figures for the general public that are much below what is spent on health care for the indigenous he said without providing details in removing lgbt concerns from the responsibilities of the human rights ministry bolsonaro did not name any agency to consider such issues he has strongly criticized what he calls gender based ideology saying it is a threat to brazil s christian values damares alves the new human rights minister did not discuss the lgbt order in her first address on the job but the evangelical pastor has insisted over the years that the brazilian family is being threatened by diversity policies on wednesday she said the state is lay but this minister is terribly christian under the new administration alves added girls will be princesses and boys will be princes there will be no more ideological indoctrination of children and teenagers in brazil lgbt activist symmy larrat said she doesn t expect reasonable treatment from the bolsonaro administration the human rights ministry discussed our concerns at a body called secretariat of promotion and defense of human rights that body just disappeared just like that we don t see any signs there will be any other government infrastructure to handle lgbt issues she said the newspaper folha de s paulo reported that bolsonaro will later announce the closing of an agency within the education ministry that has been aimed at promoting diversity in public schools and universities new foreign minister ernesto araujo indirectly criticized the lgbt community as being those that say they are not men and women also on wednesday the brazilian press association criticized restrictions on journalists at bolsonaro s inauguration reporters had to arrive seven hours before the events began and were forbidden to move freely in congress and the presidential palace food was seized and access to bathrooms and water was limited what was seen in different scenarios of brasilia is incompatible with a democratic regime the association said in a statement respect to the press is one of the main indicators of nations that consider themselves civilized bolsonaro s first day in office sparked a wave of optimism in brazil s financial market stocks of brazil s electric company eletrobras soared more than 20 percent arms maker taurus one of the main allies of the new president jumped more than 47 percent bolsonaro a fan of u s president donald trump met with secretary of state mike pompeo to discuss joint efforts regarding the leftist administrations in cuba nicaragua and venezuela pompeo told him that trump is very pleased with the relationship that our two countries are on the precipice of beginning to develop he s also confident that it the relationship between the u s and brazil will benefit the world and the set of shared values that we believe we can together advance pompeo said before leaving brasilia for colombia follow
