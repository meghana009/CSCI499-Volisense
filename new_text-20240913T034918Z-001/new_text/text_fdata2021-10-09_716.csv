innovation regulation and evolution in the health care industry have all spawned complex business arrangements that span financial operational and professional services issues as with any other sophisticated business there are tension points among financial sponsors corporate management and health care professionals all of whom can be parties to multifaceted and complex agreements many of these tension points are predictable and have become common in certain types of arrangements in the health care industry given this predictability health systems can employ strategies to anticipate resolve and restructure arrangements before they escalate into full blown disputes and litigation early neutral intervention is key to handling internal disputes before they grow to unhealthy proportions anticipating these issues and structuring the contracts to require professional intervention i e mediation or dispute resolution can be the difference between successfully navigating foreseeable tensions and ending up in expensive unsatisfactory and potentially destructive litigation a health system s dispute resolution mechanism should be as robust as possible defining both the types of issues and the process that it can muster to help achieve a successful resolution to those issues frequently early professional intervention can result in a more satisfactory outcome and help to preserve long term relationships and services within these agreements here are a few examples of the tensions that arise across financial operational and commercial agreements contract compensation and management issues recent changes in state and federal laws are designed to facilitate among other things coordinated health care these changes invite strategic alignment transactions such as hospital acquisitions affiliations joint ventures clinically integrated networks cins and accountable care organizations acos these alignments are structured and governed through various contracts which remain in effect post transactions examples of internal issues based on real life scenarios include the following health system acquisition of primary care and specialty practices and groups many hospitals or health systems employ primary care and or specialist physicians under professional services agreements which use fair market value and wrvu based compensation structures other types of these agreements employ different value based compensation models in some instances this includes bonus or additional compensation based on revenues or post ebitda numbers that measure the acquired group s profitability to the acquiring entity it s not unusual for the acquired group to seek adjustment of the compensation component after several years taking into account the group s performance and actual value to the enterprise over time management is not always enthused or willing to participate in the reevaluation and renegotiation of the group s performance and contribution and the corresponding adjustment to its members compensation this frequently leads to tension and unhappiness by and among the specialty group members who sometimes threaten to depart either individually or en masse and to seek recourse from the health system joint ventures in certain health care fields joint ventures are used to form and expand services in certain health systems including dialysis radiology ambulatory surgery cardiac catheterization and other specialty facilities these joint ventures typically include partnerships between and among business management and clinicians and or other health care providers commentators have noted certain benefits of this model which can also be tension points in commercial relationships sharing business risk access to professional management access to favorable supplier payor contracts and increased access to and competition in the market other issues between joint venture partners include access to administrative infrastructure access to clinical initiatives and medical professionals control over operation and strategic decisions sharing of profits and professional fees and compliance and regulatory issues it s common for one of the joint venture partners to be a physician or group of providers which serves as medical director of patient care and clinical operations this opens the door to tensions concerning the physician receiving profits as a joint venture partner but also earning compensation in their professional capacity this arrangement can likewise blur the line and create disagreements over who controls operational and management functions on the one hand and who has final decision and discretion on medical issues and patient care on the other hand investors and financial sponsors vs management a divergence of interests internal tensions between investor non independent board members and management over enterprise growth and operational strategies private equity pe investment in health care increased dramatically over the past decade capital markets remain busy with public financings in the health care and biotech spaces special purpose acquisition companies spacs also have become prominent actors in health care public financings according to a recent article by attorneys at mcdermott will emery 2020 saw a dramatic increase in the number of spac ipo filings and more importantly the completion of several spac merger transactions often coupled with simultaneous pipe financing transactions spac and pe investors often join the boards of directors of health care companies that have gone public these investors typically are non independent board members as they have a direct financial interest in the company s market cap and financial performance disagreements can emerge between pe and spac board members on the one hand and executive management of the company on the other hand over capital allocation operations and growth strategies the former may desire that the company focus operations and expansion to achieve immediate financial gains while the latter may seek to steer the company toward long term growth and stability there may also be disagreement between pe and spac board members who acquired stock through founder shares or public shares and senior management who receive stock and options as part of executive compensation over how immediate proceeds from the ipo and or positive performance should be distributed the former citing among other things risk from their initial funding want the lion s share of immediate profit to be distributed to them the latter citing their sweat and hard work seek reward outside of their stock grants and options for the operational successes their management leadership achieved these tensions can cripple promising health care ventures and undermine progress toward effective management and system growth conclusion recognizing that there are financial operational and compensation incentives that need to be as fully aligned as possible upfront even though they may diverge over time and proactively moving to structure a process to resolve disputes as soon as they emerge are crucial to protecting the

return of 21 6 for the s p 500 q2 2021 hedge fund letters conferences and more according to a read more industry unbound friendly academics the information industry also launders its arguments through seemingly independent academic research the best example of this is in the field of ai and automated decision making systems ai is an umbrella term often imprecisely used to refer to set of technologies best understood as a set of techniques aimed at approximating some aspect of human or animal cognition using machines for ai systems to work as promised which they rarely do their developers require enormous tranches of data for the purposes of training and improving accuracy ai policy therefore is inextricably linked to privacy the less regulation around the collection and use of personal data the easier it will be to design market and deploy ai the fewer guardrails around the use of ai the more companies will extract our data scholars in law and the social sciences are interrogating ai and its use in social policy decisions they have highlighted problems of bias lack of accountability structural injustice and invasions of privacy other researchers however have become apologists for industry s ai related data grabs the mit media lab for example not only cozied up to silicon valley billionaires to build potential funding streams but also allegedly aligned some of its policy recommendations on data collection and ai with big tech s antiregulatory posture in the ai space the information industry prefers a light or no touch approach to tweaking ai s bias problem they have co opted the notion of ai ethics as a means of replacing public governance with their own internal structures industry also invests millions to create a narrative about bias data privacy and the role of government they funded mit media lab research that was eventually cited in reports published by microsoft corporation nasdaq msft alphabet inc nasdaq googl ibm nyse ibm facebook inc nasdaq fb and amazon com inc nasdaq amzn calling for self regulation in response to industry pressure media lab executives allegedly water down ai law and policy recommendations to the california legislature that were at odds with the research done by its own experts on the ground amazon paid scholars at antonin scalia law school at george mason university to push their favored discourses after the antitrust scholar lina khan wrote an article targeting amazon as anticompetitive and calling for reinvigorating antitrust law to take on the internet giant amazon paid pro corporate scholars to write an article lauding amazon s monopolistic practices as good for consumers it s hard to know how often this happens but even when scholars acknowledge their corporate funding streams in footnotes the discursive damage remains there is more to this story than a few grants even if those grants add up to a several millions of dollars many scholars who receive google facebook or other big tech funds insist that the money doesn t influence their writing and for many that is true merely receiving money from a target of research does not necessarily prove bias but we also have evidence that the nonprofits that receive those funds make personnel and substantive decisions that accord with the views of their biggest tech donors in 2017 for example the entire competition team at a google funded think tank was fired after its leader pushed for more rigorous antitrust enforcement against google the information industry is also far more subtle as it seeks influence over academic discourse about privacy law and technology for instance company representatives will often only speak with independent researchers about already public documents and reports and then only on deep background thus limiting what academics can learn this happened to me during research for another project where a google attorney and several colleagues were only willing to discuss google play s published guidelines and only without attribution i ended the call five academic colleagues experienced the same tactic including one who was interested in facebook content moderation who was told only on the condition that you can t quote anything we say this tactic may sound counterproductive to building friendly discourses in academia not talking is a bad inculcative strategy according to a former member of google s policy shop the deep background strategy gives us an opportunity to share our side of the story without pinning a quote on one person because quotes can always be misleading and edited to make us look bad several companies incentivize friendly coverage by dangling research funds in front of junior scholars young researchers and phd students are particularly susceptible to corporate influence because of the need to pay for their fellowships publish to get tenure the possibility that access will translate into undiscovered research and the small stipends they receive from their institutions the facebook fellowship for example includes full tuition and a 42 000 annual stipend paid visits to facebook and all expenses paid participation in the annual fellowship summit undoubtedly merely participating in this program does mean that these junior scholars are unduly influenced by facebook but much of the fellows already published research fits neatly within privacy ascontrol s logic of power among thirty six facebook fellows in 2020 six classify their work in some way related to privacy along with several co authors these fellows have published academic articles arguing that the tool mark zuckerberg plans to use to create a privacy focused facebook end to end encryption is the best way to protect privacy on social media in another article researchers used studies to buttress the feasibility of privacy self governance and argued users of messaging services are willing to trade security for convenience other fellows researching ai and fairness issues have published articles proposing changes that companies can make themselves perpetuating even inadvertently the self regulatory ethos i am not suggesting that all of these promising young scholars are part of a cabal of researchers plotting to spread pro facebook messages throughout academia switch it around facebook is choosing to provide ample support for research that perpetuates privacy as control s logic and using its soft power to create friendly relationships among promising future academics to my knowledge and based on the experience of several academics in law surveillance studies and sociology facebook and google often though not always require preapproval of all quotes and related text before an academic publishes scholarship based on interviews with company representatives a grant from the company or pursuant to officially sanctioned field work this is a particularly pernicious tactic one colleague i interviewed for this projecthas saved email conversations with facebook in which company representatives required articles to be embargoed and precleared before submission i did not get that farwith facebook which refused to participate in this research another colleague reported that some facebook and google grants they received had no strings attached it was money for a conference or a project or whatever but they just gave it but research money always came with questions and invitations and ultimately they wanted to know what my conclusions would be i gave back the remaining funds much to chagrin corporate friendly academic research makes its way back into the information industry inculcating the rank and file along the way because corporate researchers public policy teams and other lawyers and privacy professionals are encouraged to cite and refer to it in their work several privacy professionals and lawyers outside silicon valley showed me internal documents focusing both on the benefits ofprivacy notice choice and control and how to improve it and they all rely on research from facebook fellows google funded research projects and encryption centered work at microsoft research of course independent academics are cited as well but often those academics are cited for background their proregulatory proposals are ignored for example facebook cited work from lorrie cranor aleecia mcdonald helen nissenbaum and me among others in its public report on improving notice and transparency but when it came time to thinking about solutions facebook touted its own solutions as if to suggest that the problem can be solved without the law getting involved performing accountability another common tactic i observed during my interviews is what julie cohen has called performing accountability or doing something designed to express a generic commitment to accountability without meaningful scrutiny of the underlying process magicians use the word misdirection to describe a related phenomenon while we re distracted by some of the information industry s cynical trappings of accountability tech companies are busy undermining our privacy a paradigmatic example of this strategy comes from the related context of content moderation content moderation refers to how platforms regulate the material available on their sites sarah roberts has called content moderation a powerful mechanism of control that has grown up alongside and in service to private companies in the information industry platforms moderate content in order to achieve optimal engagement platforms develop their own rules for what is and what is not allowed to be posted and they apply those rules using both humans and algorithms content moderation at facebook has garnered outsized attention in the media among policy makers and among academics many high profile content moderation controversies at facebook have caused such a crisis of confidence that the company announced with significant fanfare that it was creating an oversight board to hear appeals of moderation decisions from the front lines the idea is that an independent board would routinize rationalize and publicize content moderation decisions generating trust and confidence per a search on lexis nexis 2 210 newspaper and magazine articles have been written about the oversight board between november 2018 when the board was announced and may 18 2020 over 565 days that s an average of nearly four articles per day facebook pitched many of these stories to both leading outlets like the new york times and the wall street journal as well as to general interest blogs and tech focused news outlets during this time 189 law review and journal articles at least mentioning the board have been published and that doesn t even include the many hundreds that are being written under submission and soon to be published at this book went to press a may 18 2020 google search for any content with the exact phrase facebook oversight board yielded 236 000 results millions more have all of those terms facebook has pushed out several reports and issued press releases dutifully picked up by news outlets and commentators the company s representatives have given countless talks at universities as well as public and private fora from princeton university to the aspen institute this onslaught was evidently intentional but the attention paid to the board is disproportionate to its power the board says it will focus on the most challenging content issues for facebook including hate speech harassment and protecting people s privacy but as the media scholar siva vaidhyanathan notes only in the narrowest and most trivial of ways does this board have any such power the new facebook review board will have no influence over anything that really matters in the world a quick look at the board s charter proves he s correct the board can only hear appeals for content that has been removed not the misleading and harmful content that remains nor can the board make binding decisions about the fate of specific pieces of content on a case by case basis it is supposed to make its decisions within ninety days of a filed appeal but can expedite certain decisions within thirty days its decisions have zero precedential value it has no binding impact on policy even on policies about content moderation it cannot change the way facebook is run or materially change how facebook makes decisions about content it won t be able to address the fact that facebook s failure to remove misleading deep fake videos or fake news can sway an election it can t do much about the rampant hate speech and human rights violations that persist it has absolutely no voice in facebook s continued misuse of user data and it will play no role in corralling misinformation and harmful conspiracies rampant throughout the platform the last two points are rather ironic the board s announcement came in reaction to a new york times report about how facebook publicly lied deflected blame and tried to cover up both its failure to recognize and police russia s use of the platform to interfere in the 2016 us presidential election and its flagrant misuse of user data in the cambridge analytica scandal why then has the board received so much media and scholarly attention the strategy is intentional meant to distract us from everything facebook isn t doing joan donovan the research director of harvard s shorenstein center and an expert on media manipulation called the board a distraction from what really needs to happen which is to design technology that doesn t allow for the expansive amplification of disinformation and health misinformation facebook isn t changing its business it isn t taking down fake videos or limiting the lies from right wing politicians nor is it changing the very financial model that makes it in the company s interest to extract our data leave up conspiracy theories fake news deep fakes and other sensationalized content dipayan ghosh a fellow at harvard and former facebook executive wrote that the board is a commercial thing of convenience for the company both in its name and its function it gives the impression that the board will provide true oversight by graduating the responsibility of determining what should constitute hate speech to an external party with public credibility allowing the company to skate over the threat of a more rigorous regulatory policy that might emerge from relatively aggressive legislatures that might wish to target the firm s business model itself the board s impotence then is real but its discursive effect is not facebook engaged in an aggressive strategy involving earned media and friendly academics to make a lot of noise about something that will barely be a blip on the screen of facebook s vast problems its full court press is nothing short of a concerted strategy to redirect us from its other failures the same strategy has been deployed to inculcate the values of privacy as control as obvious common sense and normatively good privacy self regulation notice and consent and privacy policies are commercial things of convenience as well privacy policies give the impression that the information industry is doing something to protect our data and small marginal changes after privacy scandals facilitate an escape from greater regulatory oversight this misdirection has been so successful at inculcating a perception of accountability among members of the public that many people think a company with a privacy policy is promising to keep our data private whenever i questioned the privacy invasive designs of several companies products the usual response was to redirect my attention to the company s cybersecurity work we saw this in chapter 1 where both privacy professionals and software engineers touted their encryption and state of the art security techniques as proof that they cared about privacy the privacy lawyers i interviewed highlighted their work improving transparency in several instances these lawyers would note that no one is perfect and that we re doing better by showing how they have redesigned their notices to be more readable these are at their core misdirections improving notice and strengthening cybersecurity are not bad ideas but they don t speak to design nor do they serve any purpose outside the privacy as control framework asking us to focus on notice not only perpetuates its legitimacy as a privacy practice but it also keeps the rank and file focused on performances of privacy rather than pulling back the curtain on the industry s legal and discursive crusades against it

remote work apparently not killing cities as the result of a local employment dynamics webinar held earlier this year the census bureau has paired up with zillow using their combined data to show some of the impact of the pandemic on housing market trends census bureau analyst earlene k p dowell wrote of the results in an article published on the bureau s website dowell says that the housing market came to a screeching halt in march 2020 when much of the nation shut down in response to the covid 19 pandemic but by summer the rebound once many lockdown measures were lifted was big and fast and revealed new homebuying patterns americans had quickly adapted to the remote workstyle and began buying homes outside of some cities and traditional job centers this isn t exactly breaking news but the report has some interesting details even before covid 19 arrived 2020 was expected to be a strong homebuying year largely because more than 72 million millennials had reached their 40s the prime age to buy a home then suddenly many of them found themselves working from home and so did many renters zillow s data shows that nearly two million of the latter found they could afford to buy because given they no longer needed to commute to work they could move further out from metro centers to less expensive suburbs as more renters became homebuyers home and rental prices diverged while sales rebounded by about 20 percent from may 2020 through the end of the year new for sale housing inventory which had improved during the summer of 2020 failed to keep up with sales growth in 2020 there were fewer houses for sale than in 2019 which created a home buying market with hyper competitive conditions demand for rentals declined as more renters bought but the pandemic brought other disruptions lower income households who were more likely to rent were also more likely to have experienced job loss in hard hit industries such as retail trade hospitality and food services zillow s research shows that those facing financial pressures turned to alternatives including doubling up or moving back in with their families that shift in turn added to a decline in rental demand the data from the two sources also shows that despite some concerns that covid 19 could provoke a mass exodus from cities metropolitan areas are still very much alive in some in fact the housing market has grown census data does not recognize the suburbs so zillow used zip codes to classify areas as urban rural or suburban and then integrated census bureau variables such as population density age of housing stock and other factors research showed that cities in the northeast and west regions like new york and san francisco home value growth trailed the suburbs dowell says it appears that people in larger more expensive metros were not willing to pay premium prices for proximity to amenities such as restaurants museums and theaters that were no longer available during the pandemic however the opposite happened in markets in the midwest for example home values surged in the kansas city and cleveland metro areas where urban prices were relatively affordable zillow has found that most people are willing to undertake a 30 minute one way commute to work and place a lot of importance on living close to their place of employment however they also found that before the pandemic over half of urban workers in 20 of the top 35 markets were reverse commuters more than 70 percent of urban residents work outside of urban areas in markets like orlando tampa and riverside it was cities that had a large share of reverse commuters in 2017 that had higher growth during the pandemic zillow says the share of residents who are willing and able to pay for and keep urban amenities could be a signal as to how a city might fare during the next pandemic the data also shows that the willingness to reverse commute is not specific to any one generation both older and younger workers have remained in metro areas zillow says that most home buyers make decisions about location based on affordability amenities and major life events such as a new job growing family or older kids moving out but the mass shift to working remotely even part time is now factoring in as well early in the pandemic a zillow survey found that 75 percent of respondents who were working from home wanted to continue to do so at least half time after work restrictions were lifted two thirds said they would consider moving if remote work seemed a long term possibility finally the report looked at those stories about teleworkers transporting themselves to vacation towns and found that has happened american community survey acs data they confirmed that they are at least thinking about it they identified vacation towns that have drawn remote workers attention by looking at page views likes and url saves and found this kind of dream shopping was up by 50 percent in august 2020 compared to august 2012 this was in line with 66 percent growth in pending home sales in vacation towns apparently some buyers were turning dreams into reality

today claiming supply levels are close to normal range the petrol retailers association s research showed that 12 per cent of filling stations have run out of fuel in the region while 17 per cent have one grade of diesel or petrol under 75 per cent of petrol stations have both diesel and petrol in london and south east england as opposed to 90 per cent outside those areas the figures are at loggerheads with mr shapps claims that the issue is almost entirely over he told gb news today in london and the south east supply levels in petrol stations are getting very close to the normal range and we ll see them opening up in a day or too there was never a shortage of fuel in the refineries and storage stations as soon as people queue up to fill up fuel you get into a situation where you

outspoken ministers vented on the subject again paper industry boss warns it s very very clear that factories in all sectors across the country could close within weeks as gas prices continue to soar one industry leader has warned the government that factories across the country could stop production due to rising prices andrew large director general at the confederation of paper industries attended a meeting on friday with the business secretary and other representatives of energy intensive industries to discuss the wholesale gas crisis speaking to the bbc radio 4 s pm programme afterwards mr large claimed it was very clear across all of the sectors that there are serious risks factories could stop all activities as a result of the gas prices being too high at his conservative party conference speech earlier this week mr johnson promised that the uk would become a higher wage higher productivity economy mr large said when we talked with the secretary of state this afternoon it was very very clear across all of the sectors that there are serious risks of effectively factory stoppages as a result of the costs of gas being too high to bear and in those circumstances there will be a gradual knock on effect through supply chains right the way across manufacturing consumer retail and other products and so the risks are very very real when asked what this would mean for the paper industry mr large said it would be incredibly damaging for profitability but mr large did say the meeting was a positive first step to look at the solutions they had proposed and that kwasi kwarteng clearly furthers our desire to avoid any potential supply chain disruption the energy intensive users group eiug echoed mr large s comments saying it welcomed the opportunity to meet the business secretary and is pleased he wants to find practical solutions to the challenges members face going into this winter uk steel boss mr stace told bbc radio 4 s world at one today the prime minister this week is calling for a high wage economy the steel sector already does exactly that we pay our workers 45 per cent higher wages in regions where steel is they re highly skilled as well if you re paying as much for gas and electricity as we are as a steel sector then these unprecedented price rises are hurting us now today if the prime minister and government does nothing to help us they could start to strangle steel production here in the uk and rather than working towards a high wage economy we ll actually be walking blindly towards a low wage economy advertisement as the gas crisis escalated ofgem warned there will also be a significant rise to the cap on energy bills hitting millions of britain s poorest people with soaring energy prices set to push average annual bills through the 2 000 barrier for the first time ofgem chief executive jonathan brearley didn t put a figure on it but said there will be a significant rise in the price cap set by the industry regulator which helps to control the cost of gas and electricity in the uk he didn t knock back claims that fixed and other deals could reach 2 000 in 2022 we can t predict everything and the wholesale market as we ve seen has gone up and down extremely quickly so we can t predict fully what that will be he told bbc radio 4 s today programme but looking at the costs that are in the system we are expecting a significant rise in april but mr brearley added that the current price cap will remain until april we have no plans to raise the price cap before april he said in the face of the ongoing energy crisis london based money saving expert martin lewis has urged customers to do nothing he said those who want cheaper energy deals shouldn t shop around like normal instead he insisted inaction is now the best action speaking on his eponymous itv show on thursday martin said customers should pick deals that match their energy providers price cap or wait until they are given one when their current deal ends the finance expert explained do nothing do nothing energy prices are rising energy firms are falling the cheapest fixes are 500 a year higher than they were just a month ago shocking people are panicking do nothing inaction is now the best action he added explaining the reasons behind the surging prices he said the wholesale gas price is the price firms pay and in the uk a lot of our electricity is heated by gas so it hits the electricity price too it was normally about 50p therm you ll see it has exploded in the last few months it s now well over five times the normal amount and that s hideous the energy crisis has been blamed in part on a shortage of natural gas caused by vladimir putin allegedly choking supplies to europe to pressurise regulators into approving the controversial nord stream 2 pipeline today boris johnson waded into the row branding the link a threat to energy security and suggesting the decision to bypass ukraine to bring supplies direct to germany would damage the ukrainian economy a no 10 spokesman said although nord stream 2 will not directly impact the uk s energy security it could have serious implications for central and eastern european countries some european countries are nearly wholly dependent on russian gas which raises serious concerns about energy security in comments reported by the times the spokesman also warned about the damage to ukraine which currently hosts the largest pipeline network for russian gas and benefits from large transit fees he added nord stream 2 would divert supplies away from ukraine with significant consequences for its economy the natural gas price is currently hovering at around 2 40 a therm down from more than 4 yesterday after traders were reassured by putin hinting that russia would consider increasing exports he said so our paper mill will be wanting to operate 24 7 365 days a year with the exception of planned stoppages for maintenance and so on so the financial sustainability of that paper mill is dependent upon being able to maximise its uptime every minute that the machinery isn t working every minute that paper isn t being produced is a damage

extended if problems persist past the beginning of november when the order will run out andrew large director general at the confederation of paper industries said its members are being affected very very severely by cost increases with toilet roll and packaging among the items that could be hit hardest he said they re seeing their costs go up through the roof it s damaging their profitability and in some cases it s causing them to manage their production rates so as not to expose themselves to the very very highest costs meanwhile baked beans have become the latest victims of soaring inflation with the head of manufacturer kraft heinz today revealing the cost of the breakfast staple will have to go up miguel patricio ceo of kraft heinz which makes a range of other products including philadelphia spread and capri sun said that inflation was widespread globally and costs were rising in previous years there was inflation in coffee because of a bad crop or a bad crop in beans what is different now is that this inflation is across the board he told bbc radio 4 s today programme so it s impossible to navigate through this moment of inflation without increasing prices it s up to us and to the industry and to other companies to try to minimise these price increases one in ten british businesses put up their prices in the past month due to the rising costs the office for national statistics ons latest business survey for september shows meanwhile nearly a third of companies have seen a higher than normal increase in running costs and many have been forced to pass this on to customers companies in construction services and manufacturing were the worst hit as 10 per cent said they needed to raise prices last month up from 8 per cent in mid august and 4 per cent early in 2021 the data showed that of these nearly a quarter 23 per cent were retailers in consumer facing sectors and 25 per cent were in the manufacturing industry the stark data came as the soaring cost of electricity and gas hit industries such as steel glass and chemicals meaning consumers will soon be paying more for a huge number of products including cars building materials food packaging and even toilet roll factories have moved to reduce their output to save on costs as the price of energy went through the roof with some demanding government support to keep running it came as the bank of england s new chief economist huw pill used his first interview in the in the job to warn that britain faces a greater than expected rise in inflation over the coming months which with further hammer households and businesses mr pill said he expects increasing costs of living should subside as the pandemic recedes but with inflation already at a nine year high of 3 2 per cent he gave the chilling warning the magnitude and duration of the transient inflation spike is proving greater than expected britons and their businesses are being battered by a perfect storm of inflation and supply chain

question is the headquarters of britain s driver and vehicle licensing agency dvla at present a mere 2 500 staff or roughly 40 per cent have been told to actually turn up at the office due to the pandemic the remainder are still allowed to work from home efforts to get them back in the building where they might be able to more efficiently carry out what is a hugely important role are being stymied by a toxic industrial dispute between management and the hard left public and commercial services union it revolves around covid safety protocols activists have staged no fewer than 58 days of strikes in the past six months and more than 18 months after the first lockdown continue to resist efforts to further repopulate the dvla office the upshot last week as petrol forecourts ran dry and the hgv driver shortage became front page news it emerged that a staggering backlog of more than 56 000 applications for vocational licences needed by all lorry and bus drivers had been allowed to build up in the dvla s system about 4 000 of those are for provisional licences while the remainder covered renewals this followed a year in which thanks largely to the suspension of tests over which the dvla had no control just 26 400 new hgv drivers were approved some 17 000 fewer than normal according to figures cited by the spectator this january when about 3 000 would typically be granted a mere 173 were the dvla insists that provisional licences are now being turned around in four or five days though 1 000 arrive each 24 hours and says many drivers can carry on working while a renewal is being processed but the airwaves have nonetheless been full of enraged truckers more than 6 000 people are supposed to work in this collection of 1960s buildings which sprawl over an area the size of several football pitches adjacent to a cemetery near junction 46 of the m4 on lbc last week an hgv driver named deep said he d been caught up in the system for a year they want to have europeans to

d been unable to work for five months due to delays processing medical documents as boris johnson might observe the organisation s peloton riding home workers appear to be struggling to keep up further strife is being experienced by hundreds of thousands of ordinary motorists who also face crippling delays in getting or renewing licences an essential piece of id which can be required to open bank accounts or secure mortgages there are an astonishing 1 4million paper applications sitting on desks inside dvla headquarters a million more than usual with roughly 60 000 more arriving every day and good luck trying to raise an actual human being on the agency s telephone over the course of a single day this week during which the mail called hourly between 8am and 8pm the line was constantly engaged on the four occasions we reached the switchboard a recorded message declared that due to high demand all of our lines are busy before hanging up little wonder that critics now routinely cite the dvla as exhibit a in the row over whether public sector workers should like the public who pay for them return to the office mark serwotka a trotskyite chum of jeremy corbyn who leads the pcs union has in recent years called for a general strike to bring the tories down so what s going on how did this critical piece of national infrastructure become mired in controversy and more importantly who s to blame a good place to start is at the hq where workers somewhat wearily blame the sort of industrial strife that characterised our previous winter of discontent four decades ago the dvla s current troubles they say date back to last year s devastating second wave which turned swansea into one of the world s most virulent covid hotspots days before christmas public health wales revealed an outbreak of about 60 cases had been detected in the organisation s contact centre department where staff process calls and emails from the public understandably many of the 2 000 or so employees then on site felt they ought to be allowed to work temporarily from home however management who point out that much of the dvla s work involves processing personal data and accessing highly secure databases which often cannot be safely done remotely thought otherwise disagreement swiftly escalated thanks in no small part to the pcs union which is led by mark serwotka a trotskyite chum of jeremy corbyn who has in recent years called for a general strike to bring the tories down under his stewardship membership has fallen from 325 000 in the early 2000s to a mere 177 000 today yet the pcs retains a reputation for militancy so it proved at the dvla where around half the workforce are members on january 25 serwotka announced conditions in the building were unsafe and demanded that ministers intervene to temporarily cease non critical services there last week as petrol forecourts ran dry and the hgv driver shortage became front page news it emerged that a staggering backlog of more than 56 000 applications for vocational licences needed by all lorry and bus drivers had been allowed to build up in the dvla s system above a petrol queue in kent a safety dispute has been rumbling on ever since despite the fact that the site s covid outbreak was formally declared over in february by march they had successfully balloted for industrial action given the current pressures on the dvla the ensuing campaign remains hugely divisive supporters including half a dozen local labour mps argue the union is anxious to protect members from exploitative bosses critics however have accused the union s recalcitrant leaders of exaggerating once justified but now spurious safety fears for political gain among the cross section of workers the mail managed to speak to in swansea this week the latter view appeared to hold more sway there have been problems everyone knows that but i now feel safe said one a part time worker added there s no doubt that they didn t have all the precautions set up to start with and people i worked with complained but a lot of precautions are now operating i feel quite safe said a third it s the old story a few workers mostly union members are making all the complaints most people here want to get on with the job but a few are using covid to try to get more pay and better working conditions troublemakers and moaners are painting the dvla in a bad light but it s not what i see every day that was of course merely a handful of opinions a better way to establish who is in the right in this dispute might be to follow the numbers on which front mr serwotka has repeatedly sought to justify the safety dispute by arguing that the dvla is responsible for an extraordinary and disproportionate number of covid cases among employees in july he issued a statement claiming there had been 643 cases of the virus among staff and that this was the single biggest covid outbreak of any workplace in the uk by early september his pcs union was making hay with the fact that 768 employees had tested positive since the start of the pandemic a few days ago the figure was 874 those numbers may sound hefty but what the pcs didn t say was that they referred to the total number of dvla employees who had caught the virus including the thousands who have been working from home since last march in other words many if not a majority of those 874 cases cannot possibly be blamed on the workplace since they haven t set foot in it for months another vital piece of context missing from these figures was the proportion of the dvla s 6 148 staff members who have tested positive it is 14 per cent that compares to an average of 12 25 per cent positive cases for the whole of wales where around 380 000 people have caught the virus and nearly 13 5 per cent for swansea bay where there have been 52 000 cases in other words despite mr sewotka s claims the chance of dvla workers getting ill with covid has been almost identical to that of the rest of the local population meanwhile on a purely mathematical level the chance of them dying from the virus has been substantially better we know this because there have been 8 262 deaths linked to covid in wales according to the ons it follows that a randomly selected group of 6 000 people could expect to have suffered 16 fatalities but until now just one member of dvla staff has died his name was phil grant and in reports describing his death in january mr serwotka accused dvla bosses of a callous disregard for staff a couple of months later the late mr grant s case made headlines when the health and safety executive launched an inquiry into its circumstances a newspaper report revealing the move quoted mr serwotka criticising the arrogance and intransigence of senior dvla managers following a detailed investigation the health and safety executive which had been visiting the site since august concluded that no evidence has been found of breaches of health and safety at work law relating to the death of 60 year old mr grant their important finding has hitherto gone unreported one reason according to government sources was that dvla management chose not to issue a press release about it since unlike others we didn t want to weaponise the case out of respect for the victim s family thanks largely to the suspension of tests over which the dvla had no control just 26 400 new hgv drivers were approved last year some 17 000 fewer than normal according to figures cited by the spectator of course it should not be concluded that at various stages before during and even after last winter s lockdown some members of staff didn t raise legitimate safety concerns in february it emerged that swansea council had recently asked the dvla to reconfigure the layout of desks at its office to ensure correct social distancing a union member who spoke to itv on condition of anonymity claimed that he was sat 1 8 or 1 9 metres apart from a co worker rather than the welsh government mandated two metres it s horrendous we re just forgotten the member complained regarding this 20cm infringement the dvla claims in response to this and other criticism that it has spent some 4 2million on safety measures on the site among other things thermal imaging cameras were purchased to check the temperature of employees perspex screens installed between desks and air conditioning systems reconfigured to use external air only a nearby building was rented at vast public expense to reduce the number of staff in each room we were repeatedly inspected by public health wales swansea council and the health and safety executive says a source absolutely everything they recommended we did and more yet that still wasn t enough to satisfy the pcs in late february it announced 71 6 per cent of those who took part in a ballot had endorsed strike action over safety whether or not this was a spectacular mandate is a matter of opinion turnout was 50 3 per cent a fraction over the 50 per cent required for the vote to carry legal weight meaning that roughly 1 100 employees a mere 18 per cent actually voted in favour by early june there had been 18 days of strikes each relatively costly for both the pcs which offered members who took industrial action strike pay of 40 per day and dvla bosses who began to worry about the growing backlog hopes of nipping the dispute in the bud were then dealt a blow when a peace deal negotiated by civil servants was vetoed by transport secretary grant shapps the reason was that the settlement would have involved all dvla staff being given a cash bonus of 200 and two extra days off mr shapps took the view that this was an unethical use of taxpayer funds in a dispute that was supposed to revolve around safety what we need to know is why the demands then switched to demands about pay and demands about holiday which have nothing to do with being covid secure he told parliament his veto has lately been criticised by political opponents labour s transport spokesman jim mcmahon argues that the 1 2million spread across the frontline workforce would have recognised a failure of management and political leadership playing politics over staff welfare is reckless when forecourts are without petrol and supermarket shelves are bare he tells me it was one of the levers that he had that would have helped him reach an agreement and sort out this issue but instead ideology got in the way of a solution whoever was in the right there followed months of further strike action with the pcs appearing to revel in the disruption they were causing in an august communique to members they boasted backlogs continue to mount and are now in excess of a quarter of a million and still more incoming post is unopened in crates these backlogs will continue to put pressure on management fast forward to this week and somewhat oddly the union was seeking to play down the impact its industrial action is having on the daily lives of the british public the dispute at dvla has absolutely nothing to do with the shortage of hgv drivers they insisted in a statement this week adding that they have lobbied the dvla to prioritise applications from key workers which would include lorry and bus drivers to no avail the dvla is singing a different tune however it is extremely disappointing that pcs continues to pursue unnecessary industrial action which will hold millions of motorists across the country to ransom they say with both sides still at odds mr serwotka just invited members to vote in a second ballot that will authorise strike action for another six months and so our modern winter of discontent continues additional reporting by tom bedford green levies will still be added to your gas bill families face 100 surcharge under plan to cut emissions by phasing out conventional boilers by 2035 by jason groves political editor for the daily mail millions of families face a new 100 levy on their gas bills under plans to phase out conventional boilers by 2035 ministers want to incentivise households to buy cleaner energy by switching existing green levies from electricity to gas the idea is expected to feature in a long awaited heat and buildings strategy to be published this month the strategy is part of wider efforts to meet a commitment to slash carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 whitehall sources last night insisted that overall energy costs would not increase because levies on electricity bills will be reduced at the same time as those on gas are increased millions of families face a new 100 levy on their gas bills under plans to phase out conventional boilers by 2035 this is about shifting the incentive toward cleaner energy said the insider it will take place over a period of years and overall bills will remain static by the time the process is complete there will be many fewer people using gas and paying the levies but some tory mps fear the plan could spark a public backlash with gas prices at record levels sir robert syms said it was politically impossible to load green taxes on sky high gas bills calling for a rethink he added higher prices will do what the green taxes would have done and adjust behaviour fellow conservative mp craig mackinlay called for fracking to be allowed to reduce the need for imported energy the centrepiece of the new strategy is a ban on the installation of gas boilers from 2035 oil fired systems will also be phased out in the clampdown on fossil fuels the government has ruled out the idea of fining householders who do not get rid of their gas boiler after 2035 boris johnson considered pushing back the date after it provoked an angry reaction from tory mps but sources last night said it had been retained over the next decade green levies will gradually be shifted from electricity to gas the levies currently amount to around 13 per cent of typical electricity bills the committee on climate change has suggested typical gas bills could end up rising by around 100 a year ministers believe tackling traditional gas heating is essential if the government is to hit its carbon reduction targets traditional gas boilers account for about one seventh of uk carbon emissions boris johnson considered pushing back the date after it provoked an angry reaction from tory mps but sources last night said it had been retained they are already set to be banned from newbuilds by 2025 but ministers believe the process of removing them from 25million homes will take another decade earlier this year they committed to cutting emissions by 78 per cent by 2035 compared with 1990 levels conservative mp craig mackinlay pictured called for fracking to be allowed to reduce the need for imported energy the committee on climate change which advises the government last year said gas boilers should be banned from 2033 the independent body said replacement gas boilers should be permitted from 2025 only if they are also capable of running on hydrogen earlier this year the international energy agency called for a global ban on new boilers using fossil fuels from 2025 the agency said outlawing them was an essential part of a narrow but achievable path to cutting net carbon emissions to zero by 2050 but ministers believe the uk is not ready for an overnight transformation around 85 per cent of homes rely on gas for heating some boilers could be converted to run on hydrogen but even optimistic assessments believe hydrogen is unlikely to account for more than 10 per cent of the total because of constraints on supply most homes would have to rely on heat pumps which extract warmth from the ground or air but these typically cost more than 10 000 to install and they can struggle to warm all but the best insulated homes on cold winter days the new strategy is expected to include subsidies for people installing heat pumps fixed rate energy deals are set to break 3 000 barrier as ofgem warns of a significant increase in bills due to unprecedented rise in wholesale gas prices by fiona parker money mail reporter the cost of some fixed rate energy deals hit almost 3 000 yesterday as the regulator warned of a significant increase in bills when the price cap is reviewed ofgem chief executive jonathan brearley warned some of the unprecedented rise in wholesale gas prices would have to be passed through to consumers households should expect a large increase in their bills when the energy cap currently at 1 277 is next reviewed in april he said but mr brearley also suggested the regulator could adjust the cap more regularly in future to prevent energy providers going out of business when there is a sudden surge in costs the cost of some fixed rate energy deals hit almost 3 000 yesterday as the regulator warned of a significant increase in bills when the price cap is reviewed asked about a rise in bills in april he said the shift in prices had been phenomenal and unprecedented the wholesale market has gone up and down extremely quickly so we can t predict fully what that will be he added but looking at the costs that are in the system we are expecting a significant rise in april with gas prices so unstable there are now only a handful of fixed deals available the most expensive one year tariffs from together and bristol energy which are green deals would cost the average household 2 991 an incredible 1 714 more than the price cap the priciest non green tariff was from scottish power at 1 907 some 630 more than the current limit even the cheapest fixed deal on offer a green tariff from ge was 495 more expensive at 1 772 ofgem chief executive jonathan brearley pictured warned some of the unprecedented rise in wholesale gas prices would have to be passed through to consumers ordinarily at this time of year experts would be encouraging customers to switch to a cheap fixed energy deal but as the gas crisis escalates households are being urged to stay put on their supplier s default gas and electricity deal so they are protected by the energy watchdog s price cap remaining on a firm s standard variable tariff was previously the most expensive way to pay for power and customers could often save hundreds of pounds a year by switching but this year there are no fixed deals cheaper than the price cap experts accused suppliers many of which are struggling to stay afloat of exploiting customers panic to push expensive fixed deals scott byrom of the comparison site theenergyshop said we re hearing from customers that they are being told about longer term fixed tariffs rather than suppliers actively pushing standard tariffs this is very concerning suppliers should be flagging to customers clearly that this is the cheapest deal rather than playing to consumer fear and pushing heavily priced fixed deals dozens of suppliers are at risk of being crippled by the energy price crisis with 12 already going bust this year some firms including the uk s second largest supplier ovo are now refusing to take on any new customers which may be in breach of ofgem s rules bulb which has 1 7million customers has stopped accepting customers online and will only take requests by phone comparison sites some of which are operating again after temporarily halting their services are compounding confusion among households by advertising deals that are not available to new customers households should expect a large increase in their bills when the energy cap currently at 1 277 is next reviewed in april he said stock image the energy market is in chaos after wholesale gas prices soared to a record high rising by 40 per cent on wednesday it means many firms cannot afford to continue supplying customers who signed up to their cheapest deals months ago james daley of the consumer group fairer finance said shopping around is not the no brainer it was once was and weathering the current storm by sitting on a standard variable tariff is probably the safest course of action the market is extremely volatile and we don t know how many suppliers will collapse in the next few months but if your firm does go bust you won t be cut off or lose any of your credit balance a spokesman for together and bristol energy denied the firms were pushing sales the price of the fixed term deal we have in the market represents the current cost of energy and reinforces how the price cap is protecting consumers he said ofgem said we are looking at all market developments factories and industrial plants are already slowing down production amid rocketing gas prices industry boss warns amid growing calls for government support and fears for thousands of jobs by jacob thorburn harry howard martin robinson chief reporter and rory tingle home affairs correspondent for mailonline and sean poulter and mark shapland for the daily mail an industry leader has warned the government that factories and industrial plants across the country are already slowing production ahead of the christmas season due to skyrocketing energy costs thousands of businesses require a package of government backed rescue measures to tackle mounting gas and electricity costs as britain enters the winter months the chairman of the energy intensive users group eiug has said dr richard leese told bbc breakfast all across the energy intensive industries they re equally affected we ve seen the curtailment in production in the steel and fertiliser sector that s had a knock on impact into the supply chains in the industrial supply chains and domestic supply chains what we ve done is lay out to government a winter package of measures that we think is needed to prevent those interruptions in supply chains occurring again it s needed absolutely right now gas prices are at an unprecedented level and the businesses that manufacture the goods that we need are trying to operate under these unprecedented conditions the measures that we laid out in front of the secretary of state yesterday will go some way to alleviating the pain this winter and we really need action for this winter industry leaders put forward three proposals to the government to avoid interruption to supply chains this winter dr leese added he said winter cost containment measures looking at the carbon costs particularly that are placed on energy intensive users there is partial relief to some energy intensive but it s not widespread we re subject to qualification rules that are legacy rules from european union membership our second measure is to look at network costs within the uk network costs are distributed differently to other european countries in terms of energy intensive industries getting a higher proportion of the network costs and that s something within ofgem s gift the third measure is to look at emergency measures should any of our energy intensive plants need to shut down rapidly looking at the threshold for emergency relief to try and prevent lasting damage to very expensive plants and equipment amid industry warnings ofgem warned there will also be a significant rise to the cap on energy bills hitting millions of britain s poorest people with soaring energy prices set to push average annual bills through the 2 000 barrier for the first time as the gas crisis escalated industry analysts suggested the current energy cap of 1 277 would rise by as much as 800 while energy firms slammed the cap as not fit for purpose paul richards chief executive of together energy which he said is currently making losses told bbc radio 4 s today programme the price cap as a mechanism is not fit for industry nor is it fit for customers when the converse situation arises and the wholesale price starts to drop sharply the price that will be passed through to customers in april might feel like a very very poor deal whereas at the moment the price cap feels like a price that is too good to be true although customers are protected in the short term i think we re looking at somewhere between 1 billion to 3 billion in costs that are going to be spread back across business and households as a result of these failed suppliers as britain faced the prospect of soaring bills as the energy crisis continues to tighten its grip it emerged rocketing energy prices could strangle production of british steel a leading industry figure warned today as factory bosses said they will have to close within weeks as a result of the ongoing crisis the surge in wholesale gas prices has already forced many small suppliers in the uk out of business vladimir putin has been accused of holding europe to ransom in a bid to win approval for his nord stream 2 pipeline boris johnson has waded into the row and branded the proposed link from russia to germany a threat to security experts claimed putin was using the crisis as leverage over the nord stream 2 pipeline project which is run by gazprom pictured an output filtration facility of a gas treatment unit at the slavyanskaya compressor station how sleepy joe handed putin the bargaining chip he is using to hold europe to ransom in gas crisis joe biden gave the green light to a controversial gas pipeline that vladimir putin is now using to hold europe to ransom by threatening to withhold supplies and push up the price of energy unless european regulators grant the link final approval in a move that confounded critics and supporters alike the us president effectively green lit completion of the 11billion nord stream 2 pipe to germany back in may when he lifted sanctions that had halted construction work through 2020 before biden s intervention the us under donald trump had been bitterly opposed to the project fearing it would hand influence and money to putin while hurting the west s ability to retaliate against him nord stream 2 has been enthusiastically backed by angela merkel who wanted the pipeline to increase germany s natural gas revenues but it has been bitterly opposed by eastern european nations who fear it will embolden russia to act more aggressively on their borders and in ukraine gas shortages have caused wholesale prices to increase across the uk and in europe eight times this year sparking warnings that household bills could soon soar while raising the possibility of blackouts russian engineers finished work on nord stream 2 last month and now only need eu leaders to give final approval to start pumping gas a bargaining chip that moscow has wasted no time in using to threaten the continent aleksandr novak russia s energy minister has explicitly linked easing the gas crisis caused when demand outstripped supply as economies reopened post covid with the opening of the nord stream 2 pipe saying it would send a positive signal that would help cool the market advertisement it comes as andrew large director general at the confederation of paper industries attended a meeting on friday with the business secretary and other representatives of energy intensive industries to discuss the wholesale gas crisis speaking to the bbc radio 4 s pm programme afterwards mr large claimed it was very clear across all of the sectors that there are serious risks factories could stop all activities as a result of the gas prices being too high his comments came after the boss of uk steel gareth stace said earlier today that if prime minister boris johnson and the government does nothing to help firms rising prices could start to strangle production at his conservative party conference speech earlier this week mr johnson promised that the uk would become a higher wage higher productivity economy but mr stace claimed that if no action is taken we ll actually be walking blindly towards a low wage economy eiug chairman dr richard leese added we ve already seen the tip of the iceberg with fertiliser consequences energy intensive industries manufacture goods throughout all supply chains everything from minerals to paper goods all of that is intrinsically linked for example when the fertiliser factory closed or paused the c02 is not just needed for food we use it in the cement industry to supress explosion risk those goods are used throughout the supply chain it s all interlinked so if one industry sector is affected we re all affected suggesting reforms including inspecting the cap four times a year utilita energy s non executive chairman derek lickorish said the cap is not fit for purpose there is no doubt that there is going to be a huge cost paid by customers for failed suppliers certainly well over 100 million for every 200 000 customers that fail the government has to look at means by which they can support not only energy suppliers but also big industry as the gas crisis escalated industry analysts suggested ofgem s current energy cap of 1 277 would rise by as much as 800 ofgem chief executive jonathan brearley didn t put a figure on it but said there will be a significant rise in the price cap set by the industry regulator which helps to control the cost of gas and electricity in the uk he didn t knock back claims that fixed and other deals could reach 2 000 in 2022 we can t predict everything and the wholesale market as we ve seen has gone up and down extremely quickly so we can t predict fully what that will be he told bbc radio 4 s today programme but looking at the costs that are in the system we are expecting a significant rise in april but mr brearley added that the current price cap will remain until april we have no plans to raise the price cap before april he said the energy crisis has been blamed in part on a shortage of natural gas caused by vladimir putin allegedly choking supplies to europe to pressurise regulators into approving the controversial nord stream 2 pipeline today boris johnson waded into the row branding the link a threat to energy security and suggesting the decision to bypass ukraine to bring supplies direct to germany would damage the ukrainian economy a no 10 spokesman said although nord stream 2 will not directly impact the uk s energy security it could have serious implications for central and eastern european countries some european countries are nearly wholly dependent on russian gas which raises serious concerns about energy security in comments reported by the times the spokesman also warned about the damage to ukraine which currently hosts the largest pipeline network for russian gas and benefits from large transit fees he added nord stream 2 would divert supplies away from ukraine with significant consequences for its economy the natural gas price is currently hovering at around 2 40 a therm down from more than 4 yesterday after traders were reassured by putin hinting that russia would consider increasing exports mr large said friday when we talked with the secretary of state this afternoon it was very very clear across all of the sectors that there are serious risks of effectively factory stoppages as a result of the costs of gas being too high to bear and in those circumstances there will be a gradual knock on effect through supply chains right the way across manufacturing consumer retail and other products and so the risks are very very real when asked what this would mean for the paper industry mr large said it would be incredibly damaging for profitability he said so our paper mill will be wanting to operate 24 7 365 days a year with the exception of planned stoppages for maintenance and so on so the financial sustainability of that paper mill is dependent upon being able to maximise its uptime every minute that the machinery isn t working every minute that paper isn t being produced is a damage to the profitability of the sector and a damage to the future investment potential and opportunities going forward however mr large did say that the meeting was a positive first step to look at the solutions they had proposed and that kwasi kwarteng clearly furthers our desire to avoid any potential supply chain disruption the energy intensive users group eiug echoed mr large s comments saying in a statement it had welcomed the opportunity to meet the business secretary and is pleased he wants to find practical solutions to the challenges members face going into this winter eiug chair dr richard leese said our message to the secretary of state was for prompt and preventative measures to help avoid recent production curtailments in the fertiliser and steel sectors being replicated in other areas this winter eiug will work with government to avoid threats both to the production of essential domestic and industrial products as well an enormous range of supply chains critical to our economy and levelling up the country the eiug s membership comprises trade associations and customer groups representing industrial sectors with the heaviest energy consumption in the uk these are uk steel the chemical industries association the confederation of paper industries the mineral products association the british glass manufacturers federation the british ceramic confederation boc air products and the major energy users council mr kwarteng said consumers will be better insulated from erratic gas prices as wind and solar power start providing more energy to the uk s households he insisted that by decarbonising the uk s power supply the government would ensure that households are less vulnerable to swings in fossil fuel markets he told a conference organised by trade body energy uk the uk so far as many of you know has made great progress in diversifying our energy mix but we are still very dependent perhaps too dependent on fossil fuels and their volatile prices uk steel boss mr stace told bbc radio 4 s world at one today the prime minister this week is calling for a high wage economy the steel sector already does exactly that we pay our workers 45 per cent higher wages in regions where steel is they re highly skilled as well if you re paying as much for gas and electricity as we are as a steel sector then these unprecedented price rises are hurting us now today if the prime minister and government does nothing to help us they could start to strangle steel production here in the uk and rather than working towards a high wage economy we ll actually be walking blindly towards a low wage economy he added at the moment there s an energy crisis if government does nothing tomorrow there ll be a steel crisis the south east is still in the grip of fuel crisis one third of petrol stations are dry or short on supply despite grant shapps claim uk levels are close to normal range the south east is still in the grip of a fuel crisis with a third of petrol stations dry or short on supply despite transport secretary grant shapps today claiming supply levels are close to normal range the petrol retailers association s research showed that 12 per cent of filling stations have run out of fuel in the region while 17 per cent have one grade of diesel or petrol under 75 per cent of petrol stations have both diesel and petrol in london and south east england as opposed to 90 per cent outside those areas the figures are at loggerheads with mr shapps claims that the issue is almost entirely over he told gb news today in london and the south east supply levels in petrol stations are getting very close to the normal range and we ll see them opening up in a day or too there was never a shortage of fuel in the refineries and storage stations as soon as people queue up to fill up fuel you get into a situation where you get a run on something like we saw with toilet rolls the amount of fuel in the petrol stations themselves is about double what it was at the low point advertisement in terms of what impact that could have on jobs that wouldn t be good not only for the steel sector and for those regions where there is steel but for the uk economy as a whole his comments came as experts said the russian president had substantial scope to boost gas supplies to the west but he was using the issue as leverage in a bid to win approval for a new pipeline the surge in wholesale gas prices has already forced many small suppliers in the uk out of business mr kwarteng last night insisted there would be no bailout for failing firms adding that the government s plans to decarbonise the uk s power supply would protect customers in the long term last night ofgem appeared to open the door to a rethink on the way the cap works with chief executive jonathan brearley saying although the gas price rise is unprecedented today we will need to plan on the basis that shocks like this could happen again the current energy bill price cap is set at 1 277 a year based on typical use but industry analysts suggest it could rise by anything from 500 to 800 next april based on the current market mr brearley has made clear that a dramatic surge in gas prices which leapt 60 per cent at one stage this week will push up bills when the cap is reviewed some energy firms have been pushing for the cap to be ditched entirely or raised much sooner mr brearley said for millions of households the price cap has played its part in mitigating the consequences of the current gas price rises but it is designed to reflect fair costs and therefore will need to adjust over time to reflect the changes in fuel costs that we are seeing today it is hard to predict how long gas prices will stay high but we do expect significant upward pressure on prices industry analyst dr craig lowrey of cornwall insight said prices were likely to stay at a record high through to next winter and beyond the national grid says the gap between energy supply and demand this year is likely to be at its lowest level for six years the organisation said it was confident blackouts can be avoided but government energy adviser tom edwards said if we have a very cold winter there is a chance of blackouts we are reliant on imports from other countries and if the flows are not forthcoming then as a country we will have to take action to reduce demand some large industrial companies like car manufacturers may have to turn off exclusive research for the daily mail by the centre for economics and business research cebr also yesterday revealed how inflation will cost the typical family of four an extra 1 800 by the end of this year meanwhile a retired couple can expect to see living costs rise by more than 1 100 and a lower income couple could be stung by nearly 900 analysis of price rises in the last year shows the cost of a second hand car has risen more than 1 600 a tank of fuel is up more than 10 and the price of a pint of beer is creeping close to 4 today baked beans became the latest victims of soaring inflation with the head of manufacturer kraft heinz today revealing the cost of the breakfast staple will have to go up a supply chain crisis and dramatically spiking energy prices are combining to threaten to push up the price of ordinary goods ranging from food and toilet rolls to bricks and chemicals in previous years there was inflation in coffee because of a bad crop or a bad crop in beans what is different now is that this inflation is across the board he told bbc radio 4 s today programme so it s impossible to navigate through this moment of inflation without increasing prices it s up to us and to the industry and to other companies to try to minimise these price increases major industrial groups say soaring prices are already forcing some heavy industries such as steel fertiliser and brick manufacturers to scale back production and potentially shut down they are calling for government support of the kind that was given to banks during the 2008 financial crash mr kwarteng said last night protecting consumers from rising global gas prices is my top priority it comes as school meal suppliers have been forced to slash the amount of dishes they offer to pupils due to supply shortages iss one of the uk s largest canteen suppliers has reportedly told 450 schools it is having issues with sourcing packing and distribution predicting that the problem will get worse over the winter and will continue until february school canteens were advised by iss in an email to stockpile long life dried tinned and frozen products to make sure children can still be fed in a worse case scenario this winter according to itv news meanwhile food wholesaler bidfood has warned that it is experiencing significant supply pressures and struggling to recruit hgv drivers blaming the issues on the covid 19 pandemic and brexit

micheál martin looked shook when he arrived on tuesday night for the eu summit in slovenia people wondered why well it was a long flight and he was probably still exhausted from launching the national development plan the day before but another possible explanation emerged on wednesday morning de caawl from yaawl read more no wonder poor micheál was a bit green around the gills that he was able to continue at all is testament to the taoiseach s sense of duty and inner fortitude one can only imagine his emotional turmoil after taking that bombshell call from youghal in which backbencher james o connor threatened to resign from fianna fáil if two road projects in east cork were left out of the ndp realising on sunday that the castlemartyr bypass and fota road upgrade had been overlooked must have taken all enjoyment out of racing enthusiast o connor s few days in paris during prix de l arc de triomphe weekend or at least that s what some of his colleagues were sympathetically saying despite his anguish micheál bravely struggled on before returning to dublin on thursday for high level talks with the youngest td in the dáil following tense discussions the taoiseach said sure we ll stick em in so giving james the assurances he had so vigorously sought i am thrilled trilled the first time td now being compared to maverick politician marc macsharry who has left the fianna fáil fold before dropping another bombshell by announcing he was going to remain in the party a switch has been flicked he told patricia messenger on the cork today show on c103 on friday not since helen mcentee gave birth or the time sinn féin went 10 points clear in the polls have the spirits of an entire nation been lifted so comprehensively but while he was abroad representing the country the taoiseach was not to know the baby marc affair would end so well it had to explain why he looked out of sorts but then the real reason surfaced micheál arrived in the slovenian capital on tuesday evening with little time to spare before the leaders dinner when he landed at ljubljana airport there was an official car waiting engine running to bring him to the picturesque brdo castle estate the driver screeched away as soon as the irish party got in clock hitting 150km h within seconds as they were rushed through the rolling hills of rural slovenia at breakneck speed which is why micheál arrived on time but looking shell shocked security was very tight at the summit to discuss the will they won t they plans to grant accession to the western balkans no nonsense slovenian security prevented government press secretary paul clarkson from entering the business dinner with the taoiseach without the requisite purple badge despite producing an evidently purple badge it was rejected officials identified him as a photographer whereupon clarkson in an effort to solve the issue said he would be taking photographs of his boss hob nobbing inside with his fellow leaders when asked for his camera he produced his iphone which didn t go down well inside delegations could not sit together but had to go to different parts of the room depending on the colour of their badges the following morning the taoiseach s driver and protection officer was also prevented from accompanying him into the hall because he had the wrong colour badge he had to sit in an adjoining hotel with his disgruntled eu counterparts as they were trudging in visiting journalists were being thrown out because they also had the wrong colour badge but back to the first night s dinner phones were left at the door the badgeless leaders setting a fine example for their cabinet members to ignore they dined on beef cheeks cooked for 13 hours at the precise temperature of 74 degrees on reduction sauce with smoked potatoes and meat stock also on the menu was migration europe s place in the world and the energy crisis we hear the whole thing went on until nearly 2am but it was all business as opposed to anything remotely enjoyable it is not true that micheál hired an uber for his return trip to the airport where there s a will there should be a bill the registration of wills bill was up for discussion in the seanad on wednesday the need to introduce legislation establishing a register of wills has been under discussion since 2005 but three previous attempts to introduce it failed because of endless arguments over the issue this week was the bill s fourth time up before the oireachtas it is now high time for serious engagement between government departments and agencies and other stakeholders such as the law society said minister for social protection heather humphreys she asked for a nine month delay to get everybody in the one room to thrash this out once and for all so a decision can be taken on the bill which has been knocking around the houses of the oireachtas for longer than me and many others all speakers were in favour of the move citing the difficulty people often have when trying to find out if there is a will in existence and where it is stored there were stories of wills getting lost or altered or destroyed by aggrieved siblings the aim is simple it is to assist in asserting upon the death of a person whether a will exists and in whose custody it is kept it is no more and no less said nui senator rónán mullen he mentioned the old line where there s a will there s a relative then recalled the episode of glenroe where dinny byrne had some expectations of inheriting from his uncle peter the bad news was conveyed to him by fr devereux that there was no will he said dinny i am afraid your uncle peter died intestate to which dinny replied i thought it was the heart the roscommon law fine gael senator seán kyne is concerned with one aspect of the wills bill the register of wills should be kept in the general register office oifig an ard chláraitheora government offices in roscommon he began reading aloud from the document before setting it down he paused now if this is the same crowd that are dealing with the records of deaths abroad i wouldn t have a lot of confidence in them kyne a minister of state in the last government explained how he helped bring about legislation on behalf of parents who couldn t get a death certificate in this country after their child had died abroad so we changed the legislation in this house when i contacted the ard chláraitheora in roscommon i was politely told just because ye changed legislation up there in dublin doesn t mean we jump to your tune down here we have to update and change the computer systems and things like that he told the seanad still clearly very annoyed about what had happened last time i heard they were on strike he added contemptuously so if you re trying to get this office to look after wills never mind a nine month delay a nine year delay might be more appropriate because a kick in the proverbial backside is what that office would want with the way that they respected people who lost loved ones abroad he was so wound up he repeated what was said to him his seanad colleagues were a bit taken aback they hadn t been expecting this sudden onslaught against workers in the gro that s the office oifig an ard chláraitheora spat sean just because ye do things in dublin and changed the law we basically act as we want down here in our office that should go down well in roscommon chu denied entry yet again if god loves a trier then former lord mayor of dublin and green party chairwoman hazel chu is truly blessed hazel was among the large number of politicians attending wednesday s march for maternity calling for the ending of covid 19 restrictions that exclude partners from attending appointments and services in some maternity units the members of the oireachtas women s caucus were to the forefront of the demonstration when it reached leinster house as the protest drew to a close a 20ft long scroll featuring a fraction of the heartbreaking stories of pregnancy loss and distress endured by parents was unfurled and presented to the female tds and senators who undertook to bring it into leinster house for the attention of the minister for health push minister donnelly push read on one of the placards outside the oireachtas women marched to the main gates with the scroll the hydraulic ramp across the entrance was up and they stopped for a time while the ushers surveyed the scene while many restrictions have been lifted in kildare street the ban on visitors to the complex is still in force as they proceeded forward the ramp was lowered to let them pass but not before the chief usher shimmered into view for a discreet word with chu who was marching on in with her fellow politicos he very politely turned her away former mayor chu who went on a controversial solo run for a seat in the seanad earlier this year when she failed to get green party backing to contest a byelection was also unsuccessful in that attempt to get into the oireachtas meanwhile a caucus member told us that stephen donnelly wasn t around to receive the scroll so we rolled it up and shoved it into his pigeonhole leo s trumpian gaffe as his four year tour of duty comes to an end rté s washington correspondent brian o donovan has brought out a book about his us experience four years in cauldron has a lot of very interesting background material from leo varadkar about his various meetings with donald trump from the white house to capitol hill to shannon airport the then taoiseach seemed to get on very well with trump who appeared to like him he also talks about polite mike pence who is very proud of his irish roots varadkar was hoping to build a relationship with the then us vice president which might help tilt the white house and state department a little more in ireland s favour when it came to issues such as brexit but it didn t work and pence famously shocked his hosts during a visit to ireland by saying the government should negotiate in good faith with prime minister johnson and work to reach an agreement to respect uk sovereignty and then there was the famous lunch on capitol hill when leo got carried away and tried to curry favour with trump by letting on he intervened with clare county council to sort a planning issue for trump at his clare golf resort varadkar s assessment of the episode along with his honest recognition of how his impulsive nature gets him into trouble is telling of course i regret it i was at lunch got caught up in the moment made a silly joke about something that was kind of half true that i didn t really remember anyway it kind of blew up and marred the visit a little bit sadly there are many moments in my political life like that just some stupid thing that you

washington ap u s employers added just 194 000 jobs in september a second straight tepid gain and evidence that the pandemic has kept its grip on the economy with many companies struggling to fill millions of open jobs friday s report from the labor department also showed that the unemployment rate sank last month from 5 2 to 4 8 the rate fell in part because more people found jobs but also because about 180 000 fewer people looked for work in september which meant they weren t counted as unemployed september s sluggish job gains fell shy of even the modest 336 000 that the economy had added in august and were the fewest since december when employers actually cut jobs the economy is showing some signs of emerging from the drag of the delta variant of the coronavirus with confirmed new covid 19 infections declining restaurant traffic picking up slightly and consumers willing to spend but new infections remained high as september began and employers are still struggling to find workers because many people who lost jobs in the pandemic have yet to start looking again supply chain bottlenecks have also worsened slowing factories restraining homebuilders and emptying some store shelves the shortages have also boosted inflation to its highest levels in three decades many economists expect that as covid recedes further and americans resume traveling eating out and seeing movies more people will re enter the workforce and hiring will strengthen this report is a look in the rear view mirror said daniel zhao senior economist at the jobs website glassdoor and hopefully this means the worst is behind us and the worst was just a slowdown in the recovery economists had expected september to produce robust job growth as schools reopened thereby freeing parents especially working mothers to return to jobs several enhanced unemployment benefit programs had expired sept 6 potentially providing incentives for more people to seek work and at least before delta intensified many companies had planned to return to working in offices which would have revitalized still dormant downtowns instead as a result of the delta variant many office buildings remain vacant and fears of the disease rebounded a census bureau survey found that the number of people not working because they had covid or were caring for someone with the disease doubled between july and early september covid outbreaks have also temporarily closed some schools making it harder for many mothers to hold down permanent jobs the proportion of americans who either have a job or are looking for one known as labor force participation declined in september from 61 7 to 61 6 well below the pre pandemic level of 63 3 friday s report said the drop in labor force participation occurred entirely among women suggesting that many working mothers are still caring for children at home for men labor participation was unchanged some after school programs weren t yet in place last month to provide all day care and child care has become scarcer and costlier in many cases lael brainard a member of the federal reserve s board of governors noted in a recent speech that covid 19 outbreaks in late september caused 2 000 schools to close for an average of six days in 39 states the enhanced unemployment aid that ended in early september included a 300 a week federal supplement as well as programs that for the first time covered gig workers and people who were jobless for six months or more many business owners and republican political leaders argued that the extra 300 a week benefit was discouraging some people from seeking jobs because they could receive more money from unemployment aid so far though the ending of those programs appears to have had little effect on the number of people looking for work john lai chief executive of mister car wash with about 350 locations said he s seeking to hire 500 people in the next three months to add to the company s 6 000 workers mister car wash based in tucson arizona has raised its average hourly worker pay to 14 50 an hour since the pandemic began and offers health and retirement benefits yet it s struggling to attract applicants it is certainly the most challenging labor market that i have ever experienced in my 20 years in the business lai said some of his female employees he said have had to quit to care for children and despite the end of federal supplemental unemployment aid lai is seeing little increase in the number of job applicants i think it s the big mystery of the economy he said the folks that are sitting on the sidelines why are they sitting on the sidelines he suspects that one factor is lingering fear of becoming sick at work many economists still think that most of the roughly 3 million people who lost jobs and stopped looking for work since the pandemic struck will resume their searches as covid wanes it took years after the 2008 2009 recession they note for the proportion of people working or seeking work to return to pre recession levels but the uncertainty created by a global pandemic zhao suggested has made it harder to foresee when that might happen this time we re not yet at the new normal where we can really say what to expect in terms of the pace of workers re entering the labor force he said september s meager job gain will likely still be enough for the federal reserve to proceed with its plans to pull back on its extraordinary assistance to the economy said lydia boussour an economist at oxford economics the fed is expected to announce in november that it will begin slowing its bond purchases which are intended to lower long term loan rates and encourage more borrowing and spending another factor behind the weakness in hiring last month was a sharp drop in local government education jobs the number of such jobs fell by 144 000 last month despite the reopening of schools that decline suggests that many local school systems didn t hire as many people as they typically do many have had trouble finding enough bus drivers cafeteria workers and other support staff most industries added jobs last month though at a reduced pace transportation and warehousing for example which has been boosted by a spike in online shopping added 47 000 jobs manufacturers added 26 000 restaurants hotels and amusement parks though gained just 74 000 positions more than in august but far below the pace in the summer when they were adding hundreds of thousands of workers a month another reason workers are scarce is a surge in retirements among older more affluent workers whose home equity and stock portfolios have surged since the pandemic struck and who have managed to build up savings goldman sachs estimates that about 1 5 million people have retired who wouldn t have before the pandemic upended the economy many of these people will likely stay retired economists expect copyright 2021 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published

energy and financial stocks there a lot of financials and oils so that may explain why the up down volume seems neutral while new lows are leading can we look at wmb oil near pivot yes but up 13

live show with only a phone no internet i ll be doing some travelling where i will nnot have internet but i may have use of a phone even if i had celluar internet i d kill my data plan in just a couple of ibdl shows i know that zoom can support dial in but that seems to depend on if the show host toggles the phone call ability on or off so is it possible to dial into the live ibdl show with just a phone call i think you can call in and turn off the video can you discuss the use of stop loss orders and strategies for using them in this tricky market would use of stop limit on quote for example possibly be a good means of avoiding being whipsawed we rarely use stop orders we use alerts and then see how the stock is trading so often in uptrending markets stops will be triggered near the open and then the stock recovers and pushes higher i find them to increase being whipsawed thoughts on carg slightly extended now but following through nicely after thursday s breakout not seeing much in the way of base breakouts at this point but this one is working nicely so far greetings from houston if the market holds can i add to a zs position later today great looking weekly chart top notch fundamentals still could be in early stages of move asan task mndy glbe thought glbe would be able to hold support at 10 week line but clearly not happening asan task acting better fyi not a complaint i can t find the live page on the mobile phone app i called ibd they said to listen from your phone you have to use the website go to investors com ibdlive from your phone s web browser when

marketsmith should it currently be set to correction also is this a great time to find stocks using the rs line blue dot especially if the correction persists the blue dot list is my favorite way to find the next crop of leaders justin is correct dxcm cgms being used by both leading insulin pump manufactures live answered is there any particular reason that ibdl does not enable a phone number dial into the ibdl live show does zoom charge more i get it that the visual charts are important part of the show but i m thinking that audio only is sometimes better than not being able to connect at all when travelling love the show dont want to miss any if we can help it it s a security issue we have to have our subscribers log in to view the show if we handed out a phone number we could get people sneaking in who aren t paying in ms is there a way to set an alert when a stock crosses a 21 or 50 day moving average put the stock in smart alerts and turn on the 21 and 50 day alerts not all of them will send you a visual or audio alert but you can go to my alerts and see everything that is triggering great show love matt so bright hope you all have a great weekend thanks so much and great to meet you in person last weekend just curious is there a ryme or reason as to how the comments show up here in the q a doesn t seem to be in chronological order they show up when answered not when the question was posted exactly why i like a small position in cathie wood s arkg let her educated team sort through all the risk reward scenarios and no gap down disasters arkg has been hard hit

remember that old joke that there s a starbucks on every corner these days you might be seeing more dollar stores than coffee shops believe it or not dollar stores outnumber starbucks and mcdonald s combined and more are coming four of 10 store openings this year are expected to be dollar stores and consumers are not shying away according to a recent consumer reports survey 88 percent of americans shop at dollar stores at least sometimes the most common reason they re inexpensive and convenient but are the savings real a cr investigative reporter says yes but there s a caveat when compared with nearby grocery stores dollar stores were indeed cheapest for an entire purchase for each of our shoppers but even though you might save more money at a dollar store your options for items could be pretty limited because of those limited options cr says don t bother with a shopping list when you go to a dollar store instead go in with a strategy and be flexible not many dollar stores carry fresh fruit and vegetables but they often stock frozen versions of each which can be as nutritious if you re in need of some over the counter medicine skip the name brands like advil and tylenol and opt for the generics which are chemically identical and often much cheaper and always check the expiration date no matter where you shop it s important to remember that you may be able to get many of these items cheaper in bulk at big box stores but in an emergency or if you just need a little dollar store offerings are usually a good bet dollar stores aren t immune to the ongoing supply problems so don t be surprised if you see more empty shelves or a more limited selection of certain products

walk into a local shop and they re out of what you need and have no idea when they will get it the supermarket is no better there s a big empty hole on the shelf you re headed to order online and the message often reads delivery will be delayed that happened to us during the heat wave when we tried to order an air conditioner your delivery is scheduled between sept 30 nov 26 what ordered cancelled we are more than a year and a half into the covid pandemic and retailers are still scrambling to stock their shelves what gives at teri s toybox you don t have to look any further than the dwindling stack of a popular toy to begin to understand the whacked out global economy today stretch em squish em that s the noodlies owner teri soelter has a few still in stock but she is not getting more anytime soon right now the noodlies manufacturer in jinhua china has so much product there s no more room in his warehouse she told us he can t find ships to put them on to get to our vendor and the rental price of trans ocean containers has skyrocketed from 3 000 per trip to 25 000 a load normal delivery turnaround time on noodlies is three to four days and now we re looking at months absolutely months of back orders added soelter it doesn t end once a ship makes port a total of 40 of all american imports come through los angeles as of late september the new york times reported there were 61 container ships anchored and unable to unload there and another 29 vessels drifting 20 miles off shore because they cannot get close to an anchorage seattle also has more container ships than it has room for some ships are sitting idle in holmes harbor off whidbey port gardner in everett and west of elliott bay in seattle back at teri s toy box soelter told us her january order for ravensberger puzzles is still back ordered because german factories shut down for extended periods early in the pandemic some plush animals are also hard to come by and she faces the possible extinction of her prized german designed schliekt safari animals only a pair of lions is left no lionesses no cubs and just two polar bears one monkey and a single alligator all victims of covid s economic chaos the animals are now made in china which is having trouble getting raw materials for the molds soelter summed up worldwide it s a domino effect with covid everything just came to a dead standstill and it s become a real nightmare that nightmare has come to visit other edmonds businesses at housewares owner robert boehlke normally tells custom furniture clients their order will be delivered in six weeks now he tells them if the order came in today we d say march or april for delivery all boehlke s custom sofas and sectionals are crafted in vancouver b c but the furniture maker is having trouble getting raw materials and a few weeks ago stopped taking new orders until after christmas it has been said boehlke a phenomenon that i did not expect everybody ordering furniture people staying home in the pandemic created a remodeling surge he told us that his customers have been remarkably patient and said housewares has not lost a sale however when shipments of smaller items do arrive boehlke said it has been pure chaos the week s deliveries he added either came with a third of the items missing or things showed up that they never ordered even a seattle made product fran s chocolates couldn t deliver their july order to housewares they had chocolate but told boehlke that they didn t have boxes up a couple blocks at the wooden spoon owner jenny shore told us that it s the weird odd little stuff that s not coming in such as aprons or scrub brushes we seem to be getting said shore whatever they had left in their warehouse before the whole supply chain got screwed up from soaps and lotions made in the u s to cards from canada towels from india and paper napkins made in germany finding them has been a challenge one example brings the story home wooden spoon sells candy made in spokane but the company couldn t ship their candy the ink they use on their bags comes from india and their ink was on that container ship that got stuck in the suez canal this summer how connected it all is wow you don t realize shore said shubert ho co owner of feed me hospitality knows all too well how the supply chains are connected ho and his partner andrew leckie own salt iron bar dojo shooby doo catering the mar ket san kai sushi potlatch bistro and fire and the feast all in edmonds one of the most popular items at the mar ket has been the lobster roll ho s supply chain brings restaurant fresh lobster from the sea to the mar ket in less than 24 hours it used to cost the restaurant 30 a pound for fresh not frozen lobster but the pandemic hit the maine lobster fleet the processors the shippers and that price soared to 50 a pound and there s more from plastic wrap to aluminum foil and to go boxes ho said there s been a shortage and the price is up the price of chicken a restaurant staple he told us jumped 200 in just a few months and that affects all restaurants the shop owners we talked to echo the same advice at housewares robert boehlke recommends if you re looking for christmas gifts buy them early at some point it s gonna dry up wooden spoon s jenny shore told us she has product and will put it out for christmas but advises buy it all before the hoarders get it and from teri soelter if you see it and you want it buy it because who knows when the next lioness will come in with her baby cubs by bob throndsen
dear democrats it s been a tough start to the fall hasn t it and a tough month too with halloween looking downright scary as the stock market fluctuates and the economy behaving like a junk car with a dead battery yes you control congress and the white house but you can t seem to figure out how to pass the kind of legislation that would allow you to complete the most basic job of government to fill potholes you still have a chance to make things right though with grumpy mitch mcconnell the gnarly republican reaper and u s senator from kentucky pushing back the deadline on raising the national debt limit you have time to stop and consider how you can unravel the legislative knot you ve created you can still save yourselves from your activist excesses and a massive defeat in next fall s midterm congressional elections you might also save joe biden s presidency too but you need to act fast so here s some advice think of it as kelly s five steps to political sanity 1 admit your mistakes yes this sounds like that scene in the godfather when michael corleone confronts carlo over setting up sonny for the bloody wipeout at the toll booths but you need to acknowledge that you ve misjudged the nation s desire for a transformation of social programs as corleone said it s time to settle the family business you don t have to burn bernie sanders at the stake or tell alexandria ocasio cortez to go back to tending bar but democrats of all stripes need to say that they have overreached with their woodstock pipe dream to turn america into denmark or norway replete with cradle to grave social programs that cost around 3 5 trillion more kelly potholes or child care what s at stake in this week s battle in congress mike kelly it was a nice thought all that money going to people in need ol bernie was practically rolling in his granola as he pondered the largeness of this idea he even proclaimed on cnn that america was moving beyond the military industrial complex gee we haven t heard that line since the early 1970s but don t you find it interesting that republicans think your programs and their price tag is too much for our fragile economy to bear right now yes too many republicans still behave like misguided greedy libertarians viewing every welfare recipient as a con artist and yes too many republicans are massive tax cheats who think far too many government programs should be privatized but a large segment of clear thinking republicans are asking sober and well intentioned questions right now about the scope of this 3 2 trillion makeover and whether america can afford it listen to them 2 infrastructure is job one here is where democrats can shine led by moderates like rep josh gottheimer the democrat who represents a deeply purple district in northern new jersey that includes ardent trumpists and sanders like socialists a bipartisan senate and house coalition carved out a 1 trillion plan to fix roads bridges rails and water and sewer lines america desperately needs this kind of big bang effort think of it as the pothole version of fdr s new deal america s infrastructure problems are massive largely the result of the no more taxes attitude that sprung from the reagan administration and helped to galvanize a generation of skin flint republicans who refused to pay for all manner for public programs from schools parks roads and airports to bridges railroads and sewers the skeletal bone structure of a nation as a result america s infrastructure decayed badly and now as you watch frustrated commuters sit in car clogged roads that were built for the model t era the economy is hurting as a result the proposed 1 trillion infrastructure outlay would fix those roads and create some 2 million new jobs even mcconnell supports the bill 3 tax the rich one of the most important pieces of the 3 5 trillion plan to upgrade america s social programs the so called social infrastructure plan is the provision to revise the nation s tax system simply put most of the upgrade in social programs would be funded by telling america s wealthiest citizens that it s time to pay their fair share this should be the centerpiece of the democrats message to america sadly it s not since the 1960s wealthy americans led by republicans have managed to trim back the taxes that corporations and rich folks used to pay the impact on government s ability to meet the needs of its most vulnerable citizens has been nothing short of devastating meanwhile jeff bezos and his billionaire buddies who pay almost no taxes are blasting into space on their personal rocket ships while homeless men and women sleep under rusty bridges that s not embarrassing it s shameful a moral scar on this nation republicans counter that government wastes too many tax dollars it s an old message worn thin and pandering to the great army of uninformed people who only watch fox news sadly new jersey s gop gubernatorial candidate jack ciattarelli promises to trim the state budget if elected well good luck with that jack you might start by calling on state and federal governments to close the tax loopholes that have allowed far too many wealthy people to pay little or no taxes 4 bipartisanship is not a sin former new jersey gov tom kean an ardent republican makes a point of bragging how his administration worked bipartisan wonders to pass all manner of legislation even though he had immense power kean would not support any bill that did not have co sponsors from both parties exclusive tom kean calls on biden to release all secret files on possible saudi links to the 9 11 attacks mike kelly today kean is sadly considered a dinosaur by his own party that s too bad because he understands that bipartisanship is actually the glue that holds together important legislation without bipartisan support legislation that is only supported by one party will be revoked or trimmed when the other party gains power democrats need to remember that as they push through their 3 5 trillion social makeover if you can t get republican support you risk having your programs revoked in the coming years exhibit a is bill clinton s bill to ban assault weapons 5 trim the fat in the social makeover bill this is going to be the hardest political pill to swallow democratic progressives have lined up behind a laundry list of pet projects the climate change gang has its priorities the social welfare advocates have theirs something has to give let s start with free community college yes it s a nice idea but shouldn t this plan benefit the poorest of americans why should families with wall street bonuses send their kids to college for free the same is true with child tax credits this is a solid idea but it really is geared to working class families where both parents are working sometimes with multiple jobs and also trying to care for children wealthy families have more resources for their kids it s a fact of life so why should the wealthy receive the same benefits as the poor finally take a hard look at business incentives for green industry yes we all want to upgrade solar energy but solar panels don t work in every spot and we also want to provide incentives for car companies to produce electric vehicles but a 12 500 tax credit for an electric vehicle these are just a few ideas to trim some of the excess spending from the 3 5 trillion bill even some progressives now agree finally that the price tag has to drop perhaps to 2 trillion so sharpen those budget knives these proposals won t be easy the democratic party has become the political equivalent of bumper cars who don t drive in the same direction accidents are expected a way of life far too many segments of the party are wearing blinders too but after months of delays it s time to actually do something pass the infrastructure bill trim the social makeover legislation tell bernie and aoc to take a vacation in norway mike kelly is an award winning

it s hard to pass on a good deal but before you complete a deal make sure you understand all of the facets not just a lower price tag the tsx is slowly sliding down the descent is more akin to a running out of momentum phase instead of a sharp downward movement associated with market crashes and corrections still if the market is going down a long way you will have your fill of great deals many amazing stocks might become quite attractively valued and you might be able to bag some usually overvalued stocks at a bargain price but that s not something that can be successfully predicted right now and only time will tell whether the tsx is actually going down or is simply fluctuating if it s the latter you shouldn t wait around for good deals that might come with a market crash and look into the amazing deals available right now an undervalued high yield reit reits are usually very generous with their payouts but few reits are as generous as slate grocery reit tsx sgr u when it comes to the dividend yield the company recently completed a deal for us 390 million which gave them a portfolio of 25 properties in major metro markets in the united states the reit is already entirely u s focused and it expanded its portfolio quite aggressively the current portfolio adds up nicely to the reit s extensive u s portfolio of 106 properties in 26 states almost all the properties are grocery anchored 98 which shields the reit from bad market conditions the reit is currently offering a mouthwatering 8 3 yield and is trading at a price to earnings of 4 4 and a price to book of 0 8 times an undervalued timber company quesnel based west fraser timber tsx wfg is canada s largest forestry company and one of the largest if not the largest of its kind in north america it has an extensive and diverse portfolio both geographically and product wise it also has a small presence in europe four locations the strength of its product line is that it covers the full range when it comes to construction this forestry giant is an absurd bargain right now mostly because of its price to earnings which is 2 8 right now thanks mostly to the stellar second quarter earnings and it has remained at these low levels despite the fact that the stock price is still climbing and has grown almost 330 since the crash the next quarter s results will most likely bring about a correction since the timber prices have already normalized so even though the company is an absurdly good deal right now based on the number it might be a good idea to wait till the next quarter results before buying an iron ore royalty company labrador iron ore royalty tsx lif is currently trading at a price to earnings of 6 8 and a price to book of 3 8 times and it s an amazing deal right now primarily because of its dividend yield which is currently quite abnormally high the yield is 19 at the time of writing this and unless the company slashes its payouts the company will pay you back the capital you invest in it via dividends in about one and a half years the payout ratio is about 93 3 right now which is quite high but still not in the dangerous 100 plus territory the company has equity and royalty interest in the iron ore company of canada and offers investors exposure to this profitable business the stock also offers a bit of cyclical capital growth potential so it might be a good idea to buy the company when it hits rock bottom foolish takeaway

beyond clinical study said rachelle jacques ceo of enzyvant we are deeply grateful to the 105 patients who participated in clinical trials their families and all of the stakeholders who contributed to this pioneering regenerative medicine research program pediatric congenital athymia is ultra rare with an estimated incidence of about 17 to 24 live births each year in the united states children who

meeting of an arms control committee discussion of the united nations convention on the prohibition of the development production and stockpiling of bacteriological biological and toxin weapons and on their destruction bwc the foreign ministers of russia and china called attention to the us absence from the bwc treaty s verification protocols regime while recent events surrounding the search for the origins of covid 19 have given the proposal additional relevance it is by no means the first time it s been pitched russia made the same suggestions in 2018 a year before the pandemic began the treaty currently has no verification protocols and is little more than a gentlemen s agreement not to build or test bioweapons this is unlike other treaties such as the 1997 chemical weapons convention under which the us has destroyed much of its stockpiles of mustard gas vx and sarin projectiles albeit years later than they agreed to however the us did destroy its existing bioweapons stock between 1971 and 1972 under orders from then us president richard nixon notably before the bwc came into existence in 1975 the russian federation and china note with concern that over the past two decades the bwc states parties despite the wishes of the overwhelming majority have failed to reach an agreement on resuming the multilateral negotiations on the protocol to the convention suspended in 2001 when the united states unilaterally withdrew from this process despite the fact that the consensus was almost reached the china russia joint statement reads the statement notes that the us operates more than 200 biological laboratories located in other countries noting they function in opaque and non transparent manner and raise serious concerns and questions among the international community over its compliance with the bwc given the fact that the united states and its allies do not provide any meaningful information on those military biological activities that could allay concerns of the international community the russian federation and china urge the united states and its allies to act in an open transparent and responsible manner by informing properly on its military biological activities carried out overseas and on their national territory and supporting the resumption of negotiations on a legally binding protocol to the bwc with effective verification mechanism so as to ensure their compliance with the bwc us biolabs once drove weapons programlike many nations the us vigorously pursued biological and chemical weapons programs during and after the first world war by the time president nixon ordered their destruction the us had developed stockpiles of six biological weapons including anthrax botulism tularemia brucellosis q fever and venezuelan equine encephalitis virus as well as staphylococcal enterotoxin b a toxin produced by staphylococcus aureus bacteria as an incapacitating agent however it also had research programs into more than 20 other potential weapons including smallpox rinderpest typhus dengue fever yellow fever bird flu and plague early in 2020 a conspiracy theory arose in the united states that sars cov

biden administration also launched its own probe which found in late august that the virus was most likely natural and entered the human population via natural means not a bioweapon or escaped lab

buck clay i want to pose this it s a question i want everyone to think about so there are a lot of answers but i think it puts our conversation in a pretty useful framework right now what is joe biden good at because i think it s clear it s not being president and everyone who s being honest is seeing that play out in real time clay it s such a great question i don t know the answer because buck if you just rated joe biden right now and tried to find out what is the least bad performance by joe biden so far i was thinking about this i m glad you raised it he s clearly failing on an epic level at the border inflation is a disaster we re talking about epic unbelievable levels of murder that are going on there are 10 9 million open jobs right now and we can only somehow get 194 000 people hired all of those things are unmitigated disasters and certainly foreign policy with afghanistan everything could not have gone worse the only thing that i can say that hasn t turned to crap since biden took over is he hasn t completely eliminated the tariffs and the hard line that donald trump took against china now he s not gonna be anywhere near as effective but you know what somebody was tweeting me they were like hey you ve said before you don t root against the american president to fail and that is true i don t think regardless of who the political party the president represents is i don t want china to think that they can invade taiwan because we have an incompetent president right there are things that every president s going to do or not do that you agree or disagree with buck that s bad for everybody yeah clay that s bad for everybody look i don t want world war iii to happen because joe biden is so bad at his job right but really other than not changing some of the policies on china it s almost impossible be worse you and i both buck expected that joe biden would be a really bad american president i didn t expect for it to be this bad this soon buck he has gone below my already very low expectations clay yes same for me buck and this isn t just something that you and i are feeling yeah we work in radio and politics and media the polling shows this clay yes buck the people who have a mind that is open to being changed by reality and facts independents swing voters and all the data clay no doubt buck even some sliver of democrats are disappointed in what s going on with joe biden so far up to this point and i do think it s important for everybody to remember where we were a year ago and what they were telling us it was going to be like right all the speeches about i m gonna crush the virus not the economy it turns out joe is pretty good at crushing the economy and not the virus it shows us that there was really no effort all the talk of unity you know they made trump into this demonic figure and were willing to as we know lie about him on russia collusion we could do a three hour show now on all the lies they told about trump but the promise was there will be normalcy and unity when they re in power and that s how they sold it to people in michigan wisconsin georgia pennsylvania clay arizona buck they said all right fine it s covid it s a pandemic joe will bring us back to normal joe will build back better right give me a break now we see this no effort the unity thing went away day one right as soon as he sat down the oval office clay and started writing all the executive orders buck it might as well have been aoc sitting in the oval office at that point in time and then you ve seen since then everything that they try to do everything that is in biden s purview doesn t go well you have to lower your expectations constantly even if you have low expectations to begin with and now they re trying to tell us all this stuff like we can t actually see where is inflation where are there what 11 million jobs open what are the reasons for this i don t know maybe businesses and just the people in the economy working the economy in general with concerned about unnecessary regulation inflation huge spending raising taxes the continuation by the way of the lockdowns in the blue states you re starting to see the economic divide really play out as well the blue state panic porn stuff in new york and california is holding back those economies at a state level when red states are saying we re going back to work folks there is a real difference here clay yeah and i think we need to keep hammering home for average people out there and you and i have both been average people i live in the middle part of the country i pay attention as i m driving around what are the prices of gas gas is at seven year high buck 80 a barrel now it s gone over this is real money out of real people s pockets study that came out this week the average american because of the rising rate of inflation is paying 175 extra a month for the same things that they would have bought in past years biden keeps saying oh i m not gonna raise taxes on anybody making less than 400 000 a year the american people are smart when they look at their pocketbook and they recognize an additional several thousand dollars that s real let s talk about this for a minute if you re making 35 000 a year let s say you re the average american family out there 45 000 a year 50 whatever it is a couple of extra thousand dollars out of your pocket which is what inflation is costing that you are not able to deal with at all because you might have already had a tight budget the fact that your taxes are not being raised by the federal government doesn t mean that the money going out from your pocket for buying the basics in your life isn t also going up it s as if people don t recognize and i want to play a clip for everybody when we come back in this next break the reaction on cnbc to only 194 000 jobs but the larger context here buck is democrats don t understand basic business and they don t understand basic economics because if they did the added 175 for this inflation tax which is what s going on is a monster deal to people all over the country buck well a lot of them don t understand business and i think that there are those in the democrat party who would say oh but what about the rattners remember bruce rattner was in charge of the gm restructuring the obama administration hedge fund guide right they d have people who are coming from the business world yeah but they go along with an ideology that says that they can override with enough government power market forces or ignore market forces and basic human nature because they re so smart so you either have ignorance pushing democrat economic policy or extreme hubris a word that i ve been using a lot lately but i think it s quite applicable here where they think all the sudden it doesn t matter clay we are approaching 30 trillion in debt everybody should just take a moment and go back and look at what was happening in the country in 2009 and 2010 when we were at a fraction of the national debt that we re at now and people were deeply concerned about their children their grandchildren s futures and what it means we are seeing right now this is like the tide is rising up at our feet we are seeing what s happening with inflation because of these government policies and it s because there are people who believe that the government is effectively santa claus you just can give free stuff out to everybody and it s only the big bad mean evil republicans who don t want everyone to have endless free stuff there s no way it s free clay they say a big point that i don t think a lot of people have recognized and by the way republicans are not ceasing to be blamed here because they ve gone along to a certain extent modern monetary policy basically is instructing politicians that debt doesn t matter that the amount of national debt that we take on which has become massive because of covid at a level of government spending we haven t seen buck since world war ii when we were fighting the nazis and we had to produce all the materiel to allow the war to be fought and the japanese right buck yeah we had a lot of stuff going on in world war ii clay yeah but that is kind of in essence we spent the same caliber of gdp on fighting covid as we did to fight the nazis and the japanese in world war ii and win that war it s pretty crazy when you think about it buck and there s no way you can look at what the response has been pushed by experts and then all the financial wizardry or what s supposed to be wizardry behind it and see what we ve gone through in this country and say yeah it s been great how we ve handled covid no one thinks it s great how we ve handled covid so we have massive debt a tremendous amount of misery the destruction of freedom and where are we now look at where the economy currently is and it looks like i think it could get a whole lot worse you look at the supply chain going right now clay oh it s gonna be a mess buck it s one of these stories that sounds boring kind of like the debt for a lot of people oh the debt it s one of these things that sounds boring and it s lingering in the background it could mean empty shelves in your supermarket wherever you are listening to us right now they re gonna go in the store they re gonna say sorry we don t have any milk clay toys buck it s not actually going to be milk it s gonna be stuff that s brought in from china clay toys for christmas they re gonna be totally empty shelves buck that plug you need to get that machine doing the thing it does for you it s not gonna be in stock for six months clay laughing buck there s gonna be problems like that that s gonna be a real issue but we ll come back by the way the cnbc thing is pretty funny it s like whoa clay yeah buck turns out he s building back better not so much not so much with this biden administration
the assembly line at the ford rouge assembly plant in dearborn michigan us president joe biden s october 5 michigan speech in support of his administration s infrastructure spending program consisted in large part of a chronicle of the decline of american capitalism repeating his assertion that the us was now at an inflection point biden began by noting that for the better part of the 20th century the us led the world by a significant margin through investment in infrastructure such as roads highways bridges ports and airports we invested to win the space race we led the world in research and development which led to the creation of the internet but then something happened we slowed up we stopped investing in ourselves american infrastructure used to be the best in the world he continued but now the world economic forum ranks the us as 13th the situation was even worse in early childhood education with the organisation for economic cooperation and development ranking the us 35th out of 37 countries all those investments that fuelled the strong economy we ve taken the foot off the gas he said and then came an astonishing remark from the leader of the world s most powerful economy i don t know what s happened as the world socialist web site reported yesterday biden s speech was framed in terms of competition with china as he noted significant areas of the economy where china is outstripping the us but biden left unanswered the question of the underlying reason for the historic decline of the industrial capacity of us capitalism the answer is to be found in an another inflection point the end of the post war economic boom and the transition in the us economy from the beginning of the 1980s the decline in profit rates that ended the boom refuted the myth of so called keynesian economics that skilful demand management by governments could regulate the contradictions of capitalism the rise in profits and living standards that had marked the 1950s and 1960s was replaced in the 1970s by the phenomenon of stagflation the combination of low growth significant unemployment and rising prices something which had never previously occurred the crisis of profitability drove the american ruling class to launch a violent restructuring of the economy and class relations a process that was followed with national variations by its counterparts around the world the spearhead for the us and global offensive was the high interest rate regime initiated by the federal reserve under the chairmanship of carter appointee paul volcker whole swathes of us industry were destroyed and a massive offensive was launched against the working class starting with the smashing of the air traffic controllers strike in 1981 and the destruction of their union patco an operation carried out with the complete collaboration of the afl cio trade union bureaucracy the us economy eventually emerged from the volcker induced recession the deepest to that point since the great depression of the 1930s but it was undergoing a vast transformation this involved the development of globalised methods of production through which major corporations outsourced manufacturing activities very often to other firms and other countries including china to take advantage of cheaper sources of labour at home the profits derived from these operations were deployed to the financial markets with the result that increasingly the dominant form of corporate wealth accumulation was not investment in new plant and equipment the growth of industrial capacity leading to the expansion of jobs as it had been in the period of the boom but the securing of profits through financial manipulation that is parasitism not productive activity was now front and centre of the us economy this process aided and abetted by the policies of the us federal reserve began under reagan in the 1980s and then rose to ever greater heights in the 1990s under the clinton administration which dismantled the last remaining vestiges of the regulations imposed on finance as a result of the depression the internal rot and decay at the heart of this new mode of accumulation was laid bare in the financial crisis of 2008 a senate report of 2011 into the crisis found it was not a natural disaster but the result of high risk complex financial products undisclosed conflicts of interest and the failure of credit rating agencies and the market itself to rein in the excesses of wall street in the words of democrat senator carl levin who chaired the subcommittee that carried it out the investigation found a financial snake pit rife with greed conflicts of interest and wrongdoing however in the aftermath of this devastating report nothing was done to address the cause of the crisis rather wall street was bailed out by the government to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars the fed instituted the policy of quantitative easing through which trillions of dollars were injected into the financial markets not only to continue the speculation that had led to the crisis but enabling it to reach new heights not one of those responsible was charged for the criminal offences they had committed in fact such action was explicitly ruled out by obama s attorney general eric holder in 2013 when he said it could destabilise both the us and world economy the banks and finance houses were not only too big to fail those in charge of their operations were too big to jail the period since the global financial crisis has seen speculative parasitism escalate to ever greater heights the rise and rise of the stock market and the emergence of ever more arcane forms of speculation was fuelled by the ever greater injections of money from the fed more than 4 trillion since the near total financial meltdown in march 2020 at the start of the pandemic the development of high tech and the production of ever more sophisticated computer chips is one of the key areas for the economy of the future it is here that some of the most egregious expressions of parasitism are to be found as a recent report by economist william o lazonick published on the new economic thinking web site makes clear lazonick has for some time been documenting the growth of share buybacks by major corporations to boost the value of their stocks at the expense of productive investment he holds out the reformist utopian prospect that if this could be halted then corporations could at least be turned in the direction of acting for the common good nevertheless his work has provided some valuable insights in his latest analysis he focuses attention on the high tech firms that are seeking billions of dollars from the biden administration under the creating helpful incentives to produce semiconductors chips for america act the act which provides 52 billion was passed by the senate in june and now awaits approval by the house the semiconductor industry association sia describes it as bipartisan legislation that would invest tens of billions of dollars in semiconductor manufacturing incentives and research initiatives over the next 5 10 years to strengthen and sustain american leadership in chip technology which is essential to our economy and national security but as lazonick and his co author matt hopkins report most of the corporate members lobbying for the passage of the chips for america act have squandered the support they have received in the past they note that among the signatories on the sia letter sent to biden in february this year are five large stock repurchasers intel ibm qualcomm texas instruments and broadcom did a combined total of 249 billion in buybacks over the decade 2011 2020 equal to 71 percent of their profits and almost five times the subsidies they are now seeking over the next decade the extent of buybacks is even greater in another lobby group the semiconductors in america coalition siac formed in may this year to push for passage of the legislation this group includes apple microsoft cisco and google these firms spent a combined 633 billion on share buybacks in the period 2011 2020 more than 12 times money under the act in the period from october 2012 to june 2021 apple alone spent 444 billion on buybacks equal to 87 percent of its net income this is on top of the 114 billion paid out as dividends representing an additional 22 percent of net income the corporate lobbyists of the sia have a clear sense of where the political winds are blowing with the emphasis by the biden administration on the need to combat china they wrote in their february letter that the decline in the us share of global semiconductor chip manufacturing capacity from 37 percent in 1990 to 12 percent in 2020 was largely because the governments of our global competitors offer significant incentives and subsidies to attract new semiconductor manufacturing facilities while the us does not as for biden s professed ignorance as to the reasons for the american decline lazonick and hopkins make clear he is well aware of the role of share buybacks they note that as vice president in 2016 he wrote an opinion piece in the wall street journal that the government should take a look at regulations that promote share buybacks and tax laws that discourage long term investment saying the future of the economy depends on it but this president from delaware the home of american tax avoidance companies is a long ago bought and paid for creature of wall street moreover the growth of parasitism has become so entrenched within the financial system and the economy as a whole that attempts to curb it threaten to set off a financial and economic crisis the us response to its manufacturing decline is not going to be a return to the past but rather as the crippling of the chinese telecoms giant huawei demonstrates an intensified attack on its rivals to the extent that industrial and manufacturing capacity is developed it will arise from the drive to war rooted in objective logic of the strategy of the strategic competition with china that the biden administration has made central to its agenda

the dog eared book hosts few author events and has no local school partnerships or large initiatives underway but as it approaches its seventh anniversary the palmyra n y store represents something rare in american bookselling today it is simply a bookstore and a highly successful one at that at the helm is owner carrie deming who opened her store in january 2015 with 5 000 which she used to purchase seven flats of used books from a jobber in connecticut the stock wasn t great she jokes but it was enough to fill her shelves and test the biggest question of all could palmyra located on the shores of lake ontario support a bookstore we re in wayne county n y and it s always been a book desert deming said aside from a nearby antiquarian store the next closest bookstore is a barnes noble 30 miles away but despite opening in the dead of winter deming said she knew within weeks that the store could succeed because of the community s embrace they were wildly excited she recalled a fast learner deming found ways to source quality used books nearby and held firm to a handful of principles one of which was keeping debt to an absolute minimum while being open to trying out new ideas but in 2014 new ideas were hard to come by for a small independent used bookstore that is until deming found a handful of like minded booksellers on facebook and got word of bookexpo in 2016 she decided to make the trek to new york city and it sparked a new idea when i came back i was like i don t know if this community will support new books but i would love to sell new books deming said so i started by opening an account with baker taylor and brought in one shelf of books by then deming had a good sense of what customers wanted having seen strong sales of romance speculative fiction young adult and children s books instead of stocking frontlist titles she filled the new shelf of new books with a mixture of backlist titles that were always in demand as well as personal favorites she soon sold out and in time she established direct accounts with publishers growing her stock of new books including frontlist until it took up 70 of the store s 8 000 titles deming s trial and error approach wasn t always successful author events did not draw large audiences and the schools weren t interested in partnerships she was also growing concerned about her space deming s landlord was getting older and would only offer one year leases for her storefront on the main street in the heart of palmyra with each passing year she became more worried that the building would change hands and put her out on the curb every time any space came up for sale i d be looking at it because meeting other booksellers one of the number one recommendations is to buy your building deming said the only way to guarantee long term sustainability is if you can control that huge expense of mortgage or rent in 2019 deming got word from a customer that another building was about to go on the market a building with a large store front space occupied by a liquor store that was about to vacate before it was listed she looked at the property and contacted the owner a 92 year old book lover who wanted the building to go to her deming and her husband put their home on the market bought the building converted an upstairs apartment into their new home and began renovations on the store space always careful to keep costs down she found high end fixtures for the store for free at a bookstore that was closing near new york city and opened the doors to the new location soon after the start of the pandemic in may 2020 with the change in location and the outbreak of the pandemic deming was worried that sales would decline but instead the store s sales doubled and have held steady in the year and a half since we re on a corner and we have our own parking lot now she said and visibility seems so much better a ton of people have said they never even knew we existed at all and they found us here deming has also found a new following with her booktoks including one that garnered 1 1 million views in which she called out customers for flipping around the covers of lgbtq themed books in her store her posts have established dog eared book as an lgbtq friendly store and deming said they ve also generated sales deming continues to be the store s sole employee though her mother helps out on occasion dog eared book is open from 10 a m to 6 p m tuesday through friday and from 10 a m to 5 p m on saturdays as she looks ahead deming plans to hold firm to the simple approach that has generated her success keeping costs down and focusing on a dedicated community of readers i think if someone s thinking about opening a small store the narrative is that you need to have a ton of money and a gazillion employees and that s just not true deming said a lot of people think well i can t afford to do this well no not necessarily i started this store with 5 000

a mega acquisition deal worth roughly 929 million of israeli replacement heart valve maker valtech cardio by heartware international has israel s startup sector buzzing with excitement the us based heart technology company announced late yesterday that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the privately held or yehuda company which employs just 40 people and specializes in the development of devices for mitral and tricuspid valve repair and replacement it is the biggest buy out of an israeli medical device company ever and one of the biggest deals in any industry in israel it comes in the wake of a bumper year when in one week alone in january acquisitions of companies including annapurna labs red bend software cloudon and others reached 900 million by joining heartware we can more quickly and fully realize the potential of our pipeline technologies and further influence the underpenetrated markets that we serve said amir gross founder and ceo of valtech terms of the deal will see valtech shareholders receive an up front consideration of 4 4 million shares of heartware common stock 800 000 shares of heartware common stock contingent upon ce mark approval for cardioband and 700 000 shares of heartware common stock upon the earlier of first in man implants for either cardioband tricuspid or cardiovalve the deal is said to be worth at least 929 million the buy out is subject to regulatory approvals as well as heartware stockholder and valtech shareholder approvals the massachusetts company said the deal is expected to be closed later this year the mega deal did not come out of nowhere heartware and valtech have been bedfellows since 2013 when the us company invested in the israeli med tech team founded in 2005 valtech cardio has full in house development manufacturing and clinical research capabilities and over 130 patents and patent applications the company which was founded by gross and yiftach beinart in an incubator in ariel began life with a grant from the office of the chief scientist we identified valtech as having the broadest most compelling portfolio several years ago which led to an investment in 2013 this investment gave us a unique opportunity to observe valtech s significant progress across their portfolio of valve repair and replacement technologies it is from this vantage point that we have concluded that valtech s platforms represent the most innovative and comprehensive portfolio of interventional and surgical products for mitral and tricuspid repair and replacement in development today said doug godshall president and ceo of heartware helping millions millions of people with heart disease are likely to benefit from this deal valtech is a leader in the development of innovative surgical and transcatheter valve repair and replacement devices for the treatment of mitral valve regurgitation mr and tricuspid valve regurgitation tr mr is a condition in which the mitral valve leaflets fail to close properly allowing backflow of blood from the left ventricle into the left atrium during systole left untreated severe mr can eventually lead to a significant deterioration in cardiac function and eventually death in the us alone 4 2 million patients are affected by mitral valve disease according to heartware meanwhile tr is estimated to affect 1 6 million patients in the us and complements the mitral patient population as a significant percentage of patients suffer from both mr and tr heartware which develops and manufactures miniaturized implantable heart pumps or ventricular assist devices to treat patients suffering from advanced heart failure says this deal will provide it with a complementary portfolio of technologies to broaden the treatments it offers heart failure patients and enhance patient outcomes valtech provides heartware with commercial stage products for mitral repair as well as a robust technology pipeline an advanced r d center and an impressive experienced team with a proven track record said godshall valtech s portfolio includes cardioband the first interventional transfemoral direct annuloplasty system designed for mitral and tricuspid repair cardinal a semi rigid adjustable annuloplasty ring system that provides surgeons with the ability to optimize annuloplasty results cardiovalve a low profile transcatheter mitral valve replacement tmvr system with five degrees of steering maneuverability and v chordal a surgical and interventional chord replacement system for mr repair v chordal which has been successfully evaluated in a first in man clinical trial is expected to expand the range of percutaneous solutions offered for treating degenerative mitral valve pathologies and allow more patients to be treated without the risk of open heart surgery the mitral repair market is already a well established and rapidly growing market with a significant unmet immediate clinical need the cardioband transfemoral annuloplasty system represents a more reproducible and predictable platform for mitral valve repair than existing solutions we believe cardioband will be a natural and clear selection as a first line treatment for the broadest spectrum of mr patients since it offers a safer option and even in early clinical use has already demonstrated a strong efficacy profile said godshall valtech has benefited significantly from heartware s early investment in our company since then we have developed a strong relationship based on a shared mission to deliver transformative products to patients with advanced heart failure and degenerative heart conditions said amir gross founder and ceo of valtech heartware s existing market development experience and commercial infrastructure provide a compelling platform from which to launch multiple products worldwide including a near term launch of cardioband in international markets following anticipated ce mark approval this year together we can offer clinical heart failure teams a compelling portfolio of surgical and interventional technologies to serve the advanced heart failure population advertisement
the non profit watchdog group campaign legal center filed ethics complaints on september 22 against seven members of congress including u s representative cindy axne ia 03 the complaints ask the office of congressional ethics to investigate four u s house democrats and three republicans who did not disclose stock trades within the time frame required by the stop trading on congressional knowledge stock act that 2012 law was designed to prevent members of congress from turning inside knowledge into profit for axne it was the worst way to find out about a disclosure problem the ethics complaint generated extensive iowa media coverage all of which included quotes from delighted republicans for u s representative mariannette miller meeks ia 02 the episode was a heads up to get her own financial disclosures in order before she faces similar scrutiny next year complaint highlights troubling trend the stock act requires members of congress to file periodic transaction reports within 45 days of any purchase or sale valued at more than 1 000 the campaign legal center s staff compared annual financial disclosures for all house members who have served more than one term looking for clues about transactions that were not disclosed in a timely manner or at all the group s full complaint against axne is enclosed at the end of this post staff identified 28 assets from her annual disclosure for 2019 that do not reappear on her 2020 disclosure suggesting those stocks were sold another fifteen assets reported on the 2020 disclosure were not listed on the previous year s suggesting axne purchased those assets but failed to report the transactions as required the total value of the assets in question is somewhere between 43 043 and 645 000 axne did not file any periodic transaction reports in 2019 or 2020 while some purchases involving her accounts may not have triggered stock act reporting requirements if they were valued below 1 000 that s unlikely to have been the case for all of the undisclosed transactions the campaign legal center noted that the stock trades could very reasonably arouse conflict of interest concerns since axne and four colleagues serve on the house financial services committee the complaint expressed particular concern about shares axne has bought or sold in visa mastercard wells fargo and ss c technology holdings a financial technology company the group asked the office of congressional ethics to conduct a preliminary review to determine whether rep axne s nondisclosure was an intentional violation of the stock act and house rules and an attempt to avoid scrutiny of trades connected with non public information or with potential conflicts of interest the complaint argued that failing to file the disclosures is unlikely to be merely an oversight because axne was required to attend mandatory ethics training in 2019 and 2020 in addition the complaint says axne should have known about the disclosure requirements because high profile insider trading allegations engulfed several senators in march 2020 and became widely publicized in a news release the campaign legal center said this ongoing trend of stock act violations shows that merely the threat of a nominal fine is not deterring members of congress from breaking the law kedric payne the group s general counsel and senior director of ethics said a lack of accountability is basically giving elected officials the green light to buy and sell stocks based on information gained from committee meetings without any transparency for their voters he added until we see meaningful enforcement paired with real transparency i see no end to this troubling trend she does not personally manage or execute transactions after news broke about the ethics complaint a spokesperson for axne said in a written statement while congresswoman axne completes her own financial disclosures she does not personally manage or execute transactions related to her retirement account or the ones she has with her husband or her small business in accordance with her legal requirements cindy axne has submitted disclosures of her assets through her first three years in congress if there are errors with those disclosures they are unintentional and the congresswoman will take immediate and all necessary steps to ensure her disclosures are accurate and in accordance with the law axne s staff declined to answer follow up questions on the record the statement implies axne did not realize the law requires her to disclose all stock transactions from her accounts even if not directed by her the training videos provided by the house ethics committee to all members are not publicly available it would be useful to know whether that training which covers annual financial disclosures as well as the stock act requirements clarifies that all sales or purchases must be reported within 45 days regardless of who directed the transaction to determine whether axne knowingly violated the law the office of congressional ethics will need to find out who initiated stock sales or purchases from her accounts as well as how she understood the reporting requirements comparing the timing of the transactions with the house finance committee s hearing schedule will also be important to discern whether inside information played into any investment decisions iowa republicans weren t about to wait for additional fact finding gop state party chair jeff kaufmann told reporters on september 23 that axne s explanation was quite frankly pretty unbelievable she s been caught red handed she broke federal law he said her excuse is weak this is purposeful look she sits on the financial services committee you do not conduct 40 transactions with total amounts possibly up to well over half a million and have that not be purposeful kaufmann can t know whether axne s actions were purposeful he doesn t know whether she was even aware of the stock trades at the time let alone conducting them many people don t pay close attention to how their funds are being managed nevertheless he and iowa gop communications staffer kollin crompton have continued to claim axne knowingly broke federal law we ll know more when the office of congressional ethics reports their findings but regardless of what that investigation uncovers kaufmann s talking points will surely appear in many 2022 campaign ads against axne the campaign arm of u s house republicans is already trying to brand axne as corrupt one other iowan in congress appears to have violated federal disclosure laws fortunately for her she has a chance to correct the errors before they prompt a formal ethics complaint from a watchdog group bullet dodged for miller meeks the cedar rapids gazette s erin jordan was first to report on the annual financial disclosures filed by iowa s four u s house members excerpts from her september 17 article miller meeks a republican representing iowa s 2nd district filed the least information on her financial disclosure form her report says none disclosed for assets and unearned income liabilities positions or agreements for her earned income for 2020 miller meeks reported 100 000 for her salary as a u s representative although she didn t start that job until january 2021 it s possible she intended that amount to represent the share of her 174 000 congressional salary she d been paid through aug 13 when the report was filed miller meeks did not list her 25 000 annual salary from the iowa senate where she served from january 2019 to january 2021 will kiley a spokesman for miller meeks said wednesday his boss now is working with the house to update her form to add her iowa senate salary he said miller meeks does not have any outside income including from iras or 401 k s that she would be required to report on the form kiley did not respond to my emails seeking to clarify whether miller meeks really has no assets outside income or retirement accounts it would be unusual for a doctor with several decades of experience not to have any savings or investment accounts i turned to campaign legal center staff to help me understand what federal law requires if miller meeks co owns a home would that need to be listed as an asset or liability if her name is on a bank checking or savings account would the balance within some range need to be listed as an asset on her annual disclosure if she has any investment or retirement accounts would those need to be reported as assets even if she drew no income from them during 2020 delaney marsco the center s senior legal counsel for ethics responded via email on september 24 she noted that the group didn t review miller meeks annual disclosure in detail or those of any first term house member for this project they scrutinized annual reports only from members who filed them for two or more years speaking generally about the law marsco told me for personal residences members must disclose any mortgages or home equity loans in schedule d liabilities in their financial disclosure report a personal residence does not need to be disclosed as an asset in schedule a unless it generates rental income i e from the rental of a basement unit or room in the house a second home that is held for investment purposes generates rental income during the reporting period must be disclosed regarding other assets marsco explained banking and checking accounts held by the member the member s spouse or member s dependent child must be reported as assets in schedule a if their value exceeded the reporting threshold 1 000 during the relevant reporting period investment and retirement accounts like iras and 401 k s must be reported as assets in schedule a including all underlying assets in those accounts miller meeks did not disclose any assets or liabilities that may not be a problem with respect to her residence if she and her husband own one home free and clear that is with no outstanding mortgage or equity loans and the home does not generate any rental income it seems extremely improbable that miller meeks has no reportable banking or investment accounts though she loaned her congressional campaign 195 000 during 2020 federal election commission filings have listed that loan as coming from personal funds unlike kaufmann and crompton i operate in good faith so i m not asserting that miller meeks knowingly broke federal law based on what kiley told the cedar rapids gazette miller meeks and her staff appear to have the mistaken impression that investment accounts need to be disclosed only if the member received income from them during the reporting year they should know better if they completed the ethics training required for members of congress and staff but people can make honest mistakes in response to one of my recent tweets crompton asserted that miller meeks never failed to disclose a transaction axne is illegally hiding stock trades you know better what i do know is that miller meeks has not filed any periodic transaction reports so far this year and didn t disclose any accounts or stock holdings whatsoever if she owns any stock at all she has failed to disclose assets and if there has been any activity in any of her investment or retirement accounts she may have also neglected to disclose stock trades we ll know if and when she files more complete annual financial reports for 2020 and 2021 miller meeks is lucky to have time to fix her disclosure problems before the campaign legal center looks closely at the next round of annual reports p s u s representative ashley hinson ia 01 told the dubuque telegraph herald in april that she and her husband would sell all their publicly traded stocks and going forward would only will invest in widely held mutual funds and exchange traded funds for their retirement savings hinson filed a periodic transaction report detailing a number of stock sales in march so as far as i can tell she has kept her promise and complied with stock act requirements representative randy feenstra ia 04 disclosed banking pension and 401 k accounts on his annual disclosure he has not filed any periodic transaction reports this year but that may not be a problem if there has been no recent activity in any of his investment or retirement accounts appendix complaint filed against

activist investors have traditionally been anything but agents for positive change they are more often compared to vultures engine no 1 a hedge fund launched less than a year ago is a still rare exception its activism more closely mirrors the broader sense of the word it engages with companies with an eye to pushing social and environmental causes advertisement the fund is best known for coming out of nowhere to defeat an old guard of the fossil fuel industry exxon mobil in a proxy battle in june despite owning only a tiny stake in exxon it recruited major shareholders including blackrock and the california state teachers retirement system to its side and eventually won three seats on exxon s corporate board now engine no 1 has announced that it has a stake in gm not to be a combative force but to support ceo mary barra s established commitment to phasing out cars that run on gas and diesel fuels by 2035 gm s stock price rose on the news gaining more than 1 75 in late afternoon trading in new york making the long term case for greener energy chris james the investing veteran who founded engine no 1 has been clear about the distinction between the firm s relationship with exxon and its new toehold in gm both are legacy companies facing major transitions but that s where the analogy stops he told cnbc at exxon his company needed to convince shareholders of the business case for reducing the oil giant s carbon footprint and making investments in sustainable sources of energy as part of a long term vision he had help from exxon s own pattern of investor returns the fund s arguments were strategic rather than ideological that the company s returns have been consistently disappointing shareholders over the last 10 years and that it needed fresh direction in a rapidly decarbonizing world as quartz s samanth subramanian wrote after the exxon board vote advertisement but at gm the hedge fund will be supporting a similar premise already established by barra who has long embraced a plan to overhaul her company s products in june the automaker promised to spend 35 billion on its push into plug in vehicles by 2025 changing the auto industry narrative on electric cars the shift won t be easy given that electric cars still cost more for consumers and aren t yet as convenient to use but engine no 1 sees the momentum is there the automaker with the support of a really strong management team a great board has decided that they re going to embrace the future they re going to make the investments necessary in order to be successful during this transition james told cnbc engine no 1 has praised tesla for bringing mainstream interest to electric cars but it believes that giants of the automaker industry will need to expand in electric cars to have a meaningful impact on emissions in the auto industry he said there s been a narrative for a very long time that only technology companies can actually disrupt their own industry and we just don t think that s true james said on cnbc we think with the right management team with the right investments that they themselves can go in and disrupt the industry and be successful during this transition advertisement the hedge fund is estimated to hold fewer than 400 000 gm shares worth about 22 million on oct 4 that may be minuscule compared to other institutional shareholders but the tiny fund already has proven its capacity to have an outsized influence working from the inside progress for conscious capitalism engine no 1 s success with exxon where it says it has already has seen some impact suggests that social impact investors can successfully steal from the playbook of classic corporate raiders but rather than agitate for short term profits they can insist on changes that may require increased spending such as racial equity or other social justice initiatives observers told the new york times in june this newer strain of activist investors in the growing environmental social and corporate governance space is mainly aiming at companies that have not moved fast enough to shed old habits that continue to conduct business as usual as the world burns every high profile win is a hopeful sign for the cause of conscious capitalism and for the sustainability and equity issues that have become increasingly important to employees customers and investors as it happens barra was last week named the new head of the business roundtable an influential group of corporate leaders that in 2019 chose to throw its weight behind stakeholder capitalism over mere shareholder capitalism barra is the first woman to head the group in its quarter century history
family intercultural resource center volunteers stock shelves at the organization s food pantry during the covid 19 pandemic the resource center is one of several local nonprofits that recently partnered with 1 degree a web hosting platform that acts as a one stop shop for all nonprofit services within a community priscilla balderas family intercultural resource center thanks to a generous local donor summit county community members are now able to access various nonprofit services easier through a platform called 1 degree the platform compiles most local nonprofits and their services into one user friendly database that helps community members learn about and find resources more easily the summit foundation s program manager tara dew described it as a yelp for nonprofits the service which is now live has been a year in the making it all started with frisco resident and longtime summit county local paul finkel who reached out to the leaders of several nonprofits including the family intercultural resource center summit community care clinic keystone science school education foundation of the summit summit habitat for humanity the summit foundation and st anthony summit hospital finkel said he was looking to donate about 300 000 for tax reasons and that he wanted the money to go to a special project or initiative that focused on front line workers and community members for me it was a project that was going to help the people that need services whether it s mental health rent assistance or anything else and those are the people that i want to help in this county because they are the ones that keep me here he said when the leaders of these organizations began meeting they kept coming back to one idea dew pointed out that when some individuals look for housing they might also need assistance with child care or employment if all of those resources were housed in one place it would make navigating and accessing them that much more convenient this group of leaders started meeting regularly and discussing what kind of project that we could come up with that would really help make a difference for our local families dew said we just kept landing on this idea that we have so many nonprofit services in the community and they re doing an incredible job in filling the gaps that exist for community members but what we were missing was just a central place to really find and access all of those resources ellen reid executive director of the keystone science school said the new platform could be a game changer in that it can be updated and added to frequently and is likely to evolve in the future having a resource guide that is able to be updated in real time and pretty quickly is one of the reasons we wanted to push this project forward reid said all of the resource guides that we ve had have been paper or we thought about a website but who s going to update it that s why this really resonated for us as we were looking at some options finkel said he was enthusiastic about the idea when the team initially suggested it to him i d always been pushing various nonprofits to collaborate with each other and this did it he said they came up with a project that didn t necessarily help their own organization but helped the community and while they knew each other they re now able to work together better than they ever had before that was a byproduct of the project finkel isn t new to the nonprofit arena he has spent his retirement living in summit county full time since 1998 and has since given about 2 5 million in the past 10 years through various funds and entities a majority of that money has stayed in the county and has been given to various nonprofits finkel said when he donates he usually wants the money to go toward some kind of special project or initiative i tend to fund special projects and i tend to look for unusual projects especially startups where most organizations can t get grants for a brand new idea finkel said that s one of the reasons this project resonated with him a project like this requires the collaboration of multiple organizations and sometimes that makes it difficult to get funding finkel ended up donating about 320 000 to cover the launch of the platform and dew along with reid and nissa erickson development director for the family intercultural resource center led the charge in compiling the information of more than 700 nonprofits and getting the information uploaded onto the site so why 1 degree reid said the platform which is run by a nonprofit by the same name in san francisco is one of a few in the country that offers a hosting system for nonprofits according to the organization s website the goal is to get nonprofits and charities operating just as efficiently and as advanced as major tech companies like google and amazon the project took about a year to complete and launch the site went live monday oct 4 and it can be read in english or spanish all nonprofits fall under at least one of the nine categories urgent family and household food health housing education legal employment and money in addition to the site individuals can access the platform via its app that can be downloaded from the google or apple app stores the service is free to use and will be managed by the resource center s navigation team visit 1degree org and type in summit county to access and learn about the community s various services
with the right planning and by avoiding some potential landmines along the way holders of qualified small business stock qsbs may be able to avoid paying taxes on up to 100 of gains realized from the sale of stock in a startup this 100 exclusion has been available to startup founders employees and investors since 2010 if the house ways and means committee proposed changes are passed into law this 100 exclusion would be reduced to 50 for taxpayers with adjusted gross income equal to or exceeding 400 000 for all sales and exchanges made after sept 13 2021 unless a binding contract to sell the shares was entered into on or before that date the maximum gain exclusion is the greater of i 10 million or ii 10 times the holder s adjusted tax basis in the qsbs if you are a founder qsbs should be a factor to consider as you make decisions about forming your company issuing stock redeeming stock and beyond first the disclaimer like with most things that lawyers talk about every situation is different and there are exceptions details nuances and other considerations that are not included in this article you should always consult with a legal and tax professional to determine if and how you might be able to benefit from qsbs rules what is qsbs generally speaking qsbs is stock that a is acquired directly i e for cash or in exchange for services b from a qualified small business c is held for 5 years prior to sale and d without a disqualifying event occurring what does that all mean acquired directly qsbs generally must be originally issued by the company directly to you after sept 27 2010 to be eligible for the full exclusion in other words if you bought your stock directly from the company and after that date that s good if you bought it from another stockholder you will likely not be able to benefit from section 1202 there are exceptions for certain transfers by gift death certain tax free reorganizations or in limited circumstances to or from a pass through entity so proper tax and estate planning can preserve qsbs treatment even after certain transfers if you receive restricted stock as a startup employee that stock may also qualify provided that you make an 83 b election or in lieu of an 83 b election the restricted stock fully vests a qualified small business this refers to a 1 united states c corporation 2 engaged in a qualified trade or business 3 with aggregate gross assets no greater than 50 million prior to the issuance so equity issued by foreign companies s corporations and llcs cannot qualify as qsbs however and this is a big however it is possible to convert an llc or other non qualified company into a c corporation in a way that exchanges non qualified equity for newly issued qsbs if that happens in a non tax deferred manner and at a time when the value of the non qualified equity is high enough so that the basis of the newly issued qsbs exceeds 1 million then the qsbs gain exclusion may even exceed the typical 10 million maximum since the exclusion will instead be capped at the larger 10x basis as a note conversions from s corporations in particular should be given extra attention as they are unlikely to qualify the stock as qsbs absent a corporate restructuring or other targeted planning this issue often isn t discovered until diligence in connection with an exit when it is far too late to make the exchange and start the 5 year holding period discussed below the definition of qualified trade or business is fairly broad and essentially requires operation outside of a few proscribed industries most early stage technology companies will qualify even if tangentially related to some of the more common exclusions such as the hospitality industry personal services the financial sector farming and mining so for example companies engaged directly in the performance of services in health or financial services generally do not qualify but many healthtech and fintech companies do as a software as a service business model is typically viewed as distinct and separate from the underlying field of service eighty percent of the corporation s assets must be used in the active conduct of a qualified trade or business for the duration of the taxpayer s holding period this is highly fact specific and there are strategies for companies to implement to the extent they are engaged in both qualified and non qualified trades or businesses to issue qsbs the company must also have remained under 50 million aggregate gross assets at all times prior to the qualifying issuance previously issued qsbs does not lose its eligibility when this threshold is crossed but the company can no longer issue new shares of qsbs even if the total subsequently drops below that number held for 5 years prior to sale a holder must have held the stock for a 5 year period prior to the date of the sale in order for the stock to qualify as qsbs filing an 83 b election will generally start the clock for restricted stock issued for services similar limited exceptions to the original issuance requirement above generally apply here in the event of transfers but as with that requirement affiliate transfers should be reviewed for 1202 compliance to ensure the 5 year holding period will carry over to the transferee as intended certain rollover transactions may preserve qsbs treatment for stock that is sold prior to being held for 5 years no disqualifying event certain actions taken by the company can affect qsbs treatment for a single holder or for a group of or all stockholders at once in addition to the failure to maintain a qualifying trade or business as described above redemption and tender offer transactions which have become increasingly common for fast growing startups present a minefield of issues that can destroy the opportunity to benefit from section 1202 for example during the 2 year window on either side of a stock issuance to a particular holder a redemption of any stock of such holder will void qsbs benefits as to that stock issuance in addition certain larger stock redemptions occurring during a 1 year window on either side of a stock issuance can destroy qsbs eligibility for all stock issued in that issuance because of these rules any proposed redemption transaction should be discussed with counsel as early in the process as possible as mentioned above this article does not address every detail rule or exception out there that may help or hurt qsbs eligibility
