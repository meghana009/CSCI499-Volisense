can omicron spur a great depression a tourist is seen at wat arun on tuesday as thailand banned flights from eight african countries due to the discovery of the new omicron variant of the coronavirus photo reuters the emergence of a new covid 19 variant omicron has caused quite a stir globally just as many nations are on the recovery track from the delta variant scientists worry that the latest strain first detected in south africa has as many as 50 mutations 32 of them on the spike protein which theoretically makes it much more transmissible than the delta variant south africa made an announcement about the new variant on nov 24 after noticing that covid cases jumped from 550 a day to almost 4 000 in less than a week omicron started showing up around the world from england to hong kong and from denmark to australia it travels even faster than the news questions of concern are not just limited to the transmissibility of the virus but rather the severity of the disease and the effectiveness of existing vaccines there is no definitive answer to such questions yet as health scientists need time to conduct studies and the current sample size is too small to be conclusive amid all the uncertainty global oil prices tumbled over 10 after the news broke and stock markets tanked around the world of course many people want to know what impact the new variant will have on the world and national economies which were previously projected to see a full recovery next year i will try to answer some of these economic concerns but first i have erred on the side of caution by making a few assumptions about what impact the new variant will have on health policy if omicron despite the apparent ease with which it is transmitted does not result in more lockdowns of countries and cities the global and indeed most national economies will continue on their recovery paths as expected lockdowns are unlikely to occur unless omicron wreaks more damage than earlier variants healthcare systems will just have to deal with larger volume of patients countries will choose to strengthen their healthcare systems and tighten social distancing measures rather than lock down their economies a policy that has proven disastrous for the livelihoods of many citizens on top of this existing vaccines must be proven to be effective against omicron in terms of reducing severe disease and death if not the whole world will need a new kind of vaccine and the process of getting jabbed will all have to start over again what will happen during the re vaccination period lockdowns probably because older vaccines would no longer provide protection against this new variant however certain industries could still be severely affected especially international travel as fewer people would risk getting sick in foreign lands many manufacturers have already sent out reassurances that their vaccines could still be effective against omicron some are working on newer generations of their vaccines that are specially formulated to fight omicron and these could come out as soon as early next year i give full benefit of the doubt to the claim that such new and effective vaccines can be formulated but i m deeply concerned about how long it will take to get people revaccinated the united states took about six months to vaccinate half of its population with just one dose while the united kingdom was able to cover 70 of its people in the same period if there is a need for revaccination major economies will require three to six months to get the job done it will take longer if two jabs are required during this period countries would have no choice but to close their borders and lock down their economies if not omicron infections would spread faster than a wildfire on a windy day quickly overwhelming their healthcare systems those haunting images of people waiting to die in hospital corridors would come flooding back developing countries would not only have to revaccinate but would also have to wait in line to be supplied with the new omicron vaccines as before no doubt developing countries that own the vaccine technology would hoard their vaccines until their collective population of 1 billion is adequately protected this could make for protracted lockdowns in developing countries what would happen to the global and national economies while everyone is waiting to get their omicron jabs in all likelihood it would not just be a recession but a global depression the world economy has been severely battered by previous rounds of the pandemic and could hardly bear another massive outbreak here are two specific reasons why first governments around the world would run out of money to support economies while they were waiting for their revaccination drives to wrap up previous covid 19 outbreaks caused the world economy to shrink 3 1 in 2020 it has now been projected that the global growth rate will rebound to 5 9 in 2021 according to the international monetary fund imf the reason for this sharp rebound is not due to strong economic fundamentals but because governments around the world have spent an average of 16 of their gdp to stimulate their respective economies they forked out this much just to get 5 9 gdp growth back in return this indicates just how fragile the state of the world economy is right now if omicron were to cause more lockdowns most governments would have to allow their economies to slip into negative growth again take the case of thailand as an example the government borrowed 1 trillion baht in fiscal 2020 and 1 475 trillion baht in fiscal 2021 to shore up the economy that puts its total borrowing at about 16 of gdp which is the world average in terms of recent stimulus spending but how much more would the government be able to borrow to alleviate the economic impact of potential omicron lockdowns before it ended up bankrupting the entire economy second most consumers would run out of money to support domestic consumption the 16 of gdp stimulus spending by governments would not be enough to sustain the situation consumers around the world have already withdrawn the equivalent of 4 of gdp on average according to world bank data from their savings to support themselves since the pandemic first broke out the situation is even more grim in thailand while consumers elsewhere used up 4 of gdp in terms of their spent savings thais withdrew the equivalent of 6 5 as this data needs to be updated things could be even worse than they look in summary most governments are already broke and the same can be said for joe average another lockdown could be a death sentence for many businesses and households if an omicron outbreak were to trigger this negative economic growth may only be the tip of the iceberg it could also affect the relocation of global investment capital arising from supply chain disruptions a key factor behind today s rapidly rising inflation another round would be very hard to swallow at the onset of pandemic kristalina georgieva the imf s managing director said this is a crisis like no other this sentence may get resurrected if we see a new round of lockdowns

senior loans risk the london interbank offered rate libor is the average offered rate for various maturities of short term loans between major international banks who are members of the british bankers association libor is the most common benchmark interest rate index used to make adjustments to variable rate loans it is used throughout global banking and financial industries to determine interest rates for a variety of financial instruments such as debt instruments and derivatives and borrowing arrangements due to manipulation allegations in 2012 and reduced activity in the financial markets that it measures in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the fca the united kingdom financial regulatory body announced a desire to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 although the period from the fca announcement until the end of 2021 is generally expected to be enough time for market participants to transition to the use of a different benchmark for new securities and transactions there remains uncertainty regarding the future utilization of libor and the specific replacement rate or rates as such the potential effect of a transition away from libor on the trust or the financial instruments utilized by the trust cannot yet be determined the transition process may involve among other things increased volatility or illiquidity in markets for instruments that currently rely on libor the transition may also result in a change in i the value of certain instruments held by the trust ii the cost of temporary borrowing for the trust or iii the effectiveness of related trust transactions such as hedges as applicable when libor is discontinued the libor replacement rate may be lower than market expectations which could have an adverse impact on the value of preferred and debt securities with floating or fixed to floating rate coupons any such effects of the transition away from libor as well as other unforeseen effects could result in losses to the trust since the usefulness of libor as a benchmark could deteriorate during the transition period these effects could occur prior to the end of 2021 real estate industry risk issuers principally engaged in real estate industry including real estate investment trusts may be subject to risks similar to the risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate including i changes in general economic and market conditions ii changes in the value of real estate properties iii risks related to local economic conditions overbuilding and increased competition iv increases in property taxes and

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or gaap in addition to its gaap measures ncino uses these non gaap financial measures internally for budgeting and resource allocation purposes and in analyzing our financial results for the reasons set forth below ncino believes that excluding the following items provides information that is helpful in understanding our operating results evaluating our future prospects comparing our financial results across accounting periods and comparing our financial results to our peers many of which provide similar non gaap financial measures stock based compensation expenses ncino excludes stock based compensation expenses primarily because they are non cash expenses that ncino excludes from our internal management reporting processes ncinoâ s management also finds it useful to exclude these expenses when they assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting planning and forecasting future periods moreover because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use ncino believes excluding stock based compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies amortization of purchased intangibles ncino incurs amortization expense for purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies because these costs have already been incurred cannot be recovered are non cash and are affected by the inherent subjective nature of purchase price allocations ncino excludes these expenses for our internal management reporting processes ncinoâ s management also finds it useful to exclude these charges when assessing the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting planning and forecasting future periods although ncino excludes amortization expense for purchased intangibles from these non gaap measures management believes it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation acquisition related expenses ncino excludes expenses related to acquisitions as they limit comparability of operating results with prior periods we believe these costs are non recurring in nature and outside the ordinary course of business â â fees and expenses related to the antitrust matters ncino excludes fees and expenses related to the government antitrust investigation and related civil action disclosed in our sec filings as we do not believe these matters relate to the operating business and their exclusion from non gaap operating expenses will facilitate a more meaningful explanation of operating results and comparisons with prior period results there are limitations to using non gaap financial measures because non gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from non gaap financial measures provided by other companies the non gaap financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results in addition they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by ncinoâ s management about which items are adjusted to calculate its non gaap financial measures ncino compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a gaap basis as well as a non gaap basis and also by providing gaap measures in its public disclosures non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap ncino encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business and to view our non gaap financial measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable gaap financial measures a reconciliation of gaap to the non gaap financial measures has been provided in the tables below ncino inc reconciliation of gaap to non gaap measures in thousands except share and per share data unaudited â three months ended october 31 â nine

according to the review lamivudine in combination with a boosted protease inhibitor also showed efficacy in treatment naïve patients photo msf stefan heunis spotlight one of the biggest breakthroughs in hiv treatment in the 1990s came when three different antiretrovirals arvs were used together suppressing viral replication in multiple ways and preventing the development of drug resistance now trials are showing that certain combinations of just two antiretrovirals might be as good as three potentially bringing an end to a quarter of a century of triple therapy dominance the medicines available for the treatment of hiv infection in the public sector in south africa have changed significantly over the years but one thing that hasn t changed is that the standard treatment is made up of three different arvs even if they come co formulated in one pill the discovery of triple therapy for the treatment of hiv back in the 1990s turned hiv from a death sentence into a manageable disease the triple was critical since people who only took one or two arvs soon developed drug resistance and fell sick again the idea that you need three arvs accordingly became one of the cornerstones of hiv treatment for the quarter century since but as discussed at the recent 2021 southern african hiv clinicians society sahcs conference the era of exclusive triple therapy may be coming to an end as evidence mounts in support of the safety and efficacy of new dual therapy two drug regimens but why dual therapy if triple therapy is already so good speaking at the sahcs conference dr pedro cahn scientific director of the huesped foundation in argentina acknowledged that the current three drug regimens are very effective and said that the aim of introducing dual therapy is to make treatment more comfortable for people living with hiv a dual therapy regimen firstly reduces the drug burden from three to two which cahn said can improve patient adherence and quality of life he said this can help meet the needs of the ageing hiv population by reducing antiretroviral exposure making treatment safer without sacrificing virologic control as well as reducing drug drug interactions and costs dr michelle moorhouse senior global medical director at the pharmaceutical company viiv healthcare elaborated on the potential benefits of two drug regimens for example fewer ingredients mean a smaller pill size which means smaller and lighter packaging she said this can reduce transport and distribution costs and more stock can be stored in facilities fewer ingredients should also reduce long term exposure to additional antiretrovirals which may have long term toxicity and of course fewer ingredients should also directly reduce costs she said dual therapy could be particularly beneficial for older people living with hiv management of the older person living with hiv is complex as they often have multiple comorbidities and are at risk of polypharmacy two drug regimens offer exposure to fewer drugs reduced risk of unmanageable drug drug interactions said moorhouse evidence for dual therapy historically dual therapy has not been as effective as the current three drug regimens according to cahn but new drug combinations have shown promise in the last few years during his presentation cahn unpacked results from the landmark gemini 1 and gemini 2 studies these were two identical double blind randomised non inferiority phase three trials that compared a once daily two drug regimen of dolutegravir and lamivudine to a once daily three drug regimen of dolutegravir tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine the study enrolled patients who had not taken antiretroviral treatment before according to cahn dolutegravir lamivudine has demonstrated long term durability and efficiency in patients with high viral load and cd4 t cell count of 200 cell mm3 no treatment emergent resistance was observed among participants who met virologic withdrawal in the gemini 1 and gemini 2 studies at week 48 or week 96 according to cahn and the safety and biomarkers generally favoured dolutegravir lamivudine the studies also showed that there was a significantly lower risk of drug related adverse events with the two drug combination 20 compared to 27 for the three drug combination but a higher mean weight gain of 3 7kg was observed with dual therapy compared to 2 4kg with triple therapy while cahn said that optimal two drug regimens are potent convenient well tolerated and have a high barrier to resistance he also stressed that more research for these regimens needs to be done in pregnant women children and people with hiv and tb coinfection promising two drug regimens a systematic review published in 2020 in the infectious diseases and therapy journal looked at 33 studies conducted on dual therapy either as an initial treatment option or as a switch option the review concluded that lamivudine was the most commonly used nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor in two drug regimens that met non inferiority in both treatment naïve and treatment experienced populations for now it seems lamivudine is best paired with the integrase inhibitor dolutegravir as was done in the gemini studies according to the review dolutegravir lamivudine is the most promising nrti inclusive two drug regimen for patients initiating antiretroviral therapy so much so that recent guidelines updates for the european aids clinical society as well as the department of health and human services in the us recommend that the combination is considered as a treatment option in treatment naïve patients except for individuals with viral loads above 500 000 copies ml or active hepatitis b virus hbv coinfection according to the review lamivudine in combination with a boosted protease inhibitor also showed efficacy in treatment naïve patients for example the andes and gardel studies found that lamivudine darunavir ritonavir and lamivudine lopinavir ritonavir were non inferior to three drug regimens long acting injectable dual therapy while dolutegravir lamivudine is the front runner for dual therapy taken as a pill other combinations are leading the way when it comes to dual therapy taken as a long acting injection in her conference presentation moorhouse focused on the long acting injectable combination of cabotegravir and rilpivirine according to moorhouse the atlas and flare studies demonstrated that a monthly injection of this combination was non inferior to daily oral antiretroviral therapy preliminary data from the atlas 2m study went further to show non inferiority of two monthly compared to monthly dosing injectable dual therapy consisting of cabotegravir and rilpivirine was approved by the united states food and drug administration in january 2021 it is not listed as a registered product on the website of the south african health products regulatory authority challenges in south africa while developments in dual therapy are exciting there are also potential barriers to rolling out two drug regimens in south africa according to professor francois venter division head of ezintsha at the university of the witwatersrand one concern for venter is that women particularly pregnant women are underrepresented in a lot of studies on new hiv drugs including studies on two drug regimens he says more data for this population is required another barrier that can hinder the adoption of dual therapy particularly the dolutegravir lamivudine regimen is the high prevalence of hepatitis b in the country it s important to understand that in many ways hepatitis b is the biggest gatekeeper to two drug therapies at the moment including dolutegravir lamivudine venter said as moorhouse points out dolutegravir lamivudine may treat hiv but is insufficient to treat hepatitis b it thus follows that people should be screened for hepatitis b before being started on dual therapy in the absence of such screening triple therapy would be a safer option according to the 2019 national guidelines for the management of viral hepatitis hepatitis b is endemic in south africa resulting in a significant burden of clinical disease as a result of the progression to cirrhosis and the development of the complications of liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma hepatitis b prevalence estimates for south africa vary widely with the best evidence suggesting that it is around 6 7 overall with higher rates in people living with hiv tenofovir which forms part of standard triple therapy hiv treatment in south africa is also used to treat hepatitis b if we can t screen for hepatitis b we can t use it i don t think hiv programmes should be held hostage for the rest of time to the hepatitis b programme venter said we do acknowledge that s important but it s not important enough to inform first line therapies to the detriment of people having access to new and innovative therapies tb drug interactions another problem is that rifampicin a critically important medicine for the treatment of drug sensitive tb interacts with many of the drugs found in the current dual therapy hiv regimens tb is a constant problem and rifampicin is such a potent driver of drug interactions and it has drug interactions with almost every one of the dual therapy agents we re looking at at the moment other than lamivudine venter said yet venter explained that there are excellent first and second line treatment options for people living with hiv who also have a tb infection and those drugs can be used to treat those patients instead of dual therapy regimens we have potent drug programmes for these patients and it s not a deal breaker any more he said programmatic issues for venter the programmatic issues in south africa are the biggest headache he explained that while patients are closely monitored and there are follow ups during clinical trials patients in the real world setting in clinics are not followed up as closely this poses a big problem when rolling out dual therapies particularly long acting therapy if patients miss their appointments for long acting treatments this can be disastrous from a resistance perspective he said that healthcare workers and patients would need to undergo training for using dual therapy particularly the long acting injectables he added that the cost of dual therapies and potential logistical challenges like some long acting injectable dual therapies requiring cold chain storage would also need to be considered another factor that the government and donors will need to consider according to venter is whether dual therapy will be licensed and if generics will be produced as this will also affect cost we must not underestimate the programmatic issues venter said and we must start thinking hard now starting to put our heads together start thinking things out to everyone that needs them because if it does come we need to make sure that we re in a much stronger position to milk the benefits of this new exciting innovation as quickly as humanly possible in first and second line therapy as we go forward

expectations or any change in events conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based except as required by law reconciliation of non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues we prepare and release quarterly unaudited and annual audited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we also disclose and discuss certain non gaap financial information used to evaluate our performance in this and other earnings releases and investor conference calls as a complement to results provided in accordance with gaap we believe that current shareholders and potential investors in our company use non gaap financial measures such as adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues in making investment decisions about our company and measuring our operational results the term â œadjusted ebitdaâ refers to a financial measure that we define as earnings before certain charges that management considers to be non operating expenses and which consist of interest taxes depreciation amortization stock based compensation for which we include related fees and taxes and other charges for which we include restructuring charges and acquisition related expenses adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues divides adjusted ebitda for a period by the revenues for the corresponding period and expresses the quotient as a percentage management considers these non operating expenses to be outside the scope of descartesâ ongoing operations and the related expenses are not used by management to measure operations accordingly these expenses are excluded from adjusted ebitda which we reference to both measure our operations and as a basis of comparison of our operations from period to period management believes that investors and financial analysts measure our business on the same basis and we are providing the adjusted ebitda financial metric to assist in this evaluation and to provide a higher level of transparency into how we measure our own business however adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues are non gaap financial measures and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues should not be construed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with gaap or other non gaap measures that may be used by other companies such as ebitda the use of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues does have limitations in particular we have completed ten acquisitions since the beginning of fiscal 2020 and may complete additional acquisitions in the future that will result in acquisition related expenses and restructuring charges as these acquisition related expenses and restructuring charges may continue as we pursue our consolidation strategy some investors may consider these charges and expenses as a recurring part of operations rather than expenses that are not part of operations the table below reconciles adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues to net income reported in our unaudited

in this month s privacy cybersecurity update we examine the fbi s warning to companies regarding cyberattacks targeting confidential m a activity as well as the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency s directive ordering federal agencies to remediate cybersecurity vulnerabilities we also take a look at a report by the national association of insurance commissioners showing a steep rise in cyber insurance premiums new york state s new anti robocall laws newly approved european guidelines for international data transfers and the u k supreme court s decision involving a data protection suit fbi warns companies of ransomware attacks targeting confidential m a activity the fbi provided guidance to companies regarding the increasing incidence of ransomware attacks directed to accessing material nonpublic information regarding mergers and acquisitions the cyber division of the fbi issued a private industry notification on november 1 2021 to address ransomware attacks against both public and private companies 1 specifically the fbi warned of ransomware actors leveraging illicitly obtained material nonpublic information regarding major financial events particularly regarding upcoming mergers and acquisitions to extract substantial payments from victims according to the private industry notification companies that do not implement adequate cybersecurity protocols run an elevated risk of extortion during particularly significant and sensitive periods of corporate decision making bad actors utilizing dual stage cyberattacks the private industry notification notes that as ransomware actors become more sophisticated in their tactics they are increasingly utilizing a dual stage approach blanket reconnaissance followed by targeted strikes in the notification the fbi explains that bad actors typically begin with mass distributed trojan malware against employees at a wide range of companies during this initial stage the bad actors use varied techniques such as phishing attacks to gain access to companies private networks and then gather information about corporate and financial activity for example the fbi noted a november 2020 technical analysis of a remote access trojan called pyxie rat that attackers used to run keyword searches for information that would indicate imminent and near future stock share price changes keywords frequently searched include 10 q 10 sb n csr nasdaq marketwired and newswire during the second stage bad actors sift through data obtained during the information gathering stage to identify prime targets for ransomware attacks specifically cyber attackers select companies for which they have discovered material nonpublic information such as planned announcements of major corporate decisions or m a activity targeted companies are then subjected to blackmail a threat to publicly disclose that information unless a payment is made ransomware malware that locks up or encrypts the company s data or systems unless a payment is made or both such second stage attacks have become so common that a market for ransomware as a service has developed as recently as april 2021 the transnational organized crime group darkside2 advertised its ransomware services specifically for commercial extortion through threats against publicly traded companies the fbi indicated that between march and july of 2020 alone at least three publicly traded u s companies actively involved in m a activity two of which were still in the confidential negotiation period reported ransomware attacks to the fbi in which such m a activity was expressly leveraged against them by the attackers according to the private industry notification it is likely that the frequency of such attacks is even higher as companies may choose not to report an incident where a ransom was actually paid indeed the fbi estimates that at least 70 75 of ransomware attacks go unreported the fbi strongly recommends against paying a ransom to avoid incentivizing or funding further ransomware attacks or illegal activities but acknowledges in the private industry notification that companies under attack will evaluate all options to protect the company its shareholders and its customers even if a ransom is paid the fbi urges companies to report the incident so that the agency can take steps to prevent future attacks and hold the attackers accountable combating ransomware related to m a requires proactive cybersecurity initiatives to minimize the chances of a ransomware attack companies should take steps to address each of the two stages described above the fbi recommended that to reduce the likelihood of an initial intrusion companies should implement policies systems and training that guard against exploitation of technical or human vulnerabilities furthermore even if there is a successful intrusion by a bad actor it is less likely that bad actor will discover compromising corporate information if the company has in place strict internal information access and control systems companies also should ensure that their cybersecurity mechanisms appropriately address vulnerabilities from remote and hybrid work as a result of the covid 19 pandemic if applicable at the least the fbi recommends that companies implement the following high level security precautions back up critical data offline ensure copies of critical data are in the cloud or on an external hard drive or storage device secure backups and ensure data is not accessible for modification or deletion from the system where the original data resides install and regularly update antivirus or anti malware software on all hosts only use secure networks and avoid using public wi fi networks use two factor authentication for user login credentials and use authenticator apps rather than email as bad actors may gain control of victim email accounts and implement least privilege for file directory and network share permissions the fbi further recommended that companies engaged in frequent or near term m a activity should consider additional specialized precautions against ransomware attacks such precautions may include a detailed incident response plan to utilize if an attack occurs as well as cyber insurance policies covering these types of attacks companies also were directed to review the ransomware guide3 issued by the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency cisa a branch of the department of homeland security key takeaways bad actors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods to extort companies for financial gain through both advances in malware technology and careful selection of commercially vulnerable targets companies should ensure that their cybersecurity protections keep pace and take extra precautions in connection with sensitive m a activity cisa orders federal agencies to remediate cybersecurity vulnerabilities on november 3 2021 cisa issued binding operational directive 22 01 reducing the significant risk of known exploited vulnerabilities directive 4 which requires federal agencies to remediate certain known vulnerabilities the directive forms part of the biden administration s larger campaign to protect federal information systems and technology assets against malicious cyberattacks such as the attack on solarwinds corp that resulted in the breach of several federal agency networks and the ransomware attack on colonial pipeline co that caused a temporary gas supply shutdown for nearly half of the east coast of the united states the directive applies to all software and hardware found on federal information systems including systems managed on agency premises or hosted by third parties on an agency s behalf under the directive cisa must establish maintain and publish a catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities carrying significant risk to federal agencies 5 which then must remediate any high risk security flaws included in the catalog currently counted at approximately 290 vulnerabilities of these vulnerabilities 90 must have been addressed by november 17 2021 while the remaining 200 must be resolved within six months or by may 2022 additionally federal agencies must ensure that their internal vulnerability management procedures align with the following minimum requirements set forth in the directive establish a process for ongoing remediation of vulnerabilities that cisa identifies through inclusion in the cisa managed catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities as carrying significant risk to the federal enterprise within a timeframe set by cisa pursuant to the directive assign roles and responsibilities for executing agency actions required by the directive define necessary activities required to enable prompt response to actions required by the directive establish internal validation and enforcement procedures to ensure adherence with the directive and set internal tracking and reporting requirements to evaluate adherence with the directive and provide reporting to cisa as needed in particular the directive and the catalog are focused on vulnerabilities that are known to be exploited by bad actors the directive notes that bad actors do not exclusively rely only on critical vulnerabilities as defined by the common vulnerabilities and exposures system to achieve their goals and that some of the most widespread attacks have included multiple vulnerabilities rated high medium or even low this methodology uses lower score vulnerabilities to gain entry to a system and then exploits additional vulnerabilities to escalate privilege on an incremental basis key takeaways although the directive applies only to federal agencies private sector organizations especially those that work or may work with the government should consider incorporating the directive s mandates into their own internal practices while looking to cisa s catalog as a guide for ongoing cybersecurity risk management national association of insurance commissioners report shows cyber insurance premiums grew by nearly a third in 2020 according to a cyber insurance report recently released by the national association of insurance commissioners naic 2020 cyber insurance premiums grew 29 1 from the prior year as cyber threats continued to increase in frequency and severity 6 on october 20 2021 the naic property and casualty insurance committee released its report on the cybersecurity insurance market the purpose of which is to provide an understanding of the u s cyber insurance market the report is based on data collected from a total of 141 insurers both u s domiciled and alien surplus lines insurers that wrote cyber insurance business in the u s according to the report that data shows a cyber insurance market of roughly 4 1 billion in direct written premiums reflecting a 29 1 increase from 2019 stand alone versus package policies according to the report u s domiciled insurers writing stand alone cyber insurance reported 1 62 billion in direct written premiums for 2020 a 29 1 increase from 2019 direct written premiums for package policies also increased in 2020 to 1 14 billion a 13 6 increase from 2019 identity theft coverage the naic reported that identity theft coverage continues to be the most common cyber product offered by u s insurers with u s insurers writing approximately 20 3 million policies both standalone and package policies up roughly 4 from the prior year this increase aligns with an increase in identity theft reports in 2020 the federal trade commission reported that it received nearly 1 4 million reports of identity theft in 2020 twice as many as it received in 2019 7 while stand alone policies for identity theft actually decreased from the prior year by roughly 3 package policies increased by nearly 4 in 2020 ransomware coverage the report emphasizes the serious threat posed by ransomware attacks noting that cybercriminals now often employ extortion by threatening to release or sell sensitive data the naic posits that ansomware is likely one of the biggest reasons cyber insurance costs are on the rise noting that in 2020 there was a 400 increase in ransomware incidents premium trends the naic also reported that cyber insurance premiums are on the rise citing a recent survey of brokers that showed a 10 30 increase in cyber insurance prices during the last quarter of 2020 according to the report the survey was reflected in the increased pricing trend continuing in the first quarter of 2021 as renewal pricing on cyber insurance rose by an average of 18 the naic also noted that premiums are expected to increase by 15 50 overall in 2021 the report also stated that excess markets are charging almost as much for their policies as primary insurers are charging cyber insurance changes the report identifies several notable changes to the cyber insurance landscape including the following insurers are incorporating sublimits into their policies and adding exclusions to standard coverage lines to avoid duplication of cyber coverage according to the report these changes will likely improve underwriting performance underwriters are raising retention levels while limits are dropping across some sectors underwriters have begun to conduct more careful evaluations of potential insureds including using tools to evaluate prospective insureds computer networks to decide whether they will write the cyber business key takeaways as the report indicates companies are seeking out cyber insurance protection at a growing rate as one component of their risk management programs and insurers continue to make adjustments to coverage underwriting processes and pricing in response to market conditions in light of the ever growing frequency and severity of cyberattacks and related losses we expect the cyber insurance market to continue to grow and evolve in 2022 european data protection board adopts guidelines on international transfers of personal data on november 19 2021 the european data protection board edpb published its guidelines 05 2021 the guidelines outlining the interplay between the territorial scope of the eu general data protection regulation 2016 679 gdpr under article 3 and the provisions on transfers of personal data to third countries or international organizations under chapter v the guidelines will bring welcome clarification to companies regarding their data processing activities background in accordance with article 44 of the gdpr any transfer by a controller or processor of personal data which is undergoing processing or is intended for processing after transfer to a third country or to an international organization must comply with the provisions of chapter v of the gdpr regarding transfers the provisions of chapter v aim to ensure that personal data continues to be protected once it is made accessible to entities outside the european economic area eea for this reason the personal data being transferred must be protected by alternative means including though an adequacy decision issued by the european commission or by one of the appropriate safeguards listed in article 46 of the gdpr e g standard contractual clauses sccs the guidelines seek to assist controllers and processors operating in europe to determine whether a specific data processing activity constitutes an international transfer of personal data and accordingly whether they are required to comply with the provisions of chapter v 8 three cumulative criteria given that the gdpr does not specifically provide a legal definition of what constitutes a transfer of personal data to a third country or to an international organization the edpb determined that it was necessary to clarify the concept of a transfer the guidelines identify three cumulative criteria which when satisfied qualify a particular processing of personal data as a transfer a controller or a processor the data exporter is subject to the gdpr for the given processing of personal data this requires that the particular processing of personal data meets the requirements that are outlined in article 3 of the gdpr in particular that the data exporter is subject to gdpr for the specific processing of personal data this will be the case when the data exporter is established in the eea article 3 1 or when the data exporter offers goods or services to or monitors the behavior of data subjects in the eea article 3 2 the data exporter transmits or otherwise makes available the personal data to another controller joint controller or processor the data importer this requires a case by analysis of the particular processing of personal data and the roles of the actors involved the edpb emphasizes that transmission or the making available of personal data by the data exporter must be to a different controller joint controller or processor the second criterion is not satisfied if a controller in a third country collects data directly from an eea based data subject or when an eea based employee of the controller remotely accesses personal data in a third country the data importer is in a third country or is an international organization this requires that the data importer is based geographically in a third country i e a country outside of the eea is an international organization i e an organization that is governed by public international law or any other body which is established through an agreement between two or more countries if all three criteria are satisfied then it is determined that there has been a transfer to a third country or to an international organization as defined under article 44 of the gdpr it follows that the controller or processor for the particular processing will be required to comply with chapter v and specifically safeguard the transfer by using one of the means provided in the gdpr the edpb also made clear that it supports the european commission s proposals to introduce a set of streamlined sccs to cover data transfers to data importers who are subject to article 3 2 of the gdpr i e controllers or processors with no presence in europe that target european individuals through the offering of goods or services or that otherwise monitor european individuals behavior in europe the edpb notes that the new sccs which were published by the european commission on june 4 2021 do not fit a situation where the data importer is a controller or processor and at the same time also itself is subject to the gdpr this is because the new sccs partly duplicate gdpr rules which by virtue of article 3 2 already apply to the data importer in the third country in november 2021 at the iapp europe data protection congress 2021 european commission representatives announced that a streamlined set of sccs are scheduled for publication in 2022 we discussed the publication of the new sccs in our june 2021 privacy cybersecurity update available here key takeaways as summarized by edpb chair andrea jelinek guidelines provide a consistent interpretation of the concept of international transfers and clarify that when a data importer is subject to the gdpr the obligations under chapter v of the gdpr apply both to the transfer from the to the importer and to any further transfer that the importer undertakes the guidelines will assist organizations operating in the eea to determine which processing activities constitute international transfers and what safeguards must be put in place to ensure that personal data transferred to third countries is adequately protected while also determining more generally whether the organization complies with chapter v of the gdpr organizations should now be able to reassess their international data maps and through an application of the three cumulative criteria conclusively determine which processing activities are subject to chapter v of the gdpr and what data protection safeguards must be put in place new york passes pair of laws cracking down on illegal robocalls on november 8 2021 new york gov kathy hochul signed into law two bills that require telecommunications providers in the state to protect consumers by blocking unsolicited robocalls and validating incoming calls the laws which are effective immediately are a codification of rules previously released by the federal communications commission fcc the robocall laws one of the bills signed into law addresses call authentication by requiring companies that provide voice communications services to new york customers to block certain incoming calls such as those originating from a number that a subscriber has requested be blocked and those that originate from numbers that are not valid under the north american numbering plan 9 the law is meant to crack down on illegitimate spoofing calls in which callers attempt to mask their true identity the second law requires voice service providers to implement the secure telephone identity revisited and signature based handling of asserted information using tokens stir shaken protocol which is the fcc s standard for industrywide call authentication over the next 12 months 10 voice service providers may instead implement an alternative technology that verifies and authenticates caller identification provided that such technology is comparable or superior to the stir shaken protocol the framework uses cryptography that allows telephone service providers to validate that a call is being made from the number shown and makes tracing the source of illegal calls easier as each call has a digital certificate assigned to it the law also provides for enhanced state enforcement by granting the public service commission the authority to oversee compliance with the protocols including levying civil penalties for offenses and the power to request that companies provide documentation relevant to a suspected violation companies that knowingly or negligently violate the law face fines of up to 100 000 per offense for each day the call authentication framework is not implemented key takeaways the new laws reflect new york lawmakers stronger approach against predatory robocalls by attempting to block such calls and taking enforcement action against bad actors in the event such calls get through the laws also provide more tools for telecommunications companies to prevent and or trace unwanted calls companies that provide voice communications services in new york should be aware that such laws are in effect and ensure compliance by implementing the relevant authentication protocols uk supreme court constrains data protection based representative actions on november 10 2021 the u k supreme court uksc handed down its long awaited judgement in lloyd v google llc uksc 50 unanimously allowing google s appeal and reversing the court of appeal s decision the uksc ruled that a data subject will not have a right to compensation following breach of the data protection act 1998 dpa 1998 the predecessor of the current dpa 2018 by a data controller unless material damage can be proved and that damages for loss of control of personal data are not available for breaches of the dpa 1998 the uksc ruled that even if loss of control damages had been available the claim could not be brought as a representative class action the decision seemingly restricts the scope for bringing representative actions arising out of breaches of data protection laws while expressly confined to claims brought under the dpa 1998 this case highlights the difficulty in satisfying the requirement that each claimant have the same interest in the claim the decision therefore sharply limits the possibility of data protection based class actions which is viewed as a positive outcome for data controllers background plaintiff richard lloyd brought a claim against google in the english courts via the representative action procedure under rule 19 6 of the civil procedure rules cpr he brought this claim on behalf of himself and 4 million data subjects alleging that google had unlawfully processed browser data from his and the data subjects iphone devices for a purpose not known or disclosed to users and without their consent referred to as the safari workaround this workaround allegedly allowed google to circumvent browser privacy settings and track cookies for the purposes of targeting advertising thereby monetizing users data for the representative class action to proceed under cpr 19 6 mr lloyd was required to demonstrate that the class of 4 million data subjects shared the same interest in the representative claim he argued that each data subject had his or her data protection rights breached in the same way by google on the basis of there being a loss of control over his and the data subjects personal data mr lloyd also argued that it was not necessary to prove individual damage for each data subject affected if each user could be said to have suffered the lowest common denominator of damage and sought a uniform amount of approximately 750 in compensatory damages for each data subject for a total of 3 billion google was successful in the first instance but the decision was overturned in the court of appeal on appeal by google to the uksc two core issues were considered loss of control damages could damages be recovered under dpa 1998 for loss of control of personal data alone if the underlying breach of dpa 1998 did not result in material damage such as mental distress or financial loss could damages be recovered under dpa 1998 for loss of control of personal data alone if the underlying breach of dpa 1998 did not result in material damage such as mental distress or financial loss same interest did mr lloyd and the 4 million data subjects share the same interest in the representative action as required under cpr 19 6 decision the uksc allowed the appeal and addressed the two core issues11 as follows damages for loss of control of personal data the uksc disagreed with mr lloyd s claim that damages could be awarded for a mere loss of control of personal data under dpa 1998 applying a textual analysis to dpa 1998 the uksc concluded that the act did not allow for compensation for breach without proof of actionable damage as the damage had to be material for example in the event of mental distress or financial loss caused by the breach the uksc stated that cannot reasonably be interpreted as giving an individual a right to compensation without proof of material damage or distress whenever a data controller commits a non trivial breach of any requirement of mr lloyd could not prove that he and the representative class of 4 million data subjects had suffered more than trivially additionally mr lloyd s attempt to draw parallels with the tort of misuse of private information where damages are available for loss of control over private information was rejected as was any suggestion that compensation for loss of control over personal data was required by eu law the uksc disagreed with mr lloyd s claim that damages could be awarded for a mere loss of control of personal data under dpa 1998 applying a textual analysis to dpa 1998 the uksc concluded that the act did not allow for compensation for breach without proof of actionable damage as the damage had to be material for example in the event of mental distress or financial loss caused by the breach the uksc stated that cannot reasonably be interpreted as giving an individual a right to compensation without proof of material damage or distress whenever a data controller commits a non trivial breach of any requirement of mr lloyd could not prove that he and the representative class of 4 million data subjects had suffered more than trivially additionally mr lloyd s attempt to draw parallels with the tort of misuse of private information where damages are available for loss of control over private information was rejected as was any suggestion that compensation for loss of control over personal data was required by eu law same interest the uksc found that a claim for compensatory damages cannot be brought as a representative action unless the damages claimed can be calculated on a uniform basis for each data subject any individualized assessment was inconsistent with the same interest requirement in this instance it could not be argued that mr lloyd and the 4 million data subjects suffered uniform damage as the impact of the safari workaround inevitably varied on a case by case basis across the representative class any attempt to rely on the lowest common denominator of damage suffered by the class would mean that the damage suffered would fall below the de minimis threshold for compensation the uksc did however acknowledge that a bifurcated claim would have been open to mr lloyd under which a representative action could be brought for a declaration of breach after which injured parties could rely on that declaration for individual determination of compensation key takeaways the judgement is a welcome development to data controllers as the dismissal of google s appeal would have almost certainly resulted in a significant increase in representative class action claims arising out of breaches of data protection laws questions are likely to be raised by other stakeholders including claimant law firms and litigation funders as to whether english law provides sufficient protection to large volumes of individuals who suffer nominal damage at the hands of organizations for serious breaches of data protection laws if representative actions are not permitted indeed the uksc expressly acknowledged the concern that it was specifically law firms and litigation funders who stood to benefit from any expansion in the scope for data protection based representative actions as the landscape stands it will now likely take legislative action to permit the types of large scale opt out representative class actions that are commonplace in the united states regarding data breaches arising in circumstances similar to those in the lloyd v google

study to leverage deep learning enabled analysis of the aggregation of real world multimodal data to validate predictive signatures associated with response to immunotherapy and prognosis of patients with stage iv non small cell lung cancer large scale multicentric real world study aims to enroll 4 000 patients from approximately 30 sites across north america europe and latin america boston and lausanne switzerland dec 1 2021 prnewswire sophia genetics sa nasdaq soph the creator of a global data pooling and knowledge sharing platform that advances data driven medicine announced today the launch of their deep lung iv clinical study nct04994795 the study leverages deep learning enabled analysis of the aggregation of multimodal clinical biological genomic and radiomics data to identify and validate predictive signatures associated with response to immunotherapy and prognosis of patients with metastatic non small cell lung cancer nsclc over the last decade immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment landscape for patients diagnosed with stage iv nsclc and has become the standard of care in the frontline setting for patients without oncogene activating mutations despite the clinical promise of immunotherapy significant challenges remain as the majority of nsclc patients fail to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors today pd l1 is the only standard predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy however it remains a very suboptimal biomarker with several well characterized issues limiting its clinical utility thus an urgent need exists to discover new predictive biomarkers of response to immunotherapy sophia genetics deep lung iv clinical study aims to predict immunotherapy treatment response at first evaluation at the individual patient level using data across multiple modalities including genomics radiomics clinical and biological data the study also aims to validate an algorithm that will allow the prediction of outcomes at the individual patient such as progression free survival pfs and overall survival os this predictive model will help identify patients that are likely to benefit from immunotherapy versus those that are not as well as stratify patients according to risk helping clinicians make more informed therapeutic decisions for their patients and supporting biopharma to ensure the right patients are selected for clinical trials we are very excited about the opportunity to validate multimodal predictive models through such an innovative large scale multicentric real world clinical study we aim to generate entirely novel actionable insights to improve clinical outcomes for patients with stage iv nsclc treated with immunotherapy and develop next generation patient stratification strategies to support the selection of the right patients for clinical trials said dr philippe menu chief medical officer at sophia genetics the analytical power of the multimodal sophia genetics platform applied

than any previous variant if you re worried about the new omicron covid 19 variant you re far from alone the world health organization is warning that omicron is spreading like no other strain has before according to npr omicron has been found in 77 countries less than a month after it was officially reported the who added the reality is that omicron is probably in most countries even if it hasn t been detected yet the variant s unusually high number of mutations on its protein spike quickly prompted fears that it would be more transmissible than any other variant and that it could potentially elude vaccine protections while early data from south africa shows that the variant has led to fewer hospitalizations experts still stress that the dynamic might not be the same for every country some of south africa s situation could have more to do with the very high proportion of citizens who ve been previously infected due to the particularly high transmission rate health officials are bracing for a wave of new patients just the same 9 35 a m evictions rise months after the federal moratorium ends housing advocates say evictions are increasing around the country several months after a federal moratorium was allowed to end according to the associated press there s been a rise in evictions but it still is below pre pandemic levels in most states and cities thanks to an infusion of federal rental assistance and other pandemic related money like child tax credit payments however part of the eviction increase is due to courts catching up on the backlog of eviction cases advocates say the surge shows the limits of federal emergency rental assistance in places where distribution remains slow and tenant protections are weak rising housing prices in many markets also are playing a role data collected by the eviction lab at princeton university show that evictions have been rising in most of the 31 cities and six states where it collects data since the federal moratorium ended in august tuesday december 14 9 47 a m california brings back indoor mask mandate california is bringing back a statewide indoor mask mandate that ll last about one month starting

york according to the associated press 9 26 a m pfizer s data shows that its covid 19 pill is effective against severe illness pfizer recently released additional data about its covid 19 pill that shows it may effectively prevent hospitalizations and death when taken by people with mild to moderate illness within the first few crucial days of symptoms dubbed paxlovid the medicine is taken twice a day for five days and combined with a second medicine called ritonavir a generic antiviral as reported by npr the results from their study include more than 2 200 people at high risk for developing serious illness it found that the drug reduced their risk of hospitalization or death by 89 compared with a placebo when taken within three days of first symptoms of illness according to pfizer s study when patients took the medication within five days of showing symptoms the drug reduced the risk of hospitalization and death by 88 9 15 a m new data suggests vaccines not as effective at stopping omicron infection but stops limits severe disease an analysis of data from south africa shows the omicron variant appears to cause less severe disease than previous coronavirus mutations but the pfizer vaccine seems to offer less defense against infection despite this the vaccine still offers good protection against hospitalization according to the associated press these findings have not been peer reviewed but they line up with other early data about omicron some experts cautioned it s too soon to draw conclusions about outcomes from omicron the analysis is from insurer discovery health and the south african medical research council monday december 13 10 48 a m south african researchers find that omicron may be more mild than delta health experts still don t know if the omicron variant is causing milder covid 19 but more indicators might be emerging from south africa as reported by the associated press doctors say there are patients they are seeing now that aren t as ill as those infected with the delta variant recent data shows far fewer hospitalizations and deaths compared to previous waves however it s only been two weeks since omicron first was reported in the country and scientists caution that it ll take many more weeks to know whether early observations hold up while delta is still the dominant strain worldwide omicron is popping up in dozens of countries and has become dominant in south africa 10 12 a m new poll shows americans are increasingly concerned about omicron but aren t keeping up with safety measures as the omicron variant sparks

young as age 16 as reported by the associated press but it s not yet clear if younger teens will need a booster and the centers for disease control and prevention must recommend that 16 and 17 year olds get the booster before they can actually get the shots the u s and many other nations already urge adults to get a booster to pump up their immunity months after initial vaccinations currently the pfizer vaccine is the only option approved for children and teenagers in the country 9 40 a m here s how we ll know when the pandemic is over there s no clear cut definition for when a pandemic starts and ends or how much of a threat the global outbreak poses for each country according to the associated press back in january 2020 the world health organization designated the coronavirus

hospitalizations are still spiking even in highly immunized pockets of the country like new england according to the associated press the situation is not as dire as last year s post holiday surge before the public had any access to vaccines still experts say that the roughly 60 of the u s population that is vaccinated is not enough to prevent hotspots the colder weather thanksgiving and upcoming holidays mixed with pandemic fatigue are all playing a role in increased cases at the same time researchers are trying to figure out the remaining questions about omicron wednesday december 8 9 46 a m covid 19 drives up recall attempts in california and nationally it s not just gov gavin newsom voters across california and the country are targeting their city county and school board officials for recall geoff pallay with the election tracking website ballotpedia says 120 local officials in california have been the subject of a recall attempt this year that s nearly twice the annual average of 67 over the past decade pallay says covid 19 rules have played a major role in the uptick things like closing up schools or mask requirements or vaccine requirements covid related recalls have been a significant contributor to the overall rise in recalls nationwide pallay told california lawmakers at a hearing this week nationally 491 local recall attempts were filed in 2021 compared to an average of 324 per year in the decade prior pallay said school closures are at the center of a recall against three san francisco school board members set for february 2022 shasta

variant according to the associated press pfizer and its partner biontech tested how well vaccine produced antibodies could neutralize omicron in lab dishes and they found significant weakening after the standard two doses however a booster dose increased the antibody levels by 25 fold the companies said two doses still may protect against severe illness but they re working on developing an omicron specific vaccine in case it s needed together the companies announced the findings today in a press release the data is preliminary and hasn t undergone scientific review yet 8 49 a m federal judge blocks president biden s vaccine mandate a federal judge recently blocked president joe biden s administration from enforcing a covid 19 vaccine mandate for employees of federal contractors in a win for republican led states refusing to accommodate pandemic policies according to the associated press the judge issued a stay to bar enforcement of the mandate nationwide the order came in response to a lawsuit from several contractors and several states including alabama georgia idaho kansas south carolina utah and west virginia the stay applies across the country because one of those challenging the order is the trade group associated builders and contractors inc whose members do business nationwide separately biden has imposed vaccine requirements for the federal government and military employees the mandates are a key part of the administration s strategy to stop the spread of covid 19 which has killed more than 788 000 americans since last year tuesday december 7 4 30 p m no positive tests but omicron variant most likely present in sacramento county health officials say the new omicron variant of covid 19 is most likely present in sacramento health officials confirmed in a statement tuesday afternoon the announcement comes after stanford university researchers said they detected the variant in the region s wastewater as of tuesday no sacramento county resident has tested positive for the omicron variant during a weekly briefing last week county public health officer dr olivia kasirye said omicron would come to sacramento at some point because of how much travel happens during the holidays we just need to continue to be vigilant and do the things that we know will protect everyone like getting vaccinated getting tested and wearing masks she said the researchers from stanford university were conducting epidemiologic surveillance for covid 19 in several california counties and partnered with the sacramento regional sanitation district to test in sacramento the researchers gathered a sample of sacramento wastewater on nov 30 and found low concentrations of a mutation used as a marker for the omicron variant county officials said the county said it received the results of the study on friday and confirmed them on monday there is much we do not know at this time county spokeswoman janna haynes wrote in an email first it is unclear whether omicron is more transmissible than the delta variant second it is unknown whether omicron variant infection is associated with more severe disease the omicron variant first popped up in european and south african countries in november california health officials announced on dec 1 that one person in san francisco tested positive for the variant when they returned to the bay area from south africa cases have since popped up in at least 19 states according to the centers for disease control and prevention 10 21 a m university of the pacific sets up a nursing graduate program for non nursing backgrounds the university of the pacific has created an accelerated graduate program to help meet california and the country s critical nursing shortage while the pandemic has worsened the problem uop has started thinking about a program of this kind back in march 2020 nicoleta bugnariu the founding dean of uop s school of health sciences thinks the program could bring more people into the shrinking industry prior to the pandemic there was a shortage of nurses in california i don t pretend that we know at that point how long this pandemic will last and the impact but where we are now that shortage has increased bugnariu said according to uc san francisco california is experiencing a shortage of over 40 000 registered nurses while the situation has pre dated the pandemic things have only gotten worse bugnariu said that one of the primary goals is to help students deal with the stresses of the job through self assessment how do i address this what can i do for myself to bring myself to a healthier more grounded center if you want and then reach out to a network build that community so you don t do this alone she said these foundational skills need to be developed to help students stay in the nursing profession long term she said 10 13 a m a new type of covid 19 vaccine is almost finished with development there s another covid 19 vaccine ready to soon roll out to the world novavax and while it won t necessarily replace the current vaccinations we have it can make a huge impact on the course of the pandemic in lower resourced countries according to npr the inoculation will be what s called a protein subunit vaccine it works by injecting people with a tiny portion of the virus which in this case would be the spike protein critical for the virus to enter cells this could make a dent in the global unvaccinated population because protein subunit vaccines are often very stable and don t require freezers for storage since it ll just need a regular refrigerator it ll make disturbing the vaccines much easier 9 30 a m new covid 19 treatments show how pandemic has sped up drug and vaccine research two new drugs that treat patients with covid 19 are awaiting authorization from the food and drug administration merck makes one and the other is by pfizer while the merck drug has been in development for years pfizer s drug didn t even exist when the pandemic began the tale of two drugs could be an example of how the coronavirus pandemic has sped up the drug and vaccine development process however pfizer wasn t exactly starting from zero according to npr back in 2003 when the sars outbreak happened the company began searching for ways to combat that version of the coronavirus more about the development of coronavirus drugs here monday december 6 9 44 a m marin county parents knowingly sent child sick with covid 19 to in person school northern california parents knowingly sent their covid 19 positive child and a sibling to school last month

order 9 26 a m here s how you can protect yourself from the omicron variant to protect yourself against the omicron variant experts say to do what you would against any other variant getting vaccinated if you re not already getting a booster if you re eligible and stepping up other precautions you may have relaxed like mask wearing for all of the attention omicron is getting the overwhelming cause of infections in many places is still the delta variant according to the associated press as scientists work on learning more about omicron experts note the importance of layering protection that s especially true with holiday travel and gatherings around the corner a booster shot could be one of those protective layers 9 05 a m fauci says early reports from omicron are hopeful u s health officials say that while the omicron variant of the coronavirus is rapidly spreading in the country early indications suggest it may be less dangerous than delta the current scourge of hospitalization surges according to the associated press the country s chief medical adviser dr anthony fauci told cnn s state of the union that scientists need more information before drawing conclusions about omicron s severity but reports from south africa where it s becoming the dominant strain suggest hospitalization rates have not increased much omicron has been detected in about a third of u s states as of sunday fauci said the biden administration is considering lifting travel restrictions against noncitizens entering the u s from several african countries sunday december 5 12 10 p m convention business in downtown sacramento has been down but will likely increase in early 2022 as 2021 comes to a close at the end of this month many organizations are evaluating how the pandemic has affected their bottom lines despite a string of large scale events since june including friday s california international marathon in looking at how downtown may fare going into 2022 there s one significant wild card a possible lack of state office workers says mike testa president and ceo of visit sacramento there s a huge population of california state employees that were working in downtown every day and so many of them are working at home testa said if that continues there s great concern of the impact that will have on businesses because it s tens of thousands of people on a daily basis who just aren t in sacramento testa says compared with 2019 convention business is a bit down but several large events scheduled for early 2022 are signaling a likely increase in attendance friday december 3 11 48 a m omicron hasn t reached sacramento but it will county public officer says the omicron variant of covid 19 that s sweeping through several south african and european countries has made its way to california with cases popping up in san francisco and los angeles while sacramento has not seen any cases of the new variant county public health officer dr olivia kasirye says it s still a variant of concern she said that it s difficult to predict when the variant may spread to sacramento but with people traveling for the holidays it s only a matter of time we know it s going to happen at some point kasirye said so we just need to continue to be vigilant and do the things that we know will protect everyone like getting vaccinated getting tested and wearing masks as of now very little is known about omicron it s not clear how fast it spreads or how severe symptoms can be and of course that means we also need to look at for people that are vaccinated what is the level of protection kasirye said our hope is that our vaccines will hold up and the people that are vaccinated will continue to be protected kasirye said that it s difficult to predict when the variant may spread to sacramento but when it does she says her department will be able to detect it much sooner than they have in the past thanks to tools the county s lab just received in order to identify the variant you have to do the genome sequencing kasirye said so being able to do it in house increases our capacity to be able to continue the surveillance prior to getting access to the sequencing tools kasirye says the county was sending specimens to the state s lab which delayed identifying new cases of variants as of now she says delta is still the dominant variant in sacramento 9 27 a m california confirms second omicron case in los angeles california recently reported its second confirmed case of the omicron variant in los angeles county according to the associated press the county s public health department said a county resident is self isolating after apparently contracting the infection during a trip to south africa last month the u s recorded

was first identified a week ago in south africa and it s been spreading california isn t the only state with infections five other states including new york minnesota hawaii and colorado have all identified omicron variant cases experts have said that this shows how quickly mutations of the virus can circumnavigate the globe with speed and ease just one day after the first known u s case was found in california tests showed that the omicron variant had infected at least five people in new york city plus a man from minnesota who attended an anime convention in manhattan in late november officials reported another case in a colorado woman who had recently traveled to southern africa the variant was also confirmed in an unvaccinated hawaii resident with no recent travel history 9 23 a m unvaccinated nevada state workers will be charged an insurance premium nevada state workers enrolled in public employee healthcare plans will be charged up to 55 per month if they aren t fully vaccinated according to the associated press the nevada public employees benefits program board voted on thursday to impose a surcharge on unvaccinated workers to offset medical costs of those who

latest studies suggest previous covid 19 infection may not fend off omicron variant south african scientists are warning that the new omicron variant may be causing more reinfections among covid 19 survivors than earlier virus mutations according to the associated press a research group has been tracking reinfections in south africa and they spotted a jump with the arrival of omicron saying the timing suggests substantial evidence that the variant can overcome the immunity protection provided by a prior infection more than the extra contagious delta variant the findings are preliminary and were posted online thursday before scientific review the researchers didn t say what portion of the reinfections were confirmed as omicron cases or examine how much protection against the new variant vaccines offer thursday december 2 11 33 a m status of covid 19 vaccine mandate is still up in the air the biden administration s covid 19 vaccine mandate in the u s is on hold because of legal challenges but employers can still require the shots according to the associated press the regulation says businesses with 100 or more employees need to require covid 19 vaccinations or have workers tested weekly for the virus it was set to take effect jan 4 2022 but has faced legal challenges from businesses republicans and others a federal appeals court put the rule on hold then all legal challenges were consolidated in another appeals court which is taking written arguments from parties that want to join the case 11 26 a m omicron and delta variants could spell the return of more restrictive safety measures governments worldwide are weighing new measures for those who may be tired of restrictions and vaccine mandates as the delta variant pushes up cases in europe and other parts of the world according to the associated press different countries have been turning to varying measures to get their populations vaccinated and healthy for example residents over 60 who refuse to get vaccinated will be hit with monthly fines of 100 euros 113 a month in greece potential carriers of omicron in israel could be tracked by the nation s domestic security agency in south africa restrictions include curfews and bans on alcohol sales however in the u s there is essentially no political willpower from either major party to enact any lockdowns or contact tracing even enforcing simple measures like mask wearing has become a political flashpoint governments are facing a thorny calculus made more difficult by the prospect of backlash increased social divisions and the fear of being voted out of office 10 47 a m while we re looking at omicron we can t forget the delta variant experts stress while all eyes are on the new and little understood omicron variant the delta form of the coronavirus isn t finished wreaking havoc in the u s sending record numbers of patients to the hospital in some states especially in the midwest and new england according to the associated press the u s recorded its first known omicron infection on wednesday in a fully vaccinated person who had returned to california from south africa where the variant was identified just over a week ago for now the extra contagious delta variant accounts for practically all cases in the u s and continues to inflict misery at a time when many hospitals are struggling with shortages of nurses and a backlog of patients the fear now is that the latest variant will foist more patients and perhaps sicker ones into more hospital beds wednesday december 1 11 43 a m first omicron variant case in nation detected in san francisco the first case of the covid 19 omicron variant in the u s was found in san francisco late last month according to state and local health officials dr anthony fauci said the person was a traveler who returned from south africa on nov 22 and tested positive on nov 29 the person was vaccinated but had not received a booster shot according to the associated press the news comes as scientists continue to study the risks posed by the new strain of the virus the biden administration moved late last month to restrict travel from southern africa despite the netherlands being the first country to identify an infection where the variant originated is still unclear but clusters of cases have also been identified in about two dozen other nations 11 42 a m mysteries of the omicron variant could take weeks to untangle scientists say it could be weeks before they better understand how dangerous the omicron variant is according to the associated press it s still unknown whether the newest coronavirus variant of concern spreads faster than delta or makes people sicker according to the associated press it also isn t clear how much protection is offered either by our vaccines or a person s immunity after recovering from another covid 19 variant there are lots of guesses but little hard evidence as scientists race to find answers amid scrutiny from an anxious public in the meantime scientists urge people to get vaccinated and take other public health measures such as masking indoors 11 35 a m supply chain woes hit toy giving charities during the

inflation may not be transitory and consideration it may have to speed up the taper wall street had fallen heavily again but in the first hour the index was only down slightly then suddenly it was down 73 points at midday just in time for the gdp release australia s september quarter economic contraction of 1 9 was not nearly as bad as the 2 5 economists had forecast given nsw and victorian lockdowns in the period consumer spending did not suffer as much as assumed annual growth is running at 3 9 0 2 below the rate of 2019 suffice to say the index wound back over 50 points it was an interesting response given sentiment could realistically gone either way good news can often be good but a lesser hit to gdp than feared may also put the rba back on the tapering path it was on before the lockdowns interrupted which given wall street s reaction to tapering could have been seen as bad but of course it s all back up in the air again with omicron even if jay powell seems unperturbed and with wall street down again last night and our futures down 79 this morning so it s all academic the other interesting element in yesterday s market was it took a 0 6 gain for materials a 0 2 gain for healthcare and for banks to stay flat to close the index at only 20 points when every other sector took a hit and the hardest hit were defensives the banks closed flat despite a 4 basis point rebound in the ten year yield despite the possibility of more lockdowns consumer staples was the worst performer on 1 9 with no one off driver woolworths wow copped 2 4 utilities fell 1 4 property 1 1 industrials 1 0 and telcos 0 8 this is the opposite of how wall street has been responding to omicron looking at individual stock movers on the day there was no clear pattern rather quite the mixed bag on both sides gud holdings gud topped the losers in falling 7 6 but that s likely a response to an announced acquisition south32 s32 topped the winners with 4 0 on bounces in metal prices one reason cited for the asx200 s rally to the close yesterday was futures on the us indices were pointing up suggesting a solid wall street session it did start that way but then it s here indeed the dow was up 500 points early in the session and the s p500 was outperforming both the dow and nasdaq but then the market began to roll over at the s p s morning peak it had recovered 50 of the net fall that began last friday that technical level is often seen as resistance that was one reason another was jay powell wrapping up his second day of testimony to congress without any walk back or further clarification of his bombshell declarations the day before which implied inflation was perhaps not transitory and the pace of tapering may need to be accelerated just as new a variant emerges he stuck to his guns he did however say the taper need not be a disruptive event in markets i don t expect that it will be it hasn t been so far we telegraphed it not the sudden change of heart he didn t hence wall street was already heading south when the first case of omicron in the us was announced no one ever expected that a variant which popped up in 20 countries in less than a week would manage to avoid america but by then sentiment had turned and it was just more salt in the wound as the afternoon wore on selling begat selling the dow didn t quite close down 500 but was not far off no one paid much attention to a november private sector jobs increase of 534 000 when 506 000 was forecast but if friday s non farm payrolls come in hot that would likely only steel the fed and scare the market

washington in a fresh sign of his growing concerns about inflation chair jerome powell said wednesday that the federal reserve can t be sure that price increases will slow in the second half of next year as many economists expect powell told the house financial services committee that most economists regard the current price spikes which have sent consumer inflation to a three decade high as largely a response to the pandemic s persistent disruptions to supply and demand as americans have spent more time at home they have ramped up spending on furniture appliances laptop computers soaring demand for such goods combined with parts shortages have resulted in supply chain snarls and higher prices in the past powell who was nominated last week to a second four year term by president joe biden has frequently expressed his belief that these supply and demand imbalances should fade as the pandemic eases which would reduce inflation but on wednesday he said that while such an outcome is likely it is only a forecast the point is we can t act as if we re sure of that he said we re not at all sure of that inflation has been more persistent and higher than we ve expected at the same hearing wednesday treasury secretary janet yellen clashed with many committee republicans who charged that excess spending by the biden administration has been a major contributor to high inflation the administration s proposed 2 trillion social and environmental spending bill they further argued would further accelerate inflation it is the multiple trillions of dollars that this congress and this administration is spending that is putting jet fuel on the fires of this economy said rep patrick mchenry from north carolina the senior republican on the committee it is making things worse yellen countered that the new spending would occur over a decade and would be paid for which would reduce its inflationary impact she also argued that the administration s proposals to spend more on child care subsidies universal early child care education and the child tax credit would make it easier for many women to return to work after having children their return yellen said would help address the labor shortages that are contributing to higher inflation the treasury secretary also defended the administration s 1 9 trillion financial relief package approved last march and said that at most it was a small contributor to higher prices which she said were mostly due to supply chain bottlenecks the financial relief bill put money in people s pockets helped to meet expenses that they had and contributed to strong demand in the u s economy yellen said powell s latest remarks came a day after he signaled a sharp turn toward tightening credit more quickly than the fed has previously indicated the fed chair said tuesday that it would be appropriate for the central bank to consider accelerating the reduction of its bond purchases at its next meeting in mid december that step would pave the way to the fed hiking its benchmark interest rate as early as next spring stock prices tumbled after powell s comments low interest rates have been a key driver of the stock market to record highs during the pandemic shares recovered most of those losses in mid day trading wednesday powell also downplayed sharp wage gains this year as something that could boost inflation further suggesting that he doesn t yet see a wage price spiral developing in the 1970s as prices rose steadily workers were able to demand higher pay to keep up with greater costs yet businesses then raised prices further to cover the higher wages extending the worst run of inflation since world war ii we like to see wages move up powell said at this point we don t see them moving up at a troubling rate that would that would tend to spark higher inflation but that s something we re watching very carefully on tuesday powell said he was ready to retire the use of the word transitory to describe inflation instead he said the risk of higher inflation has increased powell also on tuesday elevated inflation fighting to a more urgent priority than supporting job growth by noting that higher prices themselves threaten the economic recovery a long period of growth he said is needed to regain the great labor market that existed before the pandemic

by david henry new york reuters the global banking industry built up capital and showed its stability during the pandemic but its return on equity plunged and it has lost favor with investors to industries with more attractive growth prospects according to a new study banks withstood the pressures of 2020 and capital reserves rose last year but it came at a cost consulting firm mckinsey said on wednesday in its annual banking review return on equity for banks in north america fell to 8 in 2020 from 12 in 2019 and halved for european banks to 3 from 6 the industry became safer more predictable more commoditized the report said investors now value banks as though they were utilities banks trade around 1 0 times book value compared with 3 0 times for all other industries the report said the discount was less a decade ago about 1 0 times versus 2 0 times the disparity comes even after the industry s stock market value increased 20 to october 2021 from the month before the pandemic that reflects a banking outlook that is decent and resilient but not attractive said mckinsey return on equity could increase from 6 to between 7 and 12 in 2025 largely depending on changes in interest rates government economic support and how much cash is piled onto balance sheets the banks that will fare better than peers the consultants said will be those that move quickly toward businesses that earn fees and require less capital such as payments wealth management and investment banking reporting by david henry in new york editing by mark potter
listen to this article listen to this article san francisco al kelly believes there has been a permanent shift in how consumers worldwide pay for goods and services his 91 year old parents are a prime example the ceo of payments processing giant visa recently visited his mother just after she d finished buying her groceries online something she d never done prior to covid 19 she said to me i cannot believe i wasn t doing this before the pandemic kelly said in an interview with the associated press kelly is more than five years into his tenure as the head of one of the world s largest payments companies and arguably one of the world s best known brands since he took over the company s stock has tripled in value as more of us pay with visa s credit and debit cards a trend bolstered by the pandemic as once cash only establishments started accepting plastic and shoppers did more transactions online but while the shift to online shopping is helping visa s bottom line the company is facing new forms of competition particularly from silicon valley who have debuted alternative forms of payment that go around the traditional visa and mastercard networks the company has also gotten pushback from washington where skeptical policymakers have questioned visa s dominance of the payments industry visa abandoned its intent to purchase plaid a company that helps merchants and banks better accept online payments after the justice department sued to stop the merger citing antitrust concerns visa does not issue credit or debit cards it s a payment processor providing the network between the bank that issues that card and the merchant accepting that card as payment in exchange visa charges a fee from every transaction that runs on its network which translates into billions of dollars in profit and revenue each year during the pandemic more consumers became comfortable purchasing routine items online or with their smart phones to avoid risky in person interactions this was particularly seen in parts of the economy that have traditionally been cash heavy such as grocery stores coffee shops and bars kelly pointed to the growth in debit card usage in the pandemic as an example debit cards are typically thought of as equivalent to cash in the payments industry they can be used to buy items but also to withdraw cash at an atm in the past year debit card purchasing volumes on visa s network rose 23 from a year ago while cash withdrawals were only up 4 people are choosing not to get cash to shop but actually using their debit cards to shop now he said any shift away from cash and digital payments will ultimately be good for visa s bottom line even a shift of 1 or 2 of consumers payments away from cash and onto credit and debit cards could result in tens of billions of dollars of additional transactions crossing over visa s network for decades visa and its primary competitor mastercard have held the dominant market position in how people pay for goods and services with american express a distant third but that duopoly is being challenged by the likes of venmo affirm paypal and other fintech companies now providing payments services to both customers and merchants apple operates its own payment system and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin etherium and others still hold the promise of being alternative forms of payment outside the traditional banking system in short how one pays for goods and services is not as simple as cash or credit with the credit choices being visa mastercard or american express as it was five years ago kelly sees visa s ubiquity as one of its strongest selling points as more competition arises true to its old advertising slogan it s everywhere you want to be visa has had years to build out the infrastructure and merchant network to accept its cards there will always be new forms to pay but they will still need an infrastructure that creates utility and security that they need he said like this article gain access to all of our great content with a month to month subscription start your subscription here

better than expected readings on the u s economy but the gains gradually gave way to a 1 2 skid the afternoon reversal is the latest dizzying move for wall street s benchmark which sank 2 3 on friday for its worst loss since february only to then rise 1 3 on monday and then fall 1 9 on tuesday advertisement the dow jones industrial average ended with a 1 3 loss while the nasdaq composite fell 1 8 both indexes had been solidly higher until the market s afternoon swoon the wild movements are partly the result of investors struggling to handicap how much damage the newest coronavirus variant will do to the economy markets were already headed lower wednesday afternoon when the white house announced that the first case of the omicron variant had been found in the u s in a person who recently had returned from south africa investors are going to have to get used to the idea that this is not going to be the last variant said liz young chief investment strategist at sofi this is likely something that is with us for a while and we have to learn to live with it and manage growth from an investment standpoint advertisement another weight dropped on wall street on tuesday when the head of the federal reserve said that it may halt its immense support for financial markets sooner than expected amid persistently high inflation sweeping the world but since climbing out of its early 2020 collapse caused by the first wave of covid 19 one hallmark of the stock market s powerful run has been the continued willingness of bargain hunting investors to buy after any dip in prices that lasting habit has helped the s p 500 set 66 all time highs so far in 2021 the second highest number on record for a year according to s p dow jones indices it also helped the dow initially climb 520 points wednesday the blue chip index ended up dropping 461 68 points to 34 022 04 the nasdaq slid 283 64 points to 15 254 05 and the s p 500 fell 53 96 points to 4 513 04 advertisement smaller company

their sharp drops from the day before triggered by worries about slowing economic growth but the rebound didn t last the yield on the 10 year treasury slid to 1 41 from 1 44 late tuesday when it fell from 1 52 some better than expected data on the economy failed to avert the late day wave of selling a report from the institute for supply management showed that growth in the u s manufacturing sector accelerated a touch faster last month than economists expected advertisement a separate report from payroll processor adp said that nongovernment employers hired more people in november than economists expected that could raise expectations for friday s more comprehensive jobs report from the u s government though the adp report doesn t have a perfect track record predicting it a stronger economy would burn more fuel and crude oil prices initially rose briefly sending benchmark u s crude 2 1 higher but it shed those gains closing down 0 9 at 65 57 a barrel it momentarily dropped below

airlines flipped from a 3 1 gain to an 8 loss a measure of fear on wall street jumped 14 5 the vix which shows how worried investors are about upcoming drops for the s p 500 is still well above where it was before omicron walloped markets worldwide after thanksgiving the biggest driver of the near term volatility has been omicron said terry sandven chief equity strategist at u s bank wealth management it clouds near term visibility and it s just simply too early to tell the extent to which it will evade existing vaccines and how severe it will be relative to other mutations it s the big unknown advertisement the possibility of less help for markets from the fed continues to hang over wall street chair jerome h powell said tuesday the central bank will consider an earlier halt to its monthly purchases of bonds which are meant to goose the economy by keeping rates low for mortgages and other long term loans that would open the door for the fed to raise short term interest rates diluting one of the main reasons for the s p 500 s more than doubling since late march 2020 low rates encourage investors to pay higher prices for stocks and have helped deflect criticism that the market had become too expensive so a faster ramp up in short term rates threatens stocks but analysts say it could also be an encouraging signal about the fed s confidence in the economy s strength analysts also warn that the market is likely to remain jumpy until more clarity arrives on omicron s ultimate effect with no answer yet on the effectiveness of vaccines against the variant it s only a guess on whether governments will reinstate tough restrictions people will be scared away from businesses or inflation will worsen advertisement associated press writer yuri kageyama contributed to

1 covid 19 the covid 19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on the research and development of our product candidates research facilities at dartmouth were subject to closures as well as laboratories at ariel in israel during fiscal 2020 this resulted in our discontinuing our research at these universities and was part of our decision to adjust our research to be collaborative and to seek aligning with third parties to advance our expanded goals we do not currently know the full extent of potential delays of research in the future as a result of the continuing pandemic restrictions covid 19 also caused significant disruptions to the global financial markets particularly in early 2020 which severely impacted our ability to raise additional capital this resulted in our terminating our employees in april 2020 in an effort to conserve resources as we evaluated our business development efforts the ultimate impact on us and our research relationships is currently uncertain we may be required to further reduce operations or cease operations if we are unable to finance our operations management is actively monitoring the situation but given the continued evolution of the covid 19 outbreak the company is not able to fully estimate the effects of the covid 19 outbreak on its planned operations or financial condition in the next 12 months however while significant uncertainty remains the company believes it is likely that the covid 19 outbreak will have a negative impact on its ability to raise additional financing and will result in delays as it continues to impact the

to our company we have incurred significant losses since inception and we expect to incur losses over the next several years and may not be able to achieve or sustain revenues or profitability in the future we were incorporated in wyoming on september 22 2016 and have a limited operating history we have no tangible assets other than cash and cash equivalents since our inception we have incurred significant net losses our net losses for the years ended december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 were 662 963 and 1 546 772 respectively as of september 30 2021 our accumulated deficit was 8 014 058 we expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future we may never become profitable or if achieved be able to sustain profitability we are heavily dependent upon the ability and expertise of our chief executive officer and president and the loss of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition we terminated our employees in april 2020 as a result of covid 19 restrictions we rely on jonah meer our chief executive officer and ido merfeld our president for our operations including our research and development activities our success is dependent upon the ability expertise judgment discretion and good faith of these individuals any loss of the services of mr meer or mr merfeld would have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 4 our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our audited financial statements in connection with our management s assessment our report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 includes an explanatory paragraph stating the company has not generated sufficient revenues sufficient to cover operating expenses and will need additional capital to service its debt obligations while the company raised proceeds of 100 000 during the nine months ended september 30 2021 through issuance of a convertible promissory note and 211 000 during the year ended december 31 2020 by way of private placement offerings to accredited investors loans and advances from its officers and directors and third party short term loans it does not believe its resources will be sufficient to meet its operating and capital needs beyond the second quarter of 2022 the company expects it will require additional capital to fully implement the scope of its proposed business operations which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern the company will have to continue to rely on equity and debt financing and or continued support from its officers and directors there can be no assurance that financing whether debt or equity will be available to the company in the amount required at any particular time or for any particular period or if available that it can be obtained on favorable terms in addition if the company is unable to obtain adequate financing due to the continued effect of covid 19 on the capital markets the company may be required to reduce the scope delay or eliminate some or all of its planned operations these factors among others raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern if we are unable to obtain sufficient funding our business prospects financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going concern we have never generated revenues from product sales and anticipate that we will incur substantial net losses for the foreseeable future we may never achieve or sustain profitability we have a limited operating history we have had no revenues to date nor anticipate any in the foreseeable future we have no products approved for commercial sale even if we are successful in developing a successful product and receiving fda clearance and launching a product into the market we expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to sell and market singularly focused products and research and develop and seek regulatory approvals for other potential product candidates we are subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business enterprise including under capitalization cash shortages limitations with respect to personnel financial and other resources lack of revenue and the risk that we will not achieve our growth objective if sales revenue from any potential product candidates that receive marketing clearance from the fda or other regulatory body is insufficient if we are unable to develop and commercialize any of our potential product candidates or if our product development is delayed we may never achieve or sustain profitability we will require additional financing to carry out our plan of operations and if we are unable to obtain such financing our business may fail we currently have limited working capital and liquid assets we held cash totaling 57 174 as of september 30 2021 to date we have not generated any revenue from the sales of products there are a number of conditions that we must satisfy before we will be able to generate revenue including but not limited to the identification successful testing and approval and development of a product while we are currently seeking additional funding we do not currently have sufficient resources to accomplish any of these conditions necessary for us to generate revenue we will therefore require substantial additional funds in order to continue to conduct research and development and to obtain regulatory clearance and approval necessary to bring a product candidate to market to establish effective marketing and sales capabilities and to develop other product candidates our existing capital resources will not be sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of the development and commercialization of our current our product candidate we cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future development and commercialization of our product candidate or if when or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of our current product candidate or potential future product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval we may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for our current product candidate and any potential future product candidates we may be unable to raise the additional funding to finance our business on commercially reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain additional financing as needed we may be required to reduce the scope of our operations and pursue only those projects that can be funded through cash flows generated from its existing operations if any 5 raising additional capital by issuing securities or through debt financings or licensing arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities your ownership interest will be diluted and the terms of such securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder debt financing if available may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take certain actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures or declaring dividends if we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships with third parties we may have to relinquish valuable rights future revenue streams research programs or otherwise grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed we may be required to delay limit reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market potential future product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve our product development and commercialization goals we may have difficulty entering into managing and maintaining strategic alliances with third parties our growth strategy includes entering into strategic alliances with third parties to gain access and collaborate in new and innovative technologies in particular we seek to engage in strategic arrangements with companies and institutions that are developing breakthrough technologies in the fields of ai ml molecular biology stem cells and tissue engineering for deployment in the fight against neuronal diseases our search is focused on researchers based in israel a country which is world renowned for biotech innovations the process to collaborate with strategic partners may be time consuming and costly we expect to expend significant resources to undertake business financial and legal due diligence and negotiate with potential partners and there is no guarantee that we will be able to enter into such arrangements or that such strategic arrangements will ultimately increase our business the anticipated benefits of these arrangements may never materialize or we may not realize them in the time frame expected and performing under these arrangements may adversely affect our results of operations ariel scientific innovations ltd a wholly owned subsidiary of ariel university in ariel israel ariel has a right to additional shares under its royalty agreement with the company which will result in dilution of existing shareholders on november 30 2019 the company entered into the royalty agreement with ariel which among other things superseded and terminated the license and research funding agreement dated december 14 2016 as amended between the company and ariel upon the occurrence of an exit event as such term is described in the royalty agreement including an underwritten public offering of the company s shares with proceeds of at least 25 million a consolidation merger or reorganization of the company and a sale of all or substantially all of the shares and or the assets of the company ariel has the right to require the company to issue up to 3 of the then issued and outstanding shares of its common stock the issuance of any such shares in the future will result in dilution to the interests of other shareholders we currently only have two product candidates which are still in development and we have not applied for clearance from the fda to commercially distribute the product in the united states or clearance from any countries outside the united states and we may never obtain such clearances we currently are dependent on the potential development of two product candidates relating to tbis which are based on what we believe to be a novel stem cell system to repair and regenerate neuronal damage we are still developing these products and we cannot begin marketing and selling the product in the united states until we obtain clearances from the fda we have not yet submitted applications for regulatory clearance in the united states the process of obtaining regulatory clearance is expensive and time consuming and can vary substantially based upon among other things the type complexity and novelty of a product changes in regulatory policy changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may cause delays in the clearance of a product candidate or rejection of a regulatory application altogether in addition varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre clinical and clinical testing could delay limit or prevent marketing authorization from the fda or regulatory clearance of a product candidate any marketing authorization from the fda or regulatory clearance we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post market commitments that render the product candidate not commercially viable if our attempts to obtain marketing authorization are unsuccessful we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain and grow our business 6 we are and will continue to be dependent in significant part on outside scientists and third party research institutions for our research and development we had two full time employees and two part time employees to perform the research and development necessary to commercialize what we believe to be our novel cell delivery system and potential future product candidates however due to the restrictions caused by the covid 19 pandemic and its impact on our ability to raise additional capital for research and development we terminated these employees in april 2020 dr liat hammer continues to serve as our director of research on an as needed basis to assist in our development goals we currently outsource all professional services to third parties and rely on third party research institution collaborators for research and development there is no guarantee that our work with professor chenfeng ke of dartmouth in our research related to 3d printable materials will continue we have been conducting a research study with professor chenfeng ke of the chemistry department at dartmouth relating to professor ke s 3d printable materials in the field of human and animal health should professor ke be unable or unwilling to continue such collaboration there can be no assurance that a suitable research partner can be found the intellectual property agreement with dartmouth may be terminated in the event of a material breach by the company under the terms of the intellectual property agreement in the event of a material breach of the agreement dartmouth may terminate the agreement after giving the company 30 days to cure such breach a material breach includes a breach of a payment obligation by the company if dartmouth were to terminate the agreement we will be unable to develop and commercialize any potential products obtained through research done under the agreement we may encounter substantial delays in our clinical trials or our clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidate to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidate we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidate clinical testing is expensive time consuming and uncertain as to outcome we cannot guarantee that clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule if at all a failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing delays can be costly and could negatively affect our ability to complete a clinical trial since our research is done by third parties our control over the research process may be diminished as we are dependent on third parties to conduct our clinical trials we do not have complete control over the process and issues with such third parties may result in further delays our technology is a new untested form of neuronal regeneration and the medical community may not to adopt new therapies and technologies very rapidly which may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial position the effectiveness of our product candidates which rely on stem cells and hydrogels to tbis have not been established in studies conducted in a controlled environment designed to produce scientifically significant results accordingly our technology is a new untested and therefore unproven therapy unproven and untested technologies are usually more slowly adopted by the medical community as the medical community tends to be very conservative and does not adopt new untested therapies very rapidly physicians may elect not to use our products for a variety of reasons including 7 lack or perceived lack of evidence supporting the beneficial characteristics of our technology limited long term data on the use of conditioned medium technology for therapy physicians perception that there are insufficient advantages of our product relative to currently available products hospitals may choose not to purchase our product group purchasing organizations may choose not to contract for our product thus limiting availability of our products to hospital purchasers lack of coverage or adequate payment from managed care plans and other third party payers for our product medicare medicaid or other third party payers may limit or not permit reimbursement for our product and the development of or improvement of competitive products if we are able to commercialize our product and the medical community reacts in a similar fashion to adopting our product candidates we will not be able to generate significant revenues if any in order to be successful we must expand our products beyond our product candidates by commercializing new potential product candidates but we may not be able to do so in a timely fashion and at expected costs or at all in order to be successful we will need to expand our product line beyond our stem cell delivery system which is currently our only projected product candidate to succeed in our commercialization efforts we must effectively continue product development and testing obtain regulatory clearances and approvals and enhance our sales and marketing capabilities there is no assurance that we will succeed in bringing our current or potential future product candidates to market if we fail in bringing our product candidate to market or experience delays in doing so we will not generate revenues as planned and will need to curtail operations or seek additional financing earlier than otherwise anticipated the development of additional products is subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of new state of the art products based on new technologies these risks include a delays in product development or manufacturing b unplanned expenditures for product development or manufacturing c failure of new products to have the desired effect or an acceptable accuracy profile d emergence of superior or equivalent products e failure by any potential collaborative partners to successfully develop products and f the dependence on third parties for the manufacture development and sale of products our research and development efforts or those of potential collaborative partners may not result in any commercially viable products if development efforts are not successful or any products are not commercially successful we are less likely to generate significant revenues or become profitable we can provide no assurance that the development by others of new or improved products will not result in our present and future products from becoming obsolete the areas in which we plan to commercialize distribute and or sell products involves rapidly developing technology there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish ourselves in the field of unmet neural diseases or if established that we will be able to maintain a market position if any there can be no assurance that the development by others of new or improved products will not make our present and future products if any superfluous or obsolete 8 if our intellectual property protection is inadequate competitors may gain access to our technology and undermine our competitive position we regard our intended and future intellectual property as important to our success and we intend to rely on patent law to protect our proprietary rights despite our precautions unauthorized third parties may copy certain portions of our products or reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we intend to seek patents in the future we do not know if any future patent application will be issued within the scope of the claims we seek if at all or whether any patents we receive will be challenged or invalidated thus we cannot assure you that any intellectual property rights that we may receive can be successfully asserted in the future or that they will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states our means of protecting any proprietary rights we may receive in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and competitors may independently develop a similar technology any failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations our future success depends on our ability to obtain approval on a patent for our technology failing which we may be unable to protect our proprietary information and any competitive advantage our future success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent approval for the technologies underlying our product candidates there can be no assurance that the patent applications made will result in the issuance of patents or that the term of the patents will be extendable after they expire in due course which would prevent us from being able to protect our proprietary information and may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition much of the know how and technology that we have may not be patentable though we believe they may constitute trade secrets there can be no assurance however that we will be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets to help protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology we will require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements there can be no assurance that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure we may become subject to litigation claims and legal proceedings including intellectual property litigation such as patent infringement claims which could adversely affect our business in time we as well as certain of our directors and officers may become subject to claims or lawsuits these lawsuits may result in significant legal fees and expenses and could divert management s time and other resources if the claims contained in these lawsuits are successfully asserted against us we could be liable for damages and be required to alter or cease certain of our business practices or development or commercialization of our product any of these outcomes could cause our business financial performance and cash position to be negatively impacted additionally our commercial success will depend in part on not infringing on the patents or proprietary rights of others there can be no assurance that the technologies and products used or developed by us will not infringe such rights if such infringement occurs and we are not able to obtain a license from the relevant third party we will not be able to continue the development manufacture use or sale of any such infringing technology or product there can be no assurance that necessary licenses to third party technology will be available at all or on commercially reasonable term in some cases litigation or other proceedings may be necessary to defend against or assert claims of infringement or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of third parties any potential litigation could result in substantial costs to and diversion of our resources and could have a material and adverse impact on us 9 an adverse outcome in any such litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities require us to cease using the subject technology or require us to license the subject technology from the third party all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business if our expenses are greater than anticipated then we will have fewer funds with which to pursue our plan of operations and our financing requirements will be greater than anticipated we may find that the costs of carrying out our plan of operations are greater than we anticipate increased operating costs may cause the amount of financing that we require to increase investors may be more reluctant to provide additional financing if we cannot demonstrate that we can control our operating costs there is no assurance that additional financing required as a result of our operating costs being greater than anticipated will be available to us if we do not control our operating expenses then we will have fewer funds with which to carry out our plan of operations with the result that our business may fail we may not be able to build an effective distribution network for our products we will likely need to rely on third party distributors to sell our product if and when developed we cannot assure you that we will succeed in entering into and maintaining productive arrangements with an adequate number of distributors that are sufficiently committed to selling our products the establishment of a distribution network is expensive and time consuming if and when we launch new products and increase our marketing effort with respect to existing products we will need to continue to retain skilled independent distributors with significant technical knowledge in addition the commissions we may pay any future distributors could increase over time which would result in higher sales and marketing expenses potential distributors may market and sell the products of our competitors even if the distributors market and sell products we may develop our competitors may be able by offering higher commission payments or other incentives to persuade these distributors to reduce or terminate their sales and marketing efforts related to our products the distributors may also help competitors solicit business from our existing customers some independent distributors may account for a significant portion of our sales volume and if we were to lose them our sales could be adversely affected even if we engage and maintain suitable relationships with an adequate number of distributors they may not generate revenue as quickly as we expect them to commit the necessary resources to effectively market and sell our products or ultimately succeed in selling our products we will need to engage a source for the manufacture of our product and the loss of this third party manufacture could harm our business we do not intend to do our own manufacturing thus will need to engage a third party to manufacture and supply our stem cell delivery system this manufacturer will also hold our inventory warehouse and ship our products to a distribution center which will ship to customers as well as handle customer service related tasks our reliance on a single third party manufacturer to supply us with our product and a separate vendor to provide such other distribution and warranty services may expose us to other risks such as lack of coordination and mutuality of interests that could delay our sales or result in higher costs or lost product revenues in particular our manufacturer could encounter difficulties in achieving volume production quality control and quality assurance or suffer shortages of qualified personnel which could result in their inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of our commercially available product to meet market demand or it could experience similar problems that result in the manufacture of insufficient quantities of our product candidate and fail to follow and remain in compliance with the fda mandated quality system regulations qsrs compliance which is required for all medical products or fail to document their compliance to qsrs either of which could lead to significant delays in the availability of materials for our product 10 if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of our product that meet our specifications and quality standards it will be difficult for us to compete effectively we have no supply agreements in place with any and any future manufacturer may change the terms of any future orders or choose not to supply us with products in the future furthermore if a manufacturer fails to perform its obligations we may be forced to purchase our product from other third party manufacturers which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms or in sufficient time if at all in addition if we are required to change manufacturers for any reason we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines the delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer or the re verification of an existing manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to produce and distribute our product in a timely manner if and when we sell our products we may be liable for product liability claims and we may not carry sufficient product liability insurance the products that we intend to develop may expose us to potential liability from personal injury claims by end users of the product we intend to carry product liability insurance to protect us against the risk that in the future a product liability claim or product recall could materially and adversely affect our business inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our intended products we cannot assure you that if and when we commence distribution of products that we will be able to obtain or maintain adequate coverage on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate coverage against all potential claims moreover even if we maintain adequate insurance any successful claim could materially and adversely affect our reputation and prospects and divert management s time and attention if we are sued for any injury allegedly caused by our future products our liability could exceed our total assets and our ability to pay the liability we qualify as an emerging growth company under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 b of the sarbanes oxley act comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements i e an auditor discussion and analysis submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes such as say on pay and say on frequency and disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive s compensation to median employee compensation we will remain an emerging growth company until december 31 2023 or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed 1 billion ii the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in rule 12b 2 under the securities exchange act of 1934 which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in non convertible debt during the preceding three year period 11 until such time however we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile since we have elected under section 107 of the jobs act to use the extended transition period with respect to complying with new or revised accounting standards our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates making it more difficult for an investor to compare our results with other public companies section 107 of the jobs act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section 102 b 2 b of the act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words as an emerging growth company we can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards we are a small company with limited resources compared to some of our current and potential competitors and we may not be able to compete effectively there is potential that we will face intense competition from other companies some of which can be expected to have longer operating histories and more financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than us increased competition by larger and better financed competitors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and our results of operations to be competitive we will require a continued high level of investment in research and development marketing sales and client support we may not have sufficient resources to maintain research and development marketing sales and client support efforts on a competitive basis which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and our results of operations we face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively the biopharmaceutical industry and the rapidly evolving market for stem cell therapies in particular is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation our competitors may be able to develop other compounds or drugs that are able to achieve similar or better results our potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies established biotechnology companies specialty pharmaceutical companies universities and other research institutions many of our competitors have substantially greater financial technical and other resources such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations as well as established sales forces smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large established companies mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries our competitors either alone or with collaborative partners may succeed in developing acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis drug or biologic products that are more effective safer more easily commercialized or less costly than our product candidates or may develop proprietary technologies or secure patent protection that we may need for the development of our technologies and products even if we obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates we may not be the first to market and that may affect the price or demand for our product candidates additionally the availability and price of our competitors products could limit the demand and the price we are able to charge for our product candidates we may not be able to implement our business plan if the acceptance of our product candidates is inhibited by price competition or the reluctance of physicians to switch from existing methods of treatment to our product candidates or if physicians switch to other new drug or biologic products or choose to reserve our product candidates for use in limited circumstances 12 the costs to meet our reporting and other requirements as a public company subject to the securities exchange act of 1934 are substantial and may result in us having insufficient funds to operate and expand our business as a public reporting company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 and will incur ongoing and significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company including costs associated with public company reporting requirements we will continue to incur costs associated with the rules implemented by the sec and any other exchange on which our common stock may become listed these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and may make some activities more time consuming and costly and as a result we may not have sufficient funds to grow our operations these laws and regulations also could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance including director and officer liability insurance and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage these laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud the sec as required by section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 adopted rules requiring every public company to include a management report on such company s internal controls over financial reporting in its annual report which contains management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting our reporting obligations as a public company place a significant strain on our management and operational and financial resources and systems effective internal controls particularly those related to revenue recognition are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to prevent fraud as a result our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting may result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which in turn may harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our stock furthermore we anticipate that we will continue to incur considerable costs and use significant management time and other resources in an effort to comply with section 404 and other requirements of the sarbanes oxley act since our officers and directors work part time for other companies their other activities for those other companies may involve a conflict of interest with regard to the amount of time they dedicate to our business our officers and directors are not required to work exclusively for us and do not devote all of their time to our operations therefore it is possible that a conflict of interest with regard to their time may arise based on their work for such other companies their other activities may prevent them from devoting time to our operations which could slow our operations and may reduce our financial results because of the slowdown in operations risks related to government regulation before we can market and sell our products we will be required to obtain approval and clearance by the fda and foreign regulatory authorities these approvals and clearances will take significant time and require significant research development and clinical study expenditures and ultimately may not succeed the research testing manufacturing labeling approval selling import export marketing and distribution of drug products including biologics are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and other regulatory authorities in the united states we are not permitted to market any biological drug product in the united states until we receive a biologics license from the fda we have not previously submitted a biologics license application bla to the fda or similar approval filings to comparable foreign authorities a bla must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish that the product candidate is safe pure and potent for each desired indication the bla must also include significant information regarding the chemistry manufacturing and controls for the product and the manufacturing facilities must complete a successful pre license inspection we expect the novel nature of our product candidate to create further challenges in obtaining regulatory approval the fda may also require a panel of experts referred to as an advisory committee to deliberate on the adequacy of the safety and efficacy data to support licensure the opinion of the advisory committee although not binding may have a significant impact on our ability to obtain licensure of the product candidates based on the completed clinical trials accordingly the regulatory approval pathway for our product candidates may be uncertain complex expensive and lengthy and approval may not be obtained 13 we will also be required to comply with costly and time consuming compliance by foreign regulatory authorities if we want to sell our products outside of the united states ethical social and legal concerns about research regarding stem cells could result in regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use federal and state agencies congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology more restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development it is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted regulations policies or guidance changed or interpretations by agencies or courts changed or what the impact of such changes if any may be obtaining fda clearance will be costly may result in time consuming delays and will subject us to ongoing compliance costs and regulatory risk for non compliance obtaining fda clearance or approval can be expensive and uncertain and generally takes several years and generally requires detailed and comprehensive scientific and clinical data notwithstanding the expense these efforts may never result in fda clearance even if we were to obtain regulatory clearance it may not be for the uses we believe are important or commercially attractive in which case we would not be permitted to market our product for those uses the fda can delay limit or deny clearance or approval of a product for many reasons including we may not be able to demonstrate to the fda s satisfaction that our product candidate is safe and effective sensitive and specific diagnostic tests for its intended users the data from our pre clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval where required and the manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements in addition the fda may change its clearance and approval policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis even if granted pre market approval for any future product would likely place substantial restrictions on how our product is marketed or sold and fda will continue to place considerable restrictions on our products and operations in addition manufacturers must register their manufacturing facilities list the products with fda and comply with requirements relating to labeling marketing complaint handling adverse event reporting reporting of corrections and removals and import and export fda monitors compliance with these other requirements through periodic inspections if our facilities or those of our manufacturers or suppliers are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations or if we or our manufacturers or suppliers fail to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection the regulatory authority could take enforcement action additionally the fda and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers regulatory enforcement or inquiries or other increased scrutiny on us could affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our product candidate and dissuade our customers from using our product candidate if and when it is authorized for marketing 14 the ability of the fda to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors including government budget and funding levels and statutory regulatory and policy changes average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result over the last several years the u s government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies including the fda have had to furlough critical employees and stop critical activities separately in response to the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 certain fda inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities and products and routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities have been postponed or otherwise restricted additionally regulatory authorities outside the united states may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the covid 19 pandemic such restrictions or delays may adversely affect our ability to obtain product approval in a timely manner we have limited experience in the clinical trials process they may proceed more slowly than anticipated clinical trials are complex expensive time consuming uncertain and are subject to substantial and unanticipated delays clinical trials generally involve a substantial number of patients in a multi year study because we do not have the experience or the infrastructure necessary to conduct clinical trials we will have to hire one or more contract research organization cro to conduct trials on our behalf cro contract negotiations may be costly and time consuming and we will rely heavily on the cro to ensure that our trials are conducted in accordance with regulatory and industry standards we may encounter problems with our clinical trials and any of those problems could cause us or the fda to suspend those trials or delay the analysis of the data derived from them delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidate which could cause our stock price to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing in addition if one or more of our clinical trials are delayed competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do and the commercial viability of our product candidate could be significantly reduced we will be substantially dependent on third parties to conduct clinical trials as we are required to conduct clinical trials to obtain fda clearance we need to rely heavily on third parties over the course of our clinical trials and as a result will have limited control over the clinical investigators and limited visibility into their day to day activities nevertheless we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities we and these third parties are required to comply with current good clinical practices or cgcps which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the fda and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for product candidates in clinical development regulatory authorities enforce these cgcps through periodic inspections of trial sponsors principal investigators and trial sites if we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable cgcp regulations the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional nonclinical or clinical trials before approving our marketing applications we cannot be certain that upon inspection such regulatory authorities will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with the cgcp regulations in addition our clinical trials may be required to be conducted with a large number of test patients our failure or any failure by these third parties to comply with these regulations or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may require us to repeat clinical trials which would delay the regulatory approval process moreover our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws any third parties conducting our clinical trials are not and will not be our employees and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing preclinical clinical and nonclinical programs these third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities including our competitors for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities which could affect their performance on our behalf if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons our clinical trials may be extended delayed or terminated and we may not be able to complete development of obtain regulatory approval of or successfully commercialize our product candidate as a result our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidate would be harmed our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed 15 if any of our relationships terminate with these third party cros we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative cros or do so on commercially reasonable terms switching or adding additional cros involves additional cost and requires management time and focus in addition there is a natural transition period when a new cro begins work as a result delays occur which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines though we carefully manage our relationships with our cros there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and prospects if we are unable to obtain a reimbursement code from the u s department of health and human services so that our product is covered under medicare and medicaid this would have a negative impact on our intended sales and would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results we will need to apply to the u s department of health and human services for reimbursement code so that our product candidate is covered under medicare and medicaid there can be no assurance that our application will be successful or that we will be able to obtain a reimbursement code in a timely manner in the event that we do not obtain a reimbursement code our customers may be unable to obtain reimbursement for their purchases under private or government sponsored insurance plans which would have a negative impact on sales and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition medicare and its administrative contractors as well as other insurers must find that our product meets their medical necessity requirements for the treatment of patients or they will not pay for the product in addition there is a risk that the payment amount for the product is too low to incentivize customer adoption if hospitals and other healthcare providers are unable to obtain coverage or adequate reimbursement for procedures performed with our products our product will not likely be widely used in the united states the commercial success of any future products will depend in part on the extent to which governmental payers at the federal and state levels including medicare and medicaid private health insurers and other third party payers provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for procedures utilizing our products hospitals and other healthcare providers that purchase our product for treatment of their patients generally rely on third party payers to pay for all or part of the costs and fees associated with our products as part of a bundled rate for the associated procedures the existence of coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products and the procedures performed with them by government and private payers critical to market acceptance of our existing and future products neither hospitals nor physicians are likely to use our product and any future products if they do not receive adequate reimbursement for the procedures utilizing our products many private payers currently base their reimbursement policies on the coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by the cms which administers the medicare program others may adopt different coverage or reimbursement policies for procedures performed with our products while some governmental programs such as medicaid have reimbursement policies that vary from state to state some of which may not pay for the procedures performed with our products in an adequate amount if at all a medicare national or local coverage decision denying coverage for one or more of our products could result in private and other third party payers also denying coverage for our products third party payers also may deny reimbursement for our products if they determine that a product used in a procedure was not medically necessary was not used in accordance with cost effective treatment methods as determined by the third party payer or was used for an unapproved use unfavorable coverage or reimbursement decisions by government programs or private payers underscore the uncertainty that our products face in the market and could have a material adverse effect on our business 16 many hospitals and clinics in the united states belong to group purchasing organizations which typically incentivize their hospital members to make a relatively large proportion of purchases from a limited number of vendors of similar products that have contracted to offer discounted prices such contracts often include exceptions for purchasing certain innovative new technologies however accordingly the commercial success of our products may also depend to some extent on our ability to either negotiate favorable purchase contracts with key group purchasing organizations and or persuade hospitals and clinics to purchase our product off contract the healthcare industry in the united states has experienced a trend toward cost containment as government and private payers seek to control healthcare costs by paying service providers lower rates while we believe that hospitals will be able to obtain coverage for procedures using our products the level of payment available to them for such procedures may change over time state and federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid closely regulate provider payment levels and have sought to contain and sometimes reduce payment levels private payers frequently follow government payment policies and are likewise interested in controlling increases in the cost of medical care in addition some payers are adopting pay for performance programs that differentiate payments to healthcare providers based on the achievement of documented quality of care metrics cost efficiencies or patient outcomes these programs are intended to provide incentives to providers to deliver the same or better results while consuming fewer resources as a result of these programs and related payer efforts to reduce payment levels hospitals and other providers are seeking ways to reduce their costs including the amounts they pay for medical products we may not be able to sell our products profitably if third party payers deny or discontinue coverage or reduce their levels of payment below that which we project or if our production costs increase at a greater rate than payment levels adverse changes in payment rates by payers to hospitals could adversely impact our ability to market and sell our products and negatively affect our financial performance in international markets medical product regulatory requirements and healthcare payment systems vary significantly from country to country and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines we cannot assure you that our products will be considered cost effective by international third party payers that reimbursement will be available or if available that the third party payers reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably any failure to receive regulatory or reimbursement approvals would negatively impact market acceptance of our products in any international markets in which those approvals are sought healthcare legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations there remains uncertainty concerning the fate of the affordable care act and other healthcare laws it is uncertain whether the united states congress will draft legislation to repeal parts of the affordable care act when such legislation would be passed and whether congress would replace the law and what any replacement law would encompass we cannot predict any initiatives that may be adopted in the future additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products which could result in reduced demand for any future products that we may develop and or pricing pressures for such products risks related to our common stock and this offering we may allocate the net proceeds from the offering in ways which differ from our estimates based on our current plans and assumptions the allocation of net proceeds of the offering set forth in the use of proceeds section below represents our estimates based upon our current plans and assumptions regarding industry and general economic conditions and any future revenues and expenditures the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors including market conditions cash generated from operations if any business developments and related rate of growth we may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds from this offering for other purposes you may not have an opportunity to evaluate the economic financial or other information on which we base our decisions on how to use our proceeds as a result you and other shareholders may not agree with our allocation of net proceeds decisions 17 a decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise any required working capital and adversely impact our operations a decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise any required capital for our operations because we intend to fund the company in the future primarily through the sale of equity securities a decline in the price of our common stock could have an adverse effect upon our liquidity and our continued operations a reduction in our ability to raise equity capital in the future may have a material adverse effect upon our business plan and operations if our stock price declines we may not be able to raise additional capital or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations an active liquid trading market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained if and when an active market develops the price of our common stock may be volatile presently our common stock is traded on the otcqb and we are in our early stages an investment in our company will require a long term commitment with no certainty of return presently there is limited trading in our stock and in the absence of an active trading market investors may have difficulty buying and selling or obtaining market quotations market visibility for shares of our common stock may be limited and a lack of visibility for shares of our common stock may have a depressive effect on the market price for shares of our common stock the lack of an active market impairs your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable the lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of your shares an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares trading in stocks quoted on the otc markets is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock moreover the otcqb is not a stock exchange and trading of securities is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like nasdaq or a national stock exchange like the nyse accordingly stockholders may have difficulty reselling any of their shares reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors as an emerging growth company we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations and you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the price at which you acquired them or at all securities of microcap and small cap companies have experienced substantial volatility in the past often based on factors unrelated to the companies financial performance or prospects we believe that trading in our stock if it occurs at all will likely be subject to significant volatility since among other reasons we do not have nor will we have in the foreseeable future an active trading market in our stock factors unrelated to our performance that may affect the price of our common stock include the following the extent of analytical coverage available to investors concerning our business may be limited if investment banks with research capabilities do not follow us a reduction 18 in trading volume and general market interest in our common stock may affect an investor s ability to trade significant numbers of shares of our common stock the size of our public float limits the ability of some institutions to invest in our common stock and a substantial decline in the price of shares of our common stock that persists for a significant period of time could cause our common stock if listed on an exchange to be delisted from such exchange further reducing market liquidity as a result of any of these factors the market price of our common stock at any given point in time may not accurately reflect our long term value the price of our common shares may increase or decrease in response to a number of events and factors including changes in financial estimates our acquisitions and financings quarterly variations in our operating results the operating and share price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable and purchase or sale of blocks of our common stock these factors or any of them may materially adversely affect the prices of our common shares regardless of our operating performance we caution you as to the highly illiquid nature of an investment in our shares the market price of our common stock may be affected by many other variables which are not directly related to our success and are therefore not within our control these include other developments that affect the breadth of the public market for shares of our common stock and the attractiveness of alternative investments the effect of these and other factors on the market price of our common stock is expected to make our common stock price volatile in the future which may result in losses to investors in the past stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation after periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities if a shareholder were to file any such class action suit against us we would incur substantial legal fees and our management s attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business to respond to the litigation which could harm our business our chief executive officer and our president have 66 2 3 of the voting rights of the company for so long as the class a preferred stock is issued and outstanding the holders of class a preferred stock vote together as a single class with the holders of the company s common stock and the holders of any other class or series of shares entitled to vote with the common stock with the holders of class a preferred stock being entitled to 66 2 3 of the total votes on all such matters regardless of the actual number of shares of class a preferred stock then outstanding because the holders of the series a preferred stock have 66 2 3 of the voting rights of the company if they act together they will be able to influence the outcome of all corporate actions requiring approval of our shareholders including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions which may result in corporate action with which other shareholders do not agree if the series a preferred shareholders vote in favor of the foregoing actions they will have sufficient voting power to approve such actions and no other shareholder approvals will be required as a result mr meer and mr merfeld will have significant influence over the management and affairs of the company and control over matters requiring shareholder approval including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets for the foreseeable future their interests may differ from the interests of other shareholders and thus result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders we are authorized to issue up to 100 million shares of common stock and we may issue significantly more shares to raise capital which would result in substantial dilution to your investment in our shares our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of 100 million shares of common stock this amount may be increased by our board who can issue shares for such consideration and on such terms and conditions as are established by our board of directors without the approval of any of our shareholders any additional financings effected by us may result in the issuance of additional securities without shareholder approval and the substantial dilution in the percentage of common stock held by our then existing shareholders moreover the common stock issued in any such transaction may be valued on an arbitrary or non arm s length basis by our management resulting in an additional reduction in the percentage of common stock held by our current shareholders our board has the power to issue any or all of such authorized but unissued shares without shareholder approval to the extent that additional shares of common stock or preferred stock are issued in connection with a financing dilution to the interests of our shareholders will occur and the rights of the holders of common stock might be materially and adversely affected 19 we have not paid any dividends and do not foresee paying dividends in the future we intend to retain earnings if any to finance the growth and development of our business and do not intend to pay cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future the payment of future cash dividends if any will be reviewed periodically by the board of directors and will depend upon among other things conditions then existing including earnings financial condition and capital requirements restrictions in financing agreements business opportunities and other factors a significant portion of our outstanding common stock may be sold into the public market in the future which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly even if our business is doing well sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur in the future these sales or the market perception that the holders of a large number of shares of our common stock intend to sell shares could reduce the market price of our common stock our stock is a penny stock trading of our stock may be restricted by the sec s penny stock regulations which may limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our stock our stock is a penny stock the sec has adopted rule 15g 9 which generally defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price as defined less than 5 00 per share or an exercise price of less than 5 00 per share subject to certain exceptions our securities are covered by the penny stock rules which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors the term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of 5 000 000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of 1 000 000 not including any equity in that person s or person s spouse s primary residence or annual income exceeding 200 000 or 300 000 jointly with their spouse the penny stock rules require a broker dealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the sec which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the broker dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the broker dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account the bid and offer quotations and the broker dealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer s confirmation in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules the broker dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules consequently these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker dealers to trade our securities we believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock finra sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our stock in addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the sec the finra has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer a broker dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non institutional customers broker dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s financial status tax status investment objectives and other information under interpretations of these rules finra believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers the finra requirements make it more difficult for broker dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock 20 anti takeover provisions may limit the ability of another party to acquire us which could cause our stock price to decline though not now we may be or in the future we may become subject to wyoming s control share law the law focuses on the acquisition of a controlling interest which means the ownership of outstanding voting shares sufficient but for the control share law to enable the acquiring person to exercise the following proportions of the voting power of the corporation in the election of directors i one fifth or more but less than one third ii one third or more but less than a majority or iii a majority or more the ability to exercise such voting power may be direct or indirect as well as individual or in association with others the effect of the control share law is that the acquiring person and those acting in association with it obtains only such voting rights in the control shares as are conferred by a resolution of the stockholders of the corporation approved at a special or annual meeting of stockholders the control share law contemplates that voting rights will be considered only once by the other stockholders thus there is no authority to strip voting rights from the control shares of an acquiring person once those rights have been approved if the stockholders do not grant voting rights to the control shares acquired by an acquiring person those shares do not become permanent non voting shares the acquiring person is free to sell its shares to others if the buyers of those shares themselves do not acquire a con

article 3 months old feature stories dec 02 2021 the emergence of omicron has sent markets and government into a potentially overwrought panic but until we know more about the new variant the outlook is clouded global economic outlook was solid ahead of omicron transmissibility and vaccine effectiveness as yet unknown until then economists remain more optimistic than pessimistic australia relatively well placed by greg peel in fnarena s last update on equity strategy into the headwinds link below the consensus among economists and analysts was that economies would continue to grow in 2022 but at a slower pace than in 2021 high inflation would last for longer than first thought but would start to ease at least by the latter half of the year delta would ease as vaccinations rates continued to grow government fiscal stimulus of the direct hand out variety would cease and central banks would shift into policy tightening through rate hikes some sooner some later corporate earnings growth rates would slow but the outlook for equities would remain positive overall one caveat to the above was of course unless another new deadly strain of covid appeared delta not done with before the sudden announcement of a new variant last friday and the swiftest time yet for who to officially declare it a virus of concern the expectation of delta risk easing was already being tested as the northern hemisphere moves towards winter before omicron europe was entering its fourth covid wave the case count in germany has reached to a level 217 higher than the prior january peak as the more infectious delta muscled out prior strains even in the netherlands where the percentage of fully vaccinated exceeds the european average the case count has surged and partial lockdowns have been instigated the good news is german hospitalisations are only running at 40 of the prior peak notes wilsons stockbroking of those european countries seeing higher case counts than the prior peak hospitalisations average 35 of those where the case count is lower hospitalisations are only 19 hospitalisation numbers are what really count in terms of economic impact rather than case numbers per se while delta has brought about yet more deaths incidences of mild symptoms or asymptomatic cases have been greater the uk has been an interesting case study wilsons suggests as while the country has been dealing with elevated case numbers for some time hospitalisations are only 22 of the prior january peak and the death rate 12 the us is also experiencing a rise in case numbers once more but for financial markets inflation and monetary policy have been the far more influential focal points australia is in better relative shape wilsons declares given a higher vaccination rate than europe or the us a booster program now underway and the fact we re heading into summer not winter but wilsons was writing before omicron variant of concern omicron is the fifth covid variant officially classified as a variant of concern by who following on from the original wuhan strain we saw alpha appearing in the uk beta in south africa and gamma in south america delta emerged out of india and overrode all previous strains delta proved to be more infectious given the pace of spread of omicron in just a matter of days the fear is omicron is more so omicron was actually first detected in botswana on november 9 it was not until november 24 the south africans confirmed it was a new strain and alerted who two days later who named it a variant of concern much faster than any earlier variant omicron has spread faster across southern africa than delta and the percentage of omicron in case counts is rising exponentially at the time of writing omicron has been detected in 20 countries including australia and the us this suggests omicron is more infectious than delta and will push delta aside the question is as to whether omicron is more virulent leading to an increase in hospitalisation death rates evidence from south africa is it is infecting younger rather than older people and symptoms are milder than delta both cases reported in nsw to date have been asymptomatic and young as older people are more vulnerable this could be good news except that south africa has a very young average age compared to western countries so the jury s still out we will have to wait at least two weeks if not longer to ascertain whether current vaccines are equally effective against omicron less effective or not effective if a new vaccine is required it is not expected to be ready before february and the world will need to go back into months long rollouts it is nevertheless believed that antiviral treatments which lesson the symptoms of covid and thus hospitalisation death risk such as those produced by merck and pfizer will be effective furthermore existing covid testing is successfully detecting omicron ord minnett points out that in australia s case action to close the border to southern africa and for states to shut borders again has been much swifter this time around than the delta response the same is true in many countries but while not enough is yet known renewed lockdowns cannot be ruled out it will be a tough call for premiers already facing restriction backlashes and having already paid the economic price of prior lockdowns living with covid remains the current mantra based on 90 vaccination rates but living with omicron might be a whole new decision central banks have since covid arrived ensured they would step in with further supportive policy measures if required which makes fed chair jerome powell s talk this week about speeding up tapering all the more untimely the impact understanding transmissibility is the biggest factor in determining the level of concern for omicron suggests morgan stanley if it outcompetes delta than the level of concern should be very high if it does not omicron will create limited disruption the broker s new base case is now one of a variant that rapidly replaces delta increases infection rates and reduces vaccine effectiveness however there is a modest but real possibility the outcome is less severe to that end morgan stanley suggests for now omicron is expected to have a limited impact on the broker s global growth forecasts they are that global growth will remain above trend inflation is mostly transitory and central banks will raise rates at a much slower pace than the market is currently pricing writing before the fed upped the ante the broker notes four main influences on inflation of which three will prove transitory in its view current wage inflation has been driven by people choosing not to work due to government handouts with these ending and lockdowns ending morgan stanley expects individuals to return to the workforce and the pressure to fill employment positions will ease thus easing wage inflation the same payments have also sparked a rush to buy goods for example since april 2020 furniture prices in the us have risen 30 and used car prices 40 with mobility returning to society households are shifting their consumption back to services morgan stanley notes including movies restaurant meals and other general experiences they had been locked out of this shift should alleviate pressure on supply chains and the inflation they are driving commodity prices have risen sharply since last year s recession as supply has been unable to keep up morgan stanley believes most commodities will likely move back into oversupply in 2022 leading to price falls and lower inflation the exception is iron ore which the broker believes has likely bottomed the other exception and the exception to inflation being transitory is energy prices the energy sector is now positioning for a net zero future and spending serious money to do so these funds are being diverted away from investment in fossil fuels long before fossil fuel demand subsides in short the world is simply not ready yet morgan stanley cites the example of the world s greenest country in terms of electric vehicle take up ev demand in norway now accounts for 70 of new car sales yet demand for petrol and diesel has remained flat for the past five years amidst all the hype currently surrounding evs especially on stock markets there is never any mention of the obvious no one has yet proposed an electric airliner or cargo ship morgan stanley believes oil supply will peak ahead of oil demand putting upward pressure on prices i e inflation but the broker also points out that inflation measures such as cpi are rate of change measures hence while a 40 jump in us used car prices has had a big impact on current inflation for that inflation rate to be maintained used car prices will have to jump another 40 even if they only flatten at high levels the ongoing inflation rate impact is zero hence inflation is transitory and hence morgan stanley believes central banks will raise rates at a slower pace than markets are currently predicting thus the global economy will continue to grow at an above trend pace for the foreseeable future business investment in the us the broker notes and in the larger emerging markets of brazil russia and india has led to the fastest cyclical recovery since the war with a focus on manufacturing machinery and it equipment and software despite government handouts ending consumer savings rates in developed economies remain significantly excessive supporting ongoing robust consumption and the us is not the only country planning to spend up big on infrastructure of course all of the above is predicated on omicron transmissibility which if proven more transmissible than delta could lead to further lockdowns in asia morgan stanley notes the world s manufacturing hub while china is trigger happy when it comes to lockdowns taiwan is also sticking to a zero covid policy and it is the world s leading producer of the computer chips used these days in just about everything chip shortages have been the biggest factor in the general supply shortages that have been driving inflation feelin alright if economists and analysts agree on anything which is rare they all agree that when it comes to omicron we just don t know yet they also agree australia is doing rather well in the context despite gravest fears the australian economy s swift rebound out of the original 2020 lockdowns caught all and sundry by surprise hence economists and analysts were sanguine about this year s delta lockdowns and again up till now anyway the rebound has been swift australia has one of the world s highest vaccination rates assuming that helps and one of the world s lowest delta case rates the federal government had planned to reopen the international border to foreign students and skilled migrants from december 1 morgan stanley notes that before covid net migration contributed about half of australia s long term economic trend growth that date has now been pushed out two weeks due to omicron so again we can only wait another positive for australia and for the global economy is that beijing s economic policies are now shifting back to supportive rather than restrictive as the government weighs up the fallout from environmental restrictions power shortages shut down production and a potential property market collapse china was posing the global economy s biggest threat as it was forced to slow down but monetary injections and policy shift should reduce that threat in 2022 equity strategy into the

washington progressive democrats on the house financial services committee urged top financial policymakers wednesday to be more aggressive in combating risks from climate change the biden administration and federal reserve have already taken heat from republicans for recommendations and research on mitigating the impact of global warming on financial institutions but at a hearing with treasury secretary janet yellen and fed chair jerome powell some lawmakers suggested the recent moves are not enough rep rashida tlaib d mich questioned powell over whether the fed will join upcoming guidance written office of the comptroller of the currency on how large banks should factor climate change into risk management acting comptroller of the currency michael hsu has announced that the occ plans to issue supervisory guidance on climate risk by the end of the year does the fed intend to join this guidance tlaib said powell responded that while the fed was in discussions with the occ and the agencies would prefer to issue uniform policies the central bank would likely decline the biden administration and federal reserve have already taken heat from republicans for recommendations and research on mitigating the impact of global warming on financial institutions but at a hearing with fed chair jerome powell and treasury secretary janet yellen some lawmakers suggested the recent moves are not enough bloomberg news i don t think we ll actually be in a position to join this specific guidance at this time but we ll get there powell said tlaib similarly asked whether the fed will follow the occ s lead in conducting climate risk assessments during 2022 examinations of large banks to which powell responded we re already deep into dialogue and again particularly with the largest financial institutions that s really where a lot of the work is going on right now on behalf of my residents i hope dialogue turns into guidance and accountability tlaib said meanwhile rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y said a much anticipated report recently issued by the financial stability oversight council on climate risk in the financial system was a missed opportunity to date regulators have focused somewhat narrowly on assessing how severe weather events and changing consumer behavior resulting from a warming planet could roil financial markets but progressives such as ocasio cortez have advocated a more direct approach of using the financial system to reduce the carbon footprint she suggested the report could have discussed ways financial companies can help nations prevent the planet from heating up by more than than 1 5 degrees celsius in the coming years a key threshold identified by scientists i was disappointed to see that the report which is intended to serve as a blueprint for federal regulators makes no mention of any timelines or policies needed to stay within that 1 5 degrees celsius target ocasio cortez said yellen defended the report by emphasizing that the fsoc s mission was to identify threats to financial stability of the united states and to coordinate across regulatory agencies to make sure that they re addressed she also pointed to the very substantial policies contained within the build back better act a legislative package she advocated for throughout wednesday s hearing to address climate change some republicans meanwhile were keenly focused on whether the policies under consideration from the biden administration would impact the ability of fossil fuel firms and other energy companies to receive financial services when the majority can t pass a bill to outlaw certain forms of energy and they can t pass a bill to tax it to death the route they re going to take is to use regulatory policy to strangle the capital available to those industries said rep frank lucas r okla is it the intention of the regulators to create standards such that banks cannot support any particular energy industry that may ask for capital that may justify a loan in response yellen pointed to the fsoc s statutory responsibility to focus on financial stability and the federal reserve s focus on banks safety and soundness that means making sure they hold adequate capital she said
