queensbury the statue of which literary character stands outside the london underground baker street station was one of the questions asked during this year s post star academic bowl hosted by queensbury high school it took a 14 year old student of the jv south glens falls team 4 seconds to ring the buzzer to answer the question correctly sherlock holmes she said but it was the saratoga springs team that emerged as this year s victor after defeating south glens falls in the final round the 34th year of the competition featured 16 teams from 14 schools in the region with some of the schools dividing into two teams the school teams are asked a wide range of challenging questions on just about every subject joe laboda has been involved in the student academic trivia event for over 30 years and writes many of the questions he is no stranger to pop trivia in 1990 laboda won on jeopardy twice and appeared on the show three times laboda and the commissioner of the academic bowl pattye nicolls are two key figures involved in creating a generation of very bright students from the region we re like a big family we all know each other very well i ve been doing this for 20 years a lot of them involved have been working together for at least that long nicolls said during the first round we do bracketed tournaments so the number one team played the number eight team and that team lost by pretty much one question it s one of the things the matches can be very close nicolls said that number eight team minerva came very close to beating the number one team south high nicolls said although it happened way before any of you were born we hope you can recall some of the important events of the 20th century laboda asked the students in the semifinal round between south glens falls and warrensburg a bonus round of four to five questions challenged the students on a number of significant historical events such as the stock market crash which caused the great depression and the assassination of john f kennedy the south high jv team answered them all correctly south high ended up beating warrensburg and rocketed into the finals to face off national qualifiers saratoga springs the organizers of the event had to put the young south high team against varsity teams because they slaughtered the kids their age nicolls said saratoga springs beat hudson falls in the semifinals to face south high in the final round with only 10 questions left the two finalists were still neck to neck with each other it was a close match said one of the three coaches for south high michael davies saratoga springs ended up winning the tournament by only seven questions i now know how atlas felt when he got the weight of the world off his shoulders one of saratoga students said even this remark meant as a joke was steeped in an appreciation for knowledge and intellectual curiosity shared by many if not all of the students who competed in the annual event nicolls commented that the sportsmanship this year was the best it s ever been the kids who got eliminated were still pleasant happy and supportive of one another she said many of the students who compete are not athletic so this gives them an opportunity to thrive nicolls added while the saratoga springs students were exuberant and relieved after winning the competition they were nonetheless humble and reflective i think the nature of the competition is to be mentally present but when the opposing team gets a string of questions right it can be very demoralizing it can throw you off a student said both south high and saratoga springs will be flying to either chicago or new orleans to compete with other schools in the country the nationals have traditionally been held in washington d c in 2006 nicolls coached the glens falls team and qualified for the nationals where they won five of the seven matches national teams are guaranteed six matches and if a team wins at least four matches they move on to the finals when glens falls competed in 2006 the team won five of the seven matches we flew out of albany to washington at 6 a m getting the kids up for the flight was a challenge in itself nicolls said this year s nationals will take place late may early june

after years of very low interest rates a change is coming the federal reserve is raising rates borrowing will get costlier for everything from mortgages to car loans to credit cards for many americans that will be a bitter pill but there are some silver linings here s what you can do in response it s going to get even harder to buy your first house for now when you re buying something as pricey as a home interest rates really matter they have already jumped sharply in anticipation of the fed s highly signaled plan to raise rates through the year since last summer mortgage rates have risen more than a full percentage point to above 4 on a 30 year fixed rate loan it starts to push it from like we could maybe make it work to the point where you re just like it s not worth it says zach gubran of fort collins colorado gubran 33 and his partner would like to settle down and buy a place of their own but he says that in this frenzied housing market that was already tough and now on a 450 000 loan the jump in rates to above 4 pushes the monthly payment up by 325 it s like this ridiculous situation says gubran who works as a contractor for a software company i have tens of thousands of dollars in savings and it feels like it s nothing it doesn t matter but it s not all despair rising rates could stop the runaway train of higher home prices home prices in the u s last year rose nearly 20 that is a staggering one year gain with a historic shortageof homes for sale and superlow interest rates bidding wars regularly broke out and drove prices ever higher in recent years big price gains like that pulled in more buyers who didn t want to miss out which juiced up demand even more in the overheated market higher mortgage rates may be helpful in cooling the housing market says selma hepp an economist with corelogic that may help bring us back more to some level of normality and in that case we won t see so much bidding over the asking price don t expect home prices to tumble but hepp thinks this year they ll rise much less around 3 a few years like that could give builders time to catch up with demand and build more homes ugh monthly payments on home equity lines of credit will go up ninety percent of homeowners have fixed rate mortgages that s the good news they re protected against rising rates but millions of americans have borrowed against their homes collectively they owe about 300 billion on home equity lines of credit helocs almost all of those have variable rates your rate is going to go up says kate wood who follows home loans for nerdwallet a home equity line of credit these are really really really closely tied to the kinds of moves that the federal reserve is making but wood says that since those rates adjust following moves by the fed more so than home mortgages do and since the fed has only just started to nudge rates higher you still have at least a little time to look at your options some banks will let you take the money you owe on your line of credit and lock that into a fixed interest rate it s worth reaching out proactively to your lender about that she says think about it this is something that is potentially saving you money your lender is maybe not you know sending you mailers and calling you up to let you know about this great option with your heloc savers will get a better return from bank cds for retirees and other people who have considerable savings that they might have to spend say a year or two from now bank cds for generations have been a go to option you don t have to worry about the stock market crashing because you get all your money back plus some interest the problem is that in recent years certificates of deposit have returned almost nothing but now with rates rising we should start to see banks offering at least slightly higher rates on cds especially as the year goes on and the fed keeps nudging rates higher there s more car loans installment loans and credit cards most types of consumer debt including auto loans are likely to see rates rise over the coming year car prices have been especially high during the coronavirus pandemic so for car loans it may be tempting for many people to take out a longer term seven year loan to lower their monthly payment but financial advisers say three year or five year loans are a much better way to go and they warn against those seven year car loans you end up paying a lot more interest and cars drop in value as time goes by so a few years down the road if you need a different car you can end up still owing 5 000 or 10 000 more than your car is worth but some people will trade in their old car anyway and the balance on the loan is transferred to the new loan which is crazy says miguel gomez a certified financial planner in el paso texas now all of a sudden you re buying another 30 000 car but you re owing 40 000 from the start which is a cycle that it s very difficult to get out of credit card debt is also a cycle that s tough to quit and with already high interest rates on credit cards headed even higher now is a good time to try to pay off those credit cards if you feel trapped credit counseling can really make a difference says gomez he points to the national foundation for credit counseling a proven nonprofit that can help clients get out of debt and he says there s also a good technique you can try at home take your credit cards put them in a ziploc bag he says then put that in a tupperware container full of water put it in the freezer and forget about them that way if you really need your credit cards you still have them but with your cards on ice it definitely cuts down on the impulse purchases copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

reuters file photo the logo of kyivstar one of ukraine s largest telecoms company is pictured at the company s headquarters in kyiv ukraine march 3 2016 reuters gleb garanich file photo by supantha mukherjee and toby sterling stockholm amsterdam reuters thousands of telecom operator veon employees are working from bomb shelters in ukraine and moving equipment to border areas to maintain a digital lifeline for refugees fleeing the war the company s chief executive said on friday their work has helped some 85 of veon s telecom network remain operational in ukraine since russia s feb 24 invasion veon ceo kaan terzioglu said in an exclusive interview with reuters but further risks loom both from electricity shortages and the conflict itself amsterdam listed veon operates ukraine s largest cell phone provider under the name kyivstar with 4 000 employees and a 25 market share terzioglu who spoke by zoom conference call from the netherlands described how the company is coping with war sanctions and financial concerns at the same time terzioglu provided a lens through which one company is providing a phone network to a rapidly spreading diaspora employees are practically working out of shelters and the moment they have the opportunity they go out to the field to do maintenance terzioglu said the parts of the network which are not working were mostly because of loss of power and are not being targeted by russian forces he said getting these parts back up required workers to run gasoline to generators which terioglu described as one of the most logistically heavy jobs that our people are trying to do russia s attack which moscow calls a special operation to demilitarize the country has killed hundreds of civilians reduced city areas to rubble and sparked a humanitarian crisis russia denies targeting civilians in the country of about 44 million more than 3 2 million people have fled and an additional 2 million have been displaced internally united nations data showed on the basis of cell phone data terzioglu estimated that 4 million refugees had left and 10 million were displaced apart from opening up its offices as refugee shelters veon has also topped up mobile accounts without charge said terzioglu who became veon s group ceo last july in his previous job as turkcell ceo he grappled with the syrian refugee crisis veon has also received support from american chinese and european companies in the tech and telecom industry while operators such as orange tele2 and vodafone nasdaq have waived off interconnection and roaming charges equipment makers such as huawei and zte hk have been helping in network maintenance these and companies including ericsson bs nokia nyse microsoft corp nasdaq and oracle corp nyse have made a heroic effort to keep the networks running terzioglu said russian connection veon also owns the second largest telecom network in russia operating under the name of beeline its most profitable market that means veon must navigate the impact of sanctions and political concerns on both sides of the border veon has about 29 000 employees in russia and the company has taken steps to operate its ukraine and russian businesses as separate from one another the company has also moved quickly to distance itself from russian oligarch mikhail fridman whose investment vehicle letterone holds a 47 9 stake in veon and an additional 8 3 economic stake through a dutch foundation the european union imposed sanctions on fridman on feb 28 a decision he said he would fight terzioglu said fridman who resigned from veon s board feb 28 and letterone s board on march 3 now has no economic interest in letterone letterone which did not respond to a request for comment said march 3 that fridman s assets had been frozen and he had been stripped of shareholder rights terzioglu said he could not speculate as to whether the company could eventually face eu sanctions or nationalization by the russian government but he hoped that it would be excluded on humanitarian grounds we will do our best to position it as a service that is essential he said veon also faces financial worries with its shares down 56 in the year to date and its us dollar denominated debt 5 4 billion worth at the end of 2021 trading at distressed levels on march 4 fitch downgraded the company s credit ratings to junk status saying that together russia and ukraine accounted for 62 of 2021 earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda of 3 3 billion russian capital controls and the war meant the company may not be able to move funds in or out of either country the company has issued several updates to reassure investors it remains liquid with 2 1 billion in cash as of the end of february of which 1 5 billion is in the

after years of very low interest rates a change is coming the federal reserve is raising rates borrowing will get costlier for everything from mortgages to car loans to credit cards for many americans that will be a bitter pill but there are some silver linings here s what you can do in response it s going to get even harder to buy your first house for now when you re buying something as pricey as a home interest rates really matter they have already jumped sharply in anticipation of the fed s highly signaled plan to raise rates through the year since last summer mortgage rates have risen more than a full percentage point to above 4 on a 30 year fixed rate loan it starts to push it from like we could maybe make it work to the point where you re just like it s not worth it says zach gubran of fort collins colorado gubran 33 and his partner would like to settle down and buy a place of their own but he says that in this frenzied housing market that was already tough and now on a 450 000 loan the jump in rates to above 4 pushes the monthly payment up by 325 it s like this ridiculous situation says gubran who works as a contractor for a software company i have tens of thousands of dollars in savings and it feels like it s nothing it doesn t matter but it s not all despair rising rates could stop the runaway train of higher home prices home prices in the u s last year rose nearly 20 that is a staggering one year gain with a historic shortageof homes for sale and superlow interest rates bidding wars regularly broke out and drove prices ever higher in recent years big price gains like that pulled in more buyers who didn t want to miss out which juiced up demand even more in the overheated market higher mortgage rates may be helpful in cooling the housing market says selma hepp an economist with corelogic that may help bring us back more to some level of normality and in that case we won t see so much bidding over the asking price don t expect home prices to tumble but hepp thinks this year they ll rise much less around 3 a few years like that could give builders time to catch up with demand and build more homes ugh monthly payments on home equity lines of credit will go up ninety percent of homeowners have fixed rate mortgages that s the good news they re protected against rising rates but millions of americans have borrowed against their homes collectively they owe about 300 billion on home equity lines of credit helocs almost all of those have variable rates your rate is going to go up says kate wood who follows home loans for nerdwallet a home equity line of credit these are really really really closely tied to the kinds of moves that the federal reserve is making but wood says that since those rates adjust following moves by the fed more so than home mortgages do and since the fed has only just started to nudge rates higher you still have at least a little time to look at your options some banks will let you take the money you owe on your line of credit and lock that into a fixed interest rate it s worth reaching out proactively to your lender about that she says think about it this is something that is potentially saving you money your lender is maybe not you know sending you mailers and calling you up to let you know about this great option with your heloc savers will get a better return from bank cds for retirees and other people who have considerable savings that they might have to spend say a year or two from now bank cds for generations have been a go to option you don t have to worry about the stock market crashing because you get all your money back plus some interest the problem is that in recent years certificates of deposit have returned almost nothing but now with rates rising we should start to see banks offering at least slightly higher rates on cds especially as the year goes on and the fed keeps nudging rates higher there s more car loans installment loans and credit cards most types of consumer debt including auto loans are likely to see rates rise over the coming year car prices have been especially high during the coronavirus pandemic so for car loans it may be tempting for many people to take out a longer term seven year loan to lower their monthly payment but financial advisers say three year or five year loans are a much better way to go and they warn against those seven year car loans you end up paying a lot more interest and cars drop in value as time goes by so a few years down the road if you need a different car you can end up still owing 5 000 or 10 000 more than your car is worth but some people will trade in their old car anyway and the balance on the loan is transferred to the new loan which is crazy says miguel gomez a certified financial planner in el paso texas now all of a sudden you re buying another 30 000 car but you re owing 40 000 from the start which is a cycle that it s very difficult to get out of credit card debt is also a cycle that s tough to quit and with already high interest rates on credit cards headed even higher now is a good time to try to pay off those credit cards if you feel trapped credit counseling can really make a difference says gomez he points to the national foundation for credit counseling a proven nonprofit that can help clients get out of debt and he says there s also a good technique you can try at home take your credit cards put them in a ziploc bag he says then put that in a tupperware container full of water put it in the freezer and forget about them that way if you really need your credit cards you still have them but with your cards on ice it definitely cuts down on the impulse purchases copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

you money your lender is maybe not you know sending you mailers and calling you up to let you know about this great option with your heloc savers will get a better return from bank cds for retirees and other people who have considerable savings that they might have to spend say a year or two from now bank cds for generations have been a go to option you don t have to worry about the stock market crashing because you get all your money back plus some interest the problem is that in recent years certificates of deposit have returned almost nothing but now with rates rising we should start to see banks offering at least slightly higher rates on cds especially as the year goes on and the fed keeps nudging rates higher there s more car loans installment loans and credit cards most types of consumer debt including auto loans are likely to see rates rise over the coming year car prices have been especially high during the coronavirus pandemic so for car loans it may be tempting for many people to take out a longer term seven year loan to lower their monthly payment but financial advisers say three year or five year loans are a much better way to go and they warn against those seven year car loans you end up paying a lot more interest and cars drop in value as time goes by so a few years down the road if you need a different car you can end up still owing 5 000 or 10 000 more than your car is worth but some people will trade in their old car anyway and the balance on the loan is transferred to the new loan which is crazy says miguel gomez a certified financial planner in el paso texas now all of a sudden you re buying another 30 000 car but you re owing 40 000 from the start which is a cycle that it s very difficult to get out of credit card debt is also a cycle that s tough to quit and with already high interest rates on credit cards headed even higher now is a good time to try to pay off those credit cards if you feel trapped credit counseling can really make a difference says gomez he points to the national foundation for credit counseling a proven nonprofit that can help clients get out of debt and he says there s also a good technique you can try at home take your credit cards put them in a ziploc bag he says then put that in a tupperware container full of water put it in the freezer and forget about them that way if you really need your credit cards you still have them but with your cards on ice it definitely cuts down on the impulse purchases copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

salmon release in hangman creek a great thing for coeur d alene tribe at one of the only remaining undeveloped slices of land in spokane the coeur d alene tribe has started to heal from nearly a century without salmon in nearby waters with a gentle splash tribal members poured around 530 finger sized summer chinook salmon a few at a time into hangman creek this release could be one of the first steps in healing the coeur d alene tribe said hemene james a council member with the tribe we weren t farmers we relied on the salmon to sustain us our bodies our minds and our spirits for tens of thousands of years james said it s only been a hundred years or so since we were those people in 1910 the construction of little falls dam blocked fish from reaching habitat on the spokane river what james called giant walls continued with the construction of grand coulee dam in 1942 the dam cut the upper columbia river tribes off from the salmon however the upper columbia tribes have started a decades long plan they hope will one day re establish salmon above chief joseph and grand coulee dams we are starting one of the largest opportunities to recover salmon in the columbia river basin we re talking about thousands of miles of stream and river habitats that can support salmon production said tom biladeau a biologist with the coeur d alene tribe these salmon released at hangman creek will provide some of the initial information biologists need to figure out how salmon will one day survive in the blocked areas of the fish that were released researchers implanted 80 fish with acoustic tags that are slightly larger than a grain of rice the tags will ping at each dam the salmon pass helping researchers track the downstream journey of the fish it took the tribe around 18 months to rear these salmon which were spawned from adults at entiat national fish hatchery and grown at the reservation in plummer idaho biladeau said eventually the tribe would like to establish a hatchery at this release site in spokane part of the tribe s aboriginal land said caj matheson natural resource director with the tribe the tribe acquired the 48 acre pilcher property in 2021 so that it wouldn t be developed into a housing project the first five dams the salmon will encounter don t have any type of fish passage system in place that means the salmon released into hangman creek will swim over the tops of three dams or through the dams turbines on their journey down the spokane river in the first 24 hours the salmon should make it past nine mile dam the first dam on the spokane river roughly 25 miles from the release site biladeau said then they ll eventually have to make it through grand coulee dam where more than 95 percent of the salmon will most likely head downstream through turbines he said the coeur d alene tribe releases salmon into hangman creek swimming through the turbines won t lead to a high survival rate biladeau said turbine blades can strike fish fish also can face swift pressure changes which lead to something like the bends human divers can get when they surface too quickly in addition water shear can injure fish when waterways of two different speeds come together i m sure fish survival will tell us that that s what s happening biladeau said of the likely number of deaths salmon will face heading downstream planning for safety in numbers the tribe scheduled multiple salmon releases downstream of each dam to increase the chances that more of the tagged fish reach the mainstem of the columbia biladeau said rather than putting all our eggs in one basket and releasing them all here we want to make sure that there s fish available to get us data as we progressively move downstream biladeau said researchers will continue to study the data from tagged fish which they hope will show them how to eventually restore salmon in the upper columbia in phase 1 researchers identified potential habitats for salmon in phase 2 researchers will begin to test the success of each habitat biladeau said this release marked the first step in phase 2 of the decades long process at the release a dozen people lined up along a steep rocky embankment they passed buckets holding just a few young salmon to people waiting in the reeds near the rushing water at the edge of the creek vince peone a cultural preservation technician with the tribe helped people pour salmon into the water while peone may not see salmon in great numbers in this creek he s hopeful future generations will benefit from this release right now peone said he has to travel two to three hours to fish for salmon relying on salmon tags he has to buy to help stock his freezer for the winter he said he hoped that wouldn t always be the case

even as this winter s omicron surge recedes more than 2 000 people in the u s still get hospitalized with covid 19 each day this population is largely unvaccinated with medical conditions that increase their risks some of these hospitalizations could have been prevented with early covid treatments such as pills and monoclonal antibodies purchased and distributed for free by the government but data on covid treatment utilization shared with npr by the u s department of health and human services indicates that millions of covid treatments are sitting on shelves unused we are still in a public health emergency said dr derek eisnor who leads the government s distribution of covid drugs on a call with national health organizations on march 16 he urged health leaders to try to get the drugs to communities that have a demand for them rather than let them go to waste there s an assumption that there s not enough of around but it does seem when you look at the numbers that there is a lot around it s just not being used says dr amesh adalja an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at the johns hopkins center for health security they clearly are not getting to people at high enough rates to have their maximum impact loading currently the federal government distributes four outpatient covid treatments that can help stop the progression of covid infections if taken within five to seven days of symptom onset and one prevention therapy for immunocompromised people state health departments and certain providers can order these drugs and they are now available at pharmacies infusion centers and health clinics across the country but states and health care providers report that less than half of the supply of treatments that they ve ordered starting october 2021 has been used health experts initially expected the drugs to fly off the shelves i thought would be much higher says dr phyllis tien an infectious disease physician at university of california san francisco who serves on the nih covid 19 treatment guidelines panel at first doctors were prioritizing who would get them she says to help preserve access for those with the greatest medical need the reported utilization rates may underestimate the total doses used sites are supposed to report daily or weekly usage numbers to the government but not all do still the rates are used by the government to make decisions on distribution policies and tien says they track with what she s seeing on the ground when a patient comes to us and they re covid positive and they have some mild symptoms we offer them some of these drugs if they fit the criteria she says but some of them don t want to take the drugs others may want the drug but they re out of the window in terms of getting access to it unused drugs are at risk of being thrown out the use rates vary by product according to the data collected by hhs two treatment options recommended as alternative therapies only when other options are not available have the lowest usage rates bebtelovimab is a monoclonal antibody injection authorized last month with insufficient data on key outcomes according to nih treatment guidelines just 2 of the amount ordered by providers has been used according to the hhs data the other with very low utilization is molnupiravir a pill course typically recommended only when other more effective options are not viable just 14 of the doses sent out have been used evusheld a preventive shot of monoclonal antibodies that helps protect immunocompromised people from infection is not widely used just 54 of the 848 000 doses available have been sent out and just a quarter of those ordered have been used even the most highly recommended treatments are going unused hundreds of thousands of doses of sotrovimab are sitting in refrigerated storage this monoclonal antibody infusion treatment is nearly 80 effective at preventing hospitalization from covid 19 for high risk people likewise hundreds of thousands of courses of paxlovid a highly effective pill that cuts the risk of getting hospitalized with covid by nearly 90 are gathering dust on pharmacy shelves for both these treatments less than half of the distributed courses have been reported as used hhs s eisnor speaking to health care providers in mid march said he was troubled by reports that some pharmacies had asked if they could trash their remaining supplies of unexpired covid pills we ask that you utilize any and all resources to facilitate maybe moving product outside to a neighboring state or jurisdiction or territory if they have a need he said what s keeping people from using the drugs these drugs are currently prioritized for people at high risk of covid 19 though sites and providers have discretion on who qualifies given the ready supply and low utilization rates tien says it may be time to expand the drug s availability to people at lower risk who could still benefit from the drug i had a situation last week where a young person who got covid called their physician for paxlovid and was denied says tien the patient had a risk factor for covid but their doctor did not think they qualified for the drug based on age and vaccination status there are some people who want it and are being turned away and then there are others who perfectly fit the criteria and don t want it tien observes health experts point to a litany of other factors that contribute to low covid treatments utilization there is a lack of awareness from providers says adalja and challenges in understanding how to use them appropriately the covid pills must be given within five days of symptom onset and can be complicated to prescribe for instance paxlovid can interfere with commonly taken medications and molnupiravir is not recommended for patients who are pregnant or trying to conceive then it can be hard to know which pharmacies have the pills in stock or which infusion clinics have appointments available a patient needs to be able to quickly find a clinician get a diagnosis and prescription and be able to access the treatment all within a few days it s multifactorial why these drugs are underutilized adalja says it s likely all of those things are playing some role in the discrepancies between what s been ordered and and what s actually been administered the biden administration launched the test to treat initiative this month to address these gaps we know the challenges that are involved with patients obtaining therapeutics said dr meg sullivan acting chief medical officer for hhs office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response in a call with clinicians on march 12 the program aims to improve access to rapid testing and to bolster public and provider awareness of available covid treatments and how to get them but the administration says their ability to support a continued pipeline of covid drugs may soon be hindered by a lack of congressional funding senior administration officials told reporters march 15 that they may run out of monoclonal antibody treatments by may and evusheld by summer since these therapies are currently authorized only for emergency use they re not available on the commercial market and the government is the sole buyer says adalja it also means they can t be advertised by drug companies which likely contributes to the lack of awareness of these treatments from providers and the public it s a bad situation when these drugs are going left unused when we have people hospitalized and dying from covid says adalja but he doesn t find it surprising given that lifesaving covid vaccines are also expiring on pharmacy shelves and getting tossed every day it s the way this pandemic has gone he says a lot of the medical

investorplace stock market news stock advice trading tips for investors looking at cryptos to buy for the medium to long term this is possibly one of the best times in the last few months there have been positive developments for cryptocurrencies from a regulatory perspective india which has the largest number of crypto holders in the world announced a crypto tax of 30 this effectively legalizes crypto trading and investing in the country recently joe biden also signed an executive order on crypto and it calls for responsible innovation the united states is also looking at the digital version of the dollar in another positive development members of european parliament also voted against the ban on bitcoin btc usd with time it seems that countries are focused on regulating cryptocurrencies rather than an outright ban this is positive news for crypto holders and as adoption increases quality coins or tokens will trend higher in the near term bitcoin has been struggling around 40 000 i believe that this is a good opportunity to consider exposure to some quality cryptocurrencies factors such as inflation and geo political tensions are also likely to be positive for cryptocurrencies this column will talk about seven cryptos to buy with focus on quality projects that can be considered for the long term here they are bitcoin dogecoin doge usd binance coin bnb usd bogged finance bog usd zignaly zig usd pancakeswap cake usd torum xtm usd cryptos to buy bitcoin btc usd source shutterstock bitcoin has struggled to cross 40 000 in the recent past however for investors bullish on cryptocurrencies bitcoin is a must hold in the portfolio if altcoins are like growth stocks bitcoin is a blue chip stock if the regulatory headwinds wane bitcoin is likely to trend higher with multiple catalysts first cryptocurrencies are positioned for wider adoption bitcoin with a limited supply of 21 million will benefit as holders increase furthermore inflation is a concern globally hard assets with limited supply tend to perform well in times of inflation in the coming years bitcoin is likely to be among the top inflation hedges it s also worth noting that data from coinbase nasdaq coin indicates that institutional adoption of bitcoin has been accelerating this is another positive catalyst for the cryptocurrency overall bitcoin has been among the top performing asset classes in the last decade with the cryptocurrency still in a price discovery stage i would bet on healthy returns from the crypto in the coming years positive news on the regulatory front will support the next phase of the rally dogecoin doge usd source wollertz shutterstock dogecoin currently trades nearly 85 lower as compared to highs of nearly 74 cents in may 2021 that was a phase of euphoria and i don t expect the meme coin to be trading at those levels again however there is no doubt that the coin is oversold i would not be surprised if there is a 30 to 40 rally from current levels of 11 6 cents especially if the overall sentiments for cryptocurrencies turns bullish recently elon musk reiterated that he continues to hold dogecoin in january 2022 musk had announced that the meme coin can be used to purchase selected tesla merchandise last month musk also announced that the coin will be accepted at tesla s nasdaq tsla supercharging station that s a source of support for the big meme coin community with a low transaction cost as compared to bitcoin more companies are likely to use dogecoin as a payment method among meme coins i would prefer holding dogecoin over shiba inu shib usd the former has a bigger community support and is a pure digital currency shiba inu on the other hand has been trying to create a wider ecosystem with entry into decentralized exchange and nfts i don t see diversification helping in terms of wider adoption or upside for shiba inu there are quality projects that are pure play in decentralized exchange cryptos to buy binance coin bnb source shutterstock after making highs of nearly 691 in may 2021 bnb coin has witnessed a sharp correction that s in sync with the broad markets however considering the business developments i would not be surprised if bnb coin re tests previous highs in 2022 binance needs no introduction with the project being the top centralized exchange in the world in the recent past binance has been in news with crypto license wins from dubai and bahrain the crypto license provides clarity from a regulatory perspective areije al shakar vice president at bahrain development bank believes that cryptocurrency adoption is likely to accelerate in the middle east in 2022 it s likely that binance will continue to expand further in the region from the perspective of trading volumes it s likely that binance will continue to benefit with wider cryptocurrency adoption india has the highest number of crypto holders in the world binance has presence in the country with stake in wazirx wrx usd in december 2021 binance also acquired outstanding shares in swipe the latter is a leading cryptocurrency visa card issuing platform clearly binance seems to be spreading its wings through acquisitions overall bnb coin is among the top cryptos to buy and hold for the long term bogged finance bog source shutterstock among the smaller projects bogged finance looks attractive with significant project developments in the last few months the bog token is lower by 67 from all time highs of 2 15 altcoins have witnessed a sharp correction and i believe that this is a good accumulation opportunity as an overview bogged finance is a dex aggregator that s already present across ten chains using bogged finance investors can place limit and stop loss orders on decentralized exchanges the project is also providing cross chain bridge between binance smart chain avalanche avax usd and fantom ftm usd besides the project features another reason to like bogged finance is the token economics there are currently 14 million bog tokens in circulation the limited supply and the token utility is likely to translate into a sharp upside when bullish sentiments are back for altcoins revenue sharing is another interesting part of bogged finance currently investors can stake bog tokens and earn a share of the platform fee the apr is relatively stable and is currently at 6 08 however if the use of the platform accelerates significantly the apr can possibly increase it makes more sense to stake in a project with a realistic apr than high apr with inflationary token economics overall at a current market capitalization of around 10 million bogged finance looks like a small cap gem i would hold the token with an investment horizon of 12 24 months for potential multi fold returns cryptos to buy zigcoin zig source shutterstock i have talked about zigcoin in the past as an attractive project zigcoin is the native token of zignaly a social crypto investment platform the platform allows investors to copy traders and pay a part of the profits as fee the platform currently has 350 000 users and 120 million in assets under management the reason to talk about zignaly again is the fact that the project recently secured 50 million in financing according to zignaly ceo bartolome bordallo the funding will propel significant new product development and global adoption of the zignaly platform besides being a social investing platform zignaly has also launched zigpad which is a multi chain launchpad users can participate in idos initial dex offerings with zig coins the launchpad is focused on filtering and bringing high quality projects to investors additionally zig staking vault can be used to stake zig coin and earn interest in the native as well as other coins tokens clearly zignaly is expanding in terms of the services its offering to investors with the recent financing the project seems poised for accelerated expansion and product development last year zig surged to highs of 22 cents the coin seems to have bottomed out at current levels of four cents i would bet on zig for the coin doubling or tripling in the next 12 18 months pancakeswap cake source shutterstock pancakeswap is a decentralized exchange that allows investors to trade tokens listed on the binance smart chain the platform has been used by millions of users which has translated into tens of millions of trades as i write cake token has been surging higher the reason is that pancakeswap will be the first defi project on binance the partnership will allow seamless use of pancakeswap within the binance application in some ways this creates a bridge between centralized and decentralized finance besides the trading feature pancakeswap also offers pools where tokens can be staked to earn a high apr as an example cake token can be staked for a current apr of 48 97 with the growth in nfts the platform also allows investors to buy and sell nfts on the binance smart chain overall pancakeswap is already used by millions of investors the partnership with binance will accelerate the trading volumes on the platform even after the recent upside in cake token i remain bullish from a long term horizon cryptos to buy torum xtm source shutterstock xtm token has corrected sharply from all time highs at current levels of 13 cents the token seems attractive for a reversal rally as an overview torum can be considered as the twitter nyse twtr of the cryptocurrency world the social media platform allows users to post views and news about cryptocurrencies however unlike twitter the project shares xtm token as rewards for various activities these include posting content liking content and logging into the platform on a daily basis xtm rewards ensure that the platform engagement is robust however even without the rewards the social media platform is interesting for cryptocurrency investors currently the platform has a user base of 210 000 crypto users torum has also been expanding on the scope of the project as an example torum has a nft marketplace and is also into decentralized finance another interesting upcoming feature of the project is torumgram this will allow users to connect telegram to torum overall xtm token looks oversold i would not be surprised if the token doubles from current levels in the next six months on the date of publication faisal humayun

liz truss said it was up to president volodymyr zelensky how his country approached peace talks but in an interview with the times she said she feared the negotiations which have been said to have made some progress were a smokescreen prime minister boris johnson told the scottish conservative conference in aberdeen he had pledged to send more defensive weapons to ukraine after speaking to mr zelensky on friday he said he was more convinced than ever russian president vladimir putin s military venture would fail mr johnson is due to address the conservative spring forum in blackpool on saturday where he will likely again address the conflict in ukraine britain s chief of defence intelligence said mr putin was now fighting a war of attrition after initial expectations of a quick conflict were dashed pa graphics lieutenant general sir jim hockenhull said the kremlin has been forced to switch tactics turning to the reckless and indiscriminate use of firepower which will inevitably lead to more civilian casualties ms truss said that if moscow was serious about peace talks being held with ukraine they would not be using such methods she told the times if a country is serious about negotiations it doesn t indiscriminately bomb civilians that day ms truss said she was very sceptical about the talks the two countries were holding and added what we ve seen is an attempt to create space for the russians to regroup foriegn secretary liz truss leave no 10 downing street james manning pa she said we don t see any serious withdrawal of russian troops or any serious proposals on the table the minister told newspaper the russians have lied and lied and lied i fear the negotiation is yet another attempt to create a diversion and create a smokescreen but she said of course ukraine as a sovereign nation is fully entitled to undertake any negotiation process it sees fit western officials warned that the russians have enormous stocks of artillery ammunition meaning they could maintain their bombardment for weeks however gen hockenhull said that more than three weeks into the campaign it is clear the kremlin has still not achieved any of its initial objectives it has been surprised by the scale and ferocity of ukrainian resistance and has been bedevilled by problems of its own making he told journalists russian operations have changed russia is now pursuing a strategy of attrition this will involve the reckless and indiscriminate use of firepower this will result in increased civilian casualties disruption of ukrainian infrastructure and intensify the humanitarian crisis ms truss told the times what we ve seen is an attempt to create space for the russians to regroup their invasion isn t going to plan mr johnson said now was the time to tighten the vice on moscow i spoke to president zelenskyyua and praised the steadfast resistance of the ukrainian people in the face of aggression the uk stands with ukraine we will send further defensive aid and they have our full backing in the negotiations boris johnson borisjohnson march 18 2022 i am more than ever convinced that putin will fail he said he will fail because in his catastrophic venture in ukraine he fatally underestimated the heroism and the resolve of the ukrainians to fight he underestimated western unity and among other things by the way he underestimated the passionate commitment of the people in this country to help earlier health secretary sajid javid said the pm was being hailed a hero in ukraine speaking at the conservative spring forum in blackpool mr javid said the support offered by the uk had prompted a british ukrainian man who stopped me in my constituency almost exactly this time last week and he said to me the next time you see boris you tell him in ukraine he s a hero apartments damaged by shelling in kharkiv andrew marienko ap elsewhere at the conference education secretary nadhim zahawi said 100 000 places had been created in schools for children fleeing ukraine and virtual lessons created during the coronavirus pandemic had been translated into ukrainian levelling up secretary michael gove confirmed more than 150 000 households had now offered to house ukrainian refugees the majority of whom have made their way to poland former prime minister david cameron announced on friday he was driving a small lorry to the polish border with ukraine with supplies it comes as mr putin russia s president made a rare public appearance to address a mass flag waving rally at moscow s luzhniki stadium to mark the eighth anniversary of his country s annexation of crimea he praised the efforts of russia s forces declaring shoulder to shoulder they help and support each other as many as 7 000 russian troops have died so far in the fighting including four major generals and a number of other senior officers american sources estimate in its latest intelligence update the ministry of defence said russia had been forced to shift to a strategy of attrition
the oil firms have to make that big profit have you noticed lots of manufacturers are hiding inflation by for example shrinking the size of the candy bar right now big oil would love to do it too but it still hasn t figured out how to package a 55 ounce gallon of gasoline it s amazing how much outrage americans generate over gasoline prices where s the outrage over the price of insulin or a federal minimum wage stuck at 7 25 an hour since 2009 we could let supply and demand and the free market solve the gasoline problem higher prices are economic signals that tell us to rethink our priorities and change how we spend money but even the free market faithful usually conservatives lose conviction when it comes to the price of gasoline regarding gasoline the knee jerk reaction is to get the price back to where it was asap so we don t have to cut our usage at all big oil loves the idea besides cutting the gas tax for a quick fix most of the solutions involve increasing the supply releasing crude from the strategic petroleum reserve is popular with big oil because it makes money refining and selling it longer term it would be delighted to buy more mineral rights on public land or offshore even though it would take years to get drilling rigs in place or build more pipelines to deliver the oil to the gulf coast refineries it also doesn t mention that some of the refined product would be shipped overseas free market advocates don t like to admit it but increasing supply takes time and requires significant government intervention sale of public land eminent domain relaxed environmental safeguards advertisement very few people are pushing for changes on the demand side we could of course immediately reinstate the odd even license plate system for purchases at gas stations other short term demand solutions might involve moratoriums on saturday mail deliveries or sunday package service by amazon ups and fedex how about a temporary four day workweek longer term solutions might include further increases in mileage requirements for cars and trucks more generous incentives for electric vehicles more recharging stations gas guzzler taxes changing double bottom truck regulations adding incentives for telecommuting or mass transit more multi use zoning higher density housing etc again almost any of this requires market intervention and takes time voters almost always prefer solutions that leave them alone and force others to change their behavior politicians know this so they go to great lengths to promise solutions that appear to be simple and free like offshore drilling or fracking in somebody else s backyard voters should remember what their mother taught them there is no such thing as a free lunch bob schmidt la jolla no good excuse for prices to be this high friday brent crude was at 108 40 a barrel and west texas intermediate was at 104 70 that s high but not as high as prices were in july of 2008 when oil peaked at 147 a barrel analysts always say that the price of gas is tied to the price of oil but in july 2008 the average price of gas in the u s was 4 14 a gallon and in california peaked at 4 53 today the average price of gas in the u s is 4 27 and in california it s 5 80 so historically the price of gas was much lower when the price of oil was much higher even taking into account increases in the gas tax in california the price of oil cannot account for the high price of gas rather it is war profiteering that is driving the price of gas up at such an extreme rate refinery operators are holding product off the market and their gas outlets are raising prices well ahead of increases in the price of gas deliveries this is all in an effort to recoup profits lost during the first year of the pandemic war profiteering has implications for what measures will work to reduce prices clearly adding to the oil supply and reducing gas taxes will have a limited effect in the u s we have not built a major new refinery for more than 40 years the concentration of refinery production in fewer hands and the resulting lack of competition is allowing this war profiteering governments need to enact a windfall profits tax and return the money to consumers allen greenberg clairemont why not fight big oil instead of ourselves someone in my news feed posted a picture of low gas prices from two years ago and high prices now under the names of the presiding presidents at the time the pump i just filled up at has been vandalized with a let s go brandon sticker on it humans are naturally wired to forget pain but really are we that forgetful would people really want to return to a pandemic quarantine when there was little demand for gas and many of us were crushingly unemployed not to mention rampant confusion and death around every corner how about considering some basic economics lessons people do believe in the free market i am presuming stuff like supply and demand the principle that that demand over supply raises prices and about that supply people think american oil doesn t flow because of something or someone u s oil production was way down during covid 19 shutdowns when there was little demand prices dropped and u s producers shifted to cheaper imported oil instead of pumping here sure prices are high now so we turn our spigots on even to current record high production levels our rapid economic recovery plus the russian war with ukraine have spiked demand and supply can t move that fast so prices go up but just watch how long it will take for the organization of the petroleum exporting countries to lower prices and take away the u s producers profit incentive we will shift to buying its cheaper oil again and shut off our spigots and investment in new wells got to make the profit doesn t matter where the source is my family was in the independent gas station business with multiple stations for decades and it s been this way for more than half a century even on a local basis when independents reached about 10 percent of a local market magically the major brands would all lower prices long enough to take out some independents that had borrowed too heavily to open their stations that s the free market baby and it s brutal you want american oil to always flow here is one way the u s could regulate it so that imported oil always has added costs like tariffs so it is never cheaper to import oil did you like the previous president s tariff war with china you should love this the fastest way for us to get to energy independence only one little problem it may cut into the near record high oil industry profits if they can t get us to keep buying at higher prices and by the way you might even try getting a higher gas mileage car you know try and do your little part but regulation will cut off their spigots of cash to our politicians like the dino joe manchin not only is he a democrat in name only he s a dinosaur from the fossil fuel era so tariffs won t happen you know we could be in this fight together my friends but the moneyed oil interests would be threatened by that so much so they prefer we keep fighting each other rather than unify against them so instead people will get hooked into placing stickers and posts and being the mouthpiece for big oil interests whether for russian oil or western oil companies and i get to seethe with thoughts like this jay goldstein san marcos don t drop efforts to change our course keeping the ship on course is the skipper s main responsibility of course an unexpected obstacle or a dangerous storm will often require evasive action however any such action should be evaluated for potential negative effects unfortunately in the past couple of years we ve had numerous storms and obstacles and our governments have been put to the test to minimize the harsh financial impact of each of these selective rebates handouts and rent extensions have played a large part in protecting people who were not prepared for the financial impacts of covid 19 now there is concern that people will not be able to deal with higher gas prices the knee jerk response is to suspend california s gas tax currently set at 51 1 cents per gallon and slated to increase a few cents by law this comes in the face of continued reports of failing infrastructure and current actions to impose even greater taxes to fund the overdue and proposed transportation infrastructure it is dangerous to change course without taking a clear look at the impacts of that change and a deep look at alternatives the issue at hand is not the fuel tax it s a basic situation of a significant change in the supply and demand model it takes some time to identify and study possible solutions aimed directly at fixing the problem there are alternate sources to compensate for the loss of russian oil as one might expect some of these come at a price we will have to consider doing business with some of the world s bad guys we are using some of the strategic reserves we should consider a short suspension of the restrictions on fossil fuel production in this country this is also a good time to start testing the san diego association of governments belief that we can cut back on vehicle miles traveled this is sandag s model to impose fees on drivers to get them to reduce greenhouse gases the idea was to make it hurt to use the roads an idea that at the last moment met with high resistance well now we don t have to wait for several tax bills to pass we have the equivalent of the road use taxes as a deterrent in place right now in the guise of higher gasoline prices calls are coming from several governments and other sources to relieve drivers from that tax burden so there is no consistency here we need the tax money but it s ok to suspend it we need to tax drivers to get them to reduce their car use but we need to save them from the high cost of gasoline so that they can use their cars without restraint we need to fix the roads and reduce driving suspending the gas tax won t do that let s try to carpool and limit unnecessary trips by planning i have replaced my car with my e bike for 90 percent of my travel haven t seen a gas pump in months we can each find a way harvey levine rancho bernardo break on taxes won t slow electric switch owning a car is a basic necessity in san diego most people have accepted the need to drive and the usual prices that come with that while many californians are used to inflation the recent high prices are pushing people over the edge our state s gas tax is one of the reasons why california has consistently high gas prices with the goal of a greener economy in mind we should turn away from gas and look to electric cars and for the short term california officials should give us a break on the gas tax california has the second highest state gas excise tax at 51 1 cents per gallon and it continues to grow each year our state has this high cost because of fees that account for environmental and infrastructure concerns while gov gavin newsom proposed a one year pause on increasing the gas tax back in january the recent surge in prices makes that seem like just a drop in the bucket a pause on the yearly increase would be a good start but a pause on the gas tax altogether would be an even better solution while it would mean a loss of 1 billion in revenue for our state california already has billions in surplus giving us good reason to fight for a tax break that would help millions of people even if the state were to give us a tax break california will always have high gas prices this is why we should look to electric vehicles which are already a popular subject in our state by 2035 california will require all new cars sold to be zero emission vehicles with consistently high gas prices and 2035 drawing closer the idea of upgrading to electric cars is appealing to many people it is definitely something i will look into california is already an energy conscious state that is looking towards renewable energy for the future so electric cars fit in perfectly with the current plans i have been cutting out unnecessary visits and planning errands in a more efficient way as my way of adjusting to the recent high gas prices i have my priority driving which is to my must drive places and anything outside that category has been put on hold my family also has been cashing in rewards points from shopping at vons which has been helpful along with a shell card that saves you 10 cents a gallon every bit helps sarah hughes normal heights pain in the purse is a good wake up call change is difficult even if we know that it s for our own good change means that we must venture outside our comfort zone but sometimes change is necessary for the greater good for example medicines often taste bad vaccine shots can hurt and layoffs are no fun but we may never quit a dead end job otherwise with the supply chain and inflation we were already stressing our comfort zone then vladimir putin invaded ukraine prices for gasoline electricity and heating gas skyrocketed how do we cope with this mess should we double down and drill for more oil is that a good solution to answer that question let s consider the cost of fossil fuel dependence when countries trade with other countries they must maintain good relations when the traded commodity is energy those relations are crucial but even good relations can turn sour overnight as we ve seen and then it s too easy for those dependencies to be weaponized we must also consider fossil fuel in the context of our existential climate crisis for decades we ve known about the dangers of global warming we could have solved the problem when it was small and manageable but we procrastinated again and again now it s a big problem last year the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change issued a climate red alert its report is more than 3 000 pages long but here it is in four words our time is up at this late date we must expeditiously take extreme action if we want to avert an inhospitable climate we re already experiencing severe wildfires droughts floods and storms but this is just the prelude it ll get worse much worse what will it take to overcome our inertia and to convince us to take action innumerable studies and stacks of peer reviewed scientific papers have not worked but a pain in the purse is a far better wake up call gas prices may just be the kick we need to recognize that we need a real solution given that push we should see that more oil will exacerbate our situation any country that trades oil is vulnerable to dicey and precarious geopolitics increased emissions will only worsen our climate crisis while our time is running out more oil may offer a temporary delay but that s just kicking the can down the road and oil is still a finite resource instead of more oil we could choose to solve several problems at once let s transition to renewable energy emissions will decrease we ll see less pollution better health and lower costs and we ll achieve sustainability and sources like the wind and the sun are not subject to sanctions tariffs or embargoes this transition will take a lot of work but even that has its benefits to research design engineer and implement the renewable energy infrastructure we will create many new jobs in all labor classes it won t be easy but it ll be worth it a transition to renewable energy is an investment in our future there is no better investment than in a healthier cleaner sustainable world james wang encinitas leaders must turn backs on oil money another reason gas prices are rising besides the republicans catering to the oil companies is that oil is bought and sold around the world through a global commodities market so even though the united states doesn t use much russian oil lower supply affects global prices and when there s less supply of an item in demand prices rise the only way to stop this is to eliminate the need for oil through home based solar electric and electric cars but as long as the republicans are bought and payed for by big oil get used to the high prices anthony kopec escondido support a fee on carbon dividend russia s assault on ukraine and the resulting impact on global oil prices once again reminds us of the instability resulting from our dependence on oil according to environmentalist bill mckibben there are around 2 795 gigatons of fossil fuels left in the world for us to use however the emissions we ll release by burning another 565 gigatons will push us over a critical climate threshold global energy use is currently around 85 carbon based this needs to change the answer won t be found in continuing to see saw back and forth between arguments for and against increased drilling or expanding development of renewable energy we need cooperation between both parties and a coordinated plan for a stable and sustainable future planning for a renewable energy transition needs to balance two interrelated but somewhat contradictory factors substituting fossil fuels fast enough to prevent the worst consequences of climate change and at the same time retaining sufficient energy to support the world s economy it s frequently overlooked that the energy necessary to invest in constructing renewable energy infrastructure on the scale required will subtract from the energy available for other economic activities modeling of feasible routes for the transition to renewable energy shows that we will be acutely dependent on fossil fuels to make it happen coal oil and natural gas are finite but we need the energy they provide as well as other mineral resources to build the physical equipment and energy grid needed the challenge of a renewable energy transition before the end of this century is unprecedented but it could be achieved if we periodically invest sufficient amounts of our current fossil energy stocks into building a sustainable energy future clearly we can no longer afford for major powers like russia the united states china and others to act recklessly and irresponsibly whether the catalyst is a hunt for non existent weapons of mass destruction or rebuilding a lost empire there are far more vital matters requiring global cooperation that must take priority renewable energy has been gaining in efficiency and is now competitive with conventional energy there are innumerable technologies in development that can expedite the transition to a carbon free future they range from longer lasting batteries for electric vehicles to household products to energy delivery systems based on renewables that could provide consistent revenue sources for developing countries continued reliance on dwindling fossil fuels will lead to increasing economic volatility and potential conflict while accelerating climate change the renewable energy transition is a matter of national security and global stability climate legislation has been stalled in congress for too long the u s is one of the only developed economies without a price on carbon pollution a price on carbon would reduce demand collected fees returned to the american public as dividend payments would help to defray costs a carbon fee is one of the most effective actions we can take for the transition to a sustainable future contact your representatives and tell them you support a carbon fee and dividend tom charlesworth escondido

after years of very low interest rates a change is coming the federal reserve is raising rates borrowing will get costlier for everything from mortgages to car loans to credit cards for many americans that will be a bitter pill but there are some silver linings here s what you can do in response it s going to get even harder to buy your first house for now when you re buying something as pricey as a home interest rates really matter they have already jumped sharply in anticipation of the fed s highly signaled plan to raise rates through the year since last summer mortgage rates have risen more than a full percentage point to above 4 on a 30 year fixed rate loan it starts to push it from like we could maybe make it work to the point where you re just like it s not worth it says zach gubran of fort collins colorado gubran 33 and his partner would like to settle down and buy a place of their own but he says that in this frenzied housing market that was already tough and now on a 450 000 loan the jump in rates to above 4 pushes the monthly payment up by 325 it s like this ridiculous situation says gubran who works as a contractor for a software company i have tens of thousands of dollars in savings and it feels like it s nothing it doesn t matter but it s not all despair rising rates could stop the runaway train of higher home prices home prices in the u s last year rose nearly 20 that is a staggering one year gain with a historic shortageof homes for sale and superlow interest rates bidding wars regularly broke out and drove prices ever higher in recent years big price gains like that pulled in more buyers who didn t want to miss out which juiced up demand even more in the overheated market higher mortgage rates may be helpful in cooling the housing market says selma hepp an economist with corelogic that may help bring us back more to some level of normality and in that case we won t see so much bidding over the asking price don t expect home prices to tumble but hepp thinks this year they ll rise much less around 3 a few years like that could give builders time to catch up with demand and build more homes ugh monthly payments on home equity lines of credit will go up ninety percent of homeowners have fixed rate mortgages that s the good news they re protected against rising rates but millions of americans have borrowed against their homes collectively they owe about 300 billion on home equity lines of credit helocs almost all of those have variable rates your rate is going to go up says kate wood who follows home loans for nerdwallet a home equity line of credit these are really really really closely tied to the kinds of moves that the federal reserve is making but wood says that since those rates adjust following moves by the fed more so than home mortgages do and since the fed has only just started to nudge rates higher you still have at least a little time to look at your options some banks will let you take the money you owe on your line of credit and lock that into a fixed interest rate it s worth reaching out proactively to your lender about that she says think about it this is something that is potentially saving you money your lender is maybe not you know sending you mailers and calling you up to let you know about this great option with your heloc savers will get a better return from bank cds for retirees and other people who have considerable savings that they might have to spend say a year or two from now bank cds for generations have been a go to option you don t have to worry about the stock market crashing because you get all your money back plus some interest the problem is that in recent years certificates of deposit have returned almost nothing but now with rates rising we should start to see banks offering at least slightly higher rates on cds especially as the year goes on and the fed keeps nudging rates higher there s more car loans installment loans and credit cards most types of consumer debt including auto loans are likely to see rates rise over the coming year car prices have been especially high during the coronavirus pandemic so for car loans it may be tempting for many people to take out a longer term seven year loan to lower their monthly payment but financial advisers say three year or five year loans are a much better way to go and they warn against those seven year car loans you end up paying a lot more interest and cars drop in value as time goes by so a few years down the road if you need a different car you can end up still owing 5 000 or 10 000 more than your car is worth but some people will trade in their old car anyway and the balance on the loan is transferred to the new loan which is crazy says miguel gomez a certified financial planner in el paso texas now all of a sudden you re buying another 30 000 car but you re owing 40 000 from the start which is a cycle that it s very difficult to get out of credit card debt is also a cycle that s tough to quit and with already high interest rates on credit cards headed even higher now is a good time to try to pay off those credit cards if you feel trapped credit counseling can really make a difference says gomez he points to the national foundation for credit counseling a proven nonprofit that can help clients get out of debt and he says there s also a good technique you can try at home take your credit cards put them in a ziploc bag he says then put that in a tupperware container full of water put it in the freezer and forget about them that way if you really need your credit cards you still have them but with your cards on ice it definitely cuts down on the impulse purchases copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
russia s invasion of ukraine has thrown global commodity markets into turmoil the global oil market in which russia is a major force is one of the most heavily affected russia is the world s third largest oil producer and the largest oil exporter significant strains are showing in the global oil market compounding difficulties in natural gas markets and creating a looming emergency for global energy security oil prices have swung violently since the russian invasion with the global benchmark nearing the all time high of usd 150 per barrel at times putting the still fragile and uneven global economic recovery at risk the united states and canada are banning imports of russian oil while the united kingdom has announced plans to do so by the end of the year the iea s latest oil market report on 16 march identified the potential for a shut in of 2 5 million barrels a day of russian oil exports starting from april but losses could increase should restrictions or public condemnation escalate a prolonged period of volatility for markets appears likely more than half of russia s oil exports go to europe and around 20 go to china but the market is global meaning changes in supply and prices affect everyone the increases in prices are being felt everywhere even if the price of oil on international markets has not so far risen as high as the all time record reached in 2008 currency exchange rates mean that the price at the pump is at the highest level ever in some countries on average monthly spending on oil products for transport and heating in january and february rose by more than usd 40 per household nearly 35 in advanced economies and nearly usd 20 per household over 55 in emerging and developing economies compared with last year s levels with the potential loss of large amounts of russian supplies looming there is a real risk that markets tighten further and oil prices escalate significantly in the coming months as the world enters the peak demand season of july and august the risks are most acute and already being felt in some cases in market segments where russia is a major supplier such as diesel several governments are introducing measures to help consumers by reducing prices at the pump wherever possible pricing measures should be designed carefully prioritising the poorest parts of the population and those for whom cars are an indispensable part of their economic activity governments have a variety of tools that could be used depending on the country context for example where taxes represent a large portion of prices for consumers a temporary reduction in those levies or vat can alleviate the extra burden on households direct payments are a means to target the poorest parts of the population such measures however do not address the broader strains affecting the market one way to do so is to increase supply spare capacity is available in some major producers outside russia but the disappointing outcome of recent opec discussions suggests limited willingness to provide immediate relief to the market iea member countries as part of their collective response unanimously agreed this month to draw on emergency stocks for an initial release of 62 7 million barrels the largest stock release in iea history new oil production projects could increase liquidity in the market in the medium term but would not be able to ease the current strains the oil industry s stocks typically help balance the market when demand outweighs supply but even before russia s invasion the industry s oil inventories were depleting rapidly at the end of january inventories in advanced economies were 335 million barrels below their five year average and at eight year lows another way to help balance the market and reduce the pain caused by high oil prices is to bring down demand following russia s invasion of ukraine the iea s march oil market report lowered its forecast for global oil demand in 2022 by 950 thousand barrels a day kb d because of the expected impacts of higher prices and weaker gdp growth but this would still leave the oil market very tight with upward pressure on prices likely to remain in an uncertain geopolitical environment further reductions in demand are possible in the near term however through actions by governments and citizens the world s advanced economies together account for around 45 of global oil demand and most of them are members of the iea demand restraint see annex is one of the emergency response measures that all iea member countries are required to have ready as a contingency at all times and that they can use to contribute to an iea collective action in the event of an emergency in view of this and the potential emergency the world is facing the iea is proposing 10 immediate actions that can be taken in advanced economies to reduce oil demand before the peak demand season we estimate that the full implementation of these measures in advanced economies alone can cut oil demand by 2 7 million barrels a day within the next four months relative to current levels 1 the analysis in this report focuses on the potential effect of these measures in advanced economies but their adoption in more countries would further increase their impact ensuring local and regional coordination of their implementation would maximise the impact looking further ahead this report also suggests a path for countries to put oil demand into structural decline in the medium term building on measures already included in economic recovery packages introduced to deal with the impacts of the covid 19 pandemic adopting the immediate and longer term recommendations would put the countries on track for a decline in oil demand consistent with what is required to reach net zero emissions by 2050 the majority of oil demand is in transport so the proposed measures of the 10 point plan essentially focus on how we get from a to b how these measures are implemented is subject to each country s own circumstances in terms of their energy markets transport infrastructure social and political dynamics and other aspects the iea stands ready to support all countries in designing and optimising measures to suit their respective circumstances government regulations and mandates have proven to be very effective for successfully implementing these measures in various countries and cities while public information and awareness campaigns can serve as alternative or complementary measures ultimately however reducing oil demand does not depend solely on national governments several of the measures can be implemented directly by other layers of government such as state regional or local or just voluntarily followed by citizens and companies enabling them to save money while showing solidarity with the people of ukraine and reducing greenhouse gas emissions 1 reduce speed limits on highways by at least 10 km h a country by country and state by state analysis shows that a reduction of speed limits on highways by 10 km h relative to current levels can significantly reduce fuel consumption for cars light commercial vehicles and trucks speed limits on highways vary widely among countries but are typically in the range of 100 km h to 135 km h for example average speed limits on urban and rural interstate highways in the united states are around 110 km h in the european union speed limits vary between 100 km h and 140 km h except in germany which has no speed limit on some highways a reduction in speed limits can be implemented by national governments many countries did so during the 1973 oil crisis including the united states and several european countries today many countries use temporary speed limit reductions on highways mostly to reduce congestion and or air pollution and to improve road safety they are also frequently adopted within cities to combat local air pollution impact around 290 kb d of oil use can be saved in the short term through a speed limit reduction of just 10 km h on motorways for cars a further 140 kb d predominantly diesel can be saved if heavy trucks reduce their speed by 10 km h 2 work from home up to three days a week where possible before the pandemic the use of private vehicles to commute to work in advanced economies was responsible for around 2 7 million barrels of oil use a day yet around one third of the jobs in advanced economies can be done from home opening up the possibility of reducing oil demand while maintaining productivity the impact of working from home on oil consumption varies widely by region depending on the distance of the commute and average fuel consumption of the car in the united states the average one way commute by car is around 18 kilometres and over three quarters of car commuters travel alone according to the us census bureau in europe the average one way car commute is around 15 kilometres differences in the fuel economy of vehicles further affect the variations among countries for example a new car in the united states consumes around 40 more fuel than one sold in europe for a trip of the same length there is an additional seasonal element to the impacts of working from home due to the use of air conditioning in cars see point 6 as the weather gets warmer air conditioning systems increase the amount of fuel used by cars therefore working from home tends to save more oil during the summer months during confinement periods triggered by the pandemic many countries implemented requirements for people to work from home for activities where it is possible while most of those requirements have been lifted some governments such as france are encouraging working from home without a minimum weekly quota the employer has the flexibility to set the terms and conditions while keeping an eye on preventing social isolation working from home up to three days per week would cut oil demand and could reduce fuel bills we estimate that avoiding an average daily commute by car currently saves around usd 2 to usd 3 each time in advanded economies impact one day of working from home can avoid around 170 kb d of oil use three days of working from home avoids around 500 kb d in the short term 3 car free sundays in cities car free sundays were introduced in countries such as switzerland the netherlands and west germany during the 1973 oil crisis brussels edinburgh vancouver parts of tokyo and other cities have used them more recently to promote public health community oriented spaces and cultural events more than 3 000 towns and cities registered for the european mobility week in 2021 which included a commitment to a car free day car free sundays help support the uptake of walking and cycling which can generate a positive spillover effect throughout the week this can in turn be supported by fare reductions or the provision of free public transport banning the use of private cars on sundays brings a number of additional benefits to public health and well being including cleaner air reduced noise pollution and improved road safety in warmer climates reduced traffic can also reduce urban heat island effects the measure is also relatively straightforward to enforce using spot fines and road closures impact avoids around 380 kb d of oil use in the short term if implemented in large cities every sunday if only one sunday per month the amount drops to 95 kb d 4 make the use of public transport cheaper and incentivise micro mobility walking and cycling an effective way to reduce oil demand is to shift travel demand away from private cars to public transport micro mobility options walking or cycling wherever practical where public transport exists a short term temporary response can be to reduce fares for public buses metro and light rail trial initiatives including in some us cities have shown that reduced or free public transport fares result in increased ridership new zealand for instance is halving public transport fares for the next three months in response to high fuel prices public transport systems available spare capacity during peak travel periods differs by country and city however there is typically spare capacity available in off peak periods that can be used to spread the peak if employers simultaneously provide flexibility in working hours in countries where it is culturally acceptable cycle lanes and pavement widening strategies exist or can be made available quickly and where distances are sufficiently short encouraging people to walk or cycle can be a complementary measure in cities with available public transport this can help make public transport less crowded and therefore more attractive and accessible rolling out programmes to incentivise the purchase of electric bikes can also be effective particularly in cities where journeys involve larger distances belgium france and italy offer residents an allowance to buy a bicycle with the amount depending on bicycle type boosting shared micro mobility options such as electric kick scooter or electric bicycles can also help lime bird or dott are some examples of app based providers that already provide this service in major cities investment in public transport and infrastructure to support walking and cycling has been boosted by sustainable economic recovery packages introduced in response to the covid crisis for example the french government allocated eur 500 million to an active mobility fund to build cycling itineraries and italy supports the design and development of cycle highways eur 50 million per year for the next three years new zealand enacted a nationwide cycle lane investment drive in 2020 of over usd 140 million in direct government spending by 2024 in 2021 milan repurposed 35 kilometres of road previously used for motor traffic into cycling lanes and aims at achieving 750 kilometres of segregated lanes by 2035 several cities such as paris london and brussels created very low speed zones 30 km h to discourage car use when the summer months approach cycling becomes more popular and can be further encouraged overall governments in advanced economies are set to spend around usd 2 5 billion in the next two years on cycle lanes and pedestrian walkways and a further usd 33 billion in urban transport infrastructure as part of economic recovery packages impact short term measures where feasible and culturally acceptable can avoid around 330 kb d of oil use 5 alternate private car access to roads in large cities restricting private cars use of roads in large cities to those with even number plates some weekdays and to those with odd numbered plates on other weekdays is a measure with a long track record of successful implementation during the first oil shock the italian government substituted car free sundays with an odd even number plate policy since the 1980s such schemes have been deployed in many cities to tackle congestion and air pollution peaks including athens madrid paris milan and mexico city implementation of restrictions based on number plates typically hinges on the availability of other options to satisfy travel demand they can pose logistical or fairness concerns especially as they are most disruptive for less wealthy single car households these concerns can be mitigated by the other measures that we propose such as reducing the price of public transport or promoting carpooling exceptions can be made for electric vehicles the measure s effectiveness in reducing car activity may fall in the longer term if wealthier households buy additional internal combustion engine cars to circumvent it households that own multiple cars may be able to circumvent the restrictions but this effect and others such as the remaining cars allowed on roads making longer multipurpose trips are factored into our estimates of the potential reduction in oil demand impact a reduction of around 210 kb d of oil in the short term if alternate car access is applied on two days per week in large cities with good public transport options 6 increase car sharing and adopt practices to reduce fuel use car users from different households can choose to carpool for non urban trips reducing oil demand and saving money at the same time governments can provide additional incentives by designating dedicated traffic lanes and parking spots next to public transport hubs and by reducing road tolls on higher occupancy vehicles such measures are in force in suburban areas of cities like madrid and houston among others non urban car trips are responsible for over 4 million barrels a day of oil use in advanced economies currently very few of these trips involve the pooling of people from different households which results in lower levels of car occupancy the average car occupancy in japan is 1 3 people per car in the united states it is around 1 5 per car in europe it is between 1 4 and 1 6 per car across advanced economies the average is around 1 5 organising carpooling is more practical today than it was in the past several smartphone apps are available including blablacar liftshare scoop tripbuddy ecov and gokid the carpooling market has grown by over 10 annually in recent years although the covid pandemic has reversed this trend since 2020 due to health concerns a higher average car occupancy rate can be interpreted either as an indication that carpooling in certain regions is more viable e g culturally technically habitually or as an indication of lower capacity for additional carpooling governments will need to take this into account when deciding upon the measures to take to incentivise carpooling cars can also be used more fuel efficiently by adopting best practices both in driving and maintenance for example regular tyre pressure monitoring can save up to 1 5 of fuel use in addition air conditioning in cars typically accounts for 4 to 10 of total fuel consumption in advanced economies depending on the local climate and comfort preferences for those car users who can we therefore propose a temporary 3 c increase in the temperature setting to give an immediate improvement in fuel economy and cut fuel bills impact an increase of around 50 in the average car occupancy across advanced economies in 1 in 10 trips and adopting best practices to decrease car fuel use can save around 470 kb d of oil in the short term 7 promote efficient driving for freight trucks and delivery of goods vehicles can be driven to optimise fuel use the possible measures span a wide range and can include improved vehicle maintenance such as regular checks of tyre pressure as well as driving habits governments can introduce so called eco driving techniques as part of the tuition and examination processes required to receive a driving license and advanced driving certificates as has been done in france and other countries broader public information campaigns can supplement these targeted efforts companies with vehicle fleets such as for the delivery of goods are particularly well placed to provide training and awareness campaigns to promote eco driving of commercial vehicles cutting into diesel use in particular given the structure of their fleets additionally lower demand for very short delivery times can contribute to increasing the overall fuel efficiency of logistics during last mile delivery besides reducing diesel use eco driving can also help reduce fuel bills and vehicle maintenance costs trucks are major consumers of diesel and so improving the efficiency of their operations can be an important contributor to reducing oil use readily accessible measures for the next four months can be in improving logistics truck companies can optimise vehicle loads and reduce empty travelling cooperation between companies and widespread use of digital technologies can help achieve these goals impact these measures can avoid around 320 kb d of oil use in the short term 8 using high speed and night trains instead of planes where possible where high speed rail lines connect major cities at distances under 1 000 km trains provide a high quality substitute for short distance flights high speed rail can substantially replace short haul air travel on routes that offer affordable reliable and convenient train journeys the use of night trains can be a means to cross wider distances in particular and spread traffic across different times of the day based on existing high speed rail infrastructure around 2 of aviation activity in advanced economies could be shifted to high speed rail including for leisure as well as business travel almost all of this involves flights of less than 800 km rail services must be operated and serviced efficiently to get widespread acceptance as an alternative to flights in that case high speed rail can not only reduce oil demand and emissions from short haul flights it can also be faster and more comfortable reliable and affordable rail stations are often located in or near city centres making them more convenient and sustainable than airports in france the recent climate and resilience law requires the cancellation of flights if alternatives exist to reach the destination within two and a half hours companies have already started to cut some flights including between paris and cities such as nantes lyon and bordeaux impact avoids around 40 kb d oil use in the short term 9 avoid business air travel where alternative options exist given the space requirements in planes the journeys of passengers in premium classes consume three times more oil than those in economy class although not all business travel by plane can be avoided in many cases the use of virtual meetings can be an effective substitute a significant reduction of around two out of every five flights taken for business purposes is feasible in the short term based on the notable changes witnessed during the covid pandemic in response to the pandemic virtual business interactions have become more common many companies have invested heavily in enhancing the experience of remote meetings making this a more effective acceptable and viable substitute to business flights and direct human engagement businesses continued operations and in some cases thrived despite having to make this major adjustment several major corporations such as hsbc zurich insurance bain company and s p global have already announced targets to cut their business travel emissions by as much as 70 reducing business travel can play a role in meeting esg goals and help reduce corporate carbon footprints before the outbreak of the pandemic about one fifth of passenger trips by plane in advanced economies were for business purposes business travel was hit harder than other categories of passenger air travel during the pandemic dropping to historic lows high oil prices may disincentivise airlines to operate underutilised routes in response to reduced business travel but to maximise the impact governments can provide flexibility on flight slot allocations so as to minimise the occurrence of ghost flights impact avoids 260 kb d of oil use in the short term 10 reinforce the adoption of electric and more efficient vehicles by the end of 2021 8 4 million electric cars were on the roads in advanced economies building on record sales in europe in particular demand for electric cars continues to be strong on the back of plummeting costs of batteries in recent years and government support however supply chain bottlenecks in semiconductors vehicle raw materials and battery materials and manufacturing are putting strains on the market the impacts are likely to be felt longer term but facilitating logistical coordination to shore up flows of materials and components is a near term priority so that disruptions in some parts of the automotive supply chain can be absorbed by less affected manufacturing capabilities elsewhere in the global market the near term priority is to ensure successful delivery of car orders to consumers where possible fleet orders may be prioritised as their impact on moderating oil demand is larger than for households with multiple cars actions taken now to hasten the adoption of electric vehicles will have a sustained effect in the future similarly new conventional vehicles sold must be fuel efficient fuel economy targets as well as taxes that penalise high emissions vehicles are key for supporting further fuel economy improvements enforcing existing regulation and supporting them via awareness campaigns is central to reaping benefits in the near term impact avoids more than 100 kb d of oil use in the short term building on expected sales of electric and more fuel efficient cars over the next four months sustained action on supply chains and policy support can help secure further savings elements of this 10 point plan combined with structural measures can help put oil demand on a more sustainable path in the longer term reducing oil use must not remain a temporary measure sustained reductions are desirable in order not only to improve energy security but also to tackle climate change and reduce air pollution governments have all the necessary tools at their disposal to put oil demand into decline in the coming years which would support efforts to both strengthen energy security and achieve vital climate goals retaining those elements of this 10 point plan to which societies can more easily adapt and that consumers can integrate into their daily habits can help temper oil demand growth beyond the peak demand season but governments must also consider accelerating their clean energy transitions and building on their net zero emissions strategies to reach net zero emissions by 2050 oil demand in advanced economies in 2030 must be more than 15 million barrels a day lower than in 2021 many measures that accelerate clean energy transitions in oil consuming sectors can have a material impact on oil use already over the next two to three years even if their impact will be felt more strongly a few more years down the road but decisions need to be taken now for them to materialise we identify a set of key actions that can be taken now prioritising those that can help advanced economies to put oil demand into a noticeable decline in the medium term the measures are lasting more oil demand reductions can be expected for years to come in line with the need to cut global oil use to reach net zero emissions by 2050 key actions include prioritise support to electric vehicles and unblock supply chains most of the new evs sold between now and the summer have already been ordered but sales can be further boosted in the subsequent months and years by providing targeted government support to car sales and the roll out of the necessary infrastructure electric car sales in the iea s net zero by 2050 scenario reach 28 million in 2030 in advanced economies up from 3 2 million in 2021 there is also large untapped potential for increased sales of electric buses and short haul electric freight trucks accelerating long term investment in supply resiliency will be critical to ease supply chain constraints for key inputs to electric cars significantly raising the ambition of fuel economy standards for road vehicles sales of electric cars are rising and ambitious fuel economy and or co2 emissions standards are in place in many countries yet sales of suvs also keep increasing with the vehicles accounting for nearly 10 of oil use in advanced economies policies to address the rise in sales of such vehicles such as specific registration and road taxes are key to achieve steady overall fuel economy progress and oil savings the fuel economy of trucks must also be improved further policy is critical even if many measures such as aerodynamic devices installed at the rear of trailers to reduce drag can be cost effective at current oil prices boosting the supply of alternative fuels availability of sustainable feedstock is a key constraint on the additional amount of biofuels that could be blended into the oil product pools in the near term without harming food markets but there is potential for increased use of waste cooking oil and animal fat for biodiesel production by maximising industrial output and non food feedstock collection synthetic fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia are not expected to reduce oil use noticeably in the near term but rd d programs should be accelerated to help diversify future supply cleaner fuels account for around one sixth of road transport use by 2030 in advanced economies in a scenario compatible with iea s net zero roadmap additional needs are in shipping and aviation accelerate the replacement of oil boilers with heat pumps and ban installation of new ones in advanced economies alone more than 3 5 million barrels a day of oil are used today to heat homes shops and offices and to meet heat demand and run engines in light industries such as food and beverages machinery and mining most of these uses of oil can be replaced by heat pumps and renewables an additional 5 5 mb d of such uses are in emerging economies and developing countries increase plastic waste collection re use and recycling many products made from plastic are single use some for good reason e g certain medical supplies and some more for convenience e g plastic bottles cutlery and food containers measures targeting their reduction have a relatively modest impact on oil demand in the short term but they lay the groundwork for larger reductions and can make an important contribution to addressing the problem of mismanaged plastic waste existing plastic recycling facilities can be further utilised to boost recycling rates supported by enhanced waste management infrastructure we also estimate that collection rates can be increased by around one percentage point per year in advanced economies in the coming years alongside incremental increases in yield and substitution rates which increase the extent to which plastics recycling reduces oil demand source iea

the continuation of the conflict between russia and ukraine along with the financial sanctions against russia by europe and the united states has induced a shock in the international capital market international energy prices including oil and natural gas together with commodity market prices rose distinctly in particular the price of nickel has increased significantly in the past two days there are market rumors that chinese private enterprises have started to experience short positions which might incur huge losses after raising more than 76 on monday the london metal exchange lme nickel price rose more than 110 on march 8 to usd 101 351 per ton setting a new high again two causes are expected to contribute to the unexpected spike in nickel prices first russia as a major producing country was kicked out of the lme because of financial sanctions because the lme was unable to supply nickel it resulted in a significant supply deficit data show that in 2021 russia s supply accounted for about 9 3 of global nickel ore output and russia s production was more than 23 of global refined nickel output after the russian products were banned liquidity in the nickel market deteriorated remarkably creating an advantage for the bulls second global nickel inventories are already low with nickel inventories in lme registered warehouses falling nearly 70 to 83 328 tons since april last year market activity forces its price higher due to low supply signaling more price volatility and potential for speculators to benefit as a result this might have ramifications for the chinese market according to certain media sources the 200 000 ton nickel short order made by tsingshan group a fortune 500 business in wenzhou may not be available in stock since russian nickel was taken off the lme because of the russia ukraine crisis and financial penalties some market rumors are circulating that glencore might squeeze tsingshan on lme nickel for its 60 stake in a nickel mine in indonesia tsingshan group is the partner of huayou that develops the nickel project at present it is not clear how risky tsingshan s position is from the rising nickel prices according to certain media reports tsingshan s floating loss might exceed usd 8 billion based on the scale of the lack of supply of 200 000 tons of nickel if the price rally persists tsingshan s short position could wipe out some of its production profits tsingshan declined to comment in multiple requests for inquiry and swiss financial trader glencore responded that the claims were baseless there have been rumors that chinese companies have encountered short squeeze in the market bloomberg did report that tsingshan started building short positions last year in part to hedge against rising production with the belief that the nickel price rally would fade tsingshan s production costs in indonesia are less than usd 10 000 a ton while the lme s benchmark price is more than usd 23 000 it is believed that tsingshan has accumulated large short positions in nickel derivatives markets to hedge against possible price falls during nickel production the lme data shows that there is an unidentified nickel inventory holder who holds at least half of the lme inventory as of february 9 2022 the unidentified stockist holds between 50 and 80 of the nickel warehouse receipts monitored by the lme according to lme daily data holder of lme warehouse receipt could withdraw the spot according to the warehouse receipt the rival of this magnitude it is believed could be glencore most important of all the concern is whether tsingshan will continue to compete with the bulls glencore or close out the short positions bloomberg s report pointed out that since tsingshan s nickel products are not eligible for delivery with the lme futures contract its futures shorts are not a perfect hedge against its products this reveals that if tsingshan is forced to increase margin or move positions these short positions would consume a lot of its cash flow although there have been warnings through news reports unfortunately under the aggravated geographical risks due to the russia ukraine crisis extreme market deals have further exacerbated the tsingshan group s position this reveals that tsingshan group has not been able to effectively control risks and cease losses promptly some chinese companies and investors who often treat market risks with conventional thinking are lacking effective early warning and risk control for external risks that cause an adjustment in the trading environment under the current aggravated geography risks its impact often exceeds the market fluctuations in the normal state bringing an unexpected influence on companies and investors the condition recalls the rare phenomenon of negative oil prices in international crude oil futures during the covid 19 pandemic at that time the acute contraction of crude oil demand as a result of the pandemic caused a rare negative value of crude oil futures prices this extreme condition led to the liquidation of trading products including yuan you bao causing huge losses to investors and financial institutions in the case of nickel the lme had to suspend nickel market trading at 4 pm on march 8 beijing time it explained that the decision on the suspension was made due to the impact of the russia ukraine crisis and the price trend in asia at present margins on the lme nickel contract were based on the closing price on march 7 2022 the lme clearing would consider additional measures if any based on a risk management perspective market closures caused by such extreme transactions are rare not only in the lme but also in international commodity markets this demonstrates that not only private enterprises were unable to take timely measures to deal with the aggravated geographical risks but the market too had no effective solution on this the latest information shows that the lme would delay the delivery of all spot nickel contracts originally scheduled for march 9 2022 the lme also cancels all nickel trades executed on or after 12 am u k time on march 8 2022 on otc and lme select screen trading systems this means that tsingshan group might recover some of the losses on the transaction because of the increased geopolitical risks the futures trading market should have some control over risky transactions but should not follow usual norms at this time for example for some extreme actions that may pose systemic risks to the market the management should apply some limits so that the market and critical institutions do not collapse easily given the implications for the entire industry this is the sort of difficulty that the lme is facing at the moment as a result it is legitimate for the lme to interfere as needed regardless of whether chinese companies could recover their losses afterwards it has become a lesson because the impacts are profound and painful more important is that in the future these companies must always be prepared in advance rather than merely observing despite various early warnings researchers at anbound point out that investors should learn the lessons and enhance their macro judgment of geopolitical risks the current rise in geographical risks has not only brought chaos to the commodity and energy markets but also affected the global capital market which could cause a major global financial turmoil the overall market environment has undergone dramatic changes under this circumstance enterprises and investors can no longer invest and operate merely from the perspective of market transactions nor evaluate market risks under conventional thinking the various market extremes exhibit that the current market is anything but a normal market now therefore under the aggravated geopolitical risks investment strategies and trading arrangements will require prudential contemplation

after years of very low interest rates a change is coming the fed is raising rates borrowing will get costlier for everything from mortgages to car loans to credit cards for many americans that will be a bitter pill but there are some silver linings here s what you can do in response it s going to get even harder to buy your first house for now when you re buying something as pricey as a home interest rates really matter they have already jumped sharply in anticipation of the fed s highly signaled plan to raise rates through the year since the summer mortgage rates have risen more than a full percentage point to above 4 on a 30 year fixed rate loan it starts to push it from like we could maybe make it work to the point where you re just like it s not worth it says zach gubran in fort collins colorado gubran 33 and his partner would like to settle down and buy a place of their own but he says in this frenzied housing market that was already tough and now on a 450 000 loan the jump in rates to above 4 pushes the monthly payment up by 325 it s like this ridiculous situation says gubran who works as a contractor for a software company i have tens of thousands of dollars in savings and it feels like it s nothing it doesn t matter but it s not all despair rising rates could stop the runaway train of higher home prices home prices in the u s last year rose nearly 20 that is a staggering one year gain with a historic shortageof homes for sale and super low interest rates bidding wars regularly broke out and drove prices ever higher in recent years big price gains like that pulled in more buyers who didn t want to miss out which juiced up demand even more in the overheated market higher mortgage rates may be helpful in cooling the housing market says selma hepp an economist with corelogic that may help bring us back more to some level of normality and in that case we won t see so much bidding over the asking price don t expect home prices to tumble but hepp thinks this year they ll rise much less around 3 a few years like that could give builders time to catch up with demand and build more homes ugh monthly payments on home equity lines of credit will go up ninety percent of homeowners have fixed rate mortgages that s the good news they re protected against rising rates but millions of americans have borrowed against their homes collectively they owe about 300 billion on home equity lines of credit or helocs almost all of those have variable rates your rate is going to go up says kate wood who follows home loans for nerdwallet a home equity line of credit these are really really really closely tied to the kinds of moves that the federal reserve is making but wood says since those rates adjust following moves by the fed more so than home mortgages and the fed has only just started to nudge rates higher you still have at least a little time to look at your options some banks will let you take the money you owe on your line of credit and lock that into a fixed interest rate it s worth reaching out proactively to your lender about that she says think about it this is something that is potentially saving you money your lender is maybe not you know sending you mailers and calling you up to let you know about this great option with your heloc savers will get a better return from bank cd s for retirees and other people who have considerable savings that they might have to spend say a year or two from now bank cd s for generations have been a go to option you don t have to worry about the stock market crashing because you get all your money back plus some interest the problem is in recent years cd s have returned almost nothing but now with rates rising we should start to see banks offering at least slightly higher rates on cd s especially as the year goes on and the fed keeps nudging rates higher there s more car loans installment loans and credit cards most types of consumer debt including auto loans are likely to see rates rise over the coming year car prices have been especially high during the pandemic so for car loans it may be tempting for many people to take out a longer term 7 year loan to lower their monthly payment but financial advisors say 3 year or 5 year loans are much better way to go and warn against those 7 year car loans you end up paying a lot more interest and cars drop in value as time goes by so a few years down the road if you need a different car you can end up still owing 5 000 or 10 000 more than your car is worth so some people will trade in their old car anyway and the balance on the loan is transferred to the new loan which is crazy says miguel gomez a certified financial planner in el paso texas now all of a sudden you re buying another 30 000 car but you re owing 40 000 from the start which is a cycle that it s very difficult to get out of credit card debt is also a cycle that s tough to quit and with already high interest rates on credit cards headed even higher now is a good time to try to pay off those credit cards if you feel trapped credit counseling can really make a difference says gomez he points to the national foundation for credit counseling a proven non profit that can help clients get out of debt and he says there s also a good technique you can try at home take your credit cards put them in a ziploc bag he says then put that in a tupperware container full of water put it in the freezer and forget about them that way if you really need your credit cards you still have them but with your cards on ice it definitely cuts down on
