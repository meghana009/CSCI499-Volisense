year net interest income for the first nine months of the fiscal year was 2 7 higher than the previous corresponding period as lower yields on earning assets were more than offset by reduced cost of

costs and repossession expenses outpaced increases in advertising and data processing costs between the comparative periods the bank s efficiency ratio for the first nine months of fiscal 2022 increased to 79 3 from 73 7 last fiscal year due to increased deposit and liquidity levels the balance of investment securities grew by 32 4 million during the nine month period this increase was

venture funding is slowing down in the us asia and latin america and big venture capital firms are adjusting their strategies to focus on early stage startups while africa seems to be weathering the decline there are concerns that growth stage startups may struggle to raise capital leading to mergers and acquisitions or early stage companies will be deluged with too much cash african startups are already seeing some of that refocused capital tiger global and softbank some of the biggest investment firms globally have directly led or participated in some of the biggest disclosed seed and pre seed deals in africa since january this year including two seed deals above 10 million so investors and ecosystem stakeholders are beginning to ask questions stephen deng a partner at san francisco based venture capital firm dfs lab believes that while the effect of a funding slowdown in africa may take some time to show ultimately african startups will need to adjust to the new venture funding reality obviously the later stage investors are going to contract their valuations and yet there will still be high valuations early on he tells techcabal in a call deng however says that how sufficient capital a dfs lab investment syndicate invests will not change our thesis he tells techcabal on a call earlier this week does not change during the more capital intensive times and it s because we continue to invest in businesses that are fit for the continent and do not require a very capital rich environment to succeed in february the information reported that tiger global management a global venture capital firm had told its investors in a webinar that large late stage firms planning to go public would no longer be a priority investment the firm planned to instead focus on investing in younger startups raising series a and b rounds a few weeks after that report partners at tiger global announced personal commitments totalling 1 billion to fund early stage companies as part of a broader strategy to index the early stage startup market similarly hedge funds like d1 capital have hinted at plans to slow down or turn off funding to late stage startups and focus on early stage companies and others like softbank have spun off a separate entity upload ventures to invest in early stage startups in latin america all of this comes on the heels of a slowdown in investment activity since january and a selloff in the shares of publicly listed tech companies that have seen stock indexes like the nasdaq composite decline by almost 18 as of april 26 and forced private market investors to revisit startup valuations a fuzzy market raises questions last year some of africa s largest growth stage companies benefited from the capital windfall that coursed through venture markets per data from africa the big deal only 7 series c rounds accounted for 1 06 billion of the total 4 33 billion startup funding it reported last year a 250 million series d round disclosed in mid february valued flutterwave at over 3 billion barely one year after it crossed the unicorn mark senegalese mobile money provider wave raised 200 million series a in september last year to become francophone africa s first unicorn and opay s 400 million round led by softbank valued the nigerian mobile payments platform at 2 billion but now that the venture capital explosion appears to be slowing down and the fall in the share prices of publicly traded companies and poor performance of recently ipo ed startups is reducing the appetite for ipos investors and entrepreneurs alike are voicing concerns about how it may affect africa s nascent markets we are entering a new epoch and negative unit economics gross margins near zero and risk premiums changing are going to create a lot of difficulty for high valuation startups tweeted steven grin managing partner at lateral frontiers vc a venture capital fund that invests in digital infrastructure in africa as early as last year and amid energetic optimism online debates began to form around startup valuations in africa in a podcast last year deng asserted that african startups are seeing valuation jumps due to the kind of recency bias that is happening referring to the high profile valuations and funding rounds that were a regular news item in 2020 and 2021 the scale of valuation changes depending on how optimistic people are about the long term and there s a lot of recency bias he added noting that huge valuations from standouts like flutterwave s 3 billion valuation and paystack s 2020 acquisition by stripe for 200 million have helped improve how african startups are valued i think now the question is are we perhaps undervaluing the limitations of the market as it exists in the mid term stephen asked are there elephants in the room around gdp growth are we actually pricing in the risks still are we simply just trying to get an allocation that was last april meme stocks were exploding gamestop was up 900 year to date and us stocks hit record highs amid a backdrop of the us federal reserve s commitment to continue expanding its balance sheet this april the situation is different the us stock market recorded its first quarterly decline in 2 years and even once high flying tech stocks are taking significant hits on the chin perhaps this would have mattered less if africa s startups depended less on foreign capital but that is not the case local investors are mostly early stage investors in 2020 early stage companies represented 64 of africa s 359 startup funding rounds above 200 000 according to dakar based vc firm partech but that only accounted for 220 million of the 1 4 billion invested in startups that year as it is local investors are unable to provide the funding that promising startups need to grow still worried about valuations valuations are not all logical affairs and some stakeholders have pointed out that african startups are already heavily discounted compared to global peers nicole dunn accelerator lead at founders factory africa has argued that far from being over valued african startups are cheap at the price in general but she also noted that global macroeconomic events have contributed to a groundswell of international capital seeking new growth frontiers if this is true is it unreasonable to expect global macroeconomic events to influence how fundraises not just valuations are distributed in africa s venture capital markets but investors like jumanne mtambalike ceo of investment firm sahara ventures question the significance of debating startup valuations writing there is an obsession with valuations and not the actual value created by startups on the ground whether we call them zebracons or camels he wrote we need to find a way to make african startups look more like african businesses and not vehicles created to be sold to the highest bidders in the pe and stock markets deng concurs saying that while valuations at the early stage at least will remain strong founders should be cautious as a higher valuation in an environment like this means more pressure to deliver on growth metrics hope for the best expect the worst entrepreneurs in africa should be bullish there are still a lot of underserved opportunities but it is one thing to make the case that the reset of startup valuations should not affect africa when in the end founders and local investors can only manage their actions not the market it will be really a year when companies that have been fundamentally strong really show up and are highlighted and companies that maybe have been selling more of a vision rather than the fundamentals or really haven t had the time yet to get to those fundamentals start to see things like flat rounds down rounds and a lot more pressure on the capital side deng said a global slowdown in startup investing may mean that startups looking to raise growth stage capital will meet stiffer headwinds at the end of last year wrote harriet agnew for financial times 70 per cent of so called growth investors in between early stage venture capital funds and private equity investors that target mature companies said they expected valuations to hold steady or rise according to a survey of the top 25 investors in the field by numis by the end of march 95 of these investors had flipped their position and anticipated lower valuations whether this will be the same for many of the seeded african startups reaching growth stage is not as clear not all investors seem to believe that the pullback in venture funding will affect africa zekarias amsalu founder and managing director of ibex frontier an ethiopian investment advisory told techcabal via email despite the vc slowdown at global scale adjusted to risk appetite i don t expect this affecting the continent as the real conversation about africa is about being in line for solid pipelines and co investing with those who know the ecosystem very well instead of slowdown according to amsalu there will be even more vc funding into africa both at early stage and growth stages as investors are becoming increasingly aware that those who misunderstand africa risk missing the greatest growth opportunity of the 21st century lexi novitske general partner at norrksen22 shares the sentiment she told techcrunch earlier this year what s happening is and we ve seen this in our acuity portfolio is that our founders as they grow and want to scale have to take time away from their business and spend it with silicon valley based investors who they have to educate on the africa growth story these investors are coming with their capital which is valuable of course but they re not coming with the local knowledge to help those companies scale across the continent and that s the missing middle that we re looking to unlock with this fund she added in january klarna co founder niklas adalberth s norrsken foundation announced the launch of a 200 million fund targeted at growth stage african startups on the other hand more money looks poised to flow to early stage deals as the big venture capital firms like tiger global move to pick younger companies potentially firing up valuations at earlier stages so the problem may not be a dearth of capital but with so much money expected to shift from late stage companies to younger firms will africa s early stage investors be able to stay disciplined and not optimize for just getting allocations besides the effects of 2 years of global splurging termed pandemic response are coming home to roost some of the biggest sponsors the imf s director kristalina georgieva admitted to short sighted thinking in said pandemic response as inflation food security and economic stability concerns increase heading into the western summer it only makes sense to expect to be shaken it will be naive not to and well managed companies will prepare accordingly for either tighter funding cycles or a deluge of global funds seeking early stage opportunities share this article
in her notorious speech on wednesday night at the lord mayor s banquet in london the tory foreign secretary and would be successor to boris johnson liz truss declared that britain is in a state of war with russia the fact that the working people of the uk have not been consulted about this life and death struggle is obvious they will have to do the sacrificing the fighting and the dying truss announced we are already stepping up in ukraine the war in ukraine is our war it is everyone s war because ukraine s victory is a strategic imperative for all of us again she is speaking for the ruling class the working class has never even been consulted about this life and death struggle that is a strategic imperative for the boss class truss admitted that this was not without risk but she insisted we have always been risk takers in other words whether british and us capitalism have a future is to be decided by whether the us uk alliance can destroy the soviet union and china and are able to force the working class to accept the enormous pauperisation required to raise the vast funds to fund such a war the imperialists want to restore their former glories and it is to be done off the backs of the uk and us working classes already stock markets are crashing and the cost of living is rocketing upwards in fact russia has already hit back at the imperialist powers high precision long range air based weapons of the russian aerospace forces have destroyed the production buildings of the artyom missile and space enterprise in kiev the russian ministry of defence said on friday in its daily briefing on the conflict in ukraine russian defence forces carried out a range of airstrikes on thursday destroying three power substations at ukrainian railway hubs and a tochka u missile launcher that it said had carried out an attack on the russian held city of kherson meanwhile vyacheslav volodin who as the speaker of the lower house of the russian parliament often voices the kremlin s views said that washington is trying to profit from the war by indebting and enslaving future generations of ukrainians lend lease is a commodity loan and not cheap many future generations of ukrainian citizens will pay for all the ammunition equipment and food that the united states will supply volodin said while the biden administration has sent tens of billions of dollars to aid ukraine russia has already said that the dramatic amount of western weapons sent for kiev means that we are fighting in a proxy war against nato the uk government has now said that it is deploying around 8 000 troops for exercises across eastern europe in a show of strength against russia according to defence officials the months long drills in countries stretching from finland to north macedonia also involve allies including france and the united states britain is deploying 72 challenger 2 tanks and 120 armoured fighting vehicles along with artillery guns helicopters and drones for the exercises some of which are already underway the security of europe has never been more important the uk s secretary of state for defence ben wallace said calling it one of the largest shared deployments since the cold war the uk and us working class must oppose this obvious preparation of an imperialist war to smash russia and china killing millions of people in the process lenin put forward the slogan in 1914 to turn the imperialist war into a civil war in fact the russian revolution was the direct outcome of the 1914 18 imperialist slaughter which the bolsheviks opposed from day one in britain the tuc have called a massive demonstration in london on 18 june this must become the platform for the calling of a general strike to kick out the tories bring in a workers government and begin the smashing of us and eu imperialism this is the only way to defeat the imperialist conspiracy to restore capitalism worldwide which would be a calamity for the peoples of the world

despite a decline in overall bond and loan issuance in the latin american region esg linked debt issuance thrived in 2021 and looks set to continue in the months ahead latin america s environmental social and governance esg debt markets stepped up in 2021 as issuers noted the strong appetite in the lender community to back credits linked to good sustainability practices according to data from debtwire par borrowers across the region tapped loan and bond markets for esg and sustainability linked debt facilities at an unprecedented rate in 2021 issuance rose to us 47 6 billion last year an exponential increase from the us 10 8 billion issued in 2020 and that momentum has carried into 2022 with us 11 9 billion of issuance already recorded this year issuers in latin america have noted the rapid growth in demand from global investors and institutions for investment opportunities linked to esg and sustainability criteria according to bloombergnef global sustainable debt issuances including green bonds and esg linked lending exceeded us 1 6 trillion in 2021 more than double the previous year s total the pandemic the growing impact of climate change and social justice movements like black lives matter and metoo have put corporate esg conduct under a microscope around the world institutional and retail investors are pivoting to companies and funds that can demonstrate positive esg practices issuer shareholders have also been supportive of companies linking their debt requirements to sustainability performance a wide range of issuers the emergence of sustainability linked bonds in particular which unlike green bonds do not need to be tied to specific eligible projects like wind or solar farms opened opportunities for a wider pool of issuers in the region sustainability linked bonds are connected to the delivery of agreed esg key performance indicators kpis rather than specific green assets or projects borrowers that meet or exceed their kpis such as carbon emissions reductions or workplace diversity targets continue to pay the initial interest rate on the loan or bond if kpis are missed by a certain deadline interest rate margins ratchet higher the emergence of these esg kpi ratchet structures has enabled a wider range of businesses operating across multiple sectors to align their capital raising requirements with esg performance latin american borrowers that have been able to articulate forward looking esg targets based on performance have found a willing pool of investors and lenders ready to back their bonds and loans brazilian personal care and cosmetics group natura cosme ticos for example raised a us 1 billion esg linked bond in may 2021 believed to be the largest single sustainability linked bond issue in latin america to date the notes mature in 2028 and will carry a 4 125 interest coupon to be paid on a half yearly basis proceeds will be used to refinance existing debt and strengthen the group s capital structures the bond commits natura which has been carbon neutral since 2007 to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by an additional 13 and achieve 25 of post consumer recycled plastic in its plastic packaging the targets must be met by the end of 2026 if missed the interest rate on the bonds will increase by 65 basis points from november 2027 other latin american blue chips that issued sustainability linked bonds in 2021 include brazilian paper producer klabin which secured a us 500 million 10 year sustainability bond priced at 3 2 and linked to natural resource consumption recycling and biodiversity metrics argentine online marketplace mercado libre raised us 400 million in sustainability notes priced at 2 375 and maturing in 2026 the proceeds will be used to finance or refinance projects with positive social and environmental impacts in january 2022 mexican cement and concrete firm gcc announced that it had completed the issuance of a us 500 million sustainability linked bond with an interest coupon of 3 614 and a maturity date of april 2032 the issuance is linked to a 22 reduction in co 2 emissions by 2030 failure to meet this target would see the interest rate on the bond rise by 75 basis points more recently in april 2022 aegea saneamento e participações s a the largest privately owned brazilian water and sanitation company priced a sustainability linked notes offering with kpis tied to the reduction of energy consumption and increases in leadership positions filled by women and black employees sovereigns step up governments in latin america have also taken advantage of the growing demand for green and sustainability linked debt products and positioned their sovereign capital raisings to secure financing from esg focused sources for example colombia has issued us 1 3 billion of green social and sustainability gss bonds since the middle of 2021 with most of this debt taken up by local funds eager to back the development of the sustainable debt market in the country in january 2022 chile secured us 4 billion from a three tranche sustainability bond issuance chile will use the proceeds for all projects that qualify as eligible green expenditures and eligible social expenditures under its sustainable bond framework latin american sovereigns have also been active in the esg and green loan space in february for example ecuador secured a us 700 million loan from the world bank to support the country s initiatives to build climate resilience reduce poverty and rebound from covid 19 disruption this is the first of three loans that have been lined up by the world bank to back ecuador s climate change and social development objectives mexico meanwhile has been a leader for sustainability linked debt issuance in latin america in 2020 mexico became the first country in the world to issue a sovereign bond connected to the un s sustainability development goals sdgs securing a seven year 890 million bond that was more than six times oversubscribed the country is considering further esg linked issuance on japan s bond market as a foreign issuer are the existing standards and regulations rigorous enough to ensure that sustainability linked issuance in latin america remains a viable option in the region only time will tell but the enthusiastic rise of esg linked debt has the potential to provide a long term pool of capital for qualifying corporate and sovereign borrowers in latin america and focus these borrowers on meeting important esg targets in the foreseeable future
crawfish continue to gain popularity around texas production acres increased by around 2 500 acres over the past three years texas a m agrilife photo by adam russell whether you call them crawfish crayfish or mudbugs todd sink ph d agrilife extension aquaculture specialist and director of the agrilife extension aquatic diagnostics lab bryan college station said the industry continues to grow in texas and although yield numbers were above average weights were down as a result of late winter cold the last three seasons have been difficult for the industry overall he said sink said 2020 was a good harvest year for crawfish producers but pandemic restrictions that led restaurants to close or limit capacity hurt demand for a food that is heavily dependent on social settings and events including crawfish boils then in 2021 winter storm uri delivered another blow he said the extended cold snap did not kill crawfish but it did stunt their growth which made them smaller at the season s peak numbers were typical but the weights were below average hurricane ida in late august 2021 presented another setback for overall crawfish production sink said the storm didn t impact texas producers on a large scale but some of louisiana s top crawfish producing areas were ruined by infrastructure damages and saltwater swells that reached farms sink said 2022 has been similar to 2021 with colder weather slowing crawfish growth and hurting poundage despite healthy numbers i would say we ve reached pre pandemic levels in that texas crawfish production was going up every year he said but the sizes have been below average so our poundage is probably not quite there yet crawfish prices higher the per pound price paid for crawfish depends on where and when consumers purchase them sink said lent the 40 day period from ash wednesday and ending on the holy saturday before easter is typically when crawfish season peaks sink said in 2020 on the first day of lent live crawfish were around 3 per pound or 90 per 30 pound bag around college station which is relatively close to farming operations in western louisiana and southeast texas this year live crawfish were 4 per pound or 120 per bag prices were even higher this year in metropolitan areas like austin san antonio and dallas where live crawfish prices routinely push beyond 4 per pound and even 5 per pound during peak demand sink said most of the time it comes down to how far you are from crawfish production locations he said the bigger the market and farther away like dallas they can get expensive fuel prices have amped up those prices this year as well but after easter prices begin falling sink said he d seen live crawfish for 2 35 per pound recently texas crawfish acres up sink said the recent calamities have not deterred growth of crawfish production in texas the state added around 2 500 acres of crawfish production over the past three years this brings the state s crawfish production capacity to approximately 9 500 acres crawfish boils are growing in popularity around the state the pandemic hurt crawfish demand as social gatherings were limited over the past two years texas a m agrilife extension service photo by adam russell pounds of crawfish are hard to pin down due to the lack of official reporting but sink believes producers average between 750 800 pounds per acre or 6 75 million to 7 2 million pounds of crawfish around 60 of texas acres are dual purpose flooded rice fields that provide habitat for crawfish farming until rice is planted those acres produce around 650 pounds of crawfish until they are shut down for rice planting acres dedicated solely to crawfish produce 900 950 pounds per acre and can be harvested a month to six weeks longer than rice acres sink said texas ranks no 2 in crawfish production and remains far behind louisiana in production but he estimates texas gained about as many acres as louisiana lost this past year to economic hardship and hurricane damages and invasive apple snail infestations texas maybe gained 1 3 but we are still small apples compared to louisiana he said in 2019 louisiana crawfish farmers harvested 150 million pounds of crawfish from 250 000 acres sink said the popularity of crawfish continues to grow a recent article by aquaculture north america reported crawfish popularity hit a record high this season based on domestic and foreign demand from countries like china it s been a strange couple of years for crawfish producers sink said i m looking forward to a year with a mild winter and without any

year net interest income for the first nine months of the fiscal year was 2 7 higher than the previous corresponding period as lower yields on earning assets were more than offset by reduced cost of

indexes posting hefty losses for april but it was a lot worse for the tech heavy nasdaq which sank more than 4 on friday and ended down more than 10 for april its worst month since 2008 the deep declines reflect a time of deep uncertainty at a moment when the economic landscape is changing rapidly here are the top three things sinking wall street big tech is going from winner to loser the pandemic was good for big tech earnings buoyed by low interest rates and the sudden pivot to quarantines and remote work companies from netflix to zoom had some banner months in terms of profits and what is good for big tech is generally good for markets given that information technology companies account for 28 percent of the s p 500 but things have changed and swiftly the world is learning to live with covid workers are returning to their offices demand for travel is booming and restaurants are filling up again that means big tech is now competing with other demands on peoples time michael

tech companies have also reported disappointing earnings or outlooks with a few exceptions such as meta the parent company of facebook amazon on thursday posted its first quarterly loss since 2015 partly because people returned to shopping in physical stores marking a sharp contrast to the pandemic when profits at the online retailer boomed meanwhile apple posted very strong results but its share price fell after it warned that covid 19 lockdowns in china could impact supply chains and hence sales the fed is fighting inflation and it could get rough it s not just big tech earnings though the market has already been under pressure as the u s deals with its highest inflation levels in about 40 years those surging prices have proven to be a persistent pernicious problem for the u s and global economies but investors aren t just worried about inflation itself which is at a 40 year high they are also unsure about whether the federal reserve will be successful fighting it samuel corum getty images getty images federal reserve board chair jerome powell before speaking at a luncheon at the 2022 nabe economic policy conference in washington d c on march 21 the fed is widely expected to raise interest rates by half a percentage point at its meeting next week at the fed s last meeting the central bank decided to hike interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point but fed chair powell jerome powell and other policy makers have since signaled they are preparing a much more aggressive response the fed is now widely expected to raise interest rates by half a percentage point at its follow up meeting next week and markets are bracing for more rate hikes this year i think that the market has wanted the fed to fight this fight says lori calvasina the head of u s equity strategy at rbc capital markets but i do think the market is unsettled by the idea of these big chunky kind of quick increases the fed has a tricky job to do the goal is to engineer a so called soft landing it s trying to slow down the economy just enough to cool down inflation but raising interest rates is never an exact science and investors fear the fed will be too aggressive and unintentionally tip the economy into a recession to be sure a recession is still not seen as a likely outcome but it s widely seen as a potential threat to the economy then there s china and the war in ukraine if the

in a stark departure from tradition whereby american presidents refrained from talking about the value of the american dollar in order to avoid shaking up global markets the 45th president of the united states regularly tweeted that he wanted the usd on the weaker side former president donald trump was blunt when asked by a wsj reporter why he wanted the american currency to weaken our companies can t compete with now because our currency is too strong and it s killing us trump might have left office more than a year ago but he s still to get his wish the u s dollar has continued to soar against its major rivals and even hitting multi year highs the ice dollar index dxy which measures the u s dollar against major rivals has climbed 15 so far this year to 103 65 the highest since january 2017 according to factset the dollar has gained the most against the japanese yen the japanese currency has lost nearly 20 against the greenback over the past year after crashing to levels not seen in more than two decades as the bank of japan vows to continue a dovish stance and pledged unlimited bond buying the bank of japan has vowed to defend a 0 25 yield on its 10 year fixed rate japanese government bond by buying those bonds every business day for as long as needed also under pressure are the sterling pound and euro both of which have sunk to multi year lows while a strong dollar can be a bonus for importers and americans vacationing abroad there are plenty of reasons why a brawny greenback is bad business overall practically a strong usd implies that exports of u s products will become more expensive for their clients abroad thus profitability of u s exporting companies drops also a strong dollar may imply that the fed is draining the market from cash tightening monetary policy thus reducing the supply of usds and thus boosting its value while at the same time there are fewer dollars to invest and move around he added peter iosif senior research analyst at noteris has told marketwatch finally u s stock markets sometimes experience an inverse relationship to the dollar with 2022 not even at the halfway mark the s p 500 is down nearly 12 putting it on track for the worst annual performance since the great financial crisis if those losses worsen or are even maintained but you can blame a hawkish fed for the turn of events fed fund rates changes in the federal funds rate are known to impact the u s dollar whenever the federal reserve increases the federal funds rate it typically increases interest rates throughout the economy higher yields attract investment capital from investors abroad seeking higher returns on interest rate products such as bonds in turn global investors sell their investments denominated in their local currencies in exchange for u s dollar denominated investments resulting in a stronger exchange rate in favor of the u s dollar the fed s hawkish stance was underlined on thursday when fed chairman jerome powell said a half point interest rate increase will be on the table at the central bank s monetary policy meeting next month with investors now pricing in over 240 basis points of tightening for the rest of this year and warnings by some economists that the fed s actions could make recession more likely by potentially pressuring spending or precipitating drops in stocks and other assets are not by any means unfounded an advance reading of first quarter u s economic growth is expected to show an annualized growth of just 1 1 down sharply from 6 9 in the final quarter of 2021 meanwhile expectations that the european central bank ecb will hike interest rates sooner rather than later have been adding more pressure to the euro with concerns that the currency bloc is headed for a sharp slowdown perhaps one of the few positives that can be drawn from a strengthening dollar is that it might help to slow down the growing u s trade deficit year to date the goods and services deficit increased 45 7 billion or 34 5 from the same period in 2021 exports increased 68 0 billion or 17 6 while imports increased 113 7 billion or 22 0 percent by michael kern via safehaven com
the mess that proves women s health isn t a priority former olympic swimmer sharron davies reveals she d ration her own hrt supplies as uk grapples with shortage every day since i started taking hrt five years ago i follow the same simple routine in the morning i apply two pumps of oestrogen gel to my thigh followed by a pump in the evening i get through a couple of bottles of gel a month and i ve always managed to get hold of it easily from my local pharmacy i also take a daily progesterone tablet to protect my uterus to discover that the medication i rely on to keep me fit and well is now in severely short supply has come as a shock and it appalls me that there are women already struggling to get hold of their prescriptions thankfully i ve got enough oestrogel which also helps protect me against a dangerous bone condition to see me through for another month i m hoping by the time i need more the supply issues will have been resolved if there s any hint that it s going to take longer than that then i ll soon start doing what my friend who lives in lancashire said she s resorted to doing and begin rationing my doses sharron davies above says that if there s any hint that it s going to take longer than a month to resolve the hrt supply shortage then she ll soon start doing what her friend said she s resorted to doing and begin rationing her doses oestrogel which is used by around 30 000 women in the uk has been in short supply lately leading to a hrt gold rush as women race to pharmacies to get their hands on dwindling stock the mail s manifesto to fix the hrt crisis 1 allow pharmacists to dispense substitutes if the prescribed hrt is out of stock currently if an hrt product is unavailable a pharmacist cannot substitute another product without consulting the prescribing gp forcing patients to go back and forth between doctor and pharmacy this could be avoided if pharmacists are allowed to alter prescriptions themselves they should also be able to move stock between different pharmacies 2 end the postcode lottery local areas all have different formularies or lists of approved hrt products meaning women face a postcode lottery of treatments a national list of all approved hrt products would ensure women have equal access and that alternative treatments are available faster 3 immediately introduce the once a year payment for hrt medication an annual prescription payment for hrt which could save women up to 200 a year is planned for april 2023 this must be implemented urgently especially during the cost of living squeeze so all women can afford treatment 4 bring forward mandatory requirement for medical students to be taught about the menopause a curriculum change needs to be introduced sooner than january 2023 when it is planned this will ensure all doctors have the training to recognise menopause symptoms which will help reduce the rate of misdiagnoses 5 provide menopause information to women at their nhs health check everyone who doesn t have a pre existing medical condition is invited for a free check up every five years between the ages of 40 and 74 women should be given information at these health checks to raise awareness of the menopause and treatment options advertisement taking less will tide me over but i know i won t feel myself on the days i forget to apply the gel i really feel it my brain starts to feel foggy and i get tired and generally unsettled the night sweats return which means i don t sleep other women who suffer more than i do will go through hell if they have to eke out their medication or go without which is why i give my whole hearted backing to the mail s campaign to put this right as soon as possible in this day and age for any women to be in a situation where they are having to ration something so crucial to good health is simply outrageous the fact that we re even in this mess that it didn t occur to anyone until it s now too late and demand has started outstripping supply is yet another example of how women s health simply isn t enough of a priority we all have someone in our lives a mother partner sister friend or colleague who is affected by menopause so this is not a crisis society can afford to ignore on social media i see people post about the stress of ringing round chemists trying to find one that has had a delivery and sharing their relief when they get their prescription even part fulfilled being able to collect the medicine your doctor has agreed you need should not feel like winning the lottery there will be those who argue that previous generations got through the menopause without medical intervention so why can t we but those women suffered how can anyone want a return to those dark days we now have the medical knowledge to help women sail through midlife without debilitating symptoms this is progress that is well worth fighting for when i started taking hrt it was for me a revelation i only fully appreciated just how much falling oestrogen levels had been impacting my daily life once they started being topped up again within weeks i had more energy my brain felt sharper i was sleeping better and the wretched night sweats keeping me awake had stopped my skin and hair were no longer dry and dull meaning i even looked better it wasn t that i felt different it was more that i felt like my old self again the woman i had been years earlier there were about 512 000 nhs prescriptions written for female sex hormones and their modulators in england in february the latest official data shows compared to 265 000 in march 2017 many of these will be hrt medications but some may include other female hormone drugs such as contraceptives left to right dr louise newson mariella frostrup mp carolyn harris penny lancaster and davina mccall with protesters outside the houses of parliament in london demonstrating against ongoing prescription charges for hrt i was 55 at the time and only discovered i needed hrt when i returned home from a horse riding holiday in arizona with my son finlay now 15 with three broken vertebrae i hadn t fallen off my horse or had any kind of accident it was simply the act of twisting and turning as i pulled this horse around various obstacles that had damaged my spine i came home in pain an x ray showed the fractures and after a further scan i was diagnosed with osteopenia meaning my bone density was low the condition is a precursor to the more serious bone thinning condition osteoporosis i was offered medication you can take the same medicine prescribed for osteoporosis but this comes with side effects such as digestive problems and joint pain the other option was hrt which helps increase bone density as i was suffering with night sweats it made sense to choose this option let s just hope the current shortages are fixed soon otherwise women will feel horribly let down as though once again our needs come as an afterthought at a time in our lives when we deserve easy access to a treatment that helps us enjoy life to the full it ll impact our professional lives we won t be able to be there in the same way for our families everyone suffers

photo credit photographee eu shutterstock despite the challenges that covid 19 created for the u s economy over the last two years recent months have shown major signs of positive economic news for one the u s bureau of economic analysis estimated that gdp increased by 7 in the last quarter of 2021 an impressive figure even during another spike in covid cases at the end of last year and while inflation has been a significant pressure on many households finances workers in almost every industry have seen wage growth since covid 19 began the simultaneous increases in economic productivity and wages are particularly noteworthy because of the increasing gap between the two in recent years from 1948 to around 1980 total economic productivity and worker compensation for non supervisory positions grew at roughly the same pace over that span economic productivity increased by 113 and compensation grew by 102 since the beginning of the 1980s economic productivity has continued to grow steadily but wage growth has not kept up from 1980 to 2000 real wages were almost completely stagnant and while compensation has increased more since 2000 the rate of wage growth lags behind the rate for productivity in 2020 economic productivity had seen a cumulative 253 increase since 1948 while real wages were up only 144 over that span a significant portion of the gap between productivity growth and wage growth can be attributed to advances in computing automation and other technologies in recent decades while these advances have provided many benefits to the economy the gap between productivity and wage growth is closely related to rising levels of economic inequality in the u s rapidly growing industries have seen more proportional wage increases even as other fields continue to stagnate so workers in more productive fields are significantly better off and in many cases economic productivity that is not translated into increased compensation is likely to be retained by a business s executives or shareholders these disparities also emerge according to geography certain locations have clusters of businesses in fields with high growth in productivity such as finance and banking in the new york city metro or tech in silicon valley as businesses and industries in these locations continue to grow their success provides the conditions and resources to continue growing

philadelphia pa accesswire april 29 2022 the above noted abrdn u s closed end funds the funds or individually the fund today announced that the funds paid the distributions noted in the table below on april 29 2022 on a per share basis to all shareholders of record as of april 22 2022 ex dividend date april 21 2022 each fund has adopted a distribution policy to provide investors with a stable distribution out of current income supplemented by realized capital gains and to the extent necessary paid in capital under applicable u s tax rules the amount and character of distributable income for each fund s fiscal year can be finally determined only as of the end of the fund s fiscal year however under section 19 of the investment company act of 1940 as amended the 1940 act and related rules the funds may be required to indicate to shareholders the estimated source of certain distributions to shareholders the following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the sources of the distributions for purposes of section 19 of the 1940 act and the rules adopted thereunder the tables have been computed based on generally accepted accounting principles the tables include estimated amounts and percentages for the current distributions paid this month as well as for the cumulative distributions paid relating to fiscal year to date from the following sources net investment income net realized short term capital gains net realized long term capital gains and return of capital the estimated compositions of the distributions may vary because the estimated composition may be impacted by future income expenses and realized gains and losses on securities and currencies each fund s estimated sources of the current distribution paid this month and for its current fiscal year to date are as follows asgi has a 9 30 fiscal year end fax has a 10 31 fiscal year end includes currency gains where the estimated amounts above show a portion of the distribution to be a return of capital it means that fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains therefore a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital a return of capital may occur for example when some or all of the money that you invested in a fund is paid back to you a return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the fund s investment performance and should not be confused with yield or income the amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes the final determination of the source of all distributions for the current year will only be made after year end the actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the fund s investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations after the end of each calendar year a form 1099 div will be sent to shareholders for the prior calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes the following table provides the funds total return performance based on net asset value nav over various time periods compared to the funds annualized and cumulative distribution rates 1 return data is net of all fund expenses and fees and assumes the reinvestment of all distributions reinvested at prices obtained under the fund s dividend reinvestment plan 2 based on the fund s nav as of march 31 2022 3 the fund launched within the past 5 years the performance and distribution rate information presented reflects data from inception july 29 2020 through march 31 2022 shareholders should not draw any conclusions about a fund s investment performance from the amount of the fund s current distributions or from the terms of the distribution policy the distribution policy while nav performance may be indicative of the fund s investment performance it does not measure the value of a shareholder s investment in the fund the value of a shareholder s investment in the fund is determined by the fund s market price which is based on the supply and demand for the fund s shares in the open market pursuant to an exemptive order granted by the securities and exchange commission the funds may distribute any long term capital gains more frequently than the limits provided in section 19 b under the 1940 act and rule 19b 1 thereunder therefore distributions paid by the funds during the year may include net income short term capital gains long term capital gains and or a return of capital net income dividends and short term capital gain dividends while generally taxable at ordinary income rates may be eligible to the extent of qualified dividend income earned by the funds to be taxed at a lower rate not to exceed the maximum rate applicable to your long term capital gains distributions made in any calendar year in excess of investment company taxable income and net capital gain are treated as taxable ordinary dividends to the extent of undistributed earnings and profits and then as a return of capital that reduces the adjusted basis in the shares held to the extent return of capital distributions exceed the adjusted basis in the shares held capital gain is recognized with a holding period based on the period the shares have been held at the date such amount is received the payment of distributions in accordance with the distribution policy may result in a decrease in the fund s net assets a decrease in the fund s net assets may cause an increase in the fund s annual operating expense ratio and a decrease in the fund s market price per share to the extent the market price correlates closely to the fund s net asset value per share the distribution policy may also negatively affect the fund s investment activities to the extent that the fund is required to hold larger cash positions than it typically would hold or to the extent that the fund must liquidate securities that it would not have sold for the purpose of paying the distribution each fund s board has the right to amend suspend or terminate the distribution policy at any time the amendment suspension or termination of the distribution policy may affect the fund s market price per share investors should consult their tax advisor regarding federal state and local tax

stocks sank on friday ending what has been a miserable month for markets especially for big tech the dow jones industrial average lost nearly 1 000 points while the s p 500 lost more than 3 with both indexes posting hefty losses for april but it was a lot worse for the tech heavy nasdaq which sank more than 4 on friday and ended down more than 10 for april its worst month since 2008 the deep declines reflect a time of deep uncertainty at a moment when the economic landscape is changing rapidly here are the top three things sinking wall street big tech is going from winner to loser the pandemic was good for big tech earnings buoyed by low interest rates and the sudden pivot to quarantines and remote work companies from netflix to zoom had some banner months in terms of profits and what is good for big tech is generally good for markets given that information technology companies account for 28 percent of the s p 500 but things have changed and swiftly the world is learning to live with covid workers are returning to their offices demand for travel is booming and restaurants are filling up again that means big tech is now competing with other demands on peoples time michael

last week after announcing it lost subscribers in the first three months of the year the first time that s happened in more than a decade the announcement sent shares down by more than 40 other big tech companies have also reported disappointing earnings or outlooks with a few exceptions such as meta the parent company of facebook amazon on thursday posted its first quarterly loss since 2015

the market has already been under pressure as the u s deals with its highest inflation levels in about 40 years those surging prices have proven to be a persistent pernicious problem for the u s and

getty images getty images federal reserve board chair jerome powell before speaking at a luncheon at the 2022 nabe economic policy conference in washington d c on march 21 the fed is widely expected to raise interest rates by half a percentage point at its meeting next week at the fed s last meeting the central bank decided to hike interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point but fed chair powell jerome powell and other policy makers have since signaled they are preparing a much more aggressive response the fed is now widely expected to raise interest rates by half a percentage point at its follow up meeting next week and markets are bracing for more rate hikes this year i think that the market has wanted the fed to fight this fight says lori calvasina the head of u s equity strategy

the bureau of economic analysis bea released march and first quarter q1 data today on personal income and outlays the results show an increase in q1 wages of 4 5 however inflation is running 6 6 on the items workers need to purchase the net result on main street is unsustainable inside the economy the u s stock market is responding negatively to this release it s easy to get caught up in the esoteric weeds so my effort here is to show just what is happening by putting an overlay of checkbook economics into the bea release if we take out the noise it is very easy to see the problem i have modified table 4 to put the results into simple understandable terms table 4 source by looking at the far right column q1 2022 you can see the problem wage growth at 268 00 minus taxes paid 51 40 leaves disposable income or take home pay at 216 60 however our expenses for living shelter food utilities energy etc cost 398 50 leaving a deficit for our income of 181 90 we either dip into our savings to cover our expenses or we go into debt this is not sustainable if you look at q1 last year you can clearly see where all of the inflation is coming from that massive increase in income came from the federal covid bailout and stimulus funds 4 trillion directly pumped into the economy at a time when biden justified massive bailout spending by saying they needed to offset the economic cost of prior covid intervention businesses and workers shut down that is the primary source of current inflation if you take out that q1 spend from the economic activity the u s economy was already contracting this is why cth has continued to say our economy was in a state of contraction since june july of 2021 everything after that massive dump of money was false economic activity the gdp growth was artificial that bailout spending dried up in the fall and winter of last year and now we see the 2022 gdp going negative in essence the gdp contraction that we should have seen in 2021 was delayed by the massive infusion of cash in april of 2021 however that massive infusion of cash created inflation that inflation has been a crisis that grew from the summer of 2021 to its apex in the last month so what does all of this mean let s cut to the chase as cth accurately predicted previously inflation comes in waves because supplier purchases are done in contract terms of 30 60 and 90 days as each contract for purchased goods expires the new prices for future goods are changed we see waves of inflation in roughly three month increments and while prices were rising faster on a daily and weekly basis those wave cycles started in october of 2021 wave 1 came oct nov dec 2021 wave 2 came jan feb march 2022 we talked about each wave as it was coming and as it arrived ultimately wave 2 was bigger than wave 1 as the cumulative increases the total supply chain and manufacturing flowed into the products we purchase where are we now there are two sub sets inflation on durable goods is now at the apex the durable goods price flatlines right now as all production costs are embedded in the cost of the product the prices of finished goods are now set inflation has caught up to production the prices of on shelf and inbound deliveries are higher but stable now we enter the phase where consumer demand becomes the dominant factor in price simultaneously demand is contracting because the higher rate of inflation in highly consumable goods energy utility costs housing gasoline food is now a spending priority for consumers and eating a larger portion of wages as a result the price of durable goods is now dependent on the ability of the consumer to pay for them sellers of durable goods are going to be chasing a smaller customer base who can afford them durable goods prices will remain static and now durable goods prices will likely become part of the competitive equation the businesses within the durable goods sector are going to have to find customers in order to stay in business incentives will show up this spring summer as businesses need customers if you are a wise careful and smart shopper for durable goods you will find deals inflation on consumable goods is not yet at the apex it s likely close to production parity but prices pressures are still volatile in the upward direction the price of gasoline and transportation overall will be a big factor in current prices of highly consumable goods we should see oil gas and energy prices stabilize first rents will likely increase for another three to six months then stabilize and in my opinion start to fall late summer housing overall is far more challenging as mortgage rates are climbing refinancing as a method to bridge the income gap between wages and expenses is a big problem now in this phase there is going to be a period of massive fluctuations and instability in the housing market depending on region and employment stability as the recession phase of the total economy is going to bite hard for most regions with mixed blend underlying economies products and services macro housing prices have peaked in the last 15 days for ordinary housing purchases not institutional investments we should start to see price decreases again as the customer base for high prices shrinks obviously this is driven by inventory and regional specifics however i am talking in the aggregate within the macro housing situation food prices still have some upward pressures through memorial day then a period of stability will settle before the third wave of food inflation hits later in the summer fall of this year that s when the increases in farming costs will reach the fork late summer and fall food prices will likely be 15 to 20 percent higher than current prices at the supermarket the fresh foods will be on the upper side of the future price wave and the processed foods on the lower end however both will increase the last factors in the food price are far more challenging to predict supply any problems within the food production cycle that impacts supply will drive prices beyond what we already expect if there are major shortages the prices will go even higher this food environment is unfortunately the best time for big agriculture the wall street multinationals to make the most profit the big ag multinationals will exploit every possible angle within inventory supply and harvest controls to maximize their profit equation there are a great deal of unknown global variables right now that could impact u s food prices later this year the only certainty is that prices will further increase joe biden sucks footnote pray for good weather and stability this summer if it is an active hurricane season gasoline oil exploration and refinery issues will make matters worse the southern coastal areas especially florida louisiana and texas need a non dramatic summer

companies in some eu countries including germany hungary and slovakia have agreed to pay for gas in euros through russian bank gazprombank which will then convert the payments into roubles the financial times has reported that gas companies in austria and italy are also planning to open accounts with gazprombank the eu said last week that if buyers of russian gas could complete payments in euros and get confirmation of this before any conversion into roubles took place that would not breach sanctions however there are different views among countries on how to interpret its initial guidance and eu diplomats have said they want more clarity on the issue how much gas does russia supply to europe n 2019 russia accounted for 41 of the eu s natural gas imports if russian gas supplies to europe dried up italy and germany would be especially vulnerable as they import the most gas russia only provides about 5 of the uk s gas supplies and the us does not import any russian gas russia sends gas to europe through several main pipelines the gas is collected in regional storage hubs and then distributed across the continent poland s gas storage is around 76 full but bulgaria s sits around 17 this is not a short term issue the problem will be next winter so it is key to replenish storage says energy policy research analyst simone tagliapietra what are the alternatives to russian gas bulgaria says it is looking to increase gas imports from azerbaijan as well as making deals with turkey and greece poland s deputy foreign minister told the bbc there were options to get the gas from other partners including the us and gulf nations europe could turn to existing gas exporters such qatar algeria or nigeria but there are practical obstacles to expanding production quickly the us has agreed to ship an additional 15 billion cubic metres of liquified natural gas lng to europe by the end of this year europe could also increase its use of other energy sources but doing so is not quick or easy the eu has proposed a plan to make europe independent from russian fossil fuels before 2030 including measures to diversify gas supplies and replace gas in heating and power generation what sanctions are there on russian oil and gas the us has declared a complete ban on russian oil gas and coal imports the uk is to phase out russian oil by the end of the year and the eu is reducing gas imports by two thirds russia has warned banning its oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market despite sanctions since the start of the war russia has almost doubled its earnings from selling fossil fuels to the eu according to the centre for research on energy and clean air as oil and gas prices have soared how much oil does russia export russia is the world s third biggest producer after the us and saudi arabia of about five million barrels of crude oil it exports each day more than half went to europe before sanctions were announced russian imports accounted for 8 of total uk oil demand and 3 of us demand what about alternative oil supplies research analyst ben mcwilliams says it should be easier to find alternative suppliers for oil than for gas because while some comes from russia there s also a lot of shipments from elsewhere some iea members have released the equivalent of 120 million barrels from oil stocks the largest stock release in its history us president joe biden ordered a major release of oil from america s reserves in an effort to bring down high fuel costs the us also wants saudi arabia to increase its oil production and is looking at relaxing sanctions on venezuela s oil what will happen to my heating and fuel bills consumers will face rising energy and fuel bills heating prices already high are likely to increase even more if russia restricts gas exports to europe in the uk household energy bills have been kept in check by an energy price cap but bills rose 700 to about 2 000 in april when the cap was increased they are expected to reach about 3 000 when the cap is increased again this autumn uk petrol and diesel prices have also soared and the government has announced a cut in fuel duty as motorists

a wave of ashkenazi immigrants fleeing persecution in central and eastern europe starting in the 1880s helped bring jewish deli culture to the united states in the new exhibit i ll have what she s having at the skirball cultural center cate thurston and laura mart who curated the show along with lara rabinovitch explore how they imported their traditions to create a new american restaurant the following interview has been edited for length and clarity kcrw how did immigration to the u s create the deli where did the immigrants come from and when did they start arriving laura mart we are looking at the so called influx of ashkenazi jewish immigrants from central and eastern europe from the 1880s to 1924 when the emergency quota act was passed and this is a period where you have jewish immigrants who are fleeing persecution fleeing pogroms violent attacks fleeing really hostile societies often where they had previously lived and then had come under a good amount of persecution again so many of them made their ways to the united states where they imported their traditions we have objects in the exhibition that speak to this suitcases and candlesticks as well as items related to foodways so we re looking at how these immigrants adapted their foodways and their traditions from all over central and eastern europe very different places with different cuisines and traditions and brought them all together under one roof at the deli was there any cross pollination from non jewish german immigrants who had also been coming over during this general time period and who had experience with processing meat cate thurston absolutely the german delicatessen is in many ways the foreigner of the jewish delicatessen and many of the items there are the same seltzer mustard dark breads and so there is this cross pollination with german delicatessen but there is cross pollination with the peoples in north america as the deli expands outward from east to west the deli menu changes you have rice and beans on the menu at places like wolfies and you have health foods reflected in jewish delicatessen jewish delicatessen is an amalgamation of jewish people in america but it s also an amalgamation of american foods coming together under one roof where and when did we start seeing the jewish deli do we know which was the first laura mart like many things related to the restaurant industry the first jewish delicatessen is the stuff of legend and speculation we have a fascinating object a tiny matchbook in the exhibition from a deli called sussman volk was in new york and it claims to have opened in 1887 which would be one year before katz s deli was founded many historians doubt that this is in fact when sussman volk opened it has since closed but it was perhaps more of a marketing ploy than truth katz s deli was founded in 1888 originally called iceland brothers and it was a different deli but this coming together of the different jewish european foodways in a brick and mortar restaurant started around the 1880s but at the same time you still had a lot of new jewish immigrant arrivals who are doing street vending we focus on that in the show with a section called street to shops where we look at how immigrants sold pickled herring out of barrels and pickles bread and bagels out of pushcarts this food began in humble ways with immigrant entrepreneurs who started their businesses with whatever resources they had available to them moving into the 1910s and 1920s delis started to develop brick and mortar locations where there would be a counter service with different prepared dishes this was a place where people would buy their specialty kosher processed foods later in the 1920s through 1940s we are looking at the second generation jewish americans the children of immigrants who maybe are a bit more well off than their parents generation had been and this is when you start to get more luxurious delis that have sit down dining rooms elvis presley visits glassman s deli and market in los angeles in 1969 credit bonar family collection i think it also becomes a family destination of root reaffirmation once these large restaurants start to happen cate thurston absolutely the deli becomes more than just a place to eat the deli becomes a place to gather and a place to gather for all peoples it s woven into the urban american fabric often you have waves of jewish immigration that are a precursor to other waves of immigration from folks from all over the world and these delis really serve as a hub within communities where folks can eat late they can break fast they can go together as a family and so i think that s a really insightful point about the delicatessen as a place for families and a place of gathering were delis from the very beginning meat centered there must have been separate appetizing stores because of kosher laws were the meat portions always as insane as they ve become in these monster sandwiches laura mart i love that question yes originally there were two distinct traditions and many establishments still follow these guidelines there were delis that served meat based dishes grains and other neutral foods and then appetizing stores served fish and dairy places like russ and daughters is an appetizing store we feature it in the exhibition to talk about this distinction and then as american jews became more used to mainstream styles of dining many delis started to serve dairy as well and lost that kosher distinction guns n roses were known to frequent canter s deli on fairfax during their early days as a band in the 1980s photo by jack lue new york may be the epicenter of jewish delis but la has had its fair share where surnames are frequently used have delis always been a family affair cate thurston one of the things that s really interesting in the exhibition that we feature are these family delicatessens that pass down from one generation to the next but a tweak on that family story there are delis that we featured in the exhibition david s brisket house in brooklyn comes to mind where the deli passes from one family to another family so it s no longer going along a line of lineage in terms of descendants but another family is partaking in the management care and maintenance of the restaurant what s so interesting about david s brisket house is that it was originally started by a russian jewish immigrant and then it was run in partnership with a friend who was muslim and now it is run by yemeni muslim immigrants and so we see these different immigration stories these different family stories all coalescing at the deli i love that this menu is from stage delicatessen in new york city in 1956 courtesy of the dorot jewish division the new york public library tell us about some of the delis you featured and why you chose them laura mart one of the delis that we feature in the exhibition is a deli called drexler s deli it s now closed drexler s was in north hollywood and it was a kosher deli for its whole existence it opened in the early 1950s and closed in the 1990s and what s so special about drexler s deli is the story rena drexler was a survivor of the holocaust she was liberated from auschwitz on her 18th birthday she was looking for her family in poland and in munich and she met her husband harry there where they started to work together and in a deli and then soon thereafter they decided to move to the united states after a few years of saving their money they opened drexler s deli where they served kosher specialties and all sorts of groceries to the local community drexler s became a community anchor for these people not only because it was a place where they could buy what they needed like kosher groceries but also because rena and harry were really known for their listening over the years rena said she learned how to trust people again by serving at the deli canter s deli on fairfax originated on the east coast before heading west photo by david george alamy stock photo what is your favorite deli order cate thurston laura and i have had the pleasure of eating a lot of deli together and i think one of the things that s fun is we switch it up a lot my can t fail that i have to have at every delicatessen is a pastrami sandwich i ve got to have it whether it s one bite or a whole sandwich i have to eat it laura mart we often share the pastrami sandwich because we like to order so much food probably enough to feed four adults for three days i like to get matzah ball soup i think it s fascinating how different restaurants will make the matzah balls in a different size and sometimes they float and they re beautiful and sometimes they re a little denser but i love chicken soup they call it jewish penicillin i m pretty sure it s a health food probably the closest thing to health food that you can possibly get at a deli maybe celery soda as a close second

potential slowdown in consumer spending along with rising inflation prices for everything from food to gas have been rising as the economy recovers from the pandemic and there has been a big disconnect between higher demand and lagging supplies russia s invasion of ukraine has only added to inflation worries as it drives price increases for oil natural gas wheat and corn the commerce department on friday reported that an inflation gauge closely tracked by the federal reserve surged 6 6 in march compared with a year ago the highest 12 month jump in four decades and further evidence that spiking prices are pressuring household budgets and the health of the economy the latest report on rising u s inflation follows a report from statistics agency eurostat that shows inflation hit a record high in april of 7 5 for the 19 countries that use the euro bond yields rose following the hot readings on inflation the yield on the 10 year treasury rose to 2 92 from 2 85 persistently rising inflation has prompted central banks to raise interest rates in order to temper the impact on businesses and consumers much of the anxiety on wall street in april has centered around how quickly the fed will raise its benchmark interest rate and whether an aggressive series of hikes will crimp economic growth the chair of the fed has indicated the central bank may raise short term interest rates by double the usual amount at upcoming meetings starting next week it has already raised its key overnight rate once the first such increase since 2018 and wall street is expecting several big increases over the coming months investors spent much of april shifting money away from big tech companies whose stock values benefit from low interest rates to areas considered less risky the s p 500 s consumer staples sector which includes many household and personal goods makers was the only sector in the benchmark index to make gains in april other safe play sectors such as utilities held up better than the broader market while technology and communications stocks are among the biggest losers
