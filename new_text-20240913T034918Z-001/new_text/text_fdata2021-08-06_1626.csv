expense or income may not be necessarily reflective of the actual financial performance of our business the company believes that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are useful to investors because they i allow investors to compare performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis by removing from operating results the impact of items that do not reflect core operating performance ii are used by our board of directors and management to assess our performance iii may subject to the limitations described below enable investors to compare the performance of the company to its competitors and iv provide additional tools for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends the company believes that pro forma revenue is useful to investors because they allow investors to compare performance of the combined company over various reporting periods on a consistent basis the company believes that net capex provide useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations however adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and accordingly should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity these non gaap measures should not be considered in isolation from or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with gaap other companies may calculate adjusted ebitda and other non gaap financial measures differently and therefore the

explained below see reconciliation of non gaap financial measures included in this press release information reconciling forward looking adjusted ebitda to gaap financial measures is unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort we cannot provide reconciliations of forward looking adjusted ebitda to gaap financial measures because certain items required for such reconciliations are

of adjusted ebitda that we believe will be achieved we cannot accurately predict all the components of the adjusted ebitda calculation the company provides adjusted ebitda guidance because we believe

periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends we evaluate business segment performance on adjusted ebitda a non gaap measure that excludes certain items as described in the reconciliation of our consolidated net income loss to adjusted ebitda reconciliation below we believe that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the company we also regularly evaluate gross profit by segment to assist in the assessment of the operational performance of each operating segment we consider adjusted ebitda to be the more important metric because it more fully captures the business performance of the segments inclusive of indirect costs we also evaluate free cash flow a non gaap measure that provides useful information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements adjusted ebitda we define ebitda as net income loss plus interest income expense income tax expense benefit depreciation and amortization our adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda reflects the following further adjustments to ebitda to exclude certain non cash items and the effect of what we consider transactions or events not related to our core business operations currency gains losses net on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than the subsidiaries functional currency substantially all such currency gains losses are unrealized and attributable to financings due to and from affiliated companies goodwill and other impairment charges related to non cash costs associated with impairment charges to goodwill other intangibles rental fleet and property plant and equipment restructuring costs lease impairment expense and other related charges

relocation expenses employee training costs and other costs required to realize cost or revenue synergies non cash charges for stock compensation plans other expense includes consulting expenses related to certain one time projects financing costs not classified as interest expense and gains and losses on disposals of property plant and equipment adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider the measure in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss cash flow from operations or other methods of analyzing the company s results as reported under us gaap some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs adjusted ebitda does not reflect our interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness adjusted ebitda does not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes adjusted ebitda does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments adjusted ebitda does not reflect the impact on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure because of these limitations adjusted ebitda should not be considered as discretionary cash available to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to meet our obligations the following tables provide unaudited reconciliations of net income loss to adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda three months ended june 30 six months

inflation readings in the united states have shot up in recent months labour markets are extremely tight in one recent survey 46 of small business owners said they could not find workers to fill open jobs and a net 39 reported having increased their employees compensation yet at the time of this writing the yield on ten year treasury bonds is 1 24 well below the ten year breakeven inflation rate of 2 4 at the same time stock markets are flirting with all time highs something in all this does not add up perhaps the bond markets believe the us federal reserve when it suggests that current inflationary pressures are transitory and that the fed can hold policy interest rates down for an extended period if so growth bolstered by pent up savings and the additional government spending currently being negotiated in congress should be reasonable and inflation should remain around the fed s target the breakeven inflation rate also seems to be pointing to this scenario but that doesn t explain why the ten year treasury rate is so low suggesting negative real rates over the next decade what if it is right perhaps the spread of the covid 19 delta variant will prompt fresh lockdowns in developed countries and damage emerging markets even more perhaps more nasty variants will emerge and perhaps the negotiations in congress will break down with even the bipartisan infrastructure bill failing to pass in this scenario however it would be hard to justify the stock market buoyancy and breakeven inflation rate one common factor driving up both stock and bond prices thus lowering bond yields could be asset managers search for yield owing to the conditions created by extremely accommodative monetary policies this would explain why the prices of stocks including meme stocks bonds cryptocurrencies and housing are all a little frothy at the same time to those who care about sound asset prices fed chair jerome powell s announcement last week that the economy had made progress toward the point where the fed might end its 120bn monthly bond buying programme was good news phasing out quantitative easing qe is the first step toward monetary policy normalisation which itself is necessary to alleviate the pressure on asset managers to produce impossible returns in a low yield environment the beginning of the end of qe would not please everyone though some economists see a significant downside to withdrawing monetary accommodation before it is clear that inflation has taken off gone is the old received wisdom that if you are staring inflation in the eyeballs it is already too late to beat it down without a costly fight two decades of persistently low inflation have convinced many central bankers that they can wait and yet even if monetary policymakers are not overly concerned about high asset prices or inflation they should be worried about another risk that prolonged qe intensifies the government s fiscal exposure to future interest rate hikes while government debt has soared government interest payments remain low and have even shrunk as a share of gdp in some countries over the last two decades as such many economists are not worried that government debt in advanced economies is approaching its post world war ii high but what if interest rates start moving up as inflation takes hold if government debt is around 125 of gdp every percentage point increase in interest rates translates into a 1 25 percentage point increase in the annual fiscal deficit as a share of gdp that is nothing to shrug at with interest rates normally rising by a few percentage points over the course of a business cycle government debt can quickly become stressful to this thoughtful economists might respond wait a minute not all the debt has to be rolled over quickly but that is no reason for complacency the average maturity for government debt is much lower in other countries not least the us where it is only 5 8 years moreover what matters is not the average debt maturity which can be skewed by a few long dated bonds but rather the amount of debt that will mature quickly and must be rolled over at a higher rate project syndicate

remnants from a homeless camp outside of the geraldine e king women s center is pictured after police officers cleared out the area in salt lake city on thursday aug 5 2021 salt lake city mayor erin mendenhall on thursday backed the call to add 300 additional emergency shelter beds to salt lake county s homeless system i want any utahn who needs shelter who wants a warm safe place to sleep at night to have that option by december of this year we cannot go another year let alone another winter without the adequate space to shelter every single person who is out there on the street right now mendenhall said the data says the target is 300 beds and that need has to be met in order for all the coordinating systems that facilitate homeless services in our city and county to function properly but the mayor didn t say where the beds will go rather she called on other partners outside of salt lake city including state leaders and other salt lake county cities to step up i m here today to ask that the state support the coalition and its partners to do whatever it takes to get those beds online quickly before winter and that the beds be located not only in salt lake city but also in other parts of salt lake county mendenhall said she noted salt lake city currently hosts most of the 1 500 emergency shelter beds already part of the county s homeless system and spends upward of 15 million a year on homeless issues so it s time other cities do more and fast she said utah s homeless can t afford to go another winter without it wayne niederhauser the state s chief homeless services coordinator laurie hopkins executive director of shelter the homeless and andrew johnston salt lake city s director of homelessness policy and outreach back row left to right listen as salt lake city mayor erin mendenhall backs a call to add 300 additional emergency shelter beds to salt lake county s homeless system during a press conference outside the city county building on thursday aug 5 2021 spenser heaps deseret news coalition calls for action on housing the mayor announced her support for the additional beds after the salt lake valley coalition to end homelessness issued a call tuesday for the community to support more affordable housing and at least 300 additional homeless overflow beds to better help salt lake county s homeless population while also addressing concerns with those living on the streets that s what service providers say is needed to ensure that no one who wants to bed inside will be forced to camp outside mendenhall said the city agrees with that conclusion the lack of affordable housing the pandemic and the lack of overflow beds has had a significant negative impact on those experiencing homelessness and the communities around them the coalition said in a statement on tuesday we also understand the concerns of local business owners and residents and concur that individuals who are unsheltered in our community need safe places to move toward stability and self sufficiency the coalition added further criminalizing the poor and burdening our criminal justice systems and jails cannot fill the gap in needed housing and shelter options a woman opens a cooler as she walks around a homeless campsite on the side of the street in salt lake city on tuesday july 27 2021 utah has released its annual homeless report scott g winterton deseret news so the group called on private businesses community members cities the county and state to support the creation of 450 permanent supportive housing units along with at least 300 emergency overflow beds as well as operational funding to address this immediate need mendenhall said the additional beds are needed so salt lake city can actually enforce its camping ordinance which has been increasingly difficult as homeless encampments have grown more and more entrenched throughout the city without those beds being available salt lake city cannot begin to consistently enforce its camping and will continue to struggle to deal more directly with the very real issue we have of criminals attempting to exploit and prey upon homeless encampments mendenhall said we will also continue to be unable to meet our goal of ensuring the public spaces stay clean safe and accessible to everyone mendenhall also asked the state to support the city s law enforcement efforts by increasing mitigation funding for communities that host homeless resource centers and she proposed the state contribute funding to salt lake city s downtown ambassador program if the state county and other partners create all 300 beds mendenhall promised the city will be able to begin more widespread and consistent enforcement of its camping ordinance that s our commitment but our commitment depends on our partners in the system to fulfill their roles too she said mendenhall s announcement comes after 63 million in state and private dollars funded the creation of three new homeless resource centers meant to transform salt lake county s system to be more housing and social services focused rather than one that warehouses people capacity at resource centers has been a concern since the idea s conception some homeless advocates worried they obviously wouldn t be big enough to replace the road home s more than 1 000 bed downtown shelter which was shut down but political leaders and other homeless advocates argued the new centers combined with the existing 300 bed midvale family shelter and increased diversion efforts affordable housing rental assistance motel vouchers and efforts to place people with family first not shelter would decrease the burden on shelters since the new homeless resource centers opened however less affordable housing is available than anticipated the salt lake valley coalition said and there is no ability to flex within the facilities to meet the varying capacity requirements since their openings the homeless resource centers have operated at or near capacity they ve consistently operated at an average of 90 capacity according to the coalition to address the unmet needs the coalition supports efforts to develop additional housing units and has developed overflow plans that ensure there are enough beds for all of those seeking emergency shelter particularly during the winter months the salt lake valley coalition said in tuesday s statement state official agrees with mayor s efforts former utah senate president wayne niederhauser who now serves as gov spencer cox s chief homeless services coordinator stood alongside mendenhall at the news conference thursday he said the state is a willing partner and ready to support local homeless organizations the idea and plan that s presented today i think is a very positive direction from the state s point of view niederhauser said and we re going to do whatever we can to support getting more housing on the ground but that involves probably getting with the legislature and persuading them and i think that s part of the job and part of the reason why i m in this position niederhauser also agreed the salt lake county system likely needs more low barrier shelter i would call our shelters more medium barrier he said having a low barrier shelter actually might be a solution probably not a complete solution but could be part of people that don t want to come into shelter but want to be in a place that s warm or cool but the question remains where will the new beds go and what will they look like niederhauser indicated the answer might be the purchase of motels a growing trend across the nation as struggling motel owners look to sell the trend of the day is the motels niederhauser said that have been vacant during covid and we have owners who want to sell they are very good options to get beds quickly statewide by the way niederhauser said partners should be focusing on that at least for the near term those shelters they can be a shelter initially and turned into more permanent supportive housing but having that stock available to us will be very very important

value to the 2 year ust the annual average is 88 olsan said similar flows are occurring in new issue where commitments past the money market range are holding rates to such extreme lows she said the result may be a function of limited money market product as note sales this year so far have totaled just 16 8 billion vs 26 5 billion in the same period last year issuers have more reserve balances

jobless claims fell for the second week in a row but are still hovering around the same mark they have been at for months as the delta variant is not a contributing factor to a measurable reduction in activity according to one analyst while the delta variant has sparked a rise in covid cases there s scant indication this is translating to a measurable reduction in economic activity in the u s so far suggesting little meaningful impact on employment according to mark hamrick senior economic analyst at bankrate initial jobless claims fell to 385 000 in the week ended july 31 on a seasonally adjusted basis from a downwardly revised 399 000 the week before first reported as 400 000 claims economists polled by ifr markets estimated 380 000 claims in the week continuing claims decreased to 2 930 million in the week ended july 24 from an upwardly revised 3 296 million in the prior week initially reported as 3 269 million this marks the lowest level of continuing claims since it was at 1 770 million the week of march 14 2020 just before the pandemic began to wreak havoc ifr anticipated 3 283 million claims in the week new jobless claims dropped a bit back below the seasonally adjusted 400 000 level in line with expectations but remain in territory where they ve been in recent months hamrick said they slipped below the benchmark 400 000 level for the first time since the pandemic began around memorial day and have essentially hovered there since also released thursday the international trade deficit widened to 75 7 billion in june from 71 0 billion in may economists expected a 73 9 billion shortfall the u s trade deficit rose to a record in june while exports rose by 1 2 billion during the month and imports jumped 6 0 billion said jay bryson chief economist and shannon seery economist at wells fargo securities the june data largely confirm the preliminary real gdp data for q2 that were released last week they added that looking ahead the strong outturn for imports in june sets trade up to be another drag on growth in the third quarter but with little data yet available for the quarter it remains to be seen how trade evolves from here due to the rise in the delta variant in the united states and the severe transportation bottlenecks the sector continues to face they said the trade deficit likely will remain elevated in coming months due to continued strength in u s domestic demand chip barnett contributed to this report

with regards to privacy legislation congress needs to ask itself the question posed by the philosopher hillel and if not now when every year multiple privacy bills are introduced in congress and ever year multiple privacy bills never leave committee the members of congress tout the importance of online privacy for americans but fail to put words into action this time it may be different and the regulatory structure established is critical to protecting personal data one key item is ensuring data brokers are captured by this legislation and given the oversight that is desperately needed in 2000 the federal trade commission ftc issued its third privacy online fair information practices in the electronic marketplace report examining the state of online privacy and the efficacy of industry self regulation 1 the ftc identified growing consumer concerns regarding their privacy online and the limited success of industry certification efforts as a result the ftc urged congress to enact legislation that would ensure adequate protection of consumers privacy online while also acknowledging industry self regulation should play an important role congress failed to pass legislation providing comprehensive privacy protections in 2014 the ftc released a report highlighting growing concerns around data brokers data brokers collect information about consumers from public and non public sources and sell that information to businesses the information may be sought for harmless purposes such as targeting dog lovers for a new product or for harmful purposes such as compiling a list of alcoholics 2 while data brokers operate legally this is largely because they have no direct contact or relationship with the consumer the ftc raised concerns about these brokers ability to collect information from a growing number of sources analyze it through new and emerging algorithms and models and store information indefinitely due to the falling cost of storage the ftc urged congress to enact legislation to ensure adequate protection of consumer privacy online and congress failed to pass any comprehensive privacy protection american s concerns over their privacy have grown as more commerce and activity shifts to online platforms according to pew research center over 81 of americans feel they have little or no control over the data collected by companies and 79 are very or somewhat concerned about how business are using their data 3 these sentiments are valid given customer personal identifiable information is compromised in 44 of all data breaches there seems to be real momentum behind congress to finally pass a privacy act that provides comprehensive protections after multiple high profile data breaches and the schrems ii invalidation of the eu us privacy shield therefore it is an impeccable moment to survey and recommend a regulatory structure for data broker oversight while some may want to abolition of the data brokerage industry altogether that idea is impractical and overlooks the market efficiency benefits the dbs provides however given that sensitive data is collected and the information can reveal a detailed profile on an individual regulation and oversight would help curtail bad actors the personal data markets operate similarly to the financial markets in that there are primary markets the collection of data from consumers secondary markets the selling and exchanging of data and broker dealers data brokers today s data industry parallels the pre great depression era financial markets where market actors were subject to little or no regulation after the collapse of the financial markets and as a part of the new deal era legislation congress passed the securities act of 1933 and securities exchange act of 1934 while these acts regulated the offering and trading of securities on the primary and secondary markets over the counter exchanges between dealers were unregulated the maloney act of 1938 amended the exchange act authorizing the national association of securities dealers nasd to impose and enforce regulations on broker dealer conduct although nasd was a voluntary self regulatory organization sro it was still under the securities and exchange commission s oversight today nasd is called the financial industry regulatory authority finra which issues licensing exams creates interprets enforces rules and adjudicates disputes firms and individuals that wish to conduct business with the public must be certified as members of finra comprehensive data privacy legislation will have a similar effect at the securities act and exchange act in that it will regulate the face of the industry data protection legislation will address how data is collected notices required and consumer rights with regard to their information also the legislation will address how firms that directly collect information from consumers handle that data and limitations on selling or sharing however similar to the financial markets the data brokers operate in a way that could largely circumvent these requirements congress should mandate an sro similar to finra that is overseen by the ftc the sro should require licensing exams for individuals handling data at member data brokerage firms and should help streamline education and training in industry best practices the sro should be able to implement interpret and enforce rules to adapt quickly to the fast paced nature of the technology industry most importantly the sro should have an adjudication arm that allows business and consumers to bring claims against data brokers for improper actions given congress s history with privacy legislation this may be the one opportunity an sro for data brokers would ensure a regulatory body is established to protect consumers establish market standards and provide needed oversight learning from other industries is crucial to avoid similar mistakes and luckily for the personal data markets the financial markets serve as a glaring example footnotes 1 federal trade commission privacy online fair information practices in the electronic marketplace a report to congress may 2000 2testimony of pam dixon

medicines for the treatment of oncology metabolic autoimmune and other major diseases and eli lilly and company nyse lly today announced new and updated data from the orient 11 study demonstrating a sustained survival benefit of sintilimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy in the first line treatment of patients with nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer in addition biomarker results from the trial provide important insights for patients with high major histocompatibility complex mhc class ii expression these findings were published today in the journal of thoracic oncology in august 2020 interim analysis data from orient 11 were released in an oral presentation at the iaslc world conference on lung cancer wclc 2020 virtual presidential symposium these interim data were simultaneously published online by the journal of thoracic oncology orient 11 is a randomized double blind phase 3 clinical trial evaluating sintilimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy compared to placebo in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy as a first line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous nsclc without sensitizing egfr mutations or alk rearrangements the journal of thoracic oncology manuscript discloses as of january 15 2021 with a median follow up of 22 9 months the median overall survival os of patients receiving the sintilimab combination was not yet reached the sintilimab combination demonstrated a sustainable os benefit hr 0 60 95 ci 0 45 0 79 p 0 0003 and the median os for those receiving the placebo combination was 16 8 months whole transcriptome sequencing of baseline tumor samples was performed to probe the predictive and correlative biomarkers showing that high or medium immune cell infiltration was strongly associated with improved progression free survival pfs in the sintilimab combination group in particular high mhc class ii presentation pathway expression was significantly correlated with prolonged pfs hr 0 32 95 ci 0 19 0 54 p 0 0001 and os hr 0 36 95 ci 0 20 0 64 p 0 0005 in the sintilimab combination group professor li zhang head of department of internal medicine sun yat sen university cancer center the primary investigator of orient 11 and the corresponding author of the manuscript stated sintilimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy demonstrated a sustainable survival benefit after long term follow up in the orient 11 study these data showed that this sintilimab combination should be further evaluated as front line therapy for patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer without egfr or alk genomic tumor aberrations dr wei xu vice president of translational medicine of innovent and co corresponding author of the manuscript stated immunotherapy based on pd 1 and pd l1 antibodies has revolutionized clinical practice of treating non small cell lung cancer however the precise patient population who will benefit from immunotherapy chemotherapy combination treatment is still unclear we explored the gene expression profile in the tumor microenvironment and found that the infiltration of antigen presenting cells and high expression of the mhc ii antigen presentation pathway correlated with improved outcomes in patients who received the sintilimab pemetrexed platinum chemotherapy combination this finding contributes to a better understanding of the mechanism of action of the immunotherapy chemotherapy combination which could help inform selection of suitable patients for future sintilimab studies publication of this study in the journal of thoracic oncology is a recognition of the important work by this research team and we will continue to explore new areas in immuno oncology with the goal of identifying additional novel approaches to treat cancer in clinical practice dr li wang senior vp of lilly china and head of lilly china drug development and medical affairs center stated we re excited to see that the results of orient 11 show sintilimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy can bring an overall survival benefit to patients with nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer in the first line treatment setting also research of the tumor microenvironment is helping scientists find suitable biomarkers as potential targets for cancer treatment these orient 11 biomarker results published in the journal of thoracic oncology will help us further understand the mechanism of action of this immunotherapy based combination in order to identify patients who are more likely to respond to treatment about the orient 11 trial orient 11 is a randomized double blind phase 3 clinical trial

the call over to lynn lynn j good chairman president and chief executive officer jack thank you and good morning everyone it s great to be with you for our second quarter 2021 earnings call today we announced strong results for the quarter with adjusted earnings per share of 1 15 these results driven in part by economic recovery also demonstrate the continued strength of our clean energy strategy we are leading the transition to cleaner energy by adding significant amounts of renewables to our portfolio hardening the grid through investments in our transmission and distribution assets and collaborating with stakeholders and policymakers to advance supportive energy policy we have positive momentum going into the second half of the year and are reaffirming our 2021 adjusted eps guidance range of 5 to 5 30 we re also reaffirming our long term eps growth rate of 5 to 7 through 2025 based on 5 15 midpoint for 2021 and we remain fully committed to creating value for shareholders by recently increasing our quarterly cash dividend for the 15th consecutive year looking ahead we have a number of strategic milestones that we re working toward the we re working toward in the second half of the year we anticipate the closing of the minority sale of duke energy indiana to gic announced earlier this year at an attractive premium to our public equity valuation this transaction satisfies our equity needs for the next five years we received cfius approval in june ferc approval is the only remaining closing requirement and we anticipate receiving approval at any time during the third quarter we continue engaging with stakeholders on important work in the carolinas on our 2020 irps and energy legislation and in indiana on our 2021 irp i will speak further about those in just a moment and operationally we have four remaining months of hurricane season and our team is ready to respond on behalf of our customers in july elsa was our first official storm of the 2021 season while we had minimal impact in our florida and carolinas service territories we were prepared and restored power quickly to our customers i m very proud of our accomplishments to date and we re poised for a strong finish to 2021 turning to slide five we continue to advance our clean energy transformation powered by our five year 59 billion growth capital plan these investments are delivering value for our customers and communities and driving strong growth for our investors i want to highlight a couple of recent accomplishments renewables are playing a major role in our path to net zero we continue construction on approximately 250 megawatts of new solar projects in north carolina and florida that we expect to bring online by the end of this year and in recent weeks we commissioned the 144 megawatt pflugerville solar and 182 megawatt maryneal wind projects in texas with the completion of these two projects we hit a significant milestone surpassing 10 000 megawatts of solar and wind resources this is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employees and strong support we receive from the communities where we operate in addition to carbon reduction and the benefits of creating a diverse energy infrastructure solar and wind investments foster economic development tax revenue and job creation in the areas we serve this milestone reflects our leadership in clean energy and we are on track to pass 16 000 megawatts of renewables by 2025 and approximately 24 000 megawatts by 2030 by 2050 renewables will represent 40 or more of our energy mix nuclear is also a foundational component of our strategy providing the largest source of reliable carbon free energy we have in our system in june we submitted our application to renew oconee nuclear station s operating licenses for an additional 20 years which was accepted by the nrc for review this is our first subsequent license renewal application among our six nuclear sites in the carolinas and the review process will move forward over the next 18 months oconee is our largest nuclear station with three generating units that produce more than 2 500 megawatts of carbon free base flow generation enough to power more than 1 9 million homes our nuclear fleet provided 83 of the company s carbon free generation in 2020 and avoided the release of nearly 50 million tons of carbon dioxide we ll pursue similar extensions for each of our remaining reactors as they approach the end of their respective licensing periods our ambitious climate strategy also puts us in a strong position to help other sectors such as transportation meet their emission reduction goals we continue to build out electric vehicle infrastructure in our service territories and one of our subsidiaries etrans energy was recently named a preferred provider by gm to help its fleet customers transition to electric vehicles electrifying vehicles is a win win approach to reducing carbon emissions from both the electric and the transportation sectors turning to slide six we re actively engaging policymakers and stakeholders across our jurisdictions and at the federal level in north carolina the house of representatives recently passed house bill 951 this legislation directs an orderly clean energy transition for north carolina including mandates to retire 12 coal units at five locations and replace them with cleaner forms of generation renewed solar programs and modern ratemaking tools to better align clean energy investments with customer needs we support house bill 951 and will continue to monitor its progress through the legislative process north carolina has a long history of constructive energy policy that was developed by finding common ground which has helped position the state as a leader in clean energy and in economic development advancing this clean energy transition continues to be a priority for the state and its leaders we also continue to work with the commissions in both north and south carolina to advance our integrated resource plans regulators have been complementary of the extensive stakeholder feedback process and comprehensive data incorporated into the irps in south carolina we received an order from the commission requesting additional analysis and modeling which will be filed later this month and in north carolina the commission plans to hold additional proceedings and will be providing guidance on next steps this is the first time we ve presented multiple generation scenarios in the irps and we welcome the opportunity to provide our regulators with more input in florida we received the final order from the commission in june approving the new multiyear rate plan settlement the significant agreement includes the continued expansion of utility scale solar energy storage new electric vehicle charging station programs and provides rate certainty to benefit customers among other things our investments include 10 new solar power plants across the state that will deliver 750 megawatts of cost effective renewable energy to customers this multi year rate plan is an addition to our storm protection plan which entails 6 2 billion in grid investments through 2029 to harden and strengthen the grid protecting it against significant weather events and improving reliability for customers in indiana the commission approves step two from our 2019 rate case which updates rate base through year end 2020 and trues up carrying costs back to january 1 2021 as we prepare to submit our indiana irp in november we continue to engage business customers consumer advocates and environmental groups to solicit input on transitioning to cleaner generation sources while keeping a sharp focus on reliability and affordability for customers we took an important step in our last rate case by reducing the depreciable lives for our coal capacity and look to the irp to continue this progress we ll collaborate with stakeholders and policymakers to find the best path forward for the state s clean energy transition shifting to the ldcs we ve filed rate cases in two jurisdictions this year across our gas segment we ve worked to keep o m costs relatively flat during a period of strong customer growth and capital additions our piedmont natural gas rate request continues to move through the regulatory process in north carolina this request includes construction costs related to our new natural gas storage facility in robeson county a hearing is scheduled for september and if approved rates would be effective by year end in kentucky we ve made strategic investments to improve the reliability and integrity of our natural gas delivery system and filed a request with the public service commission to recover those costs we ve invested nearly 190 million in a variety of capital projects across northern kentucky since we last sought a natural gas base rate increase in 2018 we will present our case to the commission in october and finally let me comment on the work in d c we re engaged with congress and the administration on a wide range of issues including infrastructure tax and climate policy the bipartisan infrastructure framework is the subject of much discussion and could serve as a powerful catalyst to modernize our nation s infrastructure it includes funding for large scale expansion of charging infrastructure to prepare for and further drive adoption of electric vehicles and as charging infrastructure grows so will the need for grid investments innovation will also be a critical part of the journey to net zero because with our existing technologies we can make important progress but cannot close the gap we re pleased to see the framework includes funding to accelerate the development of next generation clean energy technologies such as hydrogen carbon capture and advanced nuclear robust and sustained government support is vital to ensure the commercialization of these advanced technologies it s critical for us to tackle this issue today so the technologies are scalable when we need them in closing our continued growth and strong second quarter results were driven by solid execution across all our jurisdictions as we lead the largest clean energy transition in our industry i m confident we will continue to build on this momentum to deliver sustainable value and grow earnings 5 to 7 over the next five years with that let me turn it over to steve steven keith young executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks lynn and good morning everyone i ll start with a brief discussion on our quarterly results highlighting a few of the key variances to the prior year for more detailed information on variance drivers and a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today s press release and presentation as shown on slide seven our second quarter reported earnings per share was 0 96 and our adjusted earnings per share was 1 15 this is compared to a reported loss of 1 13 and an adjusted earnings per share gain of 1 08 last year the difference between second quarter reported and adjusted earnings per share is due to the onetime impacts of the initiative to redefine workspace usage in light of what we have learned from covid this effort involves consolidation of corporate office space and accommodating a hybrid work environment resulting in a 60 reduction in square footage and annual savings of approximately 25 million to 30 million the adjusted earnings per share growth in the quarter continues to be strong led by electric utilities and infrastructure which was up 0 24 compared to the prior year results were favorable due to benefits from base rate increases favorable volumes riders and weather partially offsetting these items were higher o m costs due to covid 19 mitigation efforts in 2020 shifting to gas utilities and infrastructure results were down 0 03 primarily due to the cancellation of acp last year in our commercial renewables segment results were down 0 06 for the quarter driven by lower investments in new renewables projects compared to prior year this is consistent with our guidance in february and we expect full year 2021 earnings to be within our 200 million to 250 million range other was unfavorable 0 04 for the quarter principally due to less favorable market returns on certain benefit plans and higher income tax expense partially offset by lower financing costs finally segment results are impacted by 0 04 of share dilution related to the 2 5 billion equity issuance that closed in december 2020 overall we had strong results compared to last year supported by our continued execution and the rebounding economy we remain confident in our ability to consistently grow our adjusted eps at 5 to 7 throughout the five year period off the 2021 base year turning to slide eight let me provide an overview of electric volumes and economic trends our results for the second quarter were up approximately 6 5 year over year keep in mind we are comparing sales data to q2 of last year which experienced the largest impact from covid 19 residential volumes were down 6 however given stay at home orders during the same period last year the modest decrease indicates many people continue to work from home on at least a part time basis in fact this quarter s results are more than 4 above the second quarter of 2019 highlighting the continued strength of the residential class which is supported by customer growth across our service territories as reported on our first quarter earnings call nearly all large commercial and industrial customers have resumed operations in the sector and the sector is showing signs of optimism the commercial class has rebounded considerably from prior year with an increase of 11 7 retail dining and recreation were all driving the positive year over year comparison as most covid restrictions have been lifted similarly industrial volumes have increased 11 8 for the quarter whereas volumes had declined 15 last year we expect improvement in the commercial and industrial classes as employment recovers and supply chain bottlenecks are resolved as we progress through the back half of the year we are monitoring the pace of economic recovery and potential impacts of the delta variant at the same time we are encouraged by the sales trends so far this year along with strong customer growth across our service territories with q2 overall retail volumes returning to q2 2019 levels we remain confident in our full year expectation of 1 to 2 load growth for 2021 and are trending toward the top half of that range on slide nine i d like to share an update on where we are with our financing plan and dividend growth we remain on track with the financing plan we outlined on the fourth quarter call the proceeds from the gic minority interest sale along with our overall financing plan allow us to maintain a strong credit profile without the need for common equity issuances throughout our five year plan we are on track to complete the north carolina storm securitization this fall and we recently issued 3 billion of holding company debt at low attractive rates finally we understand the value of our dividend to our investors this year marks the 95th consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividend and the 15th consecutive annual increase moving to slide 10 i want to provide some perspective on timing considerations for the second half of the year and an update on our cost management efforts we expect volumes will continue to recover over the balance of the year but as we saw in the second quarter we expect o m to be unfavorable in the third quarter when compared to 2020 this is due to the actions we took to significantly reduce o m during the pandemic such as deferred outages at are generating stations overall we reduced o m 320 million in 2020 equivalent to more than 6 of our non rider recoverable o m on our february call we shared that we plan to sustain 65 or 200 million of those savings and carry them forward into 2021 we are on track to achieve those savings this is consistent with our cost management track record since 2016 on a consolidated basis over the past five years our net regulated electric and gas o m has declined approximately 1 per year and we expect this trend to continue before we open it up for questions let me close with slide 11 we remain confident in our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of 5 to 5 30 with a midpoint of 5 15 our year to date results position us well to achieve full year results within this range as we continue to invest in important energy infrastructure to benefit our customers and communities our attractive dividend yield coupled with our long term earnings growth profile of 5 to 7 provide a compelling risk adjusted return for our shareholders as lynn discussed we continue to advance our clean energy strategy adding new renewable generation and taking steps to extend the lives of our carbon free nuclear fleet we continue to engage with state and federal leaders as they work to pave the way for a clean energy future we re executing our capital plan to support those efforts by investing in our energy grid all while employing financing solutions that save customers money and add value for shareholders duke energy is well positioned to lead as the pace of change in our industry accelerates delivering sustainable value to our customers and investors with that we ll open the line for your questions questions and answers operator we ll take our first question from shahriar pourreza with guggenham partners please go ahead shahriar pourreza guggenham partners analyst so appreciate your prepared remarks around house bill 951 lynn where are we in the process as it stands today are you still optimistic i mean couldn t help but notice some of the lack of bipartisanship going on should we be sort of concerned here at this stage lynn j good chairman president and chief executive officer sure the bill is moving and we are encouraged by what we re seeing i think you know that it passed the house we ve seen support from senate leadership the energy legislation remains a priority and the governor has been clear for some time about his strong commitment to carbon reduction and to renewable investment in the state so we re encouraged that the legislative branch executive branch and all of the broad stakeholders involved in this process will find common ground and that has been the long history in north carolina bringing diverse parties together in advancing energy policy shahriar pourreza guggenham partners analyst and just i want to just elaborate a little bit around sort of the common ground and i know this isn t obviously a duke energy bill and there s a lot of stakeholders involved but passage of it is going to obviously impact your clean energy transition right in the state investors kind of want to know if there is a possibility of compromise i e between the draft bill versus legislators versus the governor s very vocal comments right it s not really your call but could we see a faster coal retirement outlook maybe a little less dependency on gas a bit more solar i mean the governor wants more so do you see a path forward to kind of maybe bridge this sort of bid ask that s out there lynn j good chairman president and chief executive officer shahriar we do and i think your comments around it s comprehensive there are many elements to it you have a broad range of stakeholders it is natural and expected that there are going to be different points of view in that conversation and what hb 951 does is it outlines a path to a clean energy transition and the discussion is centering around that pace the cost maintaining reliability and we would expect that legislators and the administration will evaluate all portions of this draft bill to find the right balance so i think advancing clean energy transition remains a priority for the state and its leaders as well as its broad range of stakeholders and we will keep you informed as the bill continues to move operator we ll take our next question from julien dumoulin smith with bank of america julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst so at risk of asking more on the legislation perhaps i can pivot a little bit more strategically if you don t mind and i d love to hear if you have any latest thoughts with regards to undertaking any further review of the company i know that there s been a lot of shall we say noise out there and would love to hear your latest thoughts there in i ll leave it as open ended as you d like to comment lynn j good chairman president and chief executive officer sure julien i assume that s a comment about elliott management and so let me just answer it in that context and then we can take it any place you want to go we regularly engage with our shareholders we regularly review our portfolio our operations and business strategy and it has our approach around engagement has been similar with elliott and we have been in discussions with them for over a year comprehensively reviewing all of the ideas engaging advisors when we need to discussing with our board all of these ideas and it s not appropriate for me to comment any further on the specifics but i would confirm to you that we remain open to a constructive engagement we ll evaluate all proposals act on those that we believe delivers value to our stakeholders and i would also say that we remain focused on serving of customers maintaining our assets advancing the strategic priorities around our clean energy transition and that remains unchanged as well julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst got it excellent perhaps if i can pivot a little bit differently here as you think about the nonutility side of the business can you comment at all on just thoughts on scaling that are not obviously it s not been too core of a focus of late but given some of the pressures across the wider renewable businesses out there would be curious what you re seeing if that s impacting any of your time lines and or aspirations in the business but all together lynn j good chairman president and chief executive officer and julien we just crossed an important milestone of renewables so 10 000 megawatts of renewables which includes both regulated and non regulated investment and we see the growth of renewable energy is important to the clean energy transition our commercial team continues to deliver they are forecasting to achieve 200 million to 250 million per year and have been consistent in accomplishing that so it remains an important part of the company it remains an important part of our commitment around carbon reduction our esg story in general and the team is on track to deliver in 2021 2022 and beyond julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst right excellent and just to clarify do you intend to which you would get this legislation done i know it s always difficult to say but any updated thoughts at the end of the forecast period how that might change as you ve refined your planning might be a little bit early and i know it s transient what could ultimately be included but i figure i d be remiss if i didn t ask lynn j good chairman president and chief executive officer sure no julien the plan that we ve put in front of you 2021 to 2025 is not dependent on legislation we have a high degree of confidence in the ability to achieve our 5 to 7 growth rate but as we talked about in october of last year and we opened the horizon to what the back half of the decade could look like we do see acceleration of capital not only in pursuit of retirement of assets and building replacement generation but also our grid investment as well so we ll continue to update this in the ordinary course giving you a view in february of what we think 2026 looks like but we continue to expect acceleration of capital in the back half of the decade operator we ll now take our next question from jonathan arnold with vertical research jonathan arnold vertical research analyst just on the north carolina process in the last quarter when you sort of dissuaded us from being overly concerned about any particular dates but could you just remind us sort of what the timing in the legislature is through the rest of the year and just anything we should be looking out procedurally or is it essentially open ended lynn j good chairman president and chief executive officer sure jonathan what i would say is that the timing is difficult to predict in these processes it is within the hands of the legislative leadership and we will know more as the bill progresses through the senate there was in fact a hearing this morning in the senate so we ll continue to keep you updated i think you know that the long session in north carolina does not have a statutory end date so we will continue to monitor as it moves through the senate process jonathan arnold vertical research analyst okay and then just i know just a comment on feeling that you re trending toward the top half of the sales or load forecast for this year does that sort of translate into how you feel you re tracking on earnings as well or are there other things that are weighing on the other side lynn j good chairman president and chief executive officer jonathan we will reset and give you a finer look at where we were trending in the guidance range after third quarter i mean there s just so much weather volatility here in the southeast we have hurricane season underway so we will continue to monitor that and give you an update third quarter but i would say we re off to a strong start strong start on the economic rebound strong start on maintaining our focus on o m delivering on our key milestones around regulatory approvals etc so i m pleased with where we are and also pleased to see the economic recovery those strong results in commercial and industrial are indicative of the economy opening up and i think that s a good thing jonathan arnold vertical research analyst great and just one very quick one on the annual savings you talked about for the office reconfiguration were those is that a pre tax or after tax number they re 25 million to 30 million steven keith young executive vice president and chief financial officer that s a pre tax number jonathan operator we ll take our next question from steve fleishman with wolfe research steve fleishman wolfe research analyst so this may have i think this may have been asked a little bit but just wanted to better clarify the as we re watching the irp and the different scenarios that come out how should we think about what s embedded in your current capital plan versus what might be incremental or is it just mainly focused on beyond the current capital plan lynn j good chairman president and chief executive officer so steve the capital plan is basically the base of the irp and so you should think about it that way the six scenarios as you move further to the right and you introduce additional technologies in the time frame that s where the legislation begins to come in giving us some flexibility to move more rapidly on some of the retirements etc so when we talk about the implications of how irp fits with the legislation we ve got a clear line of sight 2021 to 2025 based on present law based on the present processes present regulatory processes and the opportunity really exists in the back half of the decade so that s how i would respond i don t know steve if you d add anything to that steven keith young executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so i think as you move toward a more rapid decarbonization number then the capital increases i think within our current five year plan the upside would be at the back end of things i would give that texture to it operator we ll hear next from durgesh chopra from evercore isi durgesh chopra evercore isi analyst most of my questions have been answered just maybe a big picture lynn sort of what are sort of what are you and some of the other utility leaders looking at washington infrastructure bill sort of is being debated today and then the reconciliation bill going into year end maybe sort of what are sort of the top two or three things that you see coming out between now and year end which impacts the sector lynn j good chairman president and chief executive officer yes durgesh i would say the infrastructure bill will continue to make its path we re supportive of a bipartisan approach i think as an infrastructure builder our success over many years has been in a bipartisan framework we re encouraged by the focus on electric vehicles and electric vehicle infrastructure as you know that s been a priority for duke we have about 100 million targeted on that investment and there s certainly potential to expand it the president today also has been advocating for 40 to 50 of vehicles electric vehicles by 2030 we are also pleased to see investments in zero and low carbon technologies like advanced nuclear hydrogen carbon capture because we believe those technologies are important for a net zero world so that s what i would say around infrastructure i think on the remaining the reconciliation process tax policy climate legislation are all being discussed i think it s too early to tell how those shape up but we are engaged with the administration and with congress really talking about the tools that would be helpful for us to pursue our clean energy strategy and see a lot of alignment over time but as you know in a tight senate and house it can be challenging at times to find the right path but we remain engaged operator we ll hear next from jeremy tonet with jpmorgan jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst just want to start off here when thinking about the energy transition kind of from a different perspective i know duke has some irons in the fire with regards to rng investments but do you see any potential to kind of upsize this increase this over time are there policies out there at the federal state level that could be helpful in these efforts lynn j good chairman president and chief executive officer we are getting started i would say jeremy on rng it s consistent with our overall climate targets certainly our goals 100 methane goal etc and are working actively to learn more about the technology learn more about how it impacts our system and have made some very strategic investments and so i do think there s an opportunity for it to develop over time and the team is working actively with policymakers with the communities suppliers that would be relevant to this and i think it will be a bigger story as we move forward jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst got it that s helpful and then could you give any more color just kind of pivoting here on what we should be looking for with the irp filing in indiana later this year what are some of the considerations versus maybe what we saw coming out of the carolinas last year lynn j good chairman president and chief executive officer it s a really good question jeremy because we are in the midst of stakeholder engagement in indiana as well engagement with the environmental community with our large customers certainly the regulators and other policymakers who are relevant to that process the goal is decarbonizing the goal is diversifying and if you look at our last irp that we filed in indiana we had about 2 300 2 400 megawatts of solar starting in 2023 we would expect that to grow and so we ve got a couple of more months here in working through the stakeholder process but we see this as a next step where we in the rate case we accelerated retirement dates of coal plants the irp gives us a chance to expand that discussion on the clean energy transition over the next 20 years and i think it s an important part of the ongoing conversation in indiana on how the state will position itself for growth in the clean energy transition so more to come on that and as we look forward to november third quarter poll eei etc we ll have more that we can share around indiana jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst got it that s very helpful just a real quick last one for me we very recently seen some utility peers beef up their corporate governance with certain actions i was just wondering if duke has considered taking actions like this lynn j good chairman president and chief executive officer i think duke has a strong track record on governance jeremy if you were to look back at the feedback we ve received from shareholders and the additional disclosures and adoption of certain practices that we followed we have been very open minded about these and we ll continue to do so so that becomes a key focus here in the fall as we engage with shareholders specifically focused on esg topics our corporate governance committee is very involved in that the board is very involved in some of the conversations with shareholders as well so you can expect us to continue to be responsive to our shareholders in this regard operator we ll hear next from michael lapides with goldman sachs michael lapides goldman sachs analyst lynn just curious how are you all thinking about the commercial power business and what the growth profile of that business looks like over the next couple of years relative to investing in renewables in the regulated business i guess to simplify what s a better return on capital investing in renewables outside of the regulated utility or within the regulated utility if you could allocate capital only to one of those alternatives lynn j good chairman president and chief executive officer michael it s a really good question because we have we do a lot of work around capital allocation of course what meets the needs of our customers what fits the policy of our state what delivers the highest return those are all key considerations and our commercial renewables business has performed well against our benchmarks of what we expect from that business in terms of returns but what you re suggesting is as we see more opportunity in the regulated business how will that impact commercial and i would say that will be very closely reviewed as part of our capital allocation plan going forward i think you also know that we entered a joint venture with john hancock on the commercial renewable business recycling that capital in the way that it s been quite effective and those are the types of transactions we will also evaluate over time we like the business in the context of our ongoing esg story and our pursuit of carbon reduction but we ll closely scrutinize how capital is allocated michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it also one follow up a number of your peers some of the other large caps think exelon or aep have made investments in they re almost like venture capital like investments in various clean energy related companies some of which have gone public in the last six to 12 months just curious does duke have similar type of investments and have you ever made any disclosure and are any of them material or something that would show up in kind of the income statement over time lynn j good chairman president and chief executive officer so michael we are active in this area and do make investments let me ask steve to comment we look at it from a couple of perspectives certainly there s an opportunity to earn a return but as importantly there s an opportunity to learn about what s going on in various technology developments and various methods of technologies to serve customers technologies that could advance carbon reduction and as part of our treasury corporate development organization we are focused on investment in that area in a way that complements our business steven keith young executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i would add that we have made investments in various venture funds and we work closely with the fund managers to understand what the investment profile is and as lynn said it s aligned with our strategy it looks at things like evs and new technologies and we also ensure that there is communication among our operating folks with the funds and the companies that we invest in so we can transfer learnings there and we ve had some good success there it s not been material but we re certainly learning a lot from them operator we ll take our final question from anthony crowdell of mizuho anthony crowdell mizuho analyst lynn steve just i guess a quick question earlier in the year duke had been able to resolve rate case in north carolina florida i think last year you resolved indiana but just are there any other duke properties or duke utilities underearning you re allowed and maybe creating more of a headwind than you thought versus when you went in the year i think you provided some disclosure on the fourth quarter slide deck of maybe adjusted book roes going into the year just is everyone on target or is some of them may be performing better than you thought or less than you thought steven keith young executive vice president and chief financial officer anthony they re performing well we do look over time at our allowed returns and we ve got a good history across our footprint of earning at or even above our allowed returns and they ll move around a bit as you re building a rate base for an upcoming rate case so you ll see some movement around a return based upon some of those profiles but we feel good about our regulatory cadence and our investments around that cadence and the execution has been good the indiana case and the carolinas case are coming through nicely and we re preparing for the future cases that lynn was discussing and we think that process is working well lynn j good chairman president and chief executive officer and anthony i would just add that steve runs a tight process around optimizing capital to make sure it s getting spent at a time that matches with that regulatory calendar so we do all that we know to do to minimize lag and the result of that is that we have a good track record of earning our return anthony crowdell mizuho analyst great and just a last one for me you may have touched on it earlier lynn on a question i think on maybe some stuff going on in washington there s talk of maybe a nuclear legislation or some maybe subsidy for nuclear plants you re talking about license extension on oconee just any thoughts to maybe your view on nuclear legislation that may be part of the infrastructure bill and would it impact duke lynn j good chairman president and chief executive officer so anthony we are strong supporters of nuclear as you know and i think as you look here in the carolinas in particular 50 of the power comes from nuclear across the entire enterprise 80 of our carbon free generation is from nuclear so we are very active we intend to pursue second license renewal as you indicated and the discussion in washington has really centered more around the plants that are exposed to markets commercial markets so think about plants in pjm and otherwise but we have had discussions with a number of people about the importance of nuclear in the transition and i do believe it is being recognized by the administration and by congress and so that s an important area of advocacy for us not only in existing plants but on new technologies that would keep nuclear as part of the solution set for the clean energy transition operator and that does conclude today s question and answer session i would turn the conference back over to lynn good for closing remarks lynn j good chairman president and chief executive officer well thank you cody and thanks to all of you who participated today for your interest and investment in duke energy and as always we re available for further discussion the ir team steve and i as well so thanks again for participating operator

measures of financial performance a non gaap financial measure refers to a numerical measure of grid dynamics historical or future financial performance or financial position that is included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap grid dynamics provides certain non gaap measures as additional information relating to its operating results as a complement to results provided in accordance with gaap the non gaap financial information presented herein should be considered in conjunction with and not as a substitute for or superior to the financial information presented in accordance with gaap and should not be considered a measure of liquidity and profitability grid dynamics has included these non gaap financial measures because they are financial measures used by grid dynamics management to evaluate grid dynamics core operating performance and trends to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and new investments and are among the factors analyzed in making performance based compensation decisions for key personnel grid dynamics believes the use of non gaap financial measures as a supplement to gaap measures is useful to investors in that they eliminate items that are either not part of core operations or do not require a cash outlay such as stock based compensation expense grid dynamics believes these non gaap measures provide investors and other users of its financial information consistency and comparability with its past financial performance and facilitate period to period comparisons of operations grid dynamics believes these non gaap measures are useful in evaluating its operating performance compared to that of other companies in its industry as they generally eliminate the effects of certain items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance there are significant limitations associated with the use of non gaap financial measures further these measures may differ from the non gaap information even where similarly titled used by other companies and therefore should not be used to compare our performance to that of other companies grid dynamics compensates for these limitations by providing investors and other users of its financial information a reconciliation of non gaap measures to the related gaap financial measures grid dynamics encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety not to rely on any single financial measure and to view its non gaap measures in conjunction with gaap financial measures please see the reconciliation of non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures attached to this release forward looking statements this communication contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 that are not historical facts and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results of grid dynamics to differ materially from those expected and projected these forward looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology including the words believes estimates anticipates expects intends plans may will potential projects predicts continue or should or in each case their negative or other variations or comparable terminology these forward looking statements include without limitation the quotations of management the section titled financial outlook and statements concerning grid dynamics expectations with respect to future performance particularly in light of the covid 19 pandemic these forward looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results most of these factors are outside grid dynamics control and are difficult to predict factors that may cause such differences include but are not limited to i grid dynamics has a relatively short operating history and operates in a rapidly evolving industry which makes it difficult to evaluate future prospects and may increase the risk that it will not continue to be successful and may adversely impact our stock price ii grid dynamics may be unable to effectively manage its growth or achieve anticipated growth which could place significant strain on grid dynamics management personnel systems and resources iii grid dynamics revenues are highly dependent on a limited number of clients and industries that are affected by seasonal trends and any decrease in demand for outsourced services in these industries may reduce grid dynamics revenues and adversely affect grid dynamics business financial condition and results of operations iv the impact of the covid 19 pandemic has and may continue to materially adversely affect our stock price business operations and overall financial performance v grid dynamics revenues are highly dependent on clients primarily located in the united states and any economic downturn in the united states or in other parts of the world including europe or disruptions in the

30 2021 an increase of 106 8 compared to net income of 27 6 million for the second quarter ended june 30 2020 our total revenues increased 38 6 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020 largely driven by the 37 7 million increase in oil and gas royalty revenue our share of production was approximately 16 4 thousand barrels of oil equivalent boe per day for the second quarter of 2021 compared to 15 7 thousand boe per day for the same period of 2020 the average realized price was 40 83 per boe for the second quarter of 2021 compared to 15 02 per boe for the comparable period of 2020 water sales and produced water royalties increased 4 1 million and 2 3 million respectively for the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 the increase in water sales for the second quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020 is principally due to a 70 8 increase in the number of barrels of sourced and treated water sold these increases in revenue were partially offset by easements and other surface related income which decreased 2 7 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020 these revenue streams are directly impacted by development and operating decisions in the permian basin made by our customers and commodity prices among other factors our total operating expenses of 24 7 million for the second quarter of 2021 increased approximately 2 1 million compared to the same period of 2020 operating expenses for the second quarter of 2021 included approximately 4 7 million of expense related to

months ended june 30 2021 the company reported net income of 107 1 million for the six months ended june 30 2021 an increase of 26 0 compared to net income of 85 0 million for the six months ended

million and 7 4 million respectively for the six months ended june 30 2021 compared to the six months ended june 30 2020 the 10 0 million decrease in water sales for the six months ended june 30 2021 compared to 2020 is principally due to a 16 5 decrease in the number of barrels of sourced and treated water sold these revenue streams are directly impacted by development and operating decisions made by our customers and vary as the pace of development and oil demand varies our total operating expenses of 46 8 million for the six months ended june 30 2021 decreased approximately 1 8 million compared to the same period of 2020 the decrease was principally due to a 2 7 million decrease in land sales expenses and a 2 1 million decrease in water service related expenses primarily related to decreased equipment rental fuel and ongoing cost savings measures additionally legal and professional fees decreased 1 6 million as the corporate reorganization was completed in january 2021 these decreases were partially offset by increased salaries and related employee expenses which for the six months ended june 30 2021 included 6 7 million of expense related to severance costs covid 19 pandemic and impact of increased supply by opec the uncertainty caused by the global spread of covid 19 commencing in 2020 among other factors led to a significant reduction in global demand and prices for oil these events generally led to production curtailments and capital investment reductions by the operators of the oil and gas wells to which the company s royalty interests relate this slowdown in well development has negatively affected the company s business and operations for 2020 and 2021 more recently development activity has also been impacted by shortages in labor and certain equipment as well as escalating costs with current oil natural gas and ngl prices broadly higher than the comparable period in 2020 development activities in the permian basin have rebounded from the lows in 2020 and producer activity has improved albeit at a pace still below pre pandemic levels future production and development activity will continue to be influenced by changes in commodity prices and by the evolving economic and health impact of covid 19 though the global spread of covid 19 and the associated economic impact are still uncertain covid 19 containment measures have eased in certain regions globally and as a result demand for oil and gas has begun to recover however given recent increases in covid 19 cases any additional shut downs could impact this recovery in addition oil prices in 2021 have been supported by oil supply cuts by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec and russia collectively referred to as opec oil prices will continue to be impacted by global oil demand trends particularly with covid 19 and potential containment measures and the oil market support provided by opec although our revenues are directly and indirectly impacted by changes in oil prices we believe our royalty interests which require no capital expenditures or operating expense burden for well development strong balance sheet and liquidity position will help us navigate through potential oil price volatility in 2020 we implemented certain cost reduction measures to manage costs with an initial focus on negotiating price reductions and discounts with certain vendors and reducing our usage of independent contract service providers in 2021 we continue to identify additional cost reduction opportunities as part of our longer term water business strategy we have invested in electrifying our water sourcing infrastructure the use of electricity instead of fuel powered generators to source and transport water is anticipated to reduce our dependence on fuel equipment rentals and repairs and maintenance additionally our investment in automation has allowed us to curtail our reliance on independent contract service providers to support our field operations our business model and disciplined approach to capital resource allocation have helped us maintain our strong financial position while navigating the uncertainty of the current environment further we continue to prioritize maintaining a safe and healthy work environment for our employees our information technology infrastructure allowed our corporate employees to transition to a remote work environment in march 2020 and we were able to deploy additional safety and sanitation measures for our field employees as vaccination rates in the united states have risen we have taken a phased in approach to returning employees to the office and continue to monitor guidance provided by the centers for disease control and prevention as new information becomes available we continue to provide safety and sanitation measures for all employees and maintain communication with employees regarding any concerns they may have during the transition quarterly dividend declared on

expense ratio and a decrease in the fund s market price per share to the extent the market price correlates closely to the fund s net asset value per share the distribution policy may also negatively affect the fund s investment activities to the extent that the fund is required to hold larger cash positions than it typically would hold or to the extent that the fund must liquidate securities that it would not have sold for the purpose of paying the distribution each fund s board has the right to amend suspend or terminate the distribution policy at any time the amendment suspension or

toronto north american markets rose on thursday as canada s main stock index benefited from higher crude oil prices and continued strong earnings reports for the second quarter of 2021 kevin headland senior investment strategist at manulife investment management said the dog days of summer have brought expected choppiness to north american markets but a positive economic backdrop has kept equity markets moving in a positive direction the market is reacting to positive earnings which have been very strong despite elevated expectations and markets are responding to that daily news on a daily basis said headland he added that the market seemed to brush off a u s private sector jobs report that came in well under expectations with an addition of 330 000 jobs in july the s p tsx composite index gained 45 75 points at 20 375 48 in new york the dow jones industrial average was up 271 58 points at 35 064 25 the s p 500 index was up 26 44 points at 4 429 10 while the nasdaq composite was up 114 59 points at 14 895 12 headland noted that the market seemed to brush off a u s private sector jobs report that came in well under expectations with an addition of 330 000 jobs in july rebounding oil prices helped lift the tsx today with the september crude oil contract up 94 cents at us 69 09 per barrel after dipping as low as us 67 75 on wednesday the tsx energy index was up 1 13 per cent to 121 56 points as a result the canadian dollar was also back above 80 cents us trading for 80 02 cents us compared with 79 71 cents us on wednesday headland said he expects the price of oil to follow the same lead as equity markets by exhibiting some shakiness but continuing on an upward trend that belief is rooted in the fact that rising covid cases may be affecting the pace of economic re openings but that things will continue to improve the economy is going strong despite the delta plus variant said headland we believe things are getting incrementally better and not worse an overall positive day on the tsx was otherwise hampered by the gold subindex which dropped 2 13 per cent to 302 25 points and the materials subindex that includes mining and resources companies which dropped 1 36 per cent to 318 93 points the december gold contract was down us 5 60 at us 1 808 90 an ounce and the september copper contract was up nearly 16 cents at nearly us 4 35 a pound headland said he would expect gold to be performing much stronger in the current market environment as a hedge to inflation and said the price of an ounce should be closer to us 2000 however he pointed out that there are other inflation hedges available such as crypto currencies which have performed relatively well over the last week looking ahead headland said the biggest news will be coming friday with jobs report in both the u s and canada the u s will be releasing non farm payroll numbers while statistics canada releases july employment numbers he said there is an expectation that the numbers in the u s will come out strong but said it wouldn t necessarily be a bad thing if the numbers don t match targets that s because it could give the u s federal reserve reason to extend stimulus which could be seen as positive by equity markets it all depends on the reaction and the news flow and the point of view from the federal reserve on the data coming out said headland this report by the canadian press was first published aug 5 2021

shareholders the following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the sources of the distributions for purposes of section 19 of the 1940 act and the rules adopted thereunder the tables have been computed based on generally accepted accounting principles the tables include estimated amounts and percentages for the current distributions paid this month as well as for the cumulative

distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes the final determination of the source of all distributions for the current year will only be made after year end the actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the fund s investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be

exemptive order granted by the securities and exchange commission the funds may distribute any long term capital gains more frequently than the limits provided in section 19 b under the 1940 act and

exceed the maximum rate applicable to your long term capital gains distributions made in any calendar year in excess of investment company taxable income and net capital gain are treated as taxable ordinary dividends to the extent of undistributed earnings and profits and then as a return of capital that reduces the adjusted basis in the shares held to the extent return of capital distributions exceed the adjusted basis in the shares held capital gain is recognized with a holding period based on the period the shares have been held at the date such amount is received the payment of distributions in accordance with the distribution policy may result in a decrease in the fund s net assets a decrease in the fund s net assets may cause an increase in the fund s annual operating expense ratio and a decrease in the fund s market price per share to the extent the market price correlates closely to the fund s net asset value per share the distribution policy may also negatively affect the fund s investment activities to the extent that the fund is required to hold larger cash positions than it typically would hold or to the extent that the fund must liquidate securities that it would not have sold for the purpose of paying the distribution each fund s board has the right to amend suspend or terminate the distribution policy at any time the amendment suspension or termination of the distribution policy may affect the fund s market price per share investors should consult their tax advisor regarding federal state and local tax considerations that may be

one of the top questions for business owners looking for solid investment strategies is why are you in business that question said brian loy president sage financial advisors applies both to why business owners get out of bed in the morning and to one of the reasons for running a business to make money the answer to the question becomes one of the three legs of a three legged investment stool financial planning that is sound and stable and doesn t tip over unless one of the legs is shorter than the other or missing the concept of the most affluent people i ve met they ve built their wealth on three legs which are their business slash real estate their retirement assets tax deferred like 401k s and the third leg is after tax investing like in their trust said loy you re not only diversifying your investments but you re also diversifying the income tax ramifications of how you re drawing that money from down the road the next part of investing is knowing what your number is unless people want to get carried out on their shield they don t want to work forever said loy so the number one question is how much money do we need to maintain our desired standard of living businesses provide two things to owners financially speaking they provide profits to live off of and save and an exit strategy when sold however that may not be the whole story anymore because the pandemic said loy made people think pervasive changes as business owners we ve seen these big challenges how supply chains have been interrupted how hard it is to get labor and the challenge of restarting businesses now said loy the pandemic changed how people invest and how they want to invest they want to do things simpler said loy they want to declutter their lives figuratively one fairly simple investment strategy is to run personal finances the same way the business finances run businesses have strategic plans budgets and contingency planning do something similar with your personal finances said loy have a plan and a team of trusted advisors that will provide you a roadmap for your future periodically check in so that you can make adjustments and make sure you re on track because things change whether that s life or market conditions strategies for investing aren t static what was good advice once may not apply anymore once investors were expected to invest more conservatively as they aged the rule of 100 sought to simplify asset allocation investors subtract their age from 100 and that s the percentage that should be in stocks so if you re 40 you should have 60 percent of your money in stocks 40 percent in bonds if you re 60 you should only have 40 percent in stocks said loy invest more conservatively as you grow old but that s not always right one pandemic related change is rising costs of everything from the value of a home to the cost of a sheet of plywood shipping costs have tripled and getting anything from asia to the west coast is a challenge so it s really important for us to start taking a front footed investment approach given the concerns of higher taxes inflation interest rates and higher prices said loy yet investors are told because of current inflation now s the time to invest in inflation proof assets like gold or real estate but how anxious are you to buy another rental property at today s prices which are sky high said loy and the challenge with owning gold is it doesn t pay you any dividends instead loy advises staying focused on having a diversified portfolio that includes real estate and gold that way the portfolio can provide a steady paycheck in retirement one that gives pay raises for rising living costs and won t be outlived but can be passed on the value and the beauty of having diversification is this tradeoff that we all see in investing said loy we re never going to make a killing but we ll never get killed new kids on the block during 2020 when it felt like the economy was in free fall a curious thing happened a record 4 million new businesses started up in the u s how many of those businesses were started by people who know how to run a business and how many will survive remains to be seen it s a good idea for new business owners to invest in learning to run a business but there s also 4 million new business owners who may choose to invest different businesses invest differently so do different sized businesses internally businesses have different investment needs and business owners need different levels of liquidity needs depending on the economic environment said randy garcia ceo investment counsel company when times are bad liquidity dries up and people who thought they could get their hands on their money find out unfortunately that they can t or they can t within the time frame needed hardly ever does anyone have too much cash in bad times they all find themselves short to some degree the amount of liquidity needed short term or long term can determine how a business invests typically similar companies in a similar industry are going to approach decisions similarly but they can be different sizes they can have different geographies that they target said david garcia executive director office lead jp morgan chase decisions being made on such opportunities should be discussed with a financial advisor or team because every company is going to think of it differently mgm is going to think of it differently from caesar s even though they re the same industry they re going to think of it differently because they re different companies cryptocurrency the last year brought not only new trends in investing but also new cryptocurrencies that doesn t mean financial advisors and wealth managers are suggesting anyone invest in them cryptocurrencies are a type of money that differ from traditional currencies in that they are digital in form and not issued by a government or backed by a scarce asset said paul johnson nevada president northern trust wealth management they use block chain coding systems to store transfer and validate transactions we do not believe cryptocurrencies qualify as a risk asset or risk control asset and do not have a role as an asset class in a prudent long term investment portfolio johnson said northern trust which constructs client portfolios from risk control and risk asset building blocks to ensure robust diversification believes cryptocurrencies should be considered similar to other assets such as collectibles and art which may have special value to their owners cryptocurrencies remind me of the automotive industry and or the railroad industry going back a hundred ish years said randy garcia there was money to be made and a lot of money to be made from an investors point of view but very few or not many made money at the time there were hundreds of auto manufacturers and more than 100 railroad companies but those numbers were swallowed up by massive consolidation the same thing that happens today and typically the public failed to make money off those types of opportunities large purchasers and governments don t want a currency that s hyper volatile that s one reason cryptocurrency is considered in very early stages randy garcia expects it will take on many shapes and forms as the bugs are ironed out and it s in a consumer useable form and definitely before it s ever considered the wave of the future that s partly because governments like china aren t interested in the benefits this form of cryptocurrency offers they want to be able to control all that money and where it goes he said that s in direct conflict with the stated aims of cryptocurrencies and one of the reasons the currency dropped 50 percent it was originally marketed as a currency that couldn t be tracked by governments that turned out to be false especially when a recent scam involving cryptocurrency was taken down by the fbi which had no problem tracking the currency and the people involved cryptocurrency s time may come but it hasn t come yet angel investors like the name implies they swoop down and meet with young companies that have exhausted capital and loans from friends and family and need funding at forums or meetings in angel networks interested investors meet with presenting business owners review business plans do research and due diligence and decide whether to invest advantages for angel investors is they re predominantly investing in industries outside their core business that helps diversify their portfolio angel investors normally look for a 35 to 40 percent internal rate of return that s a high return but there s also high risk said tarby bryant founder and chairman gathering of angels angel investing works out some of the time not all the time i encourage members of gathering of angels not to put all their eggs in one hot basket they believe is going to be the best thing since tesla motors having a diversified portfolio makes a lot of sense because some will go up and some will go down and several of them will become what i call walking wounded they re alive but they re not really prospering like other investment strategies angel investing follows trends a hot investment today might not be hot in another month the pandemic and resulting recession and the 2008 recession both changed the way angel investors look at investment opportunities once upon a time i would have meetings in santa fe where i started gathering of angels 25 years ago said bryant people would bring their checkbooks and if they saw something they liked they d write a 50 000 or 100 000 check and not really worry about it because it was all going to go well they thought the 2008 recession made people more skeptical of any kind of high risk investment they do more research and due diligence before writing a check they attend meetings and often co invest with other investors who have expertise in the area or with whom they ve invested before since 1996 gathering of angels has done 420 fundings for seed and early stage companies ranging from 20 000 to 38 5 million trending the new trend really is and this is debatable the federal reserve of the united states our central bank takes the position that our economy into the long term or distant future will remain deflationary said randy garcia in other words the economies of inflation today that were caused and still are being caused by covid are temporary and they feel that longer term deflation is the bigger of the two risks there s also a second opinion that inflation will either rise more than the federal reserve thinks or persist longer than the federal reserve thinks or both which means investment strategies are trending for a declining interest rate environment and investment strategies used for a declining interest rate environment are going to be very different than investment strategies used for a rising interest rate environment which is different from one that is staying within a limited range it s going forward going backward versus being in neutral in a car said randy garcia there are investment trends and the trends have been influenced by covid investment megatrends post pandemic include healthcare david garcia said with medical companies able to produce a vaccine within a year they re starting to extrapolate the process with other mnra vaccines and other r d healthcare areas healthcare data is another investment megatrend data is everywhere and ai helped with innovation in healthcare given the nature of the pandemic we re seeing shifts in the way healthcare and biotech industries are looking at the future of their respective industries said david garcia with what we saw we re really optimistic about medical companies like pfizer and biontech all the companies coming up really quick with strong vaccines and scientific development we see that continuing if not accelerating regardless of how individuals feel about it environmental social and governance esg is on a lot of investor s radars the biden administration s policies are moving toward alternative fuels states like california and new york are leading the charge for a sustainable future companies are starting to focus on how goods are sourced and where they come from investors are increasingly applying these non financial factors as part of their analysis process to identify material risks and growth opportunities said david garcia in the past it was like let s invest because it s a good thing to do morally but now it s starting to make good financial sense before it was just why am i going to do that just because it makes somebody happy now it makes financial sense so it s more like why wouldn t i do it for businesses and business owners now s the time to find deals harness megatrends and diversify through the recovery said david garcia because it s going to be bumpy as we start to take away some of the stimulus and the unemployment benefits start to phase out in december and different things start to happen it s a really good opportunity right now to get one s finances in better order for whatever may come and rates will most definitely be increased in the next couple years and as they are increased business owners have the chance of being in the best position to have lowered cost of capital debts

venture capital bejul somaia lightspeed india navroz d udwadia falcon edge capital vikram vaidyanathan matrix partners india the heads of 22 top startups and venture capital firms have jointly written to prime minister narendra modi urging the government to allow direct overseas listing of indian companies the group which includes the who s who of india s startup ecosystem said allowing companies to list overseas would be the single most significant big bang reform adding it would instantly pave the way for many indian companies to be on the global map the letter was sent earlier this week with copies marked to finance minister nirmala sitharaman commerce minister piyush goyal and it minister ashwini vaishnaw et has reviewed a copy of the letter the signatories to the letter include according to the letter while several companies are looking to list in india zomato being a recent success story and trendsetter startups need access to international capital to level the playing field with foreign technology giants and be globally competitive it said the total market capitalisation of all the companies listed in india is about 3 trillion while the comparable number for the us is 50 trillion we have reached out to pmo seeking clarity over direct listing of startups overseas this could bring more capital in india and help in brand building of indian startups in markets like the us one of the founders told et requesting anonymity many startups have flipped structures to set up companies in singapore so they could list abroad they won t have to do it if this is allowed the letter said international stock exchange listings will help raise the profile of indian startups helping them compete on a global stage with startups from other countries so far this year 20 new unicorns startups valued at 1 billion or more have emerged from india given this trend of fast paced growth many such mature companies are now keen to tap stock markets to raise further capital as it will allow them to fuel their domestic and international expansion generate employment and make india more efficient and competitive the letter said india must allow its startups to access global capital by listing on international bourses if it wants to produce multinational technology giants it added the current inability of unlisted companies to tap international markets for raising capital is an impediment to growth and most indian startups do not have a level playing field with their foreign counterparts it also leads to migration of startups outside india or flipping the note added the letter comes at a time when half a dozen indian startups have initiated processes to go public zomato s blockbuster listing last month has set the stage for other startups to accelerate their ipo plans valuation of sectors like saas insuretech would be more abroad what might work for a consumer company here might be different for another sector focused startup the founder of a startup said in september 2020 the government showed its intent to allow direct overseas listing of indian companies by amending the companies act 2013 in february this year indian companies listed overseas were also exempted from several obligations applicable to domestically listed companies we are writing with a request to kindly move forward with this unfinished reform agenda and expedite the steps required for turning overseas direct listing into a reality the letter said we are seeking more clarity and get this expedited another founder told et et reported in june that urban company was planning an ipo in the next 24 months after raising 225 million at a post money valuation of 2 billion we are looking to go public in the next 18 24 months work for which has already started earlier we were aiming for 2023 2024 but the pandemic has accelerated our ambitions to go public bhal who co founded the startup in 2014 with varun khaitan and raghav chandra had told et unacademy s munjal told et last week that he was considering an ipo as a serious option after zomato s stellar debut it is still 2 3 years away for unacademy and the company is yet to take a call on where to list concerns whether an international listing would dampen the development of the domestic capital market are unfounded the letter said as foreign investors get more familiar with investing in indian companies listed on foreign stock exchanges they will also be encouraged to drive more investments to indian startups even if international listing is permitted many companies will continue to prefer listing in india because of home brand recognition ease of investor relations lower litigation risk lower listing and ongoing compliance costs it said however the option to list overseas will provide a new avenue for certain categories of tech companies that may benefit from an international listing the letter pointed out many of the world s biggest technology companies are listed on foreign exchanges including in the us and singapore this provides a broad frame of reference to value other tech companies there is also more specialisation amongst investors due to which they are able to place a higher valuation on these companies the letter stated

in addition to our results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states u s gaap we believe the following non gaap measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance we use the following non gaap financial information to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes we believe that non gaap financial information when taken collectively may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance however non gaap financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with u s gaap in particular free cash flow is not a substitute for cash provided by used in operating activities additionally the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our liquidity is further limited as it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period in addition other companies including companies in our industry may calculate similarly titled non gaap measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures as tools for comparison a reconciliation is provided above for each non gaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with u s gaap investors are encouraged to review the related u s gaap financial measures and the reconciliation of these non gaap financial measures to their most directly comparable u s gaap financial measures and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business expenses excluded from non gaap measures we exclude stock based compensation expense which is a non cash expense from certain of our non gaap financial measures because we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance we exclude employer payroll tax expenses related to stock based compensation which is a cash expense from certain of our non gaap financial measures because such expenses are dependent on the price of our common stock and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of our business we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets which is a non cash expense related to business combinations from certain of our non gaap financial measures because such expenses are related to business combinations and have no direct correlation to the operation of our business we exclude acquisition related and other expenses from certain of our non gaap financial measures because such expenses are related to business combinations and have no direct correlation to the operation of our business acquisition related and other expenses can be cash or non cash expenses and include third party transaction costs and compensation expense for key acquired personnel we exclude amortization of debt discount and issuance costs which is a non cash expense from certain of our non gaap financial measures because such expenses have no direct correlation to the operation of our business non gaap gross profit and non gaap gross margin we define non gaap gross profit and non gaap gross margin as u s gaap gross profit and u s gaap gross margin respectively excluding stock based compensation and related employer payroll taxes and amortization of acquired intangible assets non gaap loss from operations and non gaap operating margin we define non gaap loss from operations and non gaap operating margin as u s gaap loss from operations and u s gaap operating margin respectively excluding stock based compensation and related employer payroll taxes amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition related and other expenses non gaap net loss and non gaap net loss per share basic and diluted we define non gaap net loss as gaap net loss plus stock based compensation and related employer payroll taxes amortization of acquired intangible assets acquisition related and other expenses and a non gaap provision for benefit from income taxes generally the difference between our gaap and non gaap income tax expense benefit is primarily due to adjustments in stock based compensation and related employer payroll taxes amortization of acquired intangibles associated with business combinations acquisition related and other expenses and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs we define non gaap net loss per share basic and diluted as non gaap net loss divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding since we have reported net losses for all periods presented we have excluded all potentially dilutive securities from the calculation of net loss per share as their effect is antidilutive and accordingly basic and diluted net loss per share is the same for all periods presented we believe that excluding these items from non gaap net loss and non gaap net loss per share diluted provides management and investors with greater visibility into the underlying performance of our core business operating results free cash flow and free cash flow margin free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure that we calculate as net cash provided by used in operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal use software free cash flow margin is calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue we believe that free cash flow and free cash flow margin are useful indicators of liquidity that provide information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our operations that after the investments in property and equipment and capitalized internal use software can be used for strategic initiatives including investing in our business and strengthening our financial position we believe that historical and future trends in free cash flow and free cash flow margin even if negative provide useful information about the amount of cash generated or consumed by our operating activities that is available or not available to be used for strategic initiatives for example if free cash flow is negative we may need to access cash reserves or other sources of capital to invest in strategic initiatives one limitation of free cash flow and free cash flow margin is that they do not reflect our future contractual commitments additionally free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period

hl earnings call for the period ending june 30 2021 hecla mining hl 0 36 q2 2021 earnings call 10 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator good day and thank you for standing by welcome to the q2 2021 hecla mining company earnings conference call i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today anvita patil thank you please go ahead anvita patil investor relations thank you operator and welcome everyone thank you for joining us for hecla s second quarter 2021 financial and operation results conference call i m anvita patil hecla s assistant treasurer our financial news results release that was issued this morning along with today s presentation are available on hecla s website on today s call we have phil baker hecla s president and ceo lauren roberts hecla s senior vice president and chief operating officer and russell lawlar hecla s senior vice president and chief financial officer any forward looking statements made today by the management team come under the private securities litigation reform act and involve risks as shown on slides 2 and 3 in our earnings release and in our 10 q and 10 k filings with the sec these and other risks could cause results to differ from those projected in the forward looking statements reconciliations of non gaap measures cited in this call and related slides are also found in those documents 10 stocks we like better than hecla mining when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and hecla mining wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of june 7 2021 with that i will pass the call to phil baker phil baker president and chief executive officer thanks anvita good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call hecla this quarter has delivered a near record results on many fronts we reported our second highest revenues gross profit cash flow from operations and adjusted ebitda in our history and as we capitalize on the higher commodity prices with our continued strong production and focus on cost management we reported record realized silver margin of 19 60 per ounce of silver as silver was our dominant revenue contributor at 40 for the quarter at greens creek and for the company we ve now lowered our cash cost and all in sustaining cost guidance again for the year and lauren s going to speak to that in a minute our financial position continues to strengthen and along with it our financial flexibility our cash position has increased almost two and a half times from the prior year to 181 million as a result of our free cash flow generation our financial strength is not new to this quarter and even for the past few years this is now our 39th consecutive quarter of paying a dividend and dividend that we just announced that we ll pay in september will make it 10 years and we have now returned the shareholders 72 million in common dividends and in the first six months of 2021 we paid 16 of our free cash flow in dividends and as the silver price increases shareholders have the ability to participate in the incremental free cash flow generation with our silver linked dividend and at the same time we ll be maintaining our minimum dividend payment now on the next slide i want to take a moment to talk about esg because we published earlier this quarter our 2020 sustainability report which is entitled small footprint large benefit and if you haven t taken a look at this i would encourage you to do so key understanding hecla s esg and this is on the next slide is the fact that our mines are very small underground mines that had been the economic generator or driver of communities for generations and when i say small mines i mean small tonnage the large companies in our industry will mine as many tons in a day as we do in a year when i say economic drivers for communities we ve been the largest private employer for 30 plus years at all three of our operations because we re small we use very little energy and most of it is hydro so our greenhouse gas emissions are extraordinarily low and i think the best in the industry i know that in 2020 we produced almost 2 5 times more silver equivalent ounces per ton of emissions compared to peers and the amount of water we use per silver equivalent ounces is 63 of what an average person in the united states consumes in a day so when it comes to the environmental impact of hecla think small but when you think about the social impact think big as the largest private employer in small towns with jobs that exist for generations we just earlier this summer we had a summer intern who started with us and that s he s the fifth generation to work at hecla so shout out to scott hogamier and his son and the jobs that we provide are jobs that provide more than a living wage these are jobs that sustain and build communities and particularly during the pandemic the alaska chamber recognized this and named our greens creek operation as the large business of the year for the leadership work that we did in 2020 during the pandemic and it s not just providing jobs we support communities and special needs through multiple programs that we partially fund through our charitable foundation looking at safety our culture is safety culture has gone across all of our operations with casa berardi being awarded quebec maritime mine safety award this is the first time in that mine s 30 year history to win the award finally the metals that we mine are essential in this transformation to renewable energy and hecla produces 40 of the united states silver and our montana assets host america s third largest undeveloped copper deposit with significant silver resources both metals that are keys to green energy and with that i m going to pass it over to russell to talk about the financial condition of the company russell lawlar senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks phil turning to slide 7 propelled by a strong production in sales from our silver mining with higher prices silver accounted for 40 of our revenues in the second quarter followed by gold at 37 while zinc and lead were 23 our operations produced 3 5 million ounces of silver at an all in sustaining cost of 7 54 per ounce resulting in a record margin of 19 60 per ounce with production continuing to increase at lucky friday hecla accounted for more than 40 of the u s silver production in 2020 gold production totaled 59 000 ounces at an all in sustaining cost of 1 419 per ounce for a cash margin of 406 per ounce with these margins on both silver and gold we expect to see continued strong free cash flow generation as we turn to slide 8 starting in the upper left hand corner we ended the quarter with 181 5 million in cash an increase of 41 7 million over the first quarter of 2021 moving to the right with our increasing cash position we delivered a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of 1 2 times well below our target of two times while providing liquidity position of 411 million in the bottom left you can see that our realized silver margins have continued to increase as costs are controlled and byproduct credits drive the all in sustaining costs down margins are now twice what they were a year ago and similar to the first quarter this margin combined with positive working capital management translates into free cash flow this is reflected in the chart at the bottom right quadrant which shows over the past 15 months we ve generated a total of free cash flow of 175 million and if current prices continue we expect to continue our free cash flow generation aided by low cost and high margins with that i ll pass the call to lauren to go through operations lauren roberts senior vice president and chief operating officer thanks russell i ll start on slide 10 at the greens creek mine we produced 2 6 million ounces of silver and 12 9 million ounces of gold at an all in sustaining cost of 0 68 per ounce for the quarter the mine generated 63 5 million in free cash flow in the quarter the fourth highest since hecla acquired full ownership of the mine as it continues to benefit from higher silver lead and zinc prices in the trailing 15 months greens creek generated 255 million in free cash flow by operating safely and consistently throughout the pandemic our workforce is nearly 90 vaccinated and we are taking measured steps to return to normal operations we are lowering further the cash cost and all in sustaining cost guidance due to byproduct credits lower production costs and more favorable smelter terms updated cash cost guidance for greens creek is lowered to negative 1 to 1 per ounce and all in sustaining costs are lowered to 3 25 to 4 per ounce we also are increasing gold production guidance to 43 000 to 45 000 ounces due to higher than modeled grades moving to slide 11 lucky friday now is operating at historical production rates after a successful ramp up in 2020 the mine produced 913 000 ounces of silver and generated positive free cash flow of 14 million in the quarter we are tightening the cash cost guidance for the mine to seven 7 50 to 8 50 per ounce and all in sustaining costs are estimated at 14 25 to 16 25 per ounce and we remain on track to increase metal production to approximately 5 million ounces in 2023 no significant planned outlays required to achieve this goal as the increase is driven by improving grade as we mine deeper we continue to test and optimize a new mining method which better manages the seismicity and has the potential to increase productivity at the mine year to date approximately 75 of the production has come from the new method as with any change in method there is a learning curve but we were really encouraged by the results today at the casa berardi mine shown on slide 12 we produced 31 300 ounces of gold in the second quarter at an all in sustaining cost of 14 34 per ounce our focus on optimizing production has delivered results as we continue to see higher throughput availability and recovery in the mill while our production stayed strong we saw higher costs in the second quarter due to cost associated with the increased volume contractor costs related to maintenance and optimization activities in the mill and higher underground mobile maintenance costs we are increasing our production guidance to 128 000 to 132 000 ounces of gold for the year and our updated cash cost guidance for the mine is 1 000 to 1 125 per ounce all in sustaining costs are expected to be in the range of 1 200 to 1 325 per ounce we remain focused on reducing and optimizing cost at the mine after seeing the positive results on optimizing production and throughput in the trailing 15 months casa berardi has generated a positive free cash flow of 68 4 million and our ongoing business improvement activities are expected to reduce costs and increase cash flow further over the next two years with that i would like to return the call to phil phil baker president and chief executive officer ok let s go to slide 14 and this takes the cost and production guidance that lauren went through mine by mine and shows what it is on a consolidated basis for 2021 to 2023 as far as production so you can see how we ve increased the gold production guidance to 191 000 to 198 000 we ve lowered our consolidated silver cash cost and all in sustaining costs guidance and so now the cash cost guidance between 1 and 2 and the all in sustaining costs are estimated to be 9 to 11 per ounce of silver so at current prices we would expect to generate roughly 15 per ounce of free cash flow from our silver operations we re also increasing our gold cash costs and all in sustaining cost at casa berardi slightly as lauren mentioned our capital expenditures are expected to increase slightly and that reflects the repurchases of royalties that were outstanding in nevada and at casa berardi operations these were put in place before hecla owned them these assets and we did that in the second quarter earlier in the quarter we announced an increase in our exploration expenditures to 40 million and pre development to 8 5 million we will update our exploration activities in early september and before i open the line for questions i just want to thank our employees for the commitment to safe operations they ve had during this pandemic and being able to deliver very strong operational and financial results and so with that operator i d like to open the line for questions questions answers operator your first question comes from the line of heiko ihle with h c wainwright heiko ihle h c wainwright co llc analyst hey phil and team thanks for taking my questions i hope you guys are all staying safe and well phil baker president and chief executive officer we are heiko ihle h c wainwright co llc analyst good in the release you talked about the lower treatment charges and you re one of the first to really put it black on white like that that s nice to hear miners talk about it but it leads to just sort of a follow up from an analyst s point of view in your all in sustaining reconciliation it looks like your tcs had gone from 23 2 million in q4 2020 to 15 5 million in q1 2021 and now 13 6 million i assume the answer is yes but just to make sure are you seeing the same thing going forward in q3 and beyond or are there actually even more improvements i mean these are very stark differences phil baker president and chief executive officer i ll let russell answer your question russell lawlar senior vice president and chief financial officer yes heiko essentially what happened is a lot of our concentrated business sold at benchmark terms and that gets negotiated on an annual basis the treatment charge especially for zinc concentrate dramatically decreased from last year to this year and so you re seeing a large change most notably at greens creek because it has quite a lot of zinc concentrate and concentrate is exposed to the zinc concentrate benchmark term so i would say for the rest of the year we ll likely see it kind of like what we ve seen for the first half of the year with the exception if you recall in the first quarter we highlighted there was one shipment that was made at kind of better than normal terms and so we highlighted that a quarter ago so that kind of folks don t carry that benefit forward but i would suggest we ll see the treatment charges kind of continue as if kind of the q2 2021 rate essentially there are also some concentrate parcels that are sold outside of the benchmark so it can we can move a little bit based on that but that s kind of around numbers that should be roughly what we see in the future heiko ihle h c wainwright co llc analyst got it that actually helps you given that q2 was lower right russell lawlar senior vice president and chief financial officer well yes i mean there s factors such as the concentrate mix that shifts zinc versus lead et cetera so there s factors there too and that should be good phil baker president and chief executive officer and you can get a pretty good feel in the second half of the year from just looking at our guidance heiko ihle h c wainwright co llc analyst yes fair phil baker president and chief executive officer and it s in the reconciliation heiko ihle h c wainwright co llc analyst yeah nevada seems to make a pretty decent progress with hatter graben at hollister and then the exploration that you re doing at midas any idea how much money you ve invested in the area this year thus far and is there a breakdown of the money that has been spent in nevada that you re willing and able to provide even just a little bit of granularity phil baker president and chief executive officer well yes we can russell can he has done a little bit of work on that recently so go ahead russell with what you were talking to me about russell lawlar senior vice president and chief financial officer yes essentially from nevada the perspective of nevada we re essentially becoming cash flow neutral i would say from the operational perspective we ve invested obviously at hatter graben the development and the exploration and i m thinking about maybe a quarter to a third of that is sort of the 40 million that we ve guided here would probably spend in nevada and so we will from an operational perspective we ll kind of cover the costs that we have as well as some of the exploration costs that we will invest in nevada from that perspective phil baker president and chief executive officer so the point is heiko with that cashflow negative that we generated early on in nevada we have recouped that with the exception of the expenditures that we re now making in expiration and the ramp development so we re pleased with how things have developed in nevada heiko ihle h c wainwright co llc analyst ok and i promise russell didn t make me ask that question because he just worked on it just so you know ok i ll get back in queue thank you guys phil baker president and chief executive officer thanks heiko operator your next question comes line of mike jalonen with bank of america mike jalonen bank of america merrill lynch analyst well good morning phil and russell and i just had a question phil great news on greens creek workforce nearly 90 vaccinated and what about lucky friday and casa berardi what are their rates at phil baker president and chief executive officer they re quite a bit lower in the case of casa we re in the process of vaccination it s really about the availability of the vaccine in quebec and so that s they re working they re above 50 with fully vaccinated and it s increasing in the case of the lucky friday it s not dissimilar to the national average the u s national average mike jalonen bank of america merrill lynch analyst is that around 50 phil baker president and chief executive officer yeah when you consider vaccinations and people that have had covid mike jalonen bank of america merrill lynch analyst oh what kind of steps is hecla taking to encourage lucky friday employees to get vaccinated phil baker president and chief executive officer well it s a it s been an ongoing education process that s the primary thing that we re able to do and then we have all the protocols that people have to take and until we have a further vaccination it s really difficult to remove those protocols and that s one of the reasons why at greens creek i think the vaccination rate is so high as we had this quarantine period that people were required to get through with the vaccination rate as high as it is we re not having to do the same quarantine lauren anything you want to add to this lauren roberts senior vice president and chief operating officer i would say at lucky friday mike we ve done some work to encourage folks just through making vaccinations available at the mine site we ve had anybody who does get vaccinated gets a little bit of a trinket and appreciation so we ve gone through those steps but i would also say and reiterate what phil said it s pretty consistent with certainly the idaho average rates and we really haven t seen any spike or material impact from it because of the controls we ve put in place and we would anticipate that to continue going forward mike jalonen bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok well thank you for that and good luck lauren roberts senior vice president and chief operating officer all right thanks mike operator there are no further questions i ll turn the call over to phil baker phil baker president and chief executive officer ok well thanks very much i just want to remind folks that we have available the ability to do one on one call with us so hopefully you saw that in the press release and that s open to just shareholders analysts just anyone that s interested in hecla we d be happy to have these one on one calls and so i look forward to hearing from you and if it doesn t work out for today you can certainly talk to russell and we can set something up for some time next week so thanks everyone have a good day operator duration 23 minutes call participants anvita patil investor relations phil baker president and chief executive officer

taking your questions so dan go ahead please dan e malone executive vice president chief sustainability officer thank you jeff the key takeaways from our second quarter 2021 results are second quarter sales and earnings are up significantly over the covid impacted prior year second quarter total company net sales of 348 million were up 29 industrial division net sales of 231 million were up 27 agricultural division net sales of 116 million were up 35 net income of 26 million or 2 19 per diluted share was up 100 the adjusted net income of 23 4 million or 1 97 per diluted share was up 73 and ebitda of 44 9 million was up 30 over the prior year s second quarter adjusted results also our trailing 12 month adjusted ebitda was 155 3 million up 7 from full year 2020 total debt outstanding was reduced by 38 7 million during the second quarter and was down 28 from the prior year second quarter and our backlog increased 10 during the current second quarter to 503 6 million which was up 132 over the prior year quarter second quarter 2021 net sales of 348 million were 29 higher than the prior year second quarter during the quarter our top line benefited from a continued rise in order rates and backlog as well as the effect of recent pricing actions but inbound supply chain and labor capacity issues are still constraining our growth across all lines of business industrial division s second quarter 2021 net sales of 231 million represented a 27 increase from the prior year second quarter we saw strong customer demand and backlog growth in all of this division s product lines agricultural division second quarter 2021 sales were 116 million up 35 from the prior year second quarter during the quarter strong agricultural market conditions low dealer inventories and pricing actions continue to drive organic sales growth in this division gross margin for the second quarter of 2021 was 88 1 million or 25 4 of net sales compared to 67 8 million or 25 2 of net sales in the prior year second quarter excluding 0 7 million of morbark s inventory step up expenses the prior year second quarter gross margin was 68 5 million or 25 5 of net sales in the second quarter the favorable leveraging effect from significant sales volume improvement over the covid impacted prior year quarter as well as aggressive pricing actions helped us maintain percentage gross margins despite a dramatic rise in material costs production inefficiencies resulting from supply chain and labor capacity constraints and a less favorable mix of service part sales operating income for the second quarter of 2021 was 33 6 million or 9 7 of net sales which is up 48 over the prior year quarter and up 45 when prior year results are adjusted to exclude the morbark inventory step up expense higher sales volume and the gross margin effects already mentioned more than offset a more normal level of operating expenses as compared to the reduced spending levels of the pandemic affected prior year period while we re pleased to see this improvement we would normally expect a double digit operating margin percentage in the second quarter our recent pricing actions have been aggressive but the effective impact of these actions has been lagging a continued steep rise in cost this is likely to continue until the rate of cost increases moderate net income for the second quarter 2021 of 26 million or 2 19 per diluted share was double the prior year second quarter results excluding a 2 6 million after tax gain on a real estate sale from the current year quarter and the morbark inventory step up expense from the prior year quarter second quarter adjusted net income of 23 4 million was up 73 over the adjusted prior year result this increase in adjusted net income was primarily due to the 48 improvement in operating income but it was also helped by lower interest expense and a favorable effective income tax rate second quarter 2021 ebitda was 44 9 million up 30 over the prior year second quarter adjusted ebitda trailing 12 month ebitda of 155 3 million is up 10 1 million or 7 above adjusted 2020 ebitda second quarter 2021 ebitda was 12 9 of net sales which was flat to the prior year second quarter adjusted results during the second quarter 2021 we saw an 18 million net provision of cash from operating activities despite steep volume and inflation driven increases in both accounts receivable and inventories this combined with the repatriation of cash from foreign subsidiaries resulted in a 38 7 million reduction in outstanding debt during the second quarter improved turnover of both receivables and inventory accounted for this better than expected performance we ended the second quarter of 2021 with an all time high order backlog of 503 6 million which is an increase of 132 over the prior year second quarter and 10 higher than the end of the current year first quarter during the quarter we saw continued strong customer demand across the entire range of our industrial and agricultural products to recap our second quarter 2021 results second quarter sales and earnings were up significantly over the covid impacted prior year second quarter total company net sales up 29 industrial division net sales up 27 agricultural division net sales up 35 net income up 100 adjusted net income up 73 and ebitda up 30 over the prior year second quarter adjusted results trailing 12 month adjusted ebitda was up 7 from full year 2020 total outstanding debt was reduced by 38 7 million during the second quarter and our backlog increased 10 during the second quarter to 503 6 million i d now like to turn the call back over to jeff jeffery a leonard chief executive officer and president thank you dan first i d again like to thank everybody who s joined the call today my first quarterly earnings call as president and ceo of alamo group it s an honor to succeed ron robinson who s had an exemplary 22 year period as our ceo i d like to take this opportunity to thank ron for his highly successful stewardship of the company over so many years this is certainly an interesting time to step in as ceo with the many positive and challenging trends that are influencing business at the moment over the past few months and certainly throughout the second quarter coronavirus vaccination rates steadily improved across many countries economies reopened and people became more confident about returning to more normal daily routines while recovery from the pandemic is not yet evident in all of our markets north america and europe have rebounded strongly and we experienced a further resurgence of activity in our markets in the second quarter customer ordering activity remained at a healthy level and our backlog increased to another new record at the end of the quarter unfortunately many raw material suppliers and industrial component manufacturers have not been able to add capacity fast enough to meet the higher demand certain critical components such as computer logic chips remain in severe shortage and logistics networks are strained manufacturers such as alamo group rely on a stable supply chain and efficient logistics network to allow us to meet our customers needs in a timely manner a shortage of skilled workers has further limited the ability of manufacturers to add capacity most notably in north america finally the combination of shortages and high demand has led to cost inflation in the raw materials and components that are needed to support our production requirements for example steel prices continue to rise sharply and were up by double digits again in the period like most manufacturers alamo group is not immune to these issues and our teams have had to work flexibly and creatively to deliver another solid performance for the quarter continuing the trend of the last several quarters our agricultural division produced strong second quarter results the ag market has consistently held up better during the pandemic largely due to the combined effects of several positive trends first after several years of soft conditions dealer inventories were low when demand began to accelerate and they remain low now as demand continues to outpace deliveries from oems to dealers also crop prices have been steadily rising since august of 2020 giving professional farmers the confidence to invest in maintenance or replacement of their equipment similarly livestock prices have been rising given the same increased confidence to ranchers finally the pandemic has led to more people to seeking rural lifestyles increasing investments in land and the essential equipment to maintain it as a result of these combined trends in the market in the second quarter our agricultural division enjoyed steady growth in orders and sales not only in north america and europe but also in markets such as brazil and australia thanks to timely and well planned price actions implemented by the division s leadership teams margin compression was minimalized and the division achieved a very good level of profitability in spite of the cost and availability pressures in the supply chain and logistics network the industrial division also reported solid improvements in both sales and earnings in the second quarter the impact of the pandemic on governmental budget has not been as severe as previously expected and activity in this market continued to improve sequentially during the period municipalities in the united states benefited from the very strong real estate market that has increased property taxes that are a major source of their revenue also stimulus actions taken by national governments in north america and europe helped agencies at the state and local level offset lower revenue from income taxes and fees as employment fell as a result of pandemic during the second quarter the industrial division sales to governmental agencies continued to accelerate but they ve not quite fully recovered to the levels achieved before the onset of the pandemic nongovernmental markets for the industrial divisions products also improved in sectors such as forestry land clearing petrochemicals utilities and steel during the second quarter as most world economies took steps to reopen this was evident in improved sales of the division s large wood grinders vacuum trucks and excavators also by the end of the quarter utilization of our vacuum truck rental fleet was very close to pre pandemic levels the industrial division was impacted by sharply higher steel costs shortages of important hydraulic components logistics delays and skilled worker shortages while this division also took significant price actions to protect margins the longer delivery cycles associated with the division s products means that it will take somewhat longer for the higher prices to be fully evident in its results considering the many operational challenges we faced in the second quarter i m pleased with the results we ve achieved i m also proud that our teams quickly reacted to these challenges to mitigate the impact on our results to the fullest extent possible i m also pleased that we further reduced our debt this quarter and continued to strengthen the company s balance sheet this positions the company well to take advantage of acquisition opportunities that may arise and what s proving to be an active m a season with alamo group s record order backlog of nearly 504 million the company s outlook continues to look promising although it doesn t now appear that the cost pressures component shortages and tight labor market are likely to meaningfully improve during the remainder of 2021 one issue that remains of concern is the spread of the de strain of covid that has emerged over the past few weeks although evidence suggests that vaccinations reduce both the frequency and seriousness of covid infections another significant wave of coronavirus illness could adversely affect our performance on balance though i remain confident that our teams will continue to react appropriately as conditions in our operating environment involved and that alamo group will continue to deliver solid results this year this concludes our prepared remarks we re now ready to take your questions so operator please go ahead questions and answers operator we will take our first question from chris moore from cjs securities chris moore cjs securities analyst hi good afternoon guys thanks for taking my few question jeffery a leonard chief executive officer and president good afternoon chris moore cjs securities analyst good afternoon so industrial sales up 27 ag up 35 can you break out even roughly volume versus price on those jeffery a leonard chief executive officer and president dan do you want to take a crack at that dan e malone executive vice president chief sustainability officer yes the price increases have been double digits because of just the variety of products that we sell it s really kind of hard and in different units we re taking different levels of price increases it would it s a difficult analysis i can just tell you that the price increases were double digits in both the industrial and the ag side of the business chris moore cjs securities analyst got it i appreciate that you talked about dealer inventories remain very low is there any way to quantify where those inventories are today versus six months ago or 12 or even 24 months ago just trying to get a more kind of quantitative sense in terms of the that still low level richard j wehrle executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer chris i think they ve improved since the end of last year everybody pretty much reduced their inventory levels down during 2020 but they re actually picking up and they re improving so they re actually they seem to be very pleased to have obviously product on their lot but it s continued to move out to the end user as well so a nice steady flow dan e malone executive vice president chief sustainability officer yes and one of the reasons we know they re down i mean we get intelligence from the sales force in the side of the business that s where dealer inventories are most common but the other way that we absolutely know that they re way down as the receivables the receivables on the ag side are way down and as soon as they sell a unit we don t have to wait until the third quarter to get paid chris moore cjs securities analyst got it that s helpful and just looking at backlog record backlog in a normal year what percentage of that backlog would you typically ship during the balance of the year and how would you compare that against what we re going through right now jeffery a leonard chief executive officer and president yes i think we re richard j wehrle executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer i think go ahead go ahead jeff jeffery a leonard chief executive officer and president yes chris this is jeff leonard i mean i think obviously lead times are a little bit longer than they are normally but in normal times a 500 million backlog at the rate we re currently shipping would carry us to close to the end of the year so i do believe most of that backlog if everything remains stable should turn what we can t predict accurately yet is what the impact of the supply chain is likely to be going forward while people have asked me a lot of questions about that i think the supply chain situation is stable it s not getting worse but on the other hand i haven t seen meaningful improvement yet so in the normal circumstances most of that backlog should turn before the end of the year but we re certainly in a kind of a watch and wait and see mode with regard to the supply chain chris moore cjs securities analyst got it i ll leave it there i appreciate your time jeff operator thank you we ll take a question from greg burns from sidoti company greg burns sidoti company analyst yes is there any way to quantify could you quantify the price cost gap in the quarter how big that was from a dollar perspective and in terms of the price increases that you re passing along the timing of when we might see the benefit of those and closing that price cost gap dan e malone executive vice president chief sustainability officer where we can see the price cost gap is the fact that our volumes are way up and you would expect that we d be well above 10 operating margin and well above the 25 4 where we were on the gross margin as well given the volume leveraging that we should have seen so i think it s affecting our margins but i think it s affecting our operating margin by at least 100 basis points and it s really this is again this is it s really a difficult analysis it s a moving target we re putting in pricing as quickly as we can get it in and then the costs are just coming in and they re all coming in differently in different business units richard j wehrle executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer craig several times we put price increases and then the next week the cost increases have gone up when the price increase we just did was to cover the cost increase that we did probably a couple of weeks ago so everything that we re doing is probably a drag of 45 to 60 days so if the costs can stay steady for a period of time price increases we put into effect will definitely help us as we move out dan e malone executive vice president chief sustainability officer yes if we just would get any moderation in the cost then the pricing we re putting pricing we re aggressive we re putting pricing in place as we see costs rise but when the costs continue to rise there is a delaying impact i think it s at least 100 basis points on the operating margin just the timing issue greg burns sidoti company analyst okay and then when we look at the backlog the lead times extending out do you see any risk if pricing continues to rise that some of that backlog falls off jeffery a leonard chief executive officer and president yes this is jeff i ll tackle that one greg we ve not had any customers cancel orders yet at least none that i m aware of we don t see any evidence of unusual buying at the moment and if you look at our two divisions in the industrial division which is mostly governmental governmental agencies really can t buy on speculation they don t have the power to do that and they don t behave that way in the ag side the indicator would be when dealer inventory starts to rise and dealers would then start to get cautious about waiting for orders that haven t been delivered yet and maybe some cancellations would occur but we ve seen no evidence of that to date and we ve already talked a little bit about dealer inventories kind of just kind of holding at a low level right now so we haven t seen much upward tick there yet so on the bigger ag stuff products that are being shipped or being retailed as fast as the dealers receive them at the moment so in short we don t see any risk in the backlog at the moment greg burns sidoti company analyst okay and then in terms of the supply chain chassis have been particular area of constraints are you seeing anything there or in any other specific products or components that maybe give you more concern as you look out into the balance of the year jeffery a leonard chief executive officer and president yes i ll tackle that one again greg on the chassis side we ve been very fortunate so far that chassis struggles have not really impacted us too heavily yet we have good relationships with our chassis suppliers we do a pretty good job of forecasting for them and throughout this year so far they ve been able to meet our demands for the most part we ve had to juggle a little bit here and there but we ve not had to shut down any facilities and we ve not had to turn down any delivery requests from customers we couldn t lose any orders over that the things that are making me more concerned are actually some of the smaller components at the moment hydraulics of all types are in very short supply at the moment and if you place an order for 10 hydraulic motors you might if you re lucky you get 5 and the lead times are very long for hydraulic components typically out to about six months right now and then i mentioned the computer logic chip shortage and people ask me a lot well how does that impact you well every chassis that we buy has two to three computer logic chips in it and tractor is the same because they all have an engine control module that requires on those computer logic chips and even things like dlc controllers that control the hydraulics and many of the products that we produce contain chips so we re watching that very very closely but i would say at the moment hydraulics are the ones that are keeping me up the most at night but there s other things even things like wiring harnesses getting wiring harnesses made for the equipment that we manufacture is a struggle there aren t a lot of suppliers out there for those and they tend to be a fairly complex and yet low dollar value item that can really put you into a bad spot if you re not able to get them so it s just a variety of things that s the way i would describe it right now greg burns sidoti company analyst alright thank you operator and it appears we have no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call back over to the i m sorry we have a follow up question from greg burns greg burns sidoti company analyst hi i guess no one else is on i ll ask one or two more in terms of what you re doing from a capacity perspective a record backlog how are you increasing capacity are you expanding your footprint what are you doing to kind of prepare yourself to fulfill that backlog and maybe meet some of the demand you might see from an infrastructure bill if it gets passed jeffery a leonard chief executive officer and president yes a couple of things greg i mean if you look at some of the remarks i made in the press release we re investing heavily in robotics at the moment in welding because welders have been hard to come by these days and that s been a nice improvement for us particularly in some of our larger units we ve been able to get a hold of and deploy robots a little bit faster than we were able to do previously so that s been a good help we are not facility limited we re not floor space limited or machine tool limited or anything else at the moment our limitations are the supply chain and manpower more than anything else and manpower obviously we are trying every trick in the book to hire as many people as we can but we have to then onboard them and train them and get them indoctrinated to the things that we do in our plants so that takes a bit of time and i think those are challenges that are going to be there for a while but we are making headway with it and the rate at which we ve been able to generate revenue has been stepping up fairly consistently over the last few months and i think that s a trend that s likely to continue greg burns sidoti company analyst okay great thanks operator we have no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call back over to the management team for any concluding remarks jeffery a leonard chief executive officer and president okay well thank you again everybody for joining us today we look forward to speaking with you again on our 2021 third quarter call in november so once

san francisco and suzhou china aug 5 2021 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology metabolic autoimmune and other major diseases and eli lilly and company nyse lly today announced new and updated data from the orient 11 study demonstrating a sustained survival benefit of sintilimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy in the first line treatment of patients with nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer in addition biomarker results from the trial provide important insights for patients with high major histocompatibility complex mhc class ii expression these findings were published today in the journal of thoracic oncology in august 2020 interim analysis data from orient 11 were released in an oral presentation at the iaslc world conference on lung cancer wclc 2020 virtual presidential symposium these interim data were simultaneously published online by the journal of thoracic oncology orient 11 is a randomized double blind phase 3 clinical trial evaluating sintilimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy compared to placebo in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy as a first line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous nsclc without sensitizing egfr mutations or alk rearrangements the journal of thoracic oncology manuscript discloses as of january 15 2021 with a median follow up of 22 9 months the median overall survival os of patients receiving the sintilimab combination was not yet reached the sintilimab combination demonstrated a sustainable os benefit hr 0 60 95 ci 0 45 0 79 p 0 0003 and the median os for those receiving the placebo combination was 16 8 months whole transcriptome sequencing of baseline tumor samples was performed to probe the predictive and correlative biomarkers showing that high or medium immune cell infiltration was strongly associated with improved progression free survival pfs in the sintilimab combination group in particular high mhc class ii presentation pathway expression was significantly correlated with prolonged pfs hr 0 32 95 ci 0 19 0 54 p 0 0001 and os hr 0 36 95 ci 0 20 0 64 p 0 0005 in the sintilimab combination group professor li zhang head of department of internal medicine sun yat sen university cancer center the primary investigator of orient 11 and the corresponding author of the manuscript stated sintilimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy demonstrated a sustainable survival benefit after long term follow up in the orient 11 study these data showed that this sintilimab combination should be further evaluated as front line therapy for patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer without egfr or alk genomic tumor aberrations dr wei xu vice president of translational medicine of innovent and co corresponding author of the manuscript stated immunotherapy based on pd 1 and pd l1 antibodies has revolutionized clinical practice of treating non small cell lung cancer however the precise patient population who will benefit from immunotherapy chemotherapy combination treatment is still unclear we explored the gene expression profile in the tumor microenvironment and found that the infiltration of antigen presenting cells and high expression of the mhc ii antigen presentation pathway correlated with improved outcomes in patients who received the sintilimab pemetrexed platinum chemotherapy combination this finding contributes to a better understanding of the mechanism of action of the immunotherapy chemotherapy combination which could help inform selection of suitable patients for future sintilimab studies publication of this study in the journal of thoracic oncology is a recognition of the important work by this research team and we will continue to explore new areas in immuno oncology with the goal of identifying additional novel approaches to treat cancer in clinical practice dr li wang senior vp of lilly china and head of lilly china drug development and medical affairs center stated we re excited to see that the results of orient 11 show sintilimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy can bring an overall survival benefit to patients with nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer in the first line treatment setting also research of the tumor microenvironment is helping scientists find suitable biomarkers as potential targets for cancer treatment these orient 11 biomarker results published in the journal of thoracic oncology will help us further understand the mechanism of action of this immunotherapy based combination in order to identify patients who are more likely to respond to treatment about the orient 11 trial orient 11 is a randomized double blind phase 3 clinical trial

pandemic rrd delivered strong second quarter performance as we continue to successfully execute our strategic initiatives while protecting the health and safety of our global colleagues dan knotts rrd president and ceo said in the earnings release our double digit organic sales growth driven by an improving market and increased volumes in our strategic product categories marked our fourth consecutive quarter of improving sales trends through our ongoing actions to strengthen our core and enhance our financial flexibility we reported q2 adjusted income from operations that surpassed our pre pandemic earnings in 2019 and our debt was at the lowest second quarter level since the spin knotts added looking forward we remain highly focused on driving sales growth and aggressively managing our cost structure to combat the ongoing challenges created by the global pandemic inflation and supply chain disruptions specifically net sales in the second quarter were 1 15 billion up 136 million or 13 5 from the same period in 2020 the increase results from strengthening demand for most of the rrd s products and services notably higher demand for e commerce sales contributed to four consecutive quarters of net sales growth in rrd s packaging and label products organic net sales increased 11 4 according to the earnings release the business services segment was up 11 6 on a non gaap organic basis while the marketing solutions segment was up 10 3 on a non gaap organic basis from the second quarter of 2020 the business services segment experienced growth in several of rrd s strategic focus areas including packaging labels and supply chain management net sales in marketing solutions also experienced growth led by higher volumes in digital print and fulfillment and direct marketing partially offset by last year s u s census project which was completed by rrd in mid 2020 nevertheless loss per share from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders was 0 13 in the second quarter of 2021 compared to loss per share of 0 79 reported in the second quarter of 2020 cash used in operating activities during the six months ended june 30 2021 was 64 8 million compared to 44 2 million in the prior year period according to rrd s earnings release the increase in cash used from operations during 2021 is primarily driven by 23 9 million of lsc bankruptcy related payments mostly associated with lump sum settlements for employee retirement obligations higher tax and incentive compensation payments and a 9 2 million payment to terminate certain interest rate swap agreements the release pointed out rrd issues a tepid financial outlook rrd did indicate that it expects net sales to be up 1 to 3 for the year despite the ongoing uncertainty amidst covid 19 while client demand for our products and services continues to strengthen ongoing challenges including labor shortages supply chain disruption inflationary increases and shipping delays caused by container shortages in key ports including china remain the release noted these issues combined with the ongoing uncertainty related to the covid 19 pandemic create added challenges when predicting future business performance operating cash flow is also expected to be slightly lower from the prior year due to payments to settle lsc bankruptcy related obligations and repayment of half of the employer portion of payroll taxes deferred in 2020 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 80 million rrd also expects to receive an additional deposit of approximately 50 million this year as part of the agreement to sell its printing facility in china from chatham s perspective that past financial performance and outlook for the future is not good enough

lower marriott s business risk profile and improve profitability which should enhance the company s ability to navigate future lodging cycle downturns the combined company will have the largest high quality internationally recognized brand portfolio in the industry 30 brands acquiring starwood will also enhance marriott s position in advanced emerging markets lastly fitch estimates cost synergies

cash flow margin the company s all stock funding strategy for the acquisition further demonstrates its commitment to its existing financial policies including maintaining a low investment grade rating

demonstrate similar or enhanced gross and net unit growth and achieve cost synergies during the one to two year rating outlook horizon fitch would consider revising the rating outlook to stable from positive if management changes its financial policy and opts to maintain leverage at a level higher than 3 0x to 3 25x to that end fitch believes marriott is committed to maintaining a bbb rating and the company does not presently see strategic reasons for targeting a higher rating fitch plans to withdraw its ratings for starwood after the transaction closes fitch expects marriott will assume starwood s outstanding unsecured bonds and or refinance any of starwood s bonds that may be subject to change of control provisions that are triggered by this transaction financial policy unchanged fitch views marriott s all stock transaction funding strategy as a credit positive that demonstrates the company s commitment to its low investment grade rating fitch expects the company to sustain leverage within its stated 3 0x to 3 25x target range at the through 2018 excluding any non routine transaction costs incurred during 2016 and 2017 which the company estimates could total 100 to 150 million fitch s base case projections assume marriott achieves 200 million in annualized synergies by 4q 17 fitch also expects marriott to move swiftly to complete starwood s owned asset disposition program by selling and in most cases taking back long term franchise management contracts starwood owned hotels with approximately 1 8 billion of company estimated after tax value fitch believes marriott s demonstrated ability to execute asset sales on a global basis as well as cloud cover provided by the transaction synergies will help expedite the sales process although dispositions have accelerated under starwood s new management investors have generally been disappointed with the company s asset sales pace since it announced the program several years ago increased scale and diversity acquiring starwood strengthens marriott s credit profile by adding scale and diversity resulting in lower lowering business risk the combined company will have an unmatched 5 500 hotels with 1 1 million rooms across 30 brands the combination will also bolster marriott s international presence and enhance its relationship with affluent leisure and millennial travelers many of which favor starwood owned brands starwood also brings a strong portfolio of lifestyle brands and leisure presence to the table as well as its starwood preferred guest loyalty system the legacy starwood hotel system will benefit from marriott s arguably stronger positions with large group and business travelers fitch also believes that marriott benefits whether intentional or not from defensive attributes by acquiring starwood press reports had indicated that hyatt hotels corp was considering a bid for starwood the combination of hyatt and starwood would arguably result in another u s lodging company of similar scale to hilton and marriott positive franchisee reaction is key fitch sees moderate execution risk related to the transaction primarily stemming from the company s franchisee relationships this risk encompasses the combined company s ability to attract and retain franchisees to its system and is likely to play out over many years as existing marriott and starwood franchise and management contracts expire there is an element of franchisee dissatisfaction within the lodging industry regarding the proliferation of new hotel brands from the major lodging brand owners including marriott marriott has historically been a leader in creating new brands to target an ever more granularly segmented traveler although theoretically designed to appeal to different customers in practice there has been some level of overlap which reduces the value franchisees receive from affiliating with a given brand and could hamper the company s rooms system growth in addition marriott and starwood each own hotel brands that compete head to head in the market place including in adjacent locations that would otherwise be prohibited within current franchise radius restrictions this could result in an elevated level of brand and or management contract losses if existing starwood and marriott franchisees opt to re flag their properties also some hotel owners have historically expressed a preference for starwood over marriott and vice versa these owners may opt to re flag their hotels when contracts expire regardless of whether a competitive marriott branded hotel is nearby notwithstanding the above some merger related aspects will benefit franchisees for example the breadth and depth of the combined company s loyalty rewards system will be unmatched in the industry and the company should benefit from lower administrative costs from combining the programs in addition fitch believes the merger will reduce costs for franchisees in several areas including training and recruiting inventory procurement credit card processing accounting it and revenue management lastly owners should see a benefit from the sharing of best practices as well as the combined company s deeper understanding of customer travel patterns from an organizational perspective marriott and starwood have similar structures that should facilitate the integration of the combined company s regional divisions and ensure a solid level of cost synergies from the elimination of duplicative overhead fitch expects the company to use discretionary share repurchases as a lever to maintain leverage at or below its 3 0x to 3 25x target to the extent that cost synergies are lower or higher than the 200 million run rate assumed in our base case projections key assumptions u s lodging industry revpar growth increases by 7 during 2015 and decelerates but remains positive to the mid to low single digit range for the balance of the forecast period fee revenue grows in line with gross potential revenue gpr is a fitch estimate of total system wide room revenue from which marriott can receive fees 2015 gpr is based on 5 7 net supply growth and mid single digit revpar growth resulting in low double digit increases through 2017 franchise fees as a percentage of gpr increase due to limited service additions in north america that are weighted towards the franchise model as opposed to managed or owned mar returns its excess free cash flow to shareholders through dividend increases and share repurchases regulating the latter to maintain at or near its 3 0x to 3 25x leverage target at the bbb rating rating sensitivities to resolve the positive outlook fitch will consider the combined company s ability to demonstrate similar or enhanced gross and net unit growth and achieve cost synergies during the one to two year rating outlook horizon fitch would consider revising the rating outlook to stable from positive if management changes its financial policy and opts to maintain leverage at a level higher than 3 0x to 3 25x fitch expects marriott to pull back on investment spending and share repurchases as well as its cp balance in the event of a significant downturn a negative rating action could take place if marriott chose not to adjust its capital allocation in a downturn scenario a negative rating action could also occur if a lodging industry downturn occurs that is more severe than fitch s stress case scenarios which contemplates industrywide revpar declines of 13 15 due at least in part to the more attractive supply growth environment relative to the last recessions fitch believes revpar declines would be somewhat less severe than the 20 declines experienced in 2008 to 2009 marriott s f2 short term rating is supported by its back up liquidity coverage from its rcf and sufficient internally generated sources of liquidity to amply cover near term debt service if these liquidity measures deteriorate over time there could be pressure on the f2
