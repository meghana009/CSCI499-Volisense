what s happening it is encouraging these days to come across an attractive company whose share price is not at an all time high especially given the strong market recovery from the nadir of 2020 however your first question should be why has this one been left behind slow burner data management company restore has an aim listing so although we may be able to buy shares we are also dealing in a generally illiquid market data management company restore has an aim listing so although we may be able to buy shares we are also dealing in a generally illiquid market which means that although there will be a share price quoted there may be very few buyers or sellers for investors this is incredibly frustrating as although you may have made a paper profit on your investments you may not be able to crystallise this gain unless you can find a buyer this is a lesson that we should all be aware of illiquid or untradeable shares are potentially very dangerous for portfolios as we discovered courtesy of neil woodford why does it matter restore has been left behind by the great miracle share price recovery this does not mean that it is necessarily a bad share but there is a reason for it markets do not suddenly forget about companies in this case it is because it is classed as a value stock as opposed to the supposedly more dynamic not necessarily or fashionable quite likely growth stock this was illustrated last year as the american tech giants bullied the rest of the market later in the year more focus was put on those areas that were seemingly unloved many are in the ftse 100 displaying more laggardly growth against the flash yanks however this is changing what should i do the neglected areas have been trying to catch up in the uk markets with the mining and oil companies as well as the utilities garnering more interest restore is seen as a rather slow burner some would say dull but i quite like dull if it gives me better value this company gets involved in mass record storage and in secure disposal relocation services for companies hardly gets the heart beating and recycling old it kit seems very worthy but rather dull even so the latest figures say that restore remained in the black last year which in itself is impressive restore stands to benefit from the office shrinkage we are likely to see as more staff continue to work at least partly from home as this will mean increased demand for its data management and relocation services any suggestions the shares hit their record price peak in january 2018 at 597p last year saw them fall to 268p and they are now 399p so for me there is further to go and with cash available the company is well positioned to be buying up financially damaged assets following the slump last year however if you want something less risky but using the same logic that value stocks are coming back then the much derided ftse 100 would be a cheap and easy investment by way of a low cost fund such as the ishares core ftse 100 ucits etf
hyderabad telangana state has urged the centre to import covid 19 vaccines from countries that have them in surplus this it minister k t rama rao said will help states vaccinate their people universal covid 19 vaccination is the only permanent solution for dealing with the present crisis said the minister while inaugurating a 150 bed intensive care unit icu for covid 19 patients at the telangana institute of medical sciences tims in gachibowli here rama rao pointed out that 50 crore vaccines manufactured by astrazeneca are lying unutilised in countries like norway denmark canada and the usa what is preventing the centre from opening dialogue with these countries and procuring the vaccines this will allow for vaccination of half of the indian population he stated the minister regretted that the central government has depended only on two companies bharat biotech and serum institute of india for supply of vaccines though it would not be possible for them to meet the huge demand of the country central government policy on procurement and administration of vaccines is faulty exporting vaccines to other countries when we have a large population was a wrong decision we now need vaccines but there are no sufficient stocks opening up vaccination process for 18 44 years group without sufficient stocks has further complicated issues at the ground level he underlined rama rao was critical of the manner in which the centre was going about procuring and distribution coronavirus vaccines making the states answerable to their people there is a hue and cry for vaccines and long queues at public health centres but the private sector has been slow in meeting the challenge due to lack of a robust vaccination process he said the minister underlined that with cases of coronavirus reducing in the state state government is upgrading its health infrastructure to ensure that there is availability of oxygen ventilators and other medical devices at government hospitals incidentally the telangana state government and hyderabad software enterprises association hysea member companies are coordinating in providing ventilators oxygen cylinders oxygen concentrators beds masks flow meters and other equipment to tims kondapur district hospital sarojini devi eye hospital niloufer hospital gandhi hospital king koti and fever hospital rama rao along with principal secretary jayesh ranjan cyberabad police commissioner v c sajjanar ranga reddy district collector amoy kumar and health and medical education director dr k ramesh reddy went around the tims hospital and met patients the minister spoke to patients and inquired from them about the treatment being given to them

washington june 5 us employers increased hiring in may and raised wages as they competed for workers with millions of unemployed americans still at home because of childcare issues generous unemployment checks and lingering fears over covid 19 though the pickup in job growth shown in the labour department s closely watched employment report yesterday missed economists forecasts it gave assurance that the recovery from the pandemic recession remained on track the economy is being supported by vaccinations against the virus massive fiscal stimulus and the federal reserve s ultra easy monetary policy stance april s nonfarm payrolls count which delivered about a quarter of the new jobs economists had forecast caused handwringing among some analysts and investors that growth was stagnating at a time when inflation was rising there are still a lot of people unemployed but there does not seem to be a lot of eagerness to work said chris low chief economist at fhn financial in new york there would have been many more hires if employers could find more people advertisement nonfarm payrolls increased by 559 000 jobs last month after rising 278 000 in april that left employment about 7 6 million jobs below its peak in february 2020 economists polled by reuters had forecast 650 000 jobs created in may about 9 3 million people were classified as unemployed last month there are a record 8 1 million unfilled jobs with at least half of the american population fully vaccinated authorities across the country have lifted virus related restrictions on businesses which nearly paralysed the economy early in the pandemic but the reopening economy is straining the supply chain though women took 56 2 per cent of the jobs created last month they constitute a large share of the millions of workers still at home as most school districts have not moved to full time in person learning nearly 1 8 million women have left the labour force since february 2020 advertisement despite vaccines being widely accessible some segments of the population are reluctant to get inoculated discouraging some people from returning to work government funded benefits including a us 300 rm1 238 40 weekly unemployment subsidy are also constraining hiring republican governors in 25 states accounting for more than 40 per cent of the workforce are terminating this benefit and other unemployment programmes funded by the federal government starting next saturday the expanded benefits end in early september across the country which together with more people vaccinated and schools fully reopening in the fall is expected to ease the worker crunch labour secretary marty walsh said claims that enhanced benefits were discouraging jobseeking were not supported by what workers were telling him working people across america are eager to work said walsh in a statement but workers also told me about the challenges they and their families face finding affordable childcare caring for elderly parents and grandparents stocks on wall street were trading higher the dollar fell against a basket of currencies us treasury prices rose willing workers scarce but labour shortages could remain a fixture a us chamber of commerce survey yesterday showed 61 per cent of unemployed people were in no hurry to return to work three in 10 said they did not expect to resume working this year with nearly half of those indicating they never plan to work again average hourly earnings rose a solid 0 5 per cent after shooting up 0 7 per cent in april that raised the year on year increase in wages to 2 0 per cent from 0 4 per cent in april wages in the leisure and hospitality sector jumped 1 3 per cent the third straight month of gains above 1 per cent postings on poachedjobs com a national job board for the restaurant hospitality industry are showing restaurants offering as much as us 30 us 35 per hour for lead line cooks sustained wage growth could strengthen the argument among some economists that higher inflation could persist rather than being transitory as currently envisioned by fed chair jerome powell a measure of underlying inflation tracked by the fed for its 2 per cent target accelerated 3 1 per cent on a year on year basis in april the largest increase since july 1992 still most economists do not expect the us central bank to start withdrawing its massive economic support anytime soon it is unlikely to convince powell that progress has been substantial enough just yet to start signaling tapering said kevin cummins chief us economist at natwest markets in stamford connecticut the average workweek held steady at 34 9 hours that together with strong wage gains lifted an income proxy 0 9 per cent matching april s gain this bodes well for consumer spending which could also get a powerful tailwind from the more than us 2 3 trillion in excess savings amassed during the pandemic economists are sticking to their forecasts for double digit growth this quarter last month s increase in hiring was led by the leisure and hospitality industry which added 292 000 jobs with restaurants and bars accounting for 186 000 of those positions local government education employment rose by 53 000 jobs as the resumption of in person learning and other school related activities in some parts of the country continued manufacturing payrolls increased by 23 000 jobs but construction employment decreased by 20 000 jobs the unemployment rate fell to 5 8 per cent from 6 1 per cent in april the drop was in part due to 53 000 people leaving the labour force the jobless rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being employed but absent from work without this problem the unemployment rate would have been 6 1 per cent and about 8 5 per cent accounting for those outside the labour force the labour force participation rate or the proportion of working age americans who have a job or are looking for one fell to 61 6 per cent from 61 7 per cent in april men dropped out of the labour force last month while 204 000 women returned reuters

like people every statistic is famous for fifteen minutes for the hughes tool company s rotary rig count the moment in the sun came in early 1982 that s when the company s tabulation of how many oil field rigs were burrowing into the earth s crust plunged it signaled the collapse of the energy industry and placed a set of obscure four digit numbers on front pages across the nation but to those in the oil business and to those with money in it the rig count has always been a subject of great interest it is simply put the preeminent barometer of the health of the drilling business and thus a key indicator for the entire energy industry stocks of giant companies can rise and fall with its release in houston every monday morning the plummeting figures of 1982 foreshadowed a 91 million loss for hughes tool the next fiscal year the company s first red ink in half a century the houston based oil field equipment company began compiling the rig count in the thirties to plan its production as low profile as its reclusive single shareholder howard hughes the company nonetheless began releasing the numbers in january 1940 with hopes of gaining a marketing edge the only weekly indicator of drilling activity it immediately acquired great importance the number of rigs dictated demand for expensive tools and oil field employment and reflected the oil companies outlook regarding future oil and gas prices while most statistics are the product of mysterious calculations compiling the rig count requires the arithmetic skills of an eight year old it is merely a manual count of all land inland and offshore rigs in the united states hughes s field salesmen gather the information in the course of their regular calls on rig operators hughes also compiles a monthly worldwide count but it is based largely on secondhand information in the old days the field counts were sent to houston every friday by mail and the numbers were scheduled to be released as today on monday morning now hughes s 190 salesmen file their data with three regional offices which send the numbers to houston by computer even so the count remains an imperfect calculation rigs in kentucky indiana and tennessee where much truck mounted equipment is used are not all eyeballed and a miscopied number has occasionally inflated drilling activity by five or ten rigs popular videos previous next more today the keeper of the count is ike kerridge a professional man of 61 who serves as hughes s vice president of stockholder relations each monday morning before nine kerridge s secretary records a ninety second summary of the rig count on a telephone answering machine the phone number for the summary used to be restricted to a small circle of industry experts now it has become widely known it is a tribute to the rig count s importance that wall street analysts complain that they can t get through later in the day the full results are released to a mailing list of about three hundred for 44 years the hughes rotary rig count went unchallenged that era ended in 1984 when hughes s chief rival in the drill bit business smith international launched a rig count of its own involved in a bitter patent infringement case with hughes since 1972 smith one upped its rival by stating whether rigs were drilling for oil or gas and by breaking them down into three categories according to well depth at first hughes tried to ignore the upstart but kerridge later sniffed it serves a purpose although the rig count offers insight into the industry s health it presents risks as well since the count has historically dropped at the beginning of a new year because of winter weather and exploration companies budget cycles veteran count watchers initially disregarded the 1982 slide we were not surprised when it started going down says kerridge we were surprised when it kept going down through october the fabled eighties collapse a 60 percent drop over sixteen months from 4 530 rigs to 1 807 was the most dramatic in rig count history but it was not the largest the record set in 1971 is a decline of 74 percent after a fifteen year slide to 814 rigs with today s count at about 1 212 and dropping the sobering lesson offered by rig count history is that when things are bad they can always get worse it may just take a little time
the european central bank will pretend it is not thinking about tapering when it meets next week while the bank of canada will take a step back to assess its recent decision to get the ball rolling on its qe exit process as the two central banks set the stage for the fomc meeting in the following week the may cpi print out of america will catch the attention of the us dollar in an otherwise quietish week sterling will be hoping for a boost from the barrage of april production data that s due in the uk stronger euro brings out the dove in the ecb the ecb had long pencilled in the june meeting as the right time to review the pandemic emergency purchase programme pepp but although investors initially interpreted this as a sign that policymakers will reduce the pace of purchases those expectations have now receded so what will be the purpose of the review if no decision on tapering is on the cards on thursday the bank will probably want to get its message across that it has no plans to end the pepp programme early and that the eurozone economy still needs plenty of accommodative policy even as ecb staff revise up the region s growth forecasts maintaining a dovish tone while sounding optimistic about the bloc s recovery prospects will be difficult for christine lagarde when she briefs reporters the pmis for may were exceptionally strong not just for manufacturing but for services as well as virus curbs are further loosened moreover the quickening vaccine rollout should hopefully ensure that the decisions to lift the lockdowns are not reversed in a few weeks or months time faster growth not to mention higher inflation eurozone cpi hit 2 in may would normally be grounds for a hawkish turn but lagarde can always rely on the one thing that unites the doves and the hawks a strong exchange rate the euro is up around 4 from its end of march lows and eurozone government bond yields have also risen substantially in the last couple of months this has likely put the brakes on any thoughts of prematurely withdrawing some of the pandemic stimulus however the ecb won t be able to avoid the taper topic for long and unless policymakers give any hints as to what will happen after march 2022 when pepp ends any dovish talk on thursday might only be a temporary setback for the euro on the data front revised eurozone gdp estimates are due on wednesday while a batch of stats out of germany will be watched too including industrial orders monday industrial output tuesday and the zew economic sentiment index tuesday bank of canada on hold for now while the ecb meeting has a tinge of unpredictability to it and markets could overreact to the slightest change in language by either lagarde or in the statement the bank of canada s policy decision on wednesday is unlikely to cause much of a stir the boc became the first of the big central banks to get onto the stimulus exit path in april as the canadian economy is recovering faster than expected helped by vaccinations and a booming housing market having reduced its weekly purchases of bonds twice in six months the bank is almost certain to stay on hold in june and although further tapering is not being forecasted before the autumn an upbeat tone in the statement should be enough to sustain the canadian dollar s bullish bias until then us inflation to continue its alarming ascent the consumer price index for may is the sole highlight of the us calendar when the april cpi was published the 10 year treasury yield surged by almost 10 basis points as annual inflation shot up by a much bigger than expected 4 2 treasury yields have since drifted lower so has the dollar but another positive surprise could set off a fresh bond selloff lifting both yields and the dollar as a number of fed policymakers have hinted in recent days that it may be time to think about tapering the 12 month cpi rate is forecast to rise to 4 6 and the core rate to edge up to 3 4 however ahead of thursday s cpi release there could be some unexpected turbulence arising from the jolts job openings number on tuesday the april data might attract a bit more attention than usual because of the unexplainable miss in the nonfarm payrolls estimate of the same month if job openings were strong in april it would confirm suspicions that the generous unemployment benefits were keeping americans at home rather than to seek work that would be good news in the sense that the labour shortages being cited by businesses will be temporary but it would also indicate that the jobs market is far healthier than what the nfp figures imply reviving the case for an early taper finally the university of michigan s preliminary consumer sentiment reading for june will round up the week on friday potentially adding more upside for the dollar reopening boost for uk gdp in april the 1 42 level is proving to be an impenetrable barrier for the pound but will next week s barrage of growth indicators be of much use in aiding it clear this hurdle probably not the monthly prints on gdp industrial output and trade are on the uk agenda on friday given that non essential retailers across england reopened their doors to the public in april economic output is anticipated to have soared during the month the pmis suggest manufacturers also had a strong month hence there could be a bit of a lift from the data for sterling though it s the dollar that will likely be in the driving seat for cable the us currency appears to be resisting further declines and is potentially reversing upwards hence reclaiming the 1 42 handle might have to wait a bit longer elsewhere it s going to be a fairly uneventful week and so many traders might take to the sidelines early ahead of the june 15 16 fomc meeting still there are some notable releases that could affect sentiment trade figures for may are due in china on tuesday and will be followed by consumer and producer inflation numbers on wednesday and in japan revised q1 gdp estimates are out on tuesday with corporate goods prices coming up on thursday

by amara omeokwe u s employers boosted hiring in may but not enough for the labor market to keep pace with an overall economy that is heating up as the pandemic continues to ease payrolls grew by 559 000 last month the labor department reported friday up from a revised 278 000 in april the unemployment rate fell to 5 8 in may from 6 1 the prior month the gains marked an uptick from april but were lower than economists predicted and reflected businesses struggling to fill job openings as potential workers remained on the sidelines the labor recovery has slowed from earlier in the year in march the economy added 785 000 jobs a development economists say could extend a full labor recovery well into next year the jobs market stands in contrast with other areas of the economy that have rebounded more strongly u s consumer spending for example has been near or exceeded pre pandemic levels since the start of 2021 with outlays beginning to shift away from goods and into services as americans resume everyday activities it s a middle of the road report said matthew luzzetti chief u s economist at deutsche bank of the may numbers it is disappointing relative to where we were a few months ago where we were anticipating you could see a million plus type prints over these coming months we have had to ratchet down our expectations about what job gains are likely to be going forward u s stocks rose after the data release while the yield on the u s 10 year treasury fell as markets bet the labor market improvement wasn t strong enough to change the federal reserve s course on its easy money policies fed officials at an upcoming june meeting are on track to begin informal internal discussions about reducing the pace of its large bond buying programs though a concrete plan for winding down the purchases isn t imminent many officials have said they want to see more data on inflation and the labor market before adopting a clear timeline and execution strategy job gains in may were led by leisure and hospitality which added 292 000 jobs those increases came as state and local governments further eased pandemic related restrictions on business activity and covid 19 infections declined as more people received vaccinations payrolls also rose in education and healthcare the labor department said manufacturing employment rose driven mostly by job gains in the autos sector a sign that ongoing supply chain disruptions in the industry somewhat eased last month a record level of job openings in the u s suggests businesses are having difficulty filling positions economists have pointed to a variety of factors that could be contributing to constrained job growth those issues include some workers concerns about contracting the coronavirus child care responsibilities preventing some parents from returning to work and a 300 a week federal supplement for recipients of unemployment benefits meanwhile supply constraints appeared to still be weighing on jobs growth for industries such as construction where employment fell in may for the second straight month amid materials shortages the fed is closely monitoring the pace of hiring as an indicator of strength in the overall economy as it begins to assess when to review policies put in place to support the economy during the pandemic policy makers meanwhile are debating whether existing pandemic related programs are keeping workers on the sidelines and looking at new programs to draw people back to work the overall faster uptick in hiring in may came as several factors are propelling a burst of economic activity more americans have become vaccinated against the coronavirus and state and local governments have eased restrictions on businesses as covid 19 cases have declined and as the federal government has relaxed its pandemic guidance those factors along with federal pandemic aid have prompted a pickup in spending particularly at services businesses which in turn is stoking labor demand still about 9 3 million people were unemployed and potentially available to work in may while employment was still down by about 7 6 million jobs compared with pre pandemic levels at the pace of last month s job gains it would take more than a year for u s employment to return february 2020 levels there is therefore a material disconnect between the pace of improvement in economic activity and the labor market which is on a far more gradual healing path mr luzzetti said the unemployment rate fell because more americans who were searching for work found jobs but the number of people in the labor force held nearly steady suggesting that ample open jobs and some improvement in wages didn t draw more workers off the sidelines in may the labor force participation rate the share of adults working or looking for work edged slightly lower in may to 61 6 down from 63 3 in february 2020 the trend in the labor force participation rate indicates that there is still a lot of slack in the labor market said aneta markowska chief financial economist at jefferies it s just going to take time for supply and demand to meet in the middle but there is demand for labor she said average hourly pay for private sector employees increased by 15 cents to 30 33 in may hourly wages rose 2 from a year earlier though gains in wages for leisure and hospitality workers including those at restaurants were up close to 4 over the year still the average hourly wage for leisure and hospitality jobs last month was 18 09 well below the overall average for private sector workers the unemployment rate for teens fell sharply to 9 6 in may the lowest rate on records extending back to 1953 while the share of teens who work rose to 33 2 the highest rate since 2008 that could signal labor market conditions are benefiting younger workers who may be more willing to accept lower wage jobs nearly half of small business owners reported having unfilled job openings in may according to a survey from the national federation of independent business meanwhile the number of employee shifts worked between mid april and mid may increased by 0 1 according to an analysis from the workplace software firm ultimate kronos group that compares with a 0 3 drop between mid march and mid april carol galle chief executive of special d events in detroit said she recently started efforts to recruit two or three new workers for her events planning business activity dried up at the company last year as conferences trade shows and other events were canceled because of the pandemic ms galle said inquiries for her company s services have picked up again with the economy s reopening ms galle said she has found it challenging to hire currently because many events professionals moved on to other forms of work during last year s economic downturn other potential workers she said are requesting higher pay compared with before the pandemic because the work has become more challenging for instance planners must coordinate virtual events that are technically complex or events that have both virtual and in person components people in my industry understand that the job has changed and they need to have additional skills and they want to be compensated ms galle said they re worth it it s just a matter of being able to still run my business profitably and pay people what they re worth employment in hard hit sectors such as leisure and hospitality stand to gain as more americans are vaccinated and the effects of relaxed federal pandemic guidelines take hold the centers for disease control and prevention in mid may during the same week when the employment report s survey period closed said vaccinated americans no longer need to wear masks or socially distance in most settings sixty three percent of u s adults have received at least one covid 19 vaccination according to the cdc contributing to the resumption of such activities as travel and dining out meanwhile hiring constraints are likely to ease in coming months as additional americans become vaccinated schools more fully open and the federal supplement ends broadly in september says nick bunker economic research director for north america at the jobs site indeed taking those factors together the labor market could reach an inflection point in early fall because more workers will likely be available mr bunker said it s a bit like a rocket where takeoff has been slightly delayed but takeoff will still happen he said a number of u s states all with republican governors have said they would end the federal supplement to unemployment benefits earlier than the scheduled expiration some of those states are also offering incentives for people to return to the workforce preliminary findings from the federal reserve bank of san francisco suggest the extra benefits had a small but noticeable effect on job decisions becky frankiewicz president of the staffing company manpowergroup said employers are using creative strategies to compete for new workers and retain existing ones she said some of manpower s clients are offering 1 000 signing bonuses to workers who agree to start jobs the following day while others are promising raises to employees who maintain perfect attendance for a certain amount of time there are so many options as demand picks up ms frankiewicz said employees are acting like consumers in how they re consuming work despite the overall pickup in the economy there are emerging signs of an uneven recovery for groups including african americans and women said michelle

meme stocks were on the move again today what happened wallstreetbets stocks were on the move again today as volatility continued in the set of popular meme stocks microvision mvis 4 71 was the big winner of the group shares of the autonomous vehicle technology company jumped on news that several big banks would block short selling on the volatile stock shares of other stocks popular among reddit s wallstreetbets crowd were moving in the opposite direction blackberry bb finished down 12 7 koss koss 1 80 lost 12 6 and naked brand group nakd gave up 15 1 so what retail traders have been pumping up shares of meme stocks led by amc entertainment and gamestop over the last two weeks in an attempt to execute short squeezes on some of the same stocks that jumped in january on the first wave of interest in these stocks bloomberg reported this afternoon that banks such as goldman sachs bank of america and jefferies would take steps to block short selling in amc gamestop and microvision that seemed to help lift shares of microvision higher as the lidar stock gained in high volume trading at one point the stock was up 27 6 today twenty two percent of its stock was sold short as of mid may other meme stocks seemed to lose steam after gaining earlier in the week enterprise technology company blackberry pulled back after the stock had briefly doubled this week in the meme stock mania there was no specific news driving those gains and blackberry is not heavily shorted at the moment with just about 10 of the stock sold short however the stock has followed broader trends in meme stocks since the trend began in january even with today s loss the stock still gained 38 this week koss was one of the more surprising meme stocks as the small cap headphone maker was one of the biggest winners of the rally back in january koss stock continued its slide from yesterday giving up some of its gains after the stock jumped 69 on wednesday about 16 of its float is sold short finally naked brand group a maker of swimwear and intimate apparel has moved on a similar track to koss in the last few days the stock jumped 29 on wednesday but gave up most of those gains today like some other meme stocks its short interest has fallen since earlier this year and now just 5 of the stock is sold short now what there s no fundamental explanation for the meme stock rally which shocked investors back in january but has been less of a surprise the second time around many of the businesses have poor prospects are losing money or are growing slowly still that hasn t stopped retail investors from piling into these stocks to drive eye popping gains seemingly out of nowhere for long term investors these stocks are probably best avoided the single day pops can quickly be given back as today s pullback shows and there s little fundamental justification for the gains in the prices still the strategy has been a successful one for some investors which means it s likely to continue the moves by major banks to crack down on short selling in these stocks could soften the volatility

agency mpca certified in 2018 that the project would not affect in state water quality under section 401 of the clean water act polymet now will present the evidence on which the mpca relied to the army corps of engineers which will likely require a hearing to make a final decision on the project s downstream water quality effects article content when in operation polymet s project will collect and treat water including water that holds mercury and other contaminants from historical taconite mining resulting in a net reduction of contaminants to the st louis river system i am hard pressed to understand how our treated water can meet water quality standards at the point of discharge and at other downstream communities closer to the project site and actually reduce overall mercury loading

article content we disagree with the epa s new conclusion since the science is clear that water discharges from the northmet mine will not only meet water quality standards but are proven to have a net benefit to the st louis river s water quality cherry said because epa s downstream water quality determination is a prerequisite for the section 404 wetlands permit issued to polymet by the corps of engineers the corps placed the permit on hold during epa s review that hold is expected to remain in place during any corps hearing polymet will work with the epa and corps to address this issue if

new york reuters investors will watch washington in the coming week for clues on whether an outsized rally in shares of companies that would benefit from president joe biden s proposed 1 7 trillion infrastructure plan has more room to run expectations of spending from washington on bridges roads and tunnels bolstered so called value stocks especially the industrials and materials sectors both up around 20 this year ahead of the 12 5 gain for the s p 500 among the biggest winners have been shares of united states steel corp up nearly 200 since the start of the year while steel producer nucor corp s stock has gained around 104 those large gains may leave many industrials and materials stocks vulnerable to a selloff if a large spending bill in washington fails to materialize said john mowrey chief investment officer of nfj investment group which manages 8 2 billion in assets it s scary how much of the spending bill is already priced into the market he said u s transportation secretary pete buttigieg circled june 7 as the date by which negotiations with senate republicans must have a clear direction if not he suggested senate democrats could propose a more targeted infrastructure bill republican leaders have endorsed roughly 257 billion in new spending while calling major tax hikes to finance the construction of roads bridges water pipes and other projects a non starter progressive democrats meanwhile are warning they would block any bill they view as inadequate talks continued between biden and senator shelley capito the main republican negotiator mowrey is focusing on companies he believes are undervalued that would benefit from an upgrade of technology focused infrastructure like cell phone towers and data centers shares of american tower corp one of mowrey s holdings are up 17 for the year investors have embraced infrastructure stocks at a time when concerns about rising inflation lingering disruptions in global supply chains from the coronavirus pandemic and accommodative central bank policies have helped push prices for raw materials to multi year highs investors trying to gauge the inflation threat will keep a close eye on u s consumer price data to be released on june 10 a much stronger than expected cpi number sparked a selloff in the market last month bringing infrastructure stocks down with it as many worried rising inflation could force the federal reserve to begin unwinding stimulus soon still exchange traded funds that bet on infrastructure stocks were the only type of thematic etfs to attract positive net inflows in may according to data from state street corp infrastructure etfs were up 76 1 for the year through may more than double the return of other thematic bets such as robotics or digital security the utilities sector may have the most to gain over the long term from roughly 384 billion in federal spending from biden s proposed bill wells fargo noted in an analyst report however rising treasury yields will likely leave the sector unattractive over the next six to 18 months the firm said the full ramifications of the american jobs plan will take multiple years to convert to growth for utilities firms the firm said investors who are skeptical that congress will pass an infrastructure bill should focus on areas such as clean energy automotive parts and manufacturing and agricultural machinery which have not had the same run up as commodity tied businesses said brian sponheimer a portfolio manager of the 2 4 billion gabelli dividend income trust fund automotive companies will likely continue benefiting from above trend demand through at least 2023 as the global semiconductor shortage and a lack of inventory keeps supplies low said sponheimer whose position in parts supplier genuine parts co is among his fund s ten largest holdings if lawmakers cannot reach a bipartisan agreement on infrastructure there are reasons to think that there are supply chain challenges that push out growth for pockets of the market through 2022 and 2023 he said reporting by david randall editing by david gregorio by david randall
when you start a new job one of the first decisions you ll likely make is whether to participate in the company s 401 k plan the earlier you start saving in a 401 k the better but no matter how old you are it s never too late to contribute more to your account and bolster your future retirement security here are 10 things you need to know about these retirement plans 1 you get a tax break for contributing to a 401 k with its name derived from the tax code the 401 k is an employer based retirement savings account known as a defined contribution plan you contribute pretax money from your salary which lowers your taxable income and helps you cut your tax bill now for instance if you make 4 000 a month and save 500 a month in your 401 k only 3 500 of your monthly earnings will be subject to tax plus while inside the account the money grows free from taxes which can boost your savings 2 you may be auto enrolled in a 401 k an increasing number of companies are enrolling employees automatically into their 401 k plans allowing workers to opt out if they choose according to research by the plan sponsor council of america 69 of companies used auto enrollment and 69 of defined contribution plans offered an auto escalation feature in 2019 often the initial contribution rate for auto enrollment will start at 3 of the worker s pay auto escalation increases the default contribution rate over time such as by 1 per year until the employee is contributing a certain amount typically 10 of their salary annually workers may opt out or they may choose to set a higher or lower rate of savings but beware employees who rely solely on the default rates may not end up with a sufficient nest egg as most experts recommend saving a minimum of 12 and up to 15 of your pay a year 3 there are contribution limits for 401 k s the irs sets an annual limit on how much money you can set aside in a 401 k that limit can change because it is adjusted for inflation for 2021 you can put away 19 500 those 50 or older by year end can contribute an extra 6 500 check out the financial industry regulatory authority s 401 k save the max calculator which will tell you how much you need to save each pay period to max out your annual contribution to your 401 k if you cannot afford to contribute the maximum try to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of an employer match if your company offers one 4 your company may match your 401 k contribution many employers will help you save in your 401 k by matching an employee s contribution up to a certain percentage perhaps 50 cents for every dollar you contribute up to 6 of your pay be clear on what the company s formula is some companies will provide contributions to employees accounts regardless of whether employees contribute their own money and some employers may provide the match in company stock whichever way the company helps you save ask whether there is a vesting schedule for that employer provided money you may have to work for the company for a certain amount of time before that money becomes 100 yours 5 there are fees you pay for your 401 k unfortunately 401 k plans come with fees but many savers don t realize this according to tdameritrade s january 2018 investor pulse survey 37 of americans don t know that they pay any 401 k fees 22 don t know if their plan has fees and 14 don t know how to determine the fees typically larger plans will have lower fees but the number of enrollees and the plan s provider can also affect the cost typically fees will range from 0 5 to 2 of the plan assets pay attention to each fund s expense ratio which is a measure of a fund s operating expenses expressed as an annual percentage the lower the expense ratio the less you ll pay to invest a total expense ratio of 1 or less is reasonable look at your 401 k plan s website to find a fund s expense ratio the good news is that your plan may give you access to lower cost institutional shares which are cheaper than different share classes of the same investment bought through an ira the average equity mutual fund expense ratio for stock funds in 401 k s was 0 50 in 2020 according to the investment company institute one way to cut costs look to see whether your plan offers index funds which tend to be cheaper than actively managed funds on top of investment fees expect to pay administrative fees ask your benefits manager for details on your plan s costs in 2012 the federal government issued a rule that requires companies to do a better job of disclosing all the fees you pay for your 401 k also check brightscope com which rates 401 k plans the site can show you how your 401 k stacks up against other companies plans and if your plan isn t competitive with other company plans start asking your company s benefits manager about ways to improve the plan 6 you can choose from a selection of funds in your 401 k in a 401 k your employer will select the investment choices available to employees you as the employee can then decide how to allocate your contribution among those available options if you don t make a selection for your contribution your money will go to a default choice likely a money market fund or a target date fund most plans will offer actively managed domestic and international stock funds and domestic bond funds plus a money market fund many plans also offer low cost index funds check to see if your plan offers any of the best funds for your 401 k also common on the 401 k menu target date funds which nearly 70 of plans offer over time this breed of fund typically shifts from a stock heavy portfolio to a more conservative bond heavy portfolio by its target date 7 you may have a roth 401 k option another choice to consider a roth 401 k not all plans offer the roth option but if yours does you are allowed to put in after tax money in exchange for tax free growth and tax free withdrawals in the future you can choose to divide your annual contribution between the traditional 401 k and the roth 401 k any employer match will go into a traditional 401 k according to a survey conducted by global advisory firm willis towers watson seven in 10 employers offered a roth option within their 401 k in 2018 you ll have to pay tax based on the investments value at the time of the in plan conversion but beware unlike ira roth conversions you can t undo a 401 k roth conversion the decision is irrevocable 8 you can withdraw money early from a 401 k money you stash in a 401 k isn t meant to be touched until retirement and any money withdrawn before you turn 59 1 2 could be subject to a 10 early withdrawal penalty but if you leave a job as early as age 55 you can tap the 401 k penalty free company 401 k s also generally allow participants to borrow from their accounts you may have to pay a fee to take a loan plus you ll be charged interest on the amount you take out but you ll basically be paying interest to yourself because the money goes into the account watch out if you have outstanding loans when you leave a company the loans will have to be repaid within 60 to 90 days if not the amount of the loan will be considered a taxable distribution 9 you can roll over a 401 k account workers generally have four options for their 401 k when they leave a company you can take a lump sum distribution you can leave the money in the 401 k you can roll the money into an ira or if you are going to a new employer you may be able to roll the money to the new employer s 401 k note those with balances of less than 5 000 may not get the option to keep their money in their old plan it s usually best to keep the money in a tax shelter so it can continue to grow tax deferred whether you roll the money into an ira or a new 401 k be sure to ask for a direct transfer from one account to the other if the company cuts you a check it will have to withhold 20 for taxes and whatever money isn t back in a retirement account within 60 days will become taxable so if you don t want that 20 to be considered a taxable distribution you ll have to use other assets to make up the difference once you file your tax return for the year you ll get that withholding back 10 eventually you must withdraw money from a 401 k uncle sam won t let you keep money in the 401 k tax shelter forever as with iras 401 k s have required minimum distributions you must take your first rmd by april 1 in the year after you turn 72 you will have to calculate an rmd for each old 401 k you own once you ve determined the rmd the money must then be withdrawn separately from each 401 k note that unlike roth iras roth 401 k s do have mandatory distributions starting at age 72 if you hit that magic age you are still working and you don t own 5 or more of the company you don t have to take an rmd from your current employer s 401 k and if you want to hold off on rmds from old 401 k s and iras you could consider rolling all those assets into your current employer s 401 k plan ___ best small towns for retirees in america best small towns for retirees in america 50 piermont new york 49 carefree arizona 48 great neck gardens new york 47 emerald bay texas

when you start a new job one of the first decisions you ll likely make is whether to participate in the company s 401 k plan the earlier you start saving in a 401 k the better but no matter how old you are it s never too late to contribute more to your account and bolster your future retirement security here are 10 things you need to know about these retirement plans 1 you get a tax break for contributing to a 401 k with its name derived from the tax code the 401 k is an employer based retirement savings account known as a defined contribution plan you contribute pretax money from your

subject to tax plus while inside the account the money grows free from taxes which can boost your savings 2 you may be auto enrolled in a 401 k an increasing number of companies are enrolling employees automatically into their 401 k plans allowing workers to opt out if they choose according to research by the plan sponsor council of america 69 of companies used auto enrollment and 69 of defined contribution plans offered an auto escalation feature in 2019 often the initial contribution rate for auto enrollment will start at 3 of the worker s pay auto escalation increases the default contribution rate over time such as by 1 per year until the employee is contributing a certain amount typically 10 of their salary annually workers may opt out or they may choose to set a higher or lower rate of savings but beware employees who rely solely on the default rates may not end up with a sufficient nest egg as most experts recommend saving a minimum of 12 and up to 15 of your pay a year 3 there are contribution limits for 401 k s the irs sets an annual limit on how much money you can set aside in a 401 k that limit can change because it is adjusted for inflation for 2021 you can

to save each pay period to max out your annual contribution to your 401 k if you cannot afford to contribute the maximum try to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of an employer match if your company offers one 4 your company may match your 401 k contribution many employers will help you save in your 401 k by matching an employee s contribution up to a certain percentage perhaps 50 cents for every dollar you contribute up to 6 of your pay be clear on what the company s formula is some companies will provide contributions to employees accounts regardless of whether employees contribute their own money and some employers may provide the match in company stock whichever way the company helps you save ask whether there is a vesting schedule for that employer provided money you may have to work for the company for a certain amount of time before that money becomes 100 yours 5 there are fees you pay for your 401 k unfortunately 401 k plans come with fees but many savers don t realize this according to tdameritrade s january 2018 investor pulse survey 37 of americans don t know that they pay any 401 k fees 22 don t know if their plan has fees and 14 don t know how to determine the fees typically larger plans will have lower fees but the number of enrollees and the plan s provider can also affect the cost typically fees will range from 0 5 to 2 of the plan assets pay attention to each fund s expense ratio which is a measure of a fund s operating expenses expressed as an annual percentage the lower the expense ratio the less you ll pay to invest a total expense ratio of 1 or less is reasonable look at your 401 k plan s website to find a fund s expense ratio the good news is that your plan may give you access to lower cost institutional shares which are cheaper than different share classes of the same investment bought through an ira the average equity mutual fund expense ratio for stock funds in 401 k s was 0 50 in 2020 according to the investment company institute one way to cut costs look to see whether your plan offers index funds which tend to be cheaper than actively managed funds on top of investment fees expect to pay administrative fees ask your benefits manager for details on your plan s costs in 2012 the federal government issued a rule that requires companies to do a better job of disclosing all the fees you pay for your 401 k also check brightscope com which rates 401 k plans the site can show you how your 401 k stacks up against other companies plans and if your plan isn t competitive with other company plans start asking your company s benefits manager about ways to improve the plan 6 you can choose from a selection of funds in your 401 k in a 401 k your employer will select the investment choices available to employees you as the employee can then decide how to allocate your contribution among those available options if you don t make a selection for your contribution your money will go to a default choice likely a money market fund or a target date fund most plans will offer actively managed domestic and international stock funds and domestic bond funds plus a money market fund many plans also offer low cost index funds check to see if your plan offers any of the best funds for your 401 k also common on the 401 k menu target date funds which nearly 70 of plans offer over time this breed of fund typically shifts from a stock heavy portfolio to a more conservative bond heavy portfolio by its target date 7 you may have a roth 401 k option another choice to consider a roth 401 k not all plans offer the roth option but if yours does you are allowed to put in after tax money in exchange for tax free growth and tax free withdrawals in the future you can choose to divide your annual contribution between the traditional 401 k and the roth 401 k any employer match will go into a traditional 401 k according to a survey conducted by global advisory firm willis towers watson seven in 10 employers offered a roth option within their 401 k in 2018 you ll have to pay tax based on the investments value at the time of the in plan conversion but beware unlike ira roth conversions you can t undo a 401 k roth conversion the decision is irrevocable 8 you can withdraw money early from a 401 k money you stash in a 401 k isn t meant to be touched until retirement and any money withdrawn before you turn 59 1 2 could be subject to a 10 early withdrawal penalty but if you leave a job as early as age 55 you can tap the 401 k penalty free company 401 k s also generally allow participants to borrow from their accounts you may have to pay a fee to take a loan plus you ll be charged interest on the amount you take out but you ll basically be paying interest to yourself because the money goes into the account watch out if you have outstanding loans when you leave a company the loans will have to be repaid within 60 to 90 days if not the amount of the loan will be considered a taxable distribution 9 you can roll over a 401 k account workers generally have four options for their 401 k when they leave a company you can take a lump sum distribution you can leave the money in the 401 k you can roll the money into an ira or if you are going to a new employer you may be able to roll the money to the new employer s 401 k note those with balances of less than 5 000 may not get the option to keep their money in their old plan it s usually best to keep the money in a tax shelter so it can continue to grow tax deferred whether you roll the money into an ira or a new 401 k be sure to ask for a direct transfer from one account to the other if the company cuts you a check it will have to withhold 20 for taxes and whatever money isn t back in a retirement account within 60 days will become taxable so if you don t want that 20 to be considered a taxable distribution you ll have to use other assets to make up the difference once you file your tax return for the year you ll get that withholding back 10 eventually you must withdraw money from a 401 k uncle sam won t let you keep money in the 401 k tax shelter forever as with iras 401 k s have required minimum distributions you must take your first rmd by april 1 in the year after you turn 72 you will have to calculate an rmd for each old 401 k you own once you ve determined the rmd the money must then be withdrawn separately from each 401 k note that unlike roth iras roth 401 k s do have mandatory distributions starting at age 72 if you hit that magic age you are still working and you don t own 5 or more of the company you don t have to take an rmd from your current employer s 401 k and if you want to hold off on rmds from old 401 k s and iras you could consider rolling all those assets into your current employer s 401 k plan ___ best small towns for retirees in america best small towns for retirees in america 50 piermont new york 49 carefree arizona 48 great neck gardens new york 47 emerald bay texas

this article was written by brandon smith and originally published at birch gold group of all the inflationary disasters in modern economic history yugoslavia s is the one most ignored by the mainstream to be sure the collapse of the eastern european nation was a slow burn but with a big explosion at the end most people are familiar with the serbian croatian war and the genocide that followed but few people are familiar with the economic crisis that led to the conflict i am not here to present an in depth analysis of the eventual breakup of yugoslavia only to examine the conditions that triggered it i believe there are some interesting similarities to burgeoning conditions within the u s along with some distinct differences the first stage inflation president josip broz tito led the nation in various capacities from 1953 to 1980 he used two powerful tools to clamp down on unrest in the ethnically diverse nation large scale repression of dissenting voices using both police and military forces and allowing regional foreign borrowing the latter might not sound particularly important according to the cia s 1983 national intelligence document yugoslavia an approaching crisis although self management in theory permits workers to own and manage their enterprises in fact the leaders in the six republics and two provinces became the dominant economic decision makers they grew increasingly protectionist and isolated from each other in pursuing local interests ignoring national economies of scale and ultimate profitability they built redundant enterprises blocked competition on the unified market and granted unrealistic price increases and subsidies to favored industries thus by the early 1980s inflation in the 30 to 40 percent range became chronic yugoslavia s inflation troubles were ever present with up to 76 in price increases annually from the early 1970 s to the early 1990 s in fact the cato institute s steve hanke calls it the world s greatest unreported hyperinflation under communist rule the nation was conditioned to cope with rising costs through the application of government subsidies also known as stimulus under president slobodan milošević parliament secretly ordered the serbian national bank one of the nation s regional centraly banks to issue 1 4 billion in credit to milošević s friends this is reminiscent of recent american stimulus efforts 90 of which went to the top 10 wealthiest overt taxation was used to fill government coffers to pick up any slack that money printing did not solve financing milošević s war machine was expensive more than 80 of yugoslavia s budget was earmarked for the military and police forces and by december 1993 almost 95 of all government expenditures were being financed with freshly printed dinars as we have seen recently in venezuela this is a common response of countries that devolve into socialism and communism the solution is always to increase taxes on the general public directly while also printing more money and letting citizens deal with the indirect tax of inflation government subsidies were notoriously unbalanced as major companies received the bulk of stimulus dollars while households were given scraps from the table which were not enough to offset price inflation as well as extremely low interest rates some economists assert that they were negative interest rates large companies and banks were able to squeeze the dinar for value first while regular citizens had to deal with increased depreciation sound familiar in fact it was communist leader slobodan milosevic s habit of printing billions for his elitist friends that helped to trigger the eventual balkanization of yugoslavia and the public desire to escape communist centralization subsidies were applied to companies and essentials for years and the dinar continued to lose value in domestic and international trade as the citizenry barely scraped by by 1994 only a couple years after the fall of the soviet union the country hit an epic inflation rate of 313 000 000 with prices on goods doubling daily steve hanke puts this into perspective for a sense of the impact on the local population imagine the value of your bank accounts in dollars and then move the decimal point 22 places to the left then try to buy something this peak lasted for two years and utterly destroyed the economic fabric of the nation the supply chain broke down with many producers withholding goods and raw materials because selling them today would mean taking a huge loss as the currency plunged the next day the only place to find the items people needed was on the black market and no one on the black market was willing to accept dinars as payment instead they asked for foreign currencies and hard commodities like gold and silver government rationing was the only other source of necessities and this was highly unreliable another problem that was devastating to the public was the fact that many types of debt were adjusted to match the inflation rate so escaping debts through inflation was not an option the imf offered intervention in the form of loans with numerous strings attached while at the same time the un enforced an embargo see how that works however despite the claims of milosevic yugoslavia was already a collapsed nation well before outside influencers stepped in we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us parallels to today s u s economic situation in the u s today we can see the early and middle stages of the same decline since the debt crisis of 2008 the u s along with numerous other countries has been relying on bailouts and stimulus dollars from central banks to kick the can of deflationary collapse down the road this however has led to fiat addiction of the most grotesque kind in 2018 all it took was the slightest uptick in interest rates by the federal reserve along with moderate cuts to their balance sheet and once again stock markets began their taper tantrum the u s has become a fiat crackhead with the advent of the covid 19 pandemic the danger has increased a hundred fold now trillions more in stimulus have been rationalized in the name of saving the economy from the effects of the very shutdowns the government imposed of course the vast majority of these pandemic relief loans have gone to major corporations not to small businesses and stimulus payments to households are barely enough to offset the subsequent inflation in prices we have seen over the past year it is getting to the point that the average american family will need regular stimulus checks just to survive and maybe that was the plan all along government officials and globalists call this ubi universal basic income but it is really no different from the subsidies used by the communists in yugoslavia to pacify and control the public once the public is dependent on the government for their very survival rebellion becomes unthinkable of course when hyperinflation strikes government subsidies lose their power the question is how much inflation will it take before the u s sees a similar balkanization and breakup my suspicion is that unlike yugoslavia in america the rebellion and breakup will come before hyperinflation fully takes hold the u s isn t yugoslavia yet there are advantages and disadvantages that america has compared to yugoslavia for example the u s dollar is the world reserve currency this means that for now the u s has the ability to borrow money from almost anywhere even as it is devaluing it can also print dollars without affecting domestic inflation quite as much because some of these dollars whether digital or physical are often sent overseas and held in foreign banks as reserves but what happens if the dollar s world reserve status is removed or reduced perhaps by a basket currency system like the imf s sdr basket well all those dollars being held as treasury bonds overseas will come flooding back to the u s and all our checks will get cashed at once hyperinflation or hyperstagflation would ensue all it would take is a portion of the world s major economies to agree to a basket system for the dollar to crash the slow burn of the u s collapse will mirror much of what happened in yugoslavia and the moderate inflation of today will be replaced with an avalanche tomorrow in terms of balkanization this is already happening because of the pandemic there are u s states that are seeking to assert draconian medical mandates on their citizens following the guidelines of the biden administration and there are states that are protecting the rights and freedoms of citizens despite the pandemic the divergence in our society cannot be denied we are separate peoples with separate values one side is communistic and the other side respects liberty economically conservative states are greatly outperforming leftist blue states in terms of recovery exactly because they have removed pandemic restrictions blue states have become stimulus dependent and will likely need even more stimulus dollars as the year progresses with red states in defiance of the global reset and pandemic restrictions it is only a matter of time before biden like milosevic asserts the need for unity and accuses those states that want freedom of seeking to weaken the nation this will probably happen before true hyperinflation bubbles over but in the meantime prices on goods will continue to rise exponentially states that show fealty to the federal government will receive their subsidies their table scraps while defiant conservative states will be cut off completely the fracturing of the u s is inevitable at this point this is not to say that this is a bad thing in the long run it is a necessary outcome for economic and personal freedom to survive but it is important that we learn from examples in history so that we can remain prepared some people will claim that the u s and yugoslavia are nothing alike but we are unfortunately much closer than we should be america is no longer a free market society and we haven t been for decades we are an increasingly socialist nation with all the frailties associated with such cultures one defining difference that could save us is our heritage of independence and the will to return to a self reliant system for yugoslavia communism was all they knew and adapting to an alternative economy was hard to imagine black markets arose out of necessity but these are merely stop gap solutions to structural decay there has to be a revolutionary return to free markets production and sound money for a country to rebuild but i believe this is possible in the u s given at least half of americans want this already they don t need to be convinced and like yugoslavia civil war will eventually follow american balkanization but that is a discussion for another time it is enough for now to understand that to solve the economic decline caused by socialist and communist policies more of the same is not the answer more centralization is not going to fix the disasters caused by previous centralization we need a sea change in how we view our relationship to the economy a return to an older and better way of doing things in the history of our nation and if we have to break up america to achieve this freer system then so be it

by david haggith the s p 500 failed a breakthrough on thursday and tucked its head back below its 4200 ceiling again where it has remained rangebound for weeks job news on the economic front that many analysts toasted as great could not lift sentiment out of the doldrums on thursday nor could it stop netflix from making its first death cross in more than two years falling below its 200 day moving average is generally regarded as a sign that a stock is trending down for the longer term the market s response to thursday s employment news further reveals the degree to which inflation concerns are tugging downward on market sentiment while the good news about jobs gave a jolt of lift to stocks in the opening hours as it was digested investors appeared to be figuring out that good news would be bad news for stock prices because a rebounding job market could add additional inflationary pressures as companies are being pressed to pay higher wages to attract people back to work inflationary pressures in turn will pressure the fed to turn down its massive money pumping engines which have pressured a major flow of new cash into stocks and bonds at a rate of 120 billion a month for a year now the present employment situation is great for labor thanks to the government stimulus checks because the ease with which people can remain out of the workforce empowers them to press corporations to boost pay in order to attract them back in for the past decade labor has lost out to profits being shared solely with shareholders labor has seen little real gain in wages while shareholders have seen massive gains due to the almost direct flow of fed money into stocks and bonds as the cheap debt has financed stock buybacks in record amounts for years finally some of those profits are now being pressured toward labor as many in the labor force hold back until jobs pay more than they are making on unemployment the fed throws a surprise monkey wrench the biggest damper on the thursday stock market was a surprise move by the fed chairman powell of the us people s bank has been saying for months and said again as recently as a week or two ago that the fed is not even beginning to start to think about talking about reducing its stimulus programs however rapidly rising inflation and a reverse repo crisis seem to have forced the fed rather abruptly from not even thinking about starting to talk about tapering qe to having already decided to take a baby step this is the very scenario i laid out for both the reverse repo crisis and inflationary pressures in my last two articles the fed announced it will start selling off some of the corporate bonds it has been buying this sounds like a fairly harmless breath in the direction of financial tightening that avoids touching government bonds as i recently argued the fed cannot stop funding the government directly the fed s absolutely massive reverse repo operations used this month to extract half a trillion dollars in cash money out of the system done at the same time the fed is creating money in the system leave us with no question that the fed is directly financing the government and monetizing its debt at whatever level the government demands with almost no restraint on the government s part for its role since it does reduce the fed s balance sheet it comes close to the fed announcing it will be reversing its qe bond buying in what amounts to a small ongoing amount of qt bond selling but it doesn t quite go there since it leaves the fed government bond buying still fully in play still the fed wispered and the market cringed a little notice how the fed is still not hinting it will stop soaking up government bonds fitting with my earlier argument while all astute and honest people knew the fed was financing the government debt for years the fed used to be able to somewhat reasonably argue it was not buying treasuries illegally to finance the government but that it only bought treasuries as a way of setting monetary policy it clearly does not need them for monetary policy now that it is selling off bonds and certainly not with interest rates plunging to the zero bound and real rates creeping negative that argument vanished completely this month because the fed s purchases of treasures are now actually driving monetary reality totally out of whack from the fed s own stated policy goals as wolf richter wrote it s a crazy situation the fed backed into as tsunami of liquidity goes haywire banking system strains under 4 trillion in reserves with these reverse repos the fed is selling treasury securities to counterparties and is taking their cash thereby massively draining liquidity from the market the opposite effect of qe even as liquidity is going haywire and as the fed trying to deal with it via reverse repos the fed is still buying about 120 billion per month in treasury securities and mortgage backed securities thereby adding liquidity this liquidity haywire situation appears to be an emergency that needs to be addressed now wolf street well maybe this seemingly rushed decision to start selling off its corporate bonds is the fed s is the fed s way of testing the waters for that kind of emergency action without touching what it is doing in government bonds the fed normally begins hinting at changes like this months in advance it doesn t just drop them out of the blue so the announcement does have an urgent look to it the fed claims it has nothing to do with monetary policy and perhaps it doesn t for it certainly would be inadequate to the task yet even the new york times notes it was important for the fed to signal that this was not a monetary policy action the fed s policy setting open market committee is also buying huge amounts of government backed bonds but those purchases are different meant to foster stronger economic conditions by keeping markets chugging and holding down borrowing costs markets are on edge as officials tiptoe toward thinking about when and how to slow that program nyt why was it so important for the fed to make clear this announcement had nothing to do with monetary policy because regardless of how small the amount of money is in the grand scheme of things it unsettled markets on thursday the fed even had to assure investors that the sale will be gradual and orderly the fed s caution is evidence of just how much it realizes the stock market sits on a hair trigger when it comes to even a hint of tightening the central bank will aim to minimize the potential effect on markets by factoring in daily liquidity and trading conditions for exchange traded funds and corporate bonds it said in a statement reuters here is what i think is the takeaway on this patrick leary a senior trader at incapital got it right when he noted that the fed s action minor as it was helped pave the way for the discussion about tapering out of its monetary policy accommodation as they like to call it this is one little step and a good way to test the waters in terms of what the market reaction is going to be said leary financial times the market shuddered enough to show its sensitivity in this area carefully scripted as the message was to assuage all concern elliott waves off inflation risks as fed flinches while the market shudders every time the fed even brings up the fact that it is not yet talking about tightening one particular elliott wave theorist has been criticizing my claim that inflation will have the power this year to kill the bull market while more and more opinion pieces are being presented in the written and television media about how inflation is about to kill our stock market i will tell you that i am quite unconcerned about the common refrains from the peanut gallery in my humble opinion this is a bull market which likely has much further to run in the coming year or two and i base my perspective on my objective mathematically derived elliott wave analysis seeking alpha yet thursday s announcement by the fed and corresponding market response illustrates the first one of two likely pathways by which i said inflation will kill the market 1 it will either force the fed to tighten much earlier than it has said it would or 2 it will tear the value out of the dollar and push up bond yields to compensate for inflation which will change the equity risk premium on stocks the amount by which stocks need to outperform the yields on government bonds in order to compensate for the higher risk of stocks inflation gets built into bond yields by the bond market and stocks become less attractive as yields reprice upward to compensate for soaring inflation it looks like fed flinched and jolted into a touch of qt sending thursday s shiver through the stock market so the inflation story of mine that my self appointed nemesis is criticizing has fledged and is starting to fly this same elliott wave theorist has finally admitted he was dead wrong on the s p 500 represented by the spx bounding off 4200 into a new rally my last public article on my short term expectation in the spx was clearly incorrect and was our first miss in quite some time but as i said it is simply impossible for me to be right 100 of the time in fact the s p held solidly below his prediction that 4200 would be the new floor off which the market would rally instead 4200 became the s p s ceiling for a month and a half that doesn t stop him from claiming his approach provides valuable contrast to all the other articles you likely read which continue to warn you about the common belief that inflation is the boogie man that is about to kill our stock market and then he quotes one of my own comments about how he missed his prediction that claimed the s p would bounce right off of 4200 into a new rally due to inflation concerns we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us keeps pounding its head against that barrier but not really busting through because inflation concerns keep grabbing its butt like a junkyard dog pulling someone down off the fence he s trying to scale though he believes my inflation argument is a boogieman my claim about inflation holding the market down held true against his for a month and half during which the s p got no lift in spite of that fail on his part the author is still striking out against my prediction that inflation will gnaw away at the market until it finally kills it with his new claim for a rally i am still looking for the market to rally up to the 4350 4440spx region and the manner in which we rally over the coming month will tell me where the ideal target resides within that next target region while i wouldn t be too surprised if the market does rally that much it doesn t defeat the inflation argument at all i don t expect the bull won t fight the bear but i do doubt his upper target for this summer i think we will see another pullback which we may want to now consider as a june swoon how long that swoon will last is something of which i am not yet certain but i highly doubt it is going to last until november rather the higher probability suggests that after that bout of weakness from the 4350 region we will likely continue to rally into the fall time frame and attack the 4600spx region i am still expecting to be struck in 2021 that i doubt i ll note his now uncertain sounding june beliefs have revised his view to look a lot more like mine than his original statement of a decisive rally off of 4200 while week s friday close may even make it look like his hope for hitting 4350 in june before the swoon is already proving right i see it much different from a longer term perspective funky friday the market stalled overnight after thursday s flop back below 4200 with futures going down slightly more as investors waited with bated breath for the government s friday jobs report from which they would divine the risks of inflation many were expecting an excelling jobs report and they wrote that such a report would increase pressure on the fed to taper its qe even faster in that case the market was expected to fall further as it did upon thursday s strong employment report by adp i didn t join that bandwagon even though i do believe inflation is the market s linch pin at this point what they got on friday however was the best lackluster jobs report the market could hope for one in that goldilocks zone of contentment that says the economy isn t cratering but that it is also not nearly strong enough to cause the fed to start rolling trimming back on its all out quantitative easing the report hit the market s sweet spot and so the s p climbed back up above 4200 and may climb further until it gets the next big bad inflationary news that is exactly why i think this jobs report will will ultimately prove bad for the fed by keeping inflationary pressures in the fed s blind spot you see the fed and most economists are looking for full employment to be the sign of enduring inflationary pressures but in reality inflation is being driven hot right now as i ve said would be the case for the past year by serious shortages during a time of abundant cash cash the fed is creating and shortages the fed is fostering i say that because low unemployment actually means the us will remain sub par in production for longer that will result in continuing shortages and maybe deeper shortages but the fed only sees stalling employment numbers right now as justification for pouring on the cash fuel for longer that fuel however is exactly the chemistry needed to keep heating the inflationary inferno not just because as many think more money equals more inflation but because more money via government aid enables the labor force to stay unemployed longer which suppresses production and increases wage pressure to entice workers back into the job market it is self defeating the stock market believes along with the fed low employment will keep inflation down by reducing spending power but it won t so long as the fed and feds keep supplying goodly amounts of cash stimulus to the unemployed it actually means inflation will burn hotter as shortages undercut the economy even more what we have is stagflation inflation in the context of a totally stagnant i e unproductive economy here you can see stagflation at work what you see is that even with the fed pouring on new money as fuel at a rate of 120 billion a month which is 50 greater than qe3 business activity is now actually falling hugely diminished returns on that investment the economy as measured in gross domestic product which i pointed out an article or two back is not rising back to the level it would have been at without the covidcrisis yet population keeps growing investors and economists and market analysts are all focusing on how fast gdp has risen upward from the hole it fell into during the covid closures but production the very thing gdp measures still remains well below where it was headed pre crisis it takes a steady gdp rise just to keep up with population growth here s a graph i shared earlier that shows where we are compared to where we had been heading prior to the latest crisis as well as the previous crisis we ve taken two major steps down without recovering to our former trend which means there is less for everyone so prices are rising in this newly developing stagflation environment the fed will keep dumping on fuel even though it has shown signs that it is getting nervous about that in the chatter by fed leaders and in its move this week to start selling off its corporate bonds while it continues to buy up huge amounts of government bonds as bloomberg s chris antsey notes the fed s leadership is likely to see this report as a modest improvement but not near the substantial further progress on employment required to taper its bond buying program while inflation is now topping the central bank s 2 goal jobs remain not really close to the goal zero hedge that jobs obsession is the fed s achilles heal a strong jobs report on friday would have strengthened the hand of those on the fed who are now openly worrying that it may be time to start talking about tapering qe sooner than later but the weak report will lead to overconfidence in their ability to keep pouring on the cash fuel a strong payroll report friday would give more ammunition for folks calling for earlier qe tapering in a sense policy normalization has already started after the fed announced plans to wind down its emergency corporate credit facility from that perspective the peak of liquidity is near zero hedge the longer the fed waits to remove its accommodation to the market the more it will have to pull a hard stop when it becomes clear inflation has the upper hand the fed has faked itself out today s jobs report makes it likely the fed finds all the excuse it needs to stay in the dollar dimishing game longer believing inflation will keep its head down because the lower jobs will keep wages from rising the fed has its eye on the wrong gauges in real fact the smaller than expected increase in payrolls is likely because those who are supported by fed largesse are holding out for higher wages before they make the leap back into the economy companies as a result face more pressure to raise wages this won t be the first time the fed was blind to the trap it has put itself in we all remember the repocalypse where the fed learned the hard way it can never rewind its qe without collapsing the qe dependent recovery it spent years engineering now inflation is pressing in quickly due to too much qe in the face of severe shortages while continuing fed support for the unemployed will only make keep production down with ample incentive not to work as you can see below the labor force participation rate never came close to recovering and with today s numbers it is falling back off again while only half of the pre covid work force that became unemployed has returned to work the number of people looking for work has fallen off these are people who either reported they were not looking for work or were unavailable to take a job if offered perhaps some simply want their old job back but it is gone 7 9 million persons reported that they had been unable to work because their employer closed or lost business due to the pandemic zero hedge so regardless of what happens to the stock market in june inflation will rapidly gain the upper hand with the fed s full support because the fed can t see it coming the fed will keep throwing money to the masses via the federal government until it is too late and that day may come sooner than you think inflation will kill this market either by forcing the fed to tighten sooner than the market has been led to expect or by ravaging everything unless some asteroid of a black swan like covid swoops down and takes it out first more on how inflation has built just since my last article will be out shortly in my next article

the shortage of semiconductor chips for electronics has led to a shortage of cars and trucks on dealer lots ready to sell and the top selling vehicle in the u s the ford f 150 pickup has seen production delayed or halted on an equally large scale we checked out a local high volume ford dealer varsity ford which has only a couple dozen new vehicles on a lot that normally has hundreds in stock we also checked out the lots near ford s rawsonville plant outside detroit where large numbers of f 150s and other vehicles sit parked waiting for chips to come back in if you happen to live in the metropolitan detroit area as we do you may have noticed that ford has recently taken to storing large numbers of apparently completed f 150 trucks in parking lots across the city but visit a ford dealer even a usually high volume one like varsity ford in ann arbor michigan which boasts on its website that only ford motor company has more new fords in stock than they do and the scene looks different we have maybe 25 or 30 vehicles in inventory varsity ford assistant general manager max stanford told us this week and i m probably overestimating car and driver the rows of new trucks taking up space in usually empty lots in detroit can t make it to dealerships because they re missing semiconductors that are essential to their operation the problem has been going on for months and has impacted production plans at virtually every automaker ford decided in march to build f 150s without the ungettable chips then trickle the trucks out to dealers and customers as the crucial parts come in the scores of trucks parked across southeastern michigan are awaiting chip installation and a final round of testing before they can be shipped to their new owners car and driver stanford says his dealership usually keeps 1300 to 1500 vehicles in inventory a storage facility that usually houses around 1100 of those vehicles is now completely empty and the new cars that are coming into the dealership are already spoken for by customers who chose to order a new car to their specification and wait for it to be produced rather than picking from varsity s now extremely limited new car inventory stanford says pre ordered cars are taking priority on ford s manufacturing lines the shortage means varsity ford is now selling more cars than usual at msrp and the incentive programs ford and other automakers have used in the past to clear out one model year s inventory ahead of a fall changeover are nowhere to be found instead ford is offering incentives to lease customers who agree to extend their contract until the new car shortage eases car and driver this is all good news for varsity ford s used car business but it s a tough time to be in new car sales that s the most difficult part of all this says stanford of the strain on his non salaried employees but despite the challenges stanford says salespeople are sticking with varsity ford as a salesperson even if you said forget ford i m going to go sell a chrysler or a chevrolet you re in exactly the same situation there are some signs that the chip shortage will abate by the end of the summer general motors said this week that it expects to be able to increase production numbers by july and stanford has been told to expect new inventory to start dribbling in by august but chipmaker intel says it could be years before the semiconductor shortage is fully resolved car and driver vehicles parked at ford rawsonville plant about 20 miles from varsity ford these extreme shortages could have caused tensions between ford and its dealers or dealers and their customers but stanford says that while he hopes ford might re evaluate some of its just in time manufacturing practices to fend off future crises the company has treated its dealers well and remained communicative throughout the shortage and customers are behaving themselves too the coronavirus pandemic has caused everyone to slow down and be more patient he says people have taken a step back it s not the end of the world if i extend my lease a few months and he has an answer for prospective buyers who inquire about the lots full of apparently road ready f 150s scattered across detroit we could sell you one but you d have to push it around

it was a long time til sunrise when dad called up the stairs time to go i hadn t slept much that night anyway anticipating the next day after a hurried breakfast of cereal i pulled on my boots put on my jacket and hat and waited impatiently for dad to head to the car we were going to pick up my cousin dave along with his saddle and tac and head south to john s ranch he was moving his 1 000 head herd to summer pasture and had asked if we wanted to help dad couldn t go but we teenagers jumped at the chance the drive in the dark to john s was quiet and full of anticipation pulling into the yard we saw a corral full of horses and a tall rawboned man in his 70s pitching hay over the fence john was my hero the prime example of what a real old time cowboy looked like we had gotten to know him when he came to the store for vaccine and vet supplies we spent many sundays visiting riding and talking about horses at his place nestled in the river breaks the first thing john did was invite us into the house for breakfast insisting we needed to fill up for the long day ahead we sat down to a breakfast of eggs bacon pancakes potatoes and big glasses of milk and juice john watched with amusement as we hurriedly ate he knew we were excited about the coming day we walked to the barn where john had horses stalled and he assigned us our horse for the morning mine was a young stud that was as curious about me as i was him i threw my j c penny saddle that i had borrowed from my uncle up on the colt s back cinched it up wondering how he would react he wasn t paying any attention to it so i started to breathe easier as we mounted up john led the way up the hill to the big pasture then sent us in different directions to gather the herd and start pushing them down the road towards summer pasture along the missouri things went well dave and i gathered in the strays and started feeling comfortable in our jobs we came to a bridge and were pushing cattle across when a cow bolted up the bank and scrambled over the top it was a high bank and dave and i looked at each other neither of us wanting to climb that bank about that time cussing and hollering john charged by us whipping his horse up and over the bank a short time later the cow came scrambling down the bank john right behind it still cussing and hollering he gave us a blistering lecture about falling down on the job then resumed pushing cows across the bridge the rest of the morning went smoothly trailing the fresh herd down a county road before turning south across open country towards the river as we got to the highway it took some pushing and hollering to get the herd started across the backtop in the middle of it all a semi came to the herd and started pushing through the stream of cattle john rode up next to the cab of the semi swung out of the saddle and standing on the running board cussed that driver up one side and down the other until the guy stopped moving and sat while we had crossed the highway john could get mad but he usually was having a laugh at somebody s expense at the same time which happened to be the semi driver at that moment we stopped for lunch after crossing the highway eating a big meal off the tailgate of a pickup the cattle were content to graze and rest for a while about that time a stock truck showed up driven by one of john s daughters fresh horses were unloaded and tired horses were loaded back on john took an amused interest in my cheap saddle teasing me about what was going to happen if i had to rope a cow or bull or even a calf off of the canvas covered tree that the saddle was built on i could imagine it coming apart as i was sitting on it the cow running off with a few pieces still attached to the tree john told stories of wrecks he had experienced while tied onto a bull or cow dallying wasn t part of his makeup so tying on hard and fast was the only way i marveled at this 70 year old man who was still more cowboy than anyone i knew we started moving the cattle again having to push them now leaving bulls worn out from the trek to be picked up in a trailer our fresh horses were getting tired already and before long we were so thirsty ourselves we couldn t spit suddenly the cattle started moving not south towards the river but west no amount of riding or pushing could turn them they had smelled water when we realized that we let them go to the stream meandering through the grassland cows and horses drank and we rode back to the truck to get a drink of water it was a long hot afternoon from then on keeping the horses moving became as much of a chore as moving cattle late in the afternoon a fresh load of horses showed up and we switched mounts again the crew ended up being three teenage boys including dave and me twin girls eleven years old john his son and his wife the girls joined us after school was out and were good hands knowing what to do and when to do it they rode identical grey ponies were dressed identical from hat to boots and hardly said a word the whole afternoon we had pushed most of the cattle into the huge pasture along the river before dark slowly unsaddled our horses and climbed into the back of a pickup for the ride in the dark back to john s ranch we instantly fell asleep not noticing the rough roads we were traveling on john s wife woke us up told us to washup and come to supper we struggled to the table which was loaded with steaks and potatoes corn beans homemade bread gravy and on the kitchen counter cherry and apple pies we started in eating famished from the big day we had just had john ate and watched with amusement as we devoured all the food in front of us we fought back sleep as we had second helpings of pie just as dad drove into the yard to pick us up we thanked john for the exciting wonderful day he had given us a taste of what a cattle drive was like and what it meant to do the work of a cowboy we sept all the way home dreamless and tired but so happy at living such a day as john had given us

james lee burke s office in his home outside missoula mont as seen on a zoom call is cluttered with the detritus of a long literary life there are books photographs a clutch of pens and family heirlooms including a confederate sword carried by his great grandfather through the civil war the tenor of burke s voice is a bit like the wheels on a ford f 150 rolling down a highway bass tones highlighted with a higher pitch there s also a slight wobble suggesting those wheels might need rebalancing but that is likely due to age burke is 84 and has had a distinguished career he was named an mwa grand master in 2009 his forthcoming another kind of eden simon schuster aug is his 41st book and he s very much still at it another novel is already finished and he promises more to come somewhere in that office is burke s beloved gibson j 150 guitar which he bought in 1965 in lexington ky music and musical allusions have long been threaded through his books and he s occasionally sung and picked his guitar for audiences at readings over the years for the curious youtube has several videos of him playing hank thompson s song the wild side of life tapping his toe in time it s a tune he says any southern boy must learn born in houston in 1936 burke was raised on the gulf coast as a young man he spent time in louisiana missouri colorado and california working jobs ranging from land surveyor and pipefitter to social worker he published his first novel half of paradise in 1965 in its review the new york times compared it to faulkner and sartre burke produced several more literary works which remain hard to find and command high prices on the antiquarian book market before turning to the hard edged gritty mystery novels for which he is acclaimed he says the first the lost get back boogie was rejected 111 times before being published by louisiana state university press and eventually shortlisted for the pulitzer prize the novels starring his best known protagonist former new orleans cop dave robicheaux came later burke has long drawn from his own experience for the settings of his novels he spent childhood summers in new iberia la where robicheaux lives and robicheaux s adopted daughter is named alafair just like one of burke s grandmothers and his daughter the lawyer and crime novelist alafair burke another kind of eden marks the 11th entry in burke s series starring the holland family set in 1962 in colorado the book is narrated by aaron holland broussard a peripatetic would be novelist who like burke has a journalism degree from the university of missouri broussard finds a job as a laborer working for an abusive boss on a big farm in trinidad colo near the new mexico border he starts a relationship with a local beauty who is wrapped up in the life of a nefarious professor and soon finds himself in a swirl of trouble involving drugs cults and what may or may not be the supernatural broussard was also the protagonist of burke s 2016 novel the jealous kind in it he s a teenager living in houston in the 1950s asked if aaron is an avatar for himself burke balks i won t say i lived that life he explains but i will say i was there at the time for many years burke divided his time between louisiana and montana where he and his wife of 61 years pearl now live year round on a 120 acre ranch it s pretty small by montana standards three stock tanks and three pastures burke notes and it serves as a horse rescue and an animal refuge i find the presence of animals very comforting we owe them a great apology for our treatment of them right now we have wolves elk moose they are all good guys we re even teaching a cougar to be a vegetarian burke says he turned to the animals for solace during the covid 19 pandemic we have had many pandemics over the years he adds the origin is most often with animals because they are dying dying of drought and what we are doing to the planet it s undeniable the old testament again and again admonishes us to care for animals we haven t done that we have done very cruel things to them and i think that might be our undoing the reference to the bible should won t be unfamiliar to readers of burke as the bible and catholic theology are frequent touch points in his novels this is the case also in another kind of eden the book is really a continuation of the rebirth of the western novel he says but the western novel is not really the american western it s really the story of the search for the holy grail that is the origin of all american literature going back to james fenimore cooper he also sees that tradition as going further back to the morality plays of the middle ages the bible and greek and roman myths the events of another kind of eden take place in the shadow of the cuban missile crisis which burke says brought the u s closer to doomsday than ever before john f kennedy said in public statements that we were within perhaps two hours of nuclear war he notes an event in which 180 million americans would have died another historical footnote that becomes important to the story is the founding of the united farm workers broussard has something like an epiphany while attending a church service near at the site of the ludlow massacre where 22 striking coal miners and their families were murdered by the national guard in 1914 now in his eighth decade of life burke has seen a lot of history he has come to believe that all history may well be contemporaneous the past is not even the past he says my father was something of a historian he did not believe that time was sequential he believed that all time occurred simultaneously or as he would have said it as though in a dream inside the mind of god so that is the story i have written here ed nawotka is the bookselling and international editor of publishers weekly
the year of covid 19 has been the year of terrible loss for so many the stories are a heartbreaking series of losses of life of loved ones of work of connection and touch of normalcy the year of the curse but we also know that a curse can in strange and unexpected ways also be a blessing in my case blessing may be too strong a word but the year turned a weakness into a strength no i don t mean that the covid 19 antibodies within me have morphed into an uber antibody that protects me from all viruses for all time or that in contemplating the implications of covid 19 i stumbled on the ultimate meaning of life or that i intuited that people would be watching more movies at or working from home during society s shut down and therefore i threw my life savings into netflix and zoom stocks at just the right time it s nothing that earth shattering i simply learned that it could be a plus to live in a world with masks with a mask on i look 15 years younger in fact everyone who wants to look younger does look younger wrinkles skin splotches and birth marks all disappear my wife tells me that i am losing my hearing with masks on i can tell someone to speak up because their voice is muffled by their mask without ever giving away that i am hard of hearing i have always wanted a more inscrutable face without a mask my thoughts are a dead giveaway which is one reason i have always been a bankable loser at poker now with a mask on no one knows my reaction to what they are doing i now have the ultimate poker face i am told that our facial expressions are controlled by 42 different muscles and they may be capable of more than 10 000 configurations with 3000 relating to emotions alone i have a hard time believing those numbers but that is what the scientists say i have control over only a few facial emotions fear anger surprise delight and confusion by wearing a mask i conceal my inability to communicate all those emotions scientists tell me i am capable of showing i am told that our facial expressions are controlled by 42 different muscles and they may be capable of more than 10 000 configurations with 3000 relating to emotions alone of course there is also the saving grace of eliminating spittle one of the more disgusting by products of face to face communication in a maskless society i am equally spared having to look at some of the worst dentistry imaginable clearly another benefit of a masked culture and finally the one benefit we can all agree upon throw out the mouthwashes nasal rinses anti bacterial toothpastes tongue scrappers dry mouth cocktails and other over the counter remedies halitosis be gone while the virus may still get through a mask bad breath can t escape i can t imagine a better solution but for me it goes even further i labor under an inability to distinguish faces about fifteen years ago as i was in transit from honolulu to maui i read a newspaper article about a man who had difficulty distinguishing faces it was only then i realized that i too suffered from prosopagnosia or as it is commonly known face blindness it afflicts about 2 5 percent of the population i often confuse people even people i know somewhat well when someone approaches me and starts talking as if we know one another instead of the blank stare or the ever awkward do i know you i will try to ask non obvious probing questions to figure out who it might be most embarrassing is when i approach someone i think i know and realize from their startled reaction that it s a case of mistaken identity in other instances i am with a friend when i run into another person who obviously knows me and i squirm with anxiety in my inability to introduce my friend to this person because i haven t the foggiest clue who he is i am also a terrible companion for a movie i often cannot tell the actors apart from one another i try to refrain but seldom succeed from asking my companion a barrage of questions seeking to know which actor is which as each scene melds into the next don t get me wrong this does not mean i lack all ability to tell people apart if i am quite familiar with a person i can usually identify them by their appearance for people who are acquaintances or who i have met a sufficient number of times i rely on crutches i might distinguish them by voice hair color or style shape of nose or ear placement of eyes skin color body shape mannerisms clothing and other clues but when it comes to those i have met only once or twice i am clueless when i happen to meet them again as we have had insufficient contact for me to associate faceless clues with them until i read the article about prosopagnosia i had no idea that i was lacking in the typical ability to distinguish one face from another covid ushered in the era of masks people everywhere put them on covering their nose mouth chin cheeks or more than half their face this great cover up masked not only our appearances but also our emotions you know those 3000 emotional facial expressions that are now invisible to everyone yes our eyes are still visible and one can still have a clue to appearance and emotions by reading them st jerome knew the power of being able to read eyes when he said the face is the mirror of the mind and eyes without speaking confess the secrets of the heart but the eyes are an incomplete decoder and a potentially distracting one at that eyes can be covered up or distorted by glasses dust weak eyelid muscles or makeup let s face it cover the face and most people are adrift in being able to recognize a person or to decode their emotional state or intentions that is where my prosopagnosia has become a strength my impaired face reading skills have been a huge benefit during the covid mask on imperial rule i am able to identify friends and other acquaintances who now move around us looking like masked bandits i can intuit by the shape of the head bodily gestures skin color hair color and style shape of the ears eyes tilt of the head and so on the identity of the person in my field of vision or as we now say in my field of zoom i focus not only on the eyes but changes in skin color on the exposed parts of the cheeks and ears small movements of the head non facial gestures visible veins and other clues to detect emotion i focus not only on the eyes but changes in skin color on the exposed parts of the cheeks and ears small movements of the head non facial gestures visible veins and other clues to detect emotion recently my wife and i were watching religious services online everyone in the audience was wearing a mask she had a hard time identifying the people she knew we watched a man help people to their seats we got into a disagreement over who it was finally i said can t you tell by his pointed ears that it is him she had no idea he had pointed ears similarly when we saw a woman in a white coat my wife thought it was a friend of hers but could not be certain because the mask obscured her face and she had a covering over her head that is not your friend i said with conviction it is michael s wife how do you know my wife asked look at the way her head leans to the left to compensate for her right shoulder that is lifted higher than it should be i responded convincingly i was right then there was the masked guy who had recently dyed his hair the color of black shoe polish and wore sunglasses despite being indoors i had no idea who it was until i saw the elbow patches on his jacket can t fool me various companies sell incredibly accurate facial recognition software i recently attended a zoom presentation by a hedge fund business about an israeli company that markets an ai version that is capable of recognizing faces covered by masks when a demonstration of their software correctly identified people despite their masks the would be investor crowd murmured approvingly i shrugged my shoulders i could do that
an fbi subpoena seeks information on some people who clicked on a story about a child pornography suspect who fatally shot two fbi agents washington the fbi issued a subpoena demanding u s newspaper giant gannett provide agents with information to track down readers of a usa today story about a suspect in a child pornography case who fatally shot two fbi agents in february the subpoena served on the company in april came to light this week after the media company filed documents in federal court asking a judge to quash the subpoena the justice department s actions were immediately condemned by press freedom advocates the news comes as the justice department has disclosed in recent weeks that it seized the email and phone records of reporters in at least three separate instances during the trump administration it raises questions about what liberties federal authorities are taking in using news organizations journalists and their work as investigative tools the subpoena asks for information about anyone who clicked on the article for a period of about 35 minutes on the day after the shooting it seeks the ip addresses which can sometimes be used to identify the location of a computer the company or organization it belongs to and where it was registered along with mobile phone identification information of the readers while the subpoena doesn t ask specifically for the names of those who read the story such identification information could easily lead federal agents to the readers it is unclear why the fbi was seeking information about the usa today story in particular even though numerous others news organizations including the associated press had reported extensively on the florida shooting one of the bloodiest days in the fbi s history the suspect opened fire on the agents when they arrived to serve a federal search warrant in a child exploitation case the two agents daniel alfin and laura schwartzenberger were killed and three others were wounded maribel perez wadsworth the publisher of usa today and president of the usa today network said the government wants the news organization to hand over private information about its readers and said it was fighting the subpoena to protect the relationship between its readers and journalists the company also contacted the fbi before asking a judge to quash the subpoena but did not receive any substantive reply nor any meaningful explanation of the asserted basis for the subpoena she said we intend to fight the subpoena s demand for identifying information about individuals who viewed the usa today news report wadsworth said in a statement being forced to tell the government who reads what on our websites is a clear violation of the first amendment the fbi agent who signed the subpoena to gannett has worked for years on child exploitation cases and has testified in several criminal cases related to child pornography offenses newspaper accounts and other public records show the subpoena first reported by politico says the information is needed as part of an ongoing criminal investigation federal officials would not provide additional details about the investigation this is an extraordinary demand that goes to the very heart of the first amendment for good reason the courts have generally refused to give the government access to this kind of sensitive information except in the most unusual circumstances said jameel jaffer executive director of the knight first amendment institute at columbia university the justice department in recent weeks disclosed that investigators secretly obtained call records of journalists at the washington post the new york times and cnn in an effort to identify sources who provided national security information that was published in the early months of the trump administration president joe biden has said the justice department would not seize reporters phone records though it remains unclear if that promise can be kept this subpoena especially when viewed alongside the subpoenas that the justice department served under the trump administration in an effort to obtain journalists records strongly suggests we need more robust protection for records that implicate the freedoms of speech and the press jaffer said the justice department in both republican and democratic administrations has struggled to balance the media s constitutionally protected rights against the government s interests in safeguarding classified information and collecting information for criminal cases during a 2007 investigation an fbi agent impersonated an associated press journalist while investigating bomb threats at a high school in washington state the agent portrayed himself as an ap journalist when he communicated with the suspect online and then sent a link to a fabricated ap news article that when clicked allowed the fbi to pinpoint the suspect s location the ruse was made public in 2014 and two years later the fbi imposed restrictions on the ability of agents to masquerade as reporters but it stopped short of ruling out the practice in 2013 federal investigators secretly seized two months of phone records for associated press reporters and editors that included 20 telephone lines of both ap offices and the journalists including their home phones and cellphones

an fbi subpoena seeks information on some people who clicked on a story about a child pornography suspect who fatally shot two fbi agents washington the fbi issued a subpoena demanding u s newspaper giant gannett provide agents with information to track down readers of a usa today story about a suspect in a child pornography case who fatally shot two fbi agents in february the subpoena served on the company in april came to light this week after the media company filed documents in federal court asking a judge to quash the subpoena the justice department s actions were immediately condemned by press freedom advocates the news comes as the justice department has disclosed in recent weeks that it seized the email and phone records of reporters in at least three separate instances during the trump administration it raises questions about what liberties federal authorities are taking in using news organizations journalists and their work as investigative tools the subpoena asks for information about anyone who clicked on the article for a period of about 35 minutes on the day after the shooting it seeks the ip addresses which can sometimes be used to identify the location of a computer the company or organization it belongs to and where it was registered along with mobile phone identification information of the readers while the subpoena doesn t ask specifically for the names of those who read the story such identification information could easily lead federal agents to the readers it is unclear why the fbi was seeking information about the usa today story in particular even though numerous others news organizations including the associated press had reported extensively on the florida shooting one of the bloodiest days in the fbi s history the suspect opened fire on the agents when they arrived to serve a federal search warrant in a child exploitation case the two agents daniel alfin and laura schwartzenberger were killed and three others were wounded maribel perez wadsworth the publisher of usa today and president of the usa today network said the government wants the news organization to hand over private information about its readers and said it was fighting the subpoena to protect the relationship between its readers and journalists the company also contacted the fbi before asking a judge to quash the subpoena but did not receive any substantive reply nor any meaningful explanation of the asserted basis for the subpoena she said we intend to fight the subpoena s demand for identifying information about individuals who viewed the usa today news report wadsworth said in a statement being forced to tell the government who reads what on our websites is a clear violation of the first amendment the fbi agent who signed the subpoena to gannett has worked for years on child exploitation cases and has testified in several criminal cases related to child pornography offenses newspaper accounts and other public records show the subpoena first reported by politico says the information is needed as part of an ongoing criminal investigation federal officials would not provide additional details about the investigation this is an extraordinary demand that goes to the very heart of the first amendment for good reason the courts have generally refused to give the government access to this kind of sensitive information except in the most unusual circumstances said jameel jaffer executive director of the knight first amendment institute at columbia university related articles justice department under trump seized phone records of 4 new york times reporters the justice department in recent weeks disclosed that investigators secretly obtained call records of journalists at the washington post the new york times and cnn in an effort to identify sources who provided national security information that was published in the early months of the trump administration president joe biden has said the justice department would not seize reporters phone records though it remains unclear if that promise can be kept this subpoena especially when viewed alongside the subpoenas that the justice department served under the trump administration in an effort to obtain journalists records strongly suggests we need more robust protection for records that implicate the freedoms of speech and the press jaffer said the justice department in both republican and democratic administrations has struggled to balance the media s constitutionally protected rights against the government s interests in safeguarding classified information and collecting information for criminal cases during a 2007 investigation an fbi agent impersonated an associated press journalist while investigating bomb threats at a high school in washington state the agent portrayed himself as an ap journalist when he communicated with the suspect online and then sent a link to a fabricated ap news article that when clicked allowed the fbi to pinpoint the suspect s location the ruse was made public in 2014 and two years later the fbi imposed restrictions on the ability of agents to masquerade as reporters but it stopped short of ruling out the practice in 2013 federal investigators secretly seized two months of phone records for associated press reporters and editors that included 20 telephone lines of both ap offices and the journalists including their home phones and cellphones

resources are constrained and risks are high thus was born transparensee a group of four mph students plus a graduate engineering student who together produced a clear fog resistant face mask to allow for better communication with the deaf and hard of hearing community to date transparensee has overseen the design manufacture and distribution of more than 1 400 masks sent for free to schools and families as far away as wisconsin we even have a couple of businesses who have requested them so they can better communicate with customers said hannah reed of pulaski virginia from the beginning the solution posed by opaque masks seemed obvious to the team of aspiring health professionals which also included jaclyn abramson of west chester pennsylvania and teace markwalter of vienna virginia less obvious were the challenges of designing a transparent mask that fit snugly on the wearer s face to keep potential virus droplets from escaping an opportunity to advance their idea came when laura hungerford professor and head of the virginia tech public health program and ron fricker professor and interim dean of the college of science worked with virginia tech s fralin life sciences institute to launch a campuswide competition called tech together campaign which called upon virginia tech students creativity and innovation in fighting coronavirus launched in july 2020 tech together ultimately received 76 applications from 20 different colleges and departments the mph students with their faculty advisors sophie wenzel assistant professor in population health sciences and alexander leonessa professor in the department of mechanical engineering were joined by one of leonessa s graduate students connor herron of reston virginia who already had some covid fighting cred as a member of leonessa s terrestrial robotics engineering and controls trec lab herron had worked with colleagues zach fuge alex fuge marie camp melanie hook ben beiter and an chi he to design low cost plastic face shields for area hospitals but transparesee s masks with all the folds and curves necessary to provide a tight seal with the wearer s face were another matter the material trec chose was durable light weight relatively scratch free polyester plastic with an anti fog coating both inside and out it was designed to be one single piece to be sure you trap the large molecules herron said but it is also form fitting to allow people to shape it as they like for particular face structures the competition was held in three phases for the first phase applicants sent in a one page proposal and up to 20 teams were awarded 500 to prepare for phase two during phase two 10 teams were awarded another 1 000 to assist with strategy or prototype development to prepare for the final phase at the end of the final phase five winning proposals received a grand prize of 4 000 toward implementation among the winners transparensee which used the prize money throughout fall and winter 2020 to fund experimentation and testing of their mask at nearby nanosafe inc to ensure it provided at least the same protection as its cloth counterpart once the final design was approved prize money went into full scale production as well as marketing and packaging supplies so that they could make the mask available for free to anyone who wanted one we wanted to use this project more as a community service rather than a business model explained reed delivery of the masks started up in march with orders coming in regularly online at bit ly ordertransparensee and social media channels facebook transparenseenrv and instagram transparen_see and when the prize money runs out we hope that through more marketing and promotion the more businesses and people will want to contribute so we can keep providing more masks to the community said abramson because while the money may end transparensee members enthusiasm for public health has not they are really an amazing and dedicated group hungerford said currently balancing a full load of classes serving on the front line of the vaccination and testing efforts and continuing with the mask work reed looks forward to the day when with increased vaccinations easing mask mandates their product won t be as vital but we hope this allows for an opportunity to still effectively communicate with members of the deaf and hard of hearing community she said and bring awareness to the issues that they face by making things more equitable and accessible story by michael hemphill

a former oxford university classics professor arrested for allegedly stealing ancient bible fragments is facing a 5million lawsuit dr dirk obbink 63 was arrested by police in may on suspicion of theft and fraud after 13 priceless biblical papyrus fragments were sold to the museum of the bible in washington dc it was then reported that he was awarded 434 000 by his college a year after concerns were first raised about his integrity the american born professor who denies the allegations was handed a six figure loan 12 months after a uk charity that archives and translates greek manuscripts discovered in egypt expressed concern about his behaviour reported the times the associate professor in papyrology and greek literature has been released while police continue their investigation he left his role at the university of oxford on february 6 this year but now the times reports that obbink is now being sued in the united states by a company behind a planned museum of the bible in washington dr dirk obbink 63 pictured was arrested by police last month on suspicion of theft and fraud after 13 ancient biblical papyrus fragments were sold to the museum of the bible washington dc he denied allegations of wrongdoing the 13 papyrus bible fragments were stolen from oxford university s sackler library where the oxyrhynchus collection was kept stock image the company which is run by an american evangelical christian family called the green family claim papyrus fragments were sold by obbink between 2010 and 2013 their company hobby lobby a chain of arts and crafts stores have filed a claim in new york reports the times they claim in court papers that he made seven private sales netting around 7million in the process according to the papers some of the fragments were stolen by obbink from the egyptian exploration society which looks after the biggest collection of papyrus in the world it comes as financial reports seen by the times and dated between july 2017 and july 2018 show dr obbink entered into the substantial equity share with christ church college in 2018 the loan is usually put towards helping professors buy homes in the city but dr obbink already had rooms in the college s tom quad as well as a house with a pool in the city s suburbs last year dr obbink sold his business group that in 2014 bought a castle in texas on november 12 thames valley police received a report that 13 priceless ancient papyrus biblical fragments had been stolen from from the oxyrhynchus collection at oxford university the egypt exploration society ees who own the papyrus fragments claim they were stolen from the sackler library at oxford university dr obbink has denied any wrongdoing and said the allegations are a malicious attempt to harm his reputation and damage his career the ancient papyrus was originally found during the early 20th century in the egyptian city of oxyrhynchus ees director dr carl graves said these are early fragments of the gospels or biblical fragments the ancient papyrus fragments were sold to the museum of the bible in washington dc pictured they have cooperated and returned all 13 pieces to the egypt exploration society what is papyrus papyrus is a plant rather like a reed which used to grow in egypt in ancient times the egyptians used it to make small light weight boats sandals mats and baskets as well as a paper like material for writing on this writing material is also known as papyrus sheets of papyrus were often stuck together to form long rolls scrolls for lengthy documents like books of the dead documents written on papyrus are known as papyri the oldest example of a roll of papyrus without writing dates to about 2985 bc and the oldest written papyrus document comes from about 2495 bc source the fitzwilliam museum advertisement they are testament to egypt s early christian heritage and are early evidence of biblical scripture we don t value them monetarily but they are priceless and irreplaceable in a statement on its website in 2019 the ees said the motb has informed the ees that 11 of these pieces came into its care after being sold to hobby lobby stores by prof obbink most of them in two batches in 2010 he also said that the museum of the bible had been cooperative and that all 13 biblical fragments had been returned the museum was established by the billionaire green family who own the hobby lobby chain of crafting stores dr obbink was suspended from oxford in october a month before the theft was reported after an investigation was held into the disappearance of the papyrus fragments the fragments which come from genesis exodus and deuteronomy are different sizes contain different numbers of words and took decades to put together dr obbink had previously told the guardian the allegations made against me that i have stolen removed or sold items owned by the egypt exploration society collection at the university of oxford are entirely false i would never betray the trust of my colleagues and the values which i have sought to protect and uphold throughout my academic career in the way that has been alleged i am aware that there are documents being used against me which i believe have been fabricated in a malicious attempt to harm my reputation and career
an fbi subpoena seeks information on some people who clicked on a story about a child pornography suspect who fatally shot two fbi agents washington the fbi issued a subpoena demanding u s newspaper giant gannett provide agents with information to track down readers of a usa today story about a suspect in a child pornography case who fatally shot two fbi agents in february the subpoena served on the company in april came to light this week after the media company filed documents in federal court asking a judge to quash the subpoena the justice department s actions were immediately condemned by press freedom advocates the news comes as the justice department has disclosed in recent weeks that it seized the email and phone records of reporters in at least three separate instances during the trump administration it raises questions about what liberties federal authorities are taking in using news organizations journalists and their work as investigative tools the subpoena asks for information about anyone who clicked on the article for a period of about 35 minutes on the day after the shooting it seeks the ip addresses which can sometimes be used to identify the location of a computer the company or organization it belongs to and where it was registered along with mobile phone identification information of the readers while the subpoena doesn t ask specifically for the names of those who read the story such identification information could easily lead federal agents to the readers it is unclear why the fbi was seeking information about the usa today story in particular even though numerous others news organizations including the associated press had reported extensively on the florida shooting one of the bloodiest days in the fbi s history the suspect opened fire on the agents when they arrived to serve a federal search warrant in a child exploitation case the two agents daniel alfin and laura schwartzenberger were killed and three others were wounded maribel perez wadsworth the publisher of usa today and president of the usa today network said the government wants the news organization to hand over private information about its readers and said it was fighting the subpoena to protect the relationship between its readers and journalists the company also contacted the fbi before asking a judge to quash the subpoena but did not receive any substantive reply nor any meaningful explanation of the asserted basis for the subpoena she said we intend to fight the subpoena s demand for identifying information about individuals who viewed the usa today news report wadsworth said in a statement being forced to tell the government who reads what on our websites is a clear violation of the first amendment the fbi agent who signed the subpoena to gannett has worked for years on child exploitation cases and has testified in several criminal cases related to child pornography offenses newspaper accounts and other public records show the subpoena first reported by politico says the information is needed as part of an ongoing criminal investigation federal officials would not provide additional details about the investigation this is an extraordinary demand that goes to the very heart of the first amendment for good reason the courts have generally refused to give the government access to this kind of sensitive information except in the most unusual circumstances said jameel jaffer executive director of the knight first amendment institute at columbia university the justice department in recent weeks disclosed that investigators secretly obtained call records of journalists at the washington post the new york times and cnn in an effort to identify sources who provided national security information that was published in the early months of the trump administration president joe biden has said the justice department would not seize reporters phone records though it remains unclear if that promise can be kept this subpoena especially when viewed alongside the subpoenas that the justice department served under the trump administration in an effort to obtain journalists records strongly suggests we need more robust protection for records that implicate the freedoms of speech and the press jaffer said the justice department in both republican and democratic administrations has struggled to balance the media s constitutionally protected rights against the government s interests in safeguarding classified information and collecting information for criminal cases during a 2007 investigation an fbi agent impersonated an associated press journalist while investigating bomb threats at a high school in washington state the agent portrayed himself as an ap journalist when he communicated with the suspect online and then sent a link to a fabricated ap news article that when clicked allowed the fbi to pinpoint the suspect s location the ruse was made public in 2014 and two years later the fbi imposed restrictions on the ability of agents to masquerade as reporters but it stopped short of ruling out the practice in 2013 federal investigators secretly seized two months of phone records for associated press reporters and editors that included 20 telephone lines of both ap offices and the journalists including their home phones and cellphones

photo by kurtis watson a story that s a lifetime in the making guitarist vocalist luke gruntz and drummer ian fraser met in nursery school at the age of 4 and have been inseparable ever since growing up in cobourg ontario population 19 000 the duo dedicated themselves to music early on and have created a sound that s as much influenced by modern hard rock as it is heavy hip hop beats champions of the diy aesthetic gruntz and fraser would play any venue that would have them from small local bars to even smaller basements of friends and fans while at the same time writing and recording songs and posting to soundcloud bandcamp and spotify having amassed 77 million streams to date cleopatrick became a force to be reckoned with and has moved from basements which they still love playing to some of the biggest festival stages in the world lollapalooza austin city limits shaky knees festival and sonic temple all before their first full length album was released now that bummer has been unleashed on the world expect cleopatrick s stock to continue to rise and as things starts to slowly open back up the duo has already booked a fall headlining tour in the us as well as dates in uk and canada towards the end of the year before things got too crazy the young but wise gruntz and fraser shared their story you guys met in school when you were 4 were your parents friends before the two of you met or did they become friends because of the two of you ian they actually hate each other laughs no i m kidding they didn t know each other beforehand they just became friends after the fact you know how moms be i read that they conspired to buy you instruments ian that was a little bit after that was when we were 8 years old a few years after we had already been friends we got matching acoustic guitars for christmas when you were 8 that would have been 2006 ish i looked to see what some of the top selling rock albums were that year nickelback the chili peppers panic at the disco tool and hinder were in the top 10 when you were 8 did you have any sort of recognition of what popular music was ian i don t know if i had a grasp of what was going on but i remember songs for sure i remember listening to nickelback s photograph luke singing never made it as a wise man ian oh yeah or like coldplay tracks i have different tracks in my mind that are attached to memories of certain years but i don t know that i was aware that they were the big bands for the longest time i just thought on the radio it was actually the bands performing every single time like they were at the radio station i think most kids are attracted to songs rather than bands do you remember the first band or artist that you felt like you discovered and were interested in more than just the songs you were hearing on the radio luke there was a lot that was handed down to me classic rock like ac dc i got a beatles record one year but that didn t really feel like it was my music i honestly think the first cd that i had that felt like i was in on something was justin timberlake s futuresex lovesounds my family went on a trip to florida and we got that and that felt like my cd and my thing that i knew about i was excited to get back to school from that trip and tell people the good word of futuresex lovesounds and you probably felt like it was your secret luke yeah because i got it in florida so it s probably not in cobourg right ian i loved bon jovi s have a nice day i had that cd and i listened to that fully through which is hilarious but i remember thinking this new band bon jovi is so sick even though this was like around 2006 i just thought they had not been around it s interesting to think that your era considers bands like korn coldplay and metallica to be classic rock as they started putting out music either before or right around the time you were born luke i think i kind of skipped that era we like the old stuff and then there was a period where there was new rock music coming out but i was not privy to it i always think about how ignorant i was that arctic monkeys were dropping some of the dopest rock music ever and i wasn t going to hear it until like 10 years later glancing through the song titles on bummer there are a few geographical references victoria park and great lakes and then some that seem directly related to things from your life up until now like the drake and family van are these songs based on things you know and have lived through luke for sure this first record is like what s come out underneath the layers and layers of the life we ve lived so far i definitely feel a little bit of that fear like i ve had all of these experiences up until this first record and i m going to have to live a lot of life now before i make a second record but that s also exciting there s going to be a challenge or i m going to have to look elsewhere for inspiration this first record we wanted to treat it as if we are never going to get to make another album again there isn t really much we left off the table although since recording it we ve found more inspiration in different ways we are looking towards the next thing already which is exciting you re right a lot of geographical references and a lot of big ideas that i ve been marinating on for my whole life distilled into 10 songs tell me about a song on the album that you haven t had a chance to talk about in interviews a song that nobody has asked about that you re proud of luke what should we pick ian i guess they re all musically dope aren t they laughs let s try victoria park that s a cool one we wrote it and as we were writing it we were like this is going to be the intro track for our album some of our team has wanted us to put it out as a single for a radio campaign but we ve turned that down because we want people to hear it for the first time when they have the record in front of them and can listen to the entire thing it s not a concept record but it s designed to be listened to as an album and we re really proud of that we put a lot of effort into the flow of this whole record and victoria park is kind of the cornerstone of everything it sets the tone it references a park that is in cobourg ontario that is called victoria park that was built back before canada had a capital cobourg was kind of in the running to be the capital of canada but not really and they built this big park for queen victoria when she came over to check out the kingdom they tried to impress royalty with this park but it didn t work out which i think is such a funny little tragic part of the story now it s just this sunny retirement community with a nice beach i thought that starting the album with an offering like that would be a little poetic that song is very much about trying to figure out who you are again treating this album like it s our first and only chance to make an album lyrically it kind of discusses that it says for a moment there i wasn t sure how i planned to completely destroy my reputation but now i think i understand it s kind of a self aware track that song knows that it s opening the record ian a bit of a mission statement almost luke i m really proud of it lyrically ian obviously luke puts so much into lyrics and making sure that there s a purpose behind what he s saying we really like to tap into that musically as well just the fact that the initial idea had come up and it almost immediately felt like an album opener and the fact that we were able to tie that in with that mission statement i m super proud of that and it s also one of the dopest sounding rock songs of all time maybe the best sounding track on the album we re kind of picky when it comes to the sonics and the feeling of the track is just as important as the meaning being able to tie those things together when i hear the song i think the lyrics fit so well over that instrumental and i think it s a really cool thing to have done luke sonically it s like the lens or the aperture that you choose for shooting a movie ian nice yeah it is luke it frames the story and it s really important to be critical in those choices i think sonically it enforces the aesthetic of the theme do you think it will eventually be released as a single luke yeah the day the album comes out we re going to be pushing it ian we are in the music industry and there are choices that have to be made business moves i think we really make an effort to not let that get in the way of artistic choices and i think we both felt really strongly about that one to wait until the full album was out i ve heard you reference the new rock mafia bands that you are peers with that are bringing the rock sound to the masses and it seems like you re targeting younger music fans but i wanted to let you know us old guys are into the music as well ian a big goal of ours is to speak to younger people and kind of showcase guitar music in a way that feels a bit more relatable but the fact that anybody can resonate with our music is always flattering that still means a lot to us what i will say is that when i come see you live i won t be upfront like the people in the drake video that looked to be a pretty intense video shoot ian there s a bunch more footage from that show too that was just a really awesome basement show that we got to play and it just kind of ended up being the lyric video you ve gone from playing basements to playing festival stages all before your first full length was released luke yeah we went from playing a show literally in my living room and then we played lollapalooza that was like the next gig we did for us it s never really about the size it s about the energy wherever we are i feel more uncomfortable not in a nervousness way but in a vibe way playing for a large crowd we really want to make sure things are connecting with people and people feel seen in the audience that it s a communal thing rather than us pretending to be something and have people high five us for it i think this band is more suited for a small club or basement show that s where we thrive and i think our best performances happen we have played some festivals where there are big crowds and that vibe is still there which is really exciting to us we played the shaky knees festival in atlanta in 2019 and that was a crazy set it felt like a basement show except we were in a huge tent with a couple thousand people that gets us really excited for the future we re looking forward to taking our shows to the next level but still be able to hold on to this community feeling luke you used to call bars to see if they d let you play how do you go from calling around trying to book your own shows to playing the shaky knees festival and lollapalooza luke it was a long journey and a short journey all in one when we started out i was calling bars because we had no idea how to play shows we re from a town that has no original music scene there were no role models for how to be a band so we were just kind of making it up that was one of our approaches i think the real catalyst is some spotify support that we got from the single hometown that put us in front of a lot of ears and through that we got an agent and he hooked us up with a more serious look and helped us be taken more seriously the boys by cleopatrick it s so ironic and it s kind of poetic because the same songs that i was calling bars and asking if we could show up to play were the songs that we played lollapalooza with it s the same ep whether it was in front of 10 people or we had an agent and suddenly we were playing in front of a thousand people it just makes me smile we like these songs but we didn t think that anyone else did which we thought was the reason we weren t getting shows and flash forward a little while and we were playing those exact same songs on stage at lollapalooza it s a funny journey what was it like when you did your first tour away from home ian we had a very small taste of that kind of touring life before the ep with just traveling as far as ottawa ontario and maybe toronto that was the first little taste which we really loved i think for us there was kind of a pivotal moment when we did a drive across canada to get to the west coast because we were doing a west coast run we drove there and i don t know if it was until we were about halfway across canada that we were like we re really not close to home in my van that is normally parked in my driveway in cobourg ontario we really both as well as our tour manager and best friend jake discovered this home away from home being on the open road and the wide open destination and journey to get there i think that clicked on that trip specifically where we just realized how alive it made us feel there was that big level of uncertainty mixed with that pure excitement of journeying to places you ve never been before i think that may have been the moment for discovering that ever since that we ve completely fantasized about the next tour and where we get to go next it really became one of the most pure and special part of our lives are you approaching touring the same way as you do releasing an album like this may be the one and only time you get to tour or are you considering the start of your career now that the new album is out luke touring is where we feel we belong it s like our home our record comes out on june 4 and then there s going to be these awkward few months where there s not much happening because things are still loosening up especially in canada come september that s when things are going to start and i think we re ten times more grateful to be a band that has the capability to tour than we were before and we re ten times more excited about it because it got taken away for a little bit i think these are going to be our best shows and this record was written and designed for this i do think of this as a beginning as a new chapter for us i feel the page turning for us

the company in april came to light this week after the media company filed documents in federal court asking a judge to quash the subpoena the justice department s actions were immediately condemned by press freedom advocates the news comes as the justice department has disclosed in recent weeks that it seized the email and phone records of reporters in at least three separate instances during the trump administration it raises questions about what liberties federal authorities are taking in using news organizations journalists and their work as investigative tools the subpoena asks for information about anyone who clicked on the article for a period of about 35 minutes on the day after the shooting it seeks the ip addresses which can sometimes be used to identify the location of a computer the company or organization it belongs to and where it was registered along with mobile phone identification information of the readers while the subpoena doesn t ask specifically for the names of those who read the story such identification information could easily lead federal agents to the readers it is unclear why the fbi was seeking information about the usa today story in

mr money maker value is finally coming back into vogue but beware the pitfalls of buying neglected stock what s happening it is encouraging these days to come across an attractive company whose share price is not at an all time high especially given the strong market recovery from the nadir of 2020 however your first question should be why has this one been left behind data management company restore has an aim listing so although we may be able to buy shares we are also dealing in a generally illiquid market which means that although there will be a share price quoted there may be very few buyers or sellers for investors this is incredibly frustrating as although you may have made a paper profit on your investments you may not be able to crystallise this gain unless you can find a buyer this is a lesson that we should all be aware of illiquid or untradeable shares are potentially very dangerous for portfolios as we discovered courtesy of neil woodford why does it matter restore has been left behind by the great miracle share price recovery this does not mean that it is necessarily a bad share but there is a reason for it markets do not suddenly forget about companies in this case it is because it is classed as a value stock as opposed to the supposedly more dynamic not necessarily or fashionable quite likely growth stock this was illustrated last year as the american tech giants bullied the rest of the market later in the year more focus was put on those areas that were seemingly unloved many are in the ftse 100 displaying more laggardly growth against the flash yanks however this is changing what should i do the neglected areas have been trying to catch up in the uk markets with the mining and oil companies as well as the utilities garnering more interest restore is seen as a rather slow burner some would say dull but i quite like dull if it gives me better value this company gets involved in mass record storage and in secure disposal relocation services for companies hardly gets the heart beating and recycling old it kit seems very worthy but rather dull even so the latest figures say that restore remained in the black last year which in itself is impressive restore stands to benefit from the office shrinkage we are likely to see as more staff continue to work at least partly from home as this will mean increased demand for its data management and relocation services any suggestions the shares hit their record price peak in january 2018 at 597p last year saw them fall to 268p and they are now 399p so for me there is further to go and with cash available the company is well positioned to be buying up financially damaged assets following the slump last year however if you want something less risky but using the same logic that value stocks are coming back then the much derided ftse 100 would be a cheap and easy investment by way of a low cost fund such as the ishares core ftse 100 ucits etf
hugo renaudin is bullish on cryptocurrency and by tapping his knowledge of traditional markets he hopes to do his part to improve the trading environment in this new era mr renaudin is the ceo of lgo markets a digital asset trading platform dedicated to institutional clients currently in soft launch with select clients the platform is scheduled to go fully live early in 2019 lgo markets will bring the professionalism of traditional exchanges which he believes is lacking among early cryptocurrency exchanges and combine it with added services made possible by blockchain technology we serve as bridge between institutional investors and the cryptocurrency markets mr renaudin began we re a cryptocurrency exchange for institutional investors just like nasdaq lgo markets does not hold client funds mr renaudin explained that allows institutions to trade with no counterparty risk it s an important step for entities managing other people s money as it removes non financial risks to the sector that security sits in stark difference to most cryptocurrency exchanges which mr renaudin likened to going to a casino go and play but when it comes time to cash out there s risk to the house and it s worse with exchanges as the transaction clearance process is a black box that s the exact opposite of what institutional investors are looking for mr renaudin said strong infrastructure is what institutional investors require and lgo markets provides it mr renaudin said they have partnered with a regulated and established custodian to store fiat currencies while digital assets are stored on clients own hardware wallets which remain in the client s possession independent of the lgo platform those wallets require two of three keyholders to complete a transaction the client also controls a brokerage account with a fiat custodian lgo markets is applying for broker dealer and alternative trading system licenses in addition to a bitlicense in new york state the market is ready for security tokens mr renaudin said because they essentially serve as a medium for exchange whether it be for corporate debt real estate or shares existing regulations suffice security tokens will serve as a new representation of value in a blockchain based system that allows almost anything of value to be exchanged which is a vast improvement over early icos coins were being created with no utility whatsoever mr renaudin said those kinds of icos are gone icos like the ones we saw in 2017 won t be seen again mr renaudin envisions lgo markets being much more than a cryptocurrency exchange over time he plans on building a tokenized version of a traditional asset exchange but for now the task is to build a better cryptocurrency exchange which is a needed step for a market nowhere near fulfilling its potential the job of an exchange is to bring clients together and to execute transactions in quick fashion mr renaudin said most cryptocurrency exchanges don t do the second half of that

suspect online and then sent a link to a fabricated ap news article that when clicked allowed the fbi to pinpoint the suspect s location the ruse was made public in 2014 and two years later the fbi imposed restrictions on the ability of agents to masquerade as reporters but it stopped short of ruling out the practice in 2013 federal investigators secretly seized two months of phone records for

an fbi subpoena seeks information on some people who clicked on a story about a child pornography suspect who fatally shot two fbi agents washington the fbi issued a subpoena demanding u s newspaper giant gannett provide agents with information to track down readers of a usa today story about a suspect in a child pornography case who fatally shot two fbi agents in february the subpoena served on the company in april came to light this week after the media company filed documents in federal court asking a judge to quash the subpoena the justice department s actions were immediately condemned by press freedom advocates the news comes as the justice department has disclosed in recent weeks that it seized the email and phone records of reporters in at least three separate instances during the trump administration it raises questions about what liberties federal authorities are taking in using news organizations journalists and their work as investigative tools the subpoena asks for information about anyone who clicked on the article for a period of about 35 minutes on the day after the shooting it seeks the ip addresses which can sometimes be used to identify the location of a computer the company or organization it belongs to and where it was registered along with mobile phone identification information of the readers while the subpoena doesn t ask specifically for the names of those who read the story such identification information could easily lead federal agents to the readers it is unclear why the fbi was seeking information about the usa today story in particular even though numerous others news organizations including the associated press had reported extensively on the florida shooting one of the bloodiest days in the fbi s history the suspect opened fire on the agents when they arrived to serve a federal search warrant in a child exploitation case the two agents daniel alfin and laura schwartzenberger were killed and three others were

subpoena first reported by politico says the information is needed as part of an ongoing criminal investigation federal officials would not provide additional details about the investigation this is an extraordinary demand that goes to the very heart of the first amendment for good reason the courts have generally refused to give the government access to this kind of sensitive information except in the most unusual circumstances said jameel jaffer executive director of the knight first amendment institute at columbia university the justice department in recent weeks disclosed that investigators secretly obtained call records of journalists at the washington post the new york times and cnn in an effort to identify sources who provided national security information that was published in the early months of the trump administration president joe biden has said the justice department would not seize reporters phone records though it remains unclear if that promise can be kept this subpoena especially when viewed alongside the subpoenas that the justice department served under the trump administration in an effort to obtain journalists records strongly suggests we need more robust protection for records that implicate the freedoms of speech and the press jaffer said the justice department in both republican and democratic administrations has struggled to balance the
