can this small company hold its own against the biggest tech giants in the world in this motley fool backstage pass video recorded on nov 29 motley fool com contributors jon quast jason hall and matt frankel discuss how roku roku 3 31 stock has dropped significantly from its all time high one of the factors leading to the stock s drop is competition investors fear roku doesn t have a competitive advantage shares of the stock were sold off when one of roku s tv manufacturing partners released hardware that contained software from alphabet s google 10 stocks we like better than roku when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and roku wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of november 10 2021 jon quast roku down about 52 from its all time high earlier this year it started with second quarter earnings results basically user growth and user engagement came in below what analysts had hoped to see that started a downward trend in the stock there s also fears of increasing competition roku provides a streaming tv platform you can get all of your streaming tv channels in one cohesive place on your tv it enables that there s other companies that do that as well including amazon including google and specifically with google one of roku s main partners tcl this is a tv manufacturer the stock was actually up earlier in the year as tcl expanded some of the tvs that they make with the roku operating system built natively in then roku stock dropped because they started offering google tvs as well now google is the built in in some of tcls models here i believe it is here in the united states it might have been europe i m not sure which excuse me for that also there s some fear going on much of roku s revenue is coming from advertising there is fear that with all the shakeup going on in the advertising world that their monetization is not going to be as good going forward as it has been in the past all of these fears are playing in to investors right now when it comes to roku stock i did want to point out though this is roku and paypal it s like they hit their all time high both of them on the same day earlier this year and have fallen precipitously since yes there are some things that roku investors seem to be a little bit concerned about however since they hit their all time high there s a lot of stocks that happened to be down as well and it s not just roku so a lot of things going on here one of the things i did want to point out one of the reasons that i really like roku right now and wanted to go back to july of 2019 just as a way before the pandemic baseline of valuation here i m pulling up three valuation metrics this is your price to sales ratio your price to earnings ratio and your enterprise value to ebitda ratio this company wasn t profitable until recently you can t look at it going back to 2019 on those metrics on a price to sales ratio if you look back to july 2019 it s basically on par with where it was of course the profitability has increased a lot over the past year those valuation metrics it looks a lot cheaper but one of the interesting things about roku to me this price to sales ratio i mean it s in the ballpark of where it was before the pandemic but something has happened with roku over this time this is its gross profit margin over this time it has been increasing steadily as its revenue mix goes away from hardware devices which are low margin and in some cases actually at a loss it s transferring over to software revenue which comes at a very much more favorable gross profit margin this company has on a structural basis is getting more profitable over time the valuation is sitting there the same in a lot of ways these sales in my opinion are more valuable the company i think in a lot of ways is more cheaper than it was before the pandemic if you look at the long term tailwinds here i think that more people will be streaming tv in the future not less if you believe that roku can hold its own against some of its bigger competitors i think this a good opportunity today jason hall i just struggle with the durability of its competitive advantage besides roku you ve got amazon you ve got google you ve got apple they have these platform ecosystems for all of those companies it just like a feature set of a giant very well heeled company besides investors i don t know a single human being that is just a die hard fan of roku the product i don t know them maybe i m missing out but that s the thing i finally realized that i ve struggled with with the company i think it s a great feature and it s an interesting product i just don t see any durable competitive advantage that s what i struggled with matt frankel its fair i m on the same page i use roku i m a customer i have i think three roku tvs in my house but like jason said i don t really know what the secret sauce is that s where i struggle i get that it s a good value and it s one that i really liked early on in its publicly traded life and i totally missed the boat on but its not the only one that i can say that about

have unveiled key developments to provide the global financial markets with high quality disclosures on sustainability issues ifrs the not for profit corporation which helps investors measure financial performance of companies based in different countries has announced a new international sustainability standards board issb to develop a comprehensive global baseline of sustainability disclosure standards a commitment by leading investor focused sustainability disclosure organisations to consolidate into the new board the publication of prototype climate and general disclosure requirements developed by the technical readiness working group trwg a group formed by the ifrs foundation trustees to undertake preparatory work for the issb the prototypes follow six months of joint work by representatives of the climate disclosure standards board cdsb is an initiative of cdp the international accounting standards board iasb the financial stability board s task force on climate related financial disclosures tcfd the value reporting foundation vrf and the world economic forum forum supported by the international organization of securities commissions iosco and its technical expert group of securities regulators both the g20 leaders and the financial stability board have welcomed the ifrs foundation s work programme to develop global baseline standards for sustainability disclosures financial markets need to assess esg related risks and opportunities facing individual companies and investors want global sustainability disclosure standards that meet their requirements the developments will support a global sustainability disclosure standard setter for the financial markets and fulfil the growing demand for formalising corporate sustainability disclosures the issb will have a global and multi location presence and will engage with developing and emerging economies as a key priority it will develop ifrs sustainability disclosure standards including disclosure requirements addressing companies impacts on sustainability matters the ifrs foundation has committed along with the cdsb and the vrf to consolidate technical expertise staff and other resources with the ifrs foundation the issb will sit alongside the iasb and boards will be overseen by the trustees accountable to a monitoring board of capital market authorities the trustees created the trwg to provide recommendations to the issb and has recently concluded work on two prototype documents which focuses on climate related disclosures and general sustainability disclosures technical advice will be provided by a new sustainability committe whose members include the international monetary fund the united nations the world bank and additional expert members the remit and expertise of the ifrs advisory council will provide strategic sustainability related advice and counsel to the issb as well as the trustees and the iasb and the foundation plans to use the international integrated reporting council to provide advice and intends to leverage existing cdsb and vrf advisory groups the issb s work is expected to start once the chair and vice chair s have been appointed and will commence with public consultations on the issb s work plan erkki liikanen chair of the ifrs foundation trustees said sustainability and particularly climate change is the defining issue of our time to properly assess related opportunities and risks investors require high quality transparent and globally comparable sustainability disclosures that are compatible with the financial statements establishing the issb and building on the innovation and expertise of the cdsb the value reporting foundation and others will provide the foundations to achieve this goal richard sexton and robert k steel co chairs of the value reporting foundation board commented this announcement is a reflection of the changed world we live in a world in which sustainability and long term thinking are increasingly at the heart of business and investor decision making the value reporting foundation board believes the consolidation will help deliver effective disclosures to drive global sustainability performance we count on your continued collaboration as we embark on this exciting next step richard samans chairman of cdsb and paul simpson ceo of cdp said we are delighted that the ifrs foundation is forming the issb to drive forward the development of global standards for sustainability related financial disclosures the issb s integration of cdsb will ensure that the new board has a strong foundation and can move rapidly building on existing best practice cdp looks forward to supporting the issb process with its global market led environmental disclosure mechanism and expertise on data klaus schwab founder and executive chairman of the world economic forum said creating long term value requires both a focus on financial and sustainability performance this means we need tools for measuring sustainability performance just as we have for financial performance we look forward to continuing our partnership with the ifrs foundation in support of the issb during its establishment and as it delivers on its historical mandate catherine harris director sustainable business north america at acre attended the post cop26 reuters responsible business usa event last week which was attended by more than 4 000 change making ceos policymakers chief sustainability officers ngos and investors all delegates share the joint goal of sharing strategies on leading a new business future through innovation investment and collaboration and many were discussing the business impact of the ifrs announcement catherine said this announcement means investors will increasingly be asking business for esg data and transition plans and we re now seeing further announcements and moves towards making such reporting mandatory we ll see an explosion of investor leadership in this space more engagement and a demand for better data that ll drive positive action for a long time now we ve needed a consistent standard which clearly defines what good looks like we ve seen more harmonizing of standards in the last month than there s been in last 25 years on the environmental side there s been significantly more convergence in terms of climate disclosure but there s still a lot more work to do in understanding how to define and report effectively on social and human rights issues this will have an enormous impact on business and on the need to hire specialist esg talent from a junior right up to a senior executive and non executive level in time we hope such expertise will become truly embedded in every business function but in the meantime it will require esg leaders to engage across the business for support in collecting reporting and acting on that data catherine has been recruiting senior sustainability executives and non executives for over 9 years prior to acre catherine worked for a boutique search firm with a focus on the charity and public sector catherine also sits on the board of future fit foundation a non profit offering tools to help investors and business tackle key sustainability and climate change issues with a passion for board diversity and appointing exceptional leaders at board level she is also co author of the social board a paper exploring how to engage board members on key esg and sustainability issues catherine completed a master s at kings college london in sustainable tourism development and the environment in 2001 with a focus on standards and benchmarking in the tourism sector
it is commonly believed among certain schools of economics that war is good for the economy and therefore peace is bad this has been proven wrong over and over again but it nevertheless persists because it is the poisoned fruit of a bad economic root the idea that economic growth depends on policies which stimulate spending if one starts with the idea that spending leads to growth it s hard to avoid the myth that war is good for the economy because it s hard to deny that wars are one of the most expensive things which government does this idea got a major test after the end of wwii and the succession of power from fdr to truman while investors industry and businessmen and entrepreneurs all shared a common disdain and fear of roosevelt after wwii he was now gone and so was his

roosevelt began to weaken even some of the radicals of roosevelt s brain trust became disenfranchised about the new deal brain trust member raymond moley who had become estrange from the new deal described in 1940 as a time bomb in fact by november 1941 a fortune magazine poll revealed 92 8 percent of business executives grimly predicted a post war economic structure in the united states would be somewhere between a quasi socialist state and an outright dictatorship by the mid 1940s unemployment was at a paltry 3 9 percent in fact unemployment maintained a very low rate 3 9 percent in 1946 3 6 percent in 1947 and 3 4 in 1948 it wasn t until 1949 that it rose to 5 5 percent which is a healthy and strong figure in fact between 1950 and 1957 unemployment range from a low of 2 5 percent to a high of 5 0 percent stunning figures of economic health by any standard from an employment standpoint the shining city certainly did shine even with the exceedingly low levels of unemployment substantial price controls were in effect in 1944 but were essentially abandoned by 1947 although there were price controls in place during the period between 1941 and 1945 prices rose by 46 percent so much for the government s ability to manage prices although the government did marginally control the pricing on war materials and during the post war period between 1945 and 1948 prices rose about 13 percent economists richard vedder and lowell gallaway s joint review of the economic data suggests that the strong economic increases cited during the war years are seriously overstated therefore concluding that wwii brought america out of the great depression a common misconception is not correct in fact the war prosperity was superficially due to the government s massive demand and consumption on wartime materials not to paint this as unnecessary to shift to such an economy during times of significant wars this change is often crucial to secure a military victory via massive munitions development and production but the falsehood of this substitute prosperity is the very reason so many economists at the end of the war predicted a return to a depression and exacerbated by the return of soldiers needing employment it also drove the greatly inflated and fundamentally flawed economic statistics looking at it from the demand side many consumers of governmental services are forced to purchase those services at a cost above what the consumer would be willing to pay if permitted to buy the services on a non coercive basis from the supply perspective monopolistic governmental bureaucrats lack the incentive to minimize resource use and thus services are provided less efficiently than if sold competitively in the private market economy with the government s exit from industry the gnp in 1946 declined by only 1 1 percent a tiny number in contrast to the dire predictions of economists of the time output in 1947 was less the 2 percent below the output of 1944 and 1948 exceeds the wartime peak by nearly 6 percent the result of the economy at the end of the war and post war is the exact opposite of what the keynesian economists of the time predicted they believed that t reflected a more short term keynesian concern with falling aggregate demand in the face of decreased government expenditures the thought of a rapid reduction in government military spending nightmare but as vedder and gallaway report yet that is precisely what the government did federal spending dropped by more than 50 percent essentially a spending cut of 53 4 percent seemingly unimaginable by today s perception in 1945 government spending was 118 billion and fell to 58 billion by 1947 and to 55 billion in 1948 between congress and president truman little was done with the exception of a few small efforts were to invoke any new public works spending or stimulate aggregate demand through tax relief congress completely rebuked a majority of truman s efforts to push any reinstituted programs from the new deal the citizens of the shining city did as they did during the war they soldiered on with a report from the new york times only three days after v j day stating eports indicate that industry is reconverting its plants from war to peace much more quickly and early and that reconversion unemployment is much smaller than anticipated despite the evaporation of government contracts for the war effort reports burt and anita folsom entrepreneurs who were the success behind the supplying of war materials proved after the war they were not dependent on government war contracts for success as they quickly shifted to peacetime production underpinned a successful economy business also ignored the dire predictions of the economists as stocks rose more than 30 percent between the autumn 1945 and the autumn of 1946 articles from business week revised their originally bleak projections of unemployment by a 30 percent improvement stating that the transition from war to peace production isn t proving too rough however they were still off by 60 percent in 1946 with unemployment even improving further in 1947 and 1948 the doomsayers minimum

this software company has made a name for itself in the restaurant industry toast tost 3 01 is a software as a service saas company its platform helps restauranteurs manage virtually every aspect of their businesses from point of sale to marketing prior to its september initial public offering ipo toast generated quite a bit of buzz among investors but the stock currently sits 35 below its all time high is it time to buy the dip in this backstage pass video recorded on nov 29 motley fool com contributors danny vena and travis hoium who happens to be a toast customer share their thoughts on the company 10 stocks we like better than toast inc when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and toast inc wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of november 10 2021 danny vena one of the things that i noticed when i was looking at it is there were two metrics i guess that stood out to me one was just actually the claim that they are the largest in terms of use by restaurants they are the largest provider of these services to restaurants i thought wow that s pretty good right out of the gate then the number for that is they serve 6 of restaurant locations in the united states that talks to how fragmented the market is do you see that as a much larger opportunity for them to consolidate this fragmented market travis hoium that s the opportunity for them what i m really interested in especially since their third quarter numbers came out you look at their growth rate of over a 100 now there s a couple of things that are happening there they re both adding restaurants and they are expanding the revenue opportunity they have in restaurants you talked about those services that they re adding or modules there s two growth angles there i don t know how consolidated that can be the restaurant industry is so fragmented that i don t think there s any way that any company is going to have over let s say 30 market share but they can still double triple their business and still stay siloed in that restaurant business the other thing to keep in mind too in this segment is it s extremely competitive square has introduced some restaurant features that have really improved their offering in that market just in the last year that s another company to watch there there s always companies popping up in this market and then they re always seem to find some little niche because the services that a coffee shop needs are different than the services that a full service restaurant needs is different than a top golf this is why it s fragmented because there s such specialization that goes into the market that will be the question can they add enough features without diluting the overall value to capture more of the market than i think they can i m taking a guess at that 30 number but it seems like there s always be fragmentation and there s always going to be restaurants too that are just still run on paper danny vena i ve actually been to some of those restaurants and it s pretty interesting with all the technology available see waitstaff running around with the pad and writing the number down travis hoium exactly danny vena it is interesting that sounds like a good spot right here to go ahead and share my screen again and bring up actually i need to get back to the presentation first i think and share my screen here we go this is the most recent information from toast in the third quarter their revenue of 486 million was up 105 year over year now a lot of that probably has to do with the fact that in the third quarter of last year there were a lot of things that were shut down as a result of the pandemic restaurants were probably not considering adopting new operating systems for their back end software annual recurring revenue of 544 million up 77 year over year gross payment volume 16 5 billion up 123 that s some of the triple digit growth that travis was alluding to their gross profit was 83 million up 72 the company is not profitable and actually their losses expanded exponentially in this quarter but the fact that they went public september 15th that means that a lot of their ipo related expenses were dropped into the third quarter i didn t throw the number up there because it s meaningless at this point which is also one of the reasons why you want to watch a company for a few quarters so they can wash those ipo expenses through their financial statements you can get a better look at what s going on as i mentioned earlier 56 of locations used four or more of the modules that s in addition to the payment processing which is the base module that travis was talking about now management says their total addressable market is about 55 billion in the us globally they think that s twice as large they currently have over 48 000 locations using its platform as of the june quarter that was up 45 during the trailing 12 month period it was up 67 in the year before one of the analysts asked management on the call what that number had grown to and they said we re not really going to focus on that on a quarter by quarter basis but we are going to maybe supply that once a year again as i mentioned 6 of restaurant locations in the u s but the largest provider at this point i think that is interesting whenever i see massive adoption like that happening over a short period of time it makes my ears perk up a little bit any other thoughts on toast before we move travis hoium yeah couple of things for perspective that i want to just point out square did 41 7 billion in gross payment volume last quarter toast did 16 5 billion if you re looking at those two companies toast is almost half the gross payment volume of a company like square which is far better known they re really growing quickly in this restaurant space and that comes through a lot of revenue their market cap is only about 20 billion compared to 100 billion for square now they don t have the cash app and bitcoin and all that other stuff going on which is maybe an advantage but bigger company than you might think if you re just hearing about them now danny vena i guess it depends on your focus as an investor but in my experience some of the companies that can remain laser focused on a particular niche they can really carve out a successful business with that focus say netflix they stayed laser focused on that niche and were able to beat out some competitors that had really deep pockets don t get me wrong i m square shareholder but i think that toast is something that i m intrigued about i will probably be following a little more closely and definitely considering maybe in the next quarter or so investing in there
toronto canada s main stock index started the trading week on a continued down note as the energy and industrials sectors fell on renewed worries about the latest covid 19 variant and impending decisions by the u s federal reserve the s p tsx composite index closed down 142 17 points to 20 748 45 for its fourth straight day of losses north american investors woke up to headlines from britain about the first death from the omicron variant and some data in the u k showing that the variant could overtake delta as the dominant strain said mona mahajan senior investment strategist at edward jones i certainly think the covid headlines were once again front and centre monday morning she said in an interview u s stock markets were also lower due to virus concerns after posting its strongest week since february with the s p 500 reaching record highs in new york the dow jones industrial average was down 320 04 points at 35 650 95 the s p 500 index was down 43 05 points at 4 668 97 while the nasdaq composite was down 217 32 points at 15 413 28 as we re heading towards a week of fed and central bank meetings investors may just be taking a bit of a pause here before deciding which way to move towards year end mahajan said the fed is expected on wednesday to speed up its tapering of quantitative easing stimulus measures and potentially indicate the number of interest rate hikes it expects to make next year there are also meetings by the bank of england bank of japan and european central bank in canada a new framework agreement between the federal government and the bank of canada announced monday said the central bank will aim to keep inflation at its historic target rate but will now more formally take into account the health of the job market that essentially puts it more in line with the fed s dual mandate on inflation and jobs said mahajan she said it was interesting because both central banks have exceeded their inflation targets in 2021 but canada is a bit ahead of the u s from a labour perspective with employment rising above pre pandemic levels in recent months perhaps there s a little bit of concern that on both of those metrics the bank of canada has has met their targets and could be in a position to raise interest rates mahajan said the canadian dollar traded for 78 18 cents us compared with 78 65 cents us on friday the loonie has benefited from the bank of canada s tightening policy moving ahead of the u s but the fed s expected moves to catch up with canada and the rest of the world may put downward pressure on the canadian dollar she said energy and industrials were the biggest laggards among the seven sectors that lost ground on the day a drop in crude oil prices pushed energy down 2 9 per cent with enerplus corp and crescent point energy corp falling by 5 4 and 4 3 per cent respectively the january crude oil contract was down 38 cents at us 71 29 per barrel and the january natural gas contract was down 13 1 cents at us 3 79 per mmbtu mahajan said omicron was putting a little downward pressure on oil demand a decision by opec and its allies not to substantially boost output means wti prices will likely continue to fall hitting the mid 60 level next year she said industrials lost 1 4 per cent as shares of air canada lost 3 2 per cent and canada s two largest railways declined about 2 2 per cent it followed a pattern in the u s where travel and leisure names were hit hard ahead of the key holiday season mahajan said some people have changed their travel plans based on stricter regulations in the u s and canada technology decreased 1 3 per cent with hut 8 mining corp down 6 4 per cent and shopify inc off 3 5 per cent materials joined consumer staples real estate and utilities in being up on the day with shares of turquoise hill resources ltd surging 13 7 per cent it rose as the february gold contract was up us 3 50 at us 1 788 30 an ounce and the march copper contract was down less than a penny at us 4 28 a pound this report by the canadian press was first published dec 13 2021 companies in this story tsx erf tsx vet tsx cp tsx cnr tsx hut tsx shop tsx trq tsx gsptse tsx cadusd x ross marowits the canadian press
on november 16 2021 the first circuit court of appeals issued an opinion reversing a district court s order enjoining the national marine fisheries service nmfs rule that barred the use of lobster traps with traditional buoy lines between october 1 and january 31 each year in a 967 square mile area located thirty nautical miles off the maine coast although acknowledging this rule would impose major financial hardship on some lobster fishers the first circuit held they were unlikely to prevail in challenging what amounted to a seasonal closure in that area because it clearly effectuated two statutory mandates the marine mammal protection act requires nmfs to prevent the depletion of endangered marine mammals that interact with commercial fisheries the court stated and the endangered species act embodies congress s plain intent to halt and reverse the trend toward species extinction whatever the cost the endangered species that nmfs sought to protect was the right whale nmfs has implemented regulations to reduce right whale entanglements since the late 1990s despite these efforts nmfs estimated in 2019 that there were no more than 368 right whales left in the ocean with five of those suffering serious injury or death each year because of entanglement in commercial fishing gear entanglement at that rate the first circuit stated will lead to extinction although the estimated reduction in risk of right whale mortalities attributable to the seasonal closure would be small only 6 6 the court concluded the closure was defensible as a major but not yet sufficient step in reducing those deaths the hastened demise of the right whale fits a disturbingly familiar pattern in the unnatural history of the sea callum roberts has documented the serial depletion of the world s marine stocks place by place and species by species from medieval times to the present day technological advances proceeding hand in hand with the spread and vertical expansion of fishing grounds have caused steady decline in species and populations and widespread damage to marine ecosystems new englanders together with a growing international fleet chased right whales to commercial extinction from the grand banks to greenland and then turned with faster boats and new technology to other species farther afield from the arctic to the southern ocean as a result of the international commercial whaling moratorium the endangered species act and the marine mammal protection act right whales have not been directly targeted since the 1980s right whales continue to die however as by kill from lobstering and other commercial fishing activities ship strikes and other human interactions also continue to take a toll the minimal measures being implemented now likely will be too late and too few to save the right whale nevertheless president biden s recently issued proclamation restoring protections for the northeast canyons and seamounts marine national monument does provide some hope if not for right whales then for other species including sperm fin and sei whales implementing a strategy successfully employed at the papahānaumokuākea marine national monument since 2006 the proclamation not only will protect endangered species against incidental taking as by kill ultimately it will help to preserve and enhance an entire marine ecosystem populated by a diversity of species as small as corals and large as whales

this software company has made a name for itself in the restaurant industry toast tost 3 01 is a software as a service saas company its platform helps restauranteurs manage virtually every aspect of their businesses from point of sale to marketing prior to its september initial public offering ipo toast generated quite a bit of buzz among investors but the stock currently sits 35 below its all time high is it time to buy the dip in this backstage pass video recorded on nov 29 motley fool com contributors danny vena and travis hoium who happens to be a toast customer share their thoughts on the company 10 stocks we like better than toast inc when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and toast inc wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of november 10 2021 danny vena one of the things that i noticed when i was looking at it is there were two metrics i guess that stood out to me one was just actually the claim that they are the largest in terms of use by restaurants they are the largest provider of these services to restaurants i thought wow that s pretty good right out of the gate then the number for that is they serve 6 of restaurant locations in the united states that talks to how fragmented the market is do you see that as a much larger opportunity for them to consolidate this fragmented market travis hoium that s the opportunity for them what i m really interested in especially since their third quarter numbers came out you look at their growth rate of over a 100 now there s a couple of things that are happening there they re both adding restaurants and they are expanding the revenue opportunity they have in restaurants you talked about those services that they re adding or modules there s two growth angles there i don t know how consolidated that can be the restaurant industry is so fragmented that i don t think there s any way that any company is going to have over let s say 30 market share but they can still double triple their business and still stay siloed in that restaurant business the other thing to keep in mind too in this segment is it s extremely competitive square has introduced some restaurant features that have really improved their offering in that market just in the last year that s another company to watch there there s always companies popping up in this market and then they re always seem to find some little niche because the services that a coffee shop needs are different than the services that a full service restaurant needs is different than a top golf this is why it s fragmented because there s such specialization that goes into the market that will be the question can they add enough features without diluting the overall value to capture more of the market than i think they can i m taking a guess at that 30 number but it seems like there s always be fragmentation and there s always going to be restaurants too that are just still run on paper danny vena i ve actually been to some of those restaurants and it s pretty interesting with all the technology available see waitstaff running around with the pad and writing the number down travis hoium exactly danny vena it is interesting that sounds like a good spot right here to go ahead and share my screen again and bring up actually i need to get back to the presentation first i think and share my screen here we go this is the most recent information from toast in the third quarter their revenue of 486 million was up 105 year over

considering adopting new operating systems for their back end software annual recurring revenue of 544 million up 77 year over year gross payment volume 16 5 billion up 123 that s some of the triple

went public september 15th that means that a lot of their ipo related expenses were dropped into the third quarter i didn t throw the number up there because it s meaningless at this point which is

the company is having a little fun with some unwanted negative press what happened shares of peloton interactive pton 4 57 were surprisingly up 7 today even though the market was down investors seemed to be cheering a new ad that went viral the ad was a playful response to some negative publicity the company received last week so what peloton knew one of its exercise bikes would be featured in an episode of a new show called and just like that a sequel to the popular series sex and the city it didn t know that the script called for a character named mr big to die of a heart attack after using it needless to say it s the kind of negative publicity peloton doesn t want especially this close to the holiday shopping season peloton management was quick to respond to mr big s scripted death by pointing out the heart attack was caused by an unhealthy lifestyle not the healthy choice of cardiovascular exercise but over the weekend peloton had a more playful response its own ad featuring a very much alive mr big and a voice over from hollywood star ryan reynolds now what this isn t peloton s first rodeo with unwanted press shortly after the company went public people criticized its holiday ad but in the end it resulted in free publicity that kick started its sales right before the start of the pandemic perhaps the headlines from and just like that and its viral ad response can do the same thing this time but a single viral ad isn t all that peloton needs the stock has plummeted 75 from its all time high earlier this year to retake previous highs it will need to create lasting shareholder value by selling more of its exercise devises expanding its subscription membership base and reining in spending so that it can generate positive cash flow this weekend s ad won t be able to do all of this heavy lifting but the company is certainly enjoying its moment back in the spotlight

the company is only on its third day of trading on the public markets and is experiencing volatility what happened shares of the brazilian banking fintech nu holdings nu 2 25 had fallen nearly 9 as of 2 10 p m for no obvious reason although the stock has had some volatility since going public last week so what nu holdings the parent company of nubank is a digital platform that has disrupted the brazilian banking market and is picking up steam in other parts of latin america it offers a credit card with no annual fee as well as other consumer banking services such as cash management accounts personal loans online investing payments capabilities and more nubank also serves business customers the company has garnered an impressive 48 million customers with low customer acquisition costs since it offers cheaper banking services that are easier to access than those of other traditional banks in brazil earlier this year warren buffett and berkshire hathaway brk a 1 39 brk b 1 07 joined an impressive list of investors and venture capitalists and invested 500 million at a 30 billion valuation berkshire also purchased another 250 million worth of shares during the initial public offering ipo now what i ve been incredibly impressed with the strength in nubank through the first three days of trading the company cut its ipo valuation just days before trading to 41 5 billion suggesting that its desired 50 billion valuation might be too high but even after the decline today nubank has a nearly 49 billion market cap and other fintech stocks have been really struggling in the past few weeks as i ve mentioned previously i think nubank is going to be successful but it seems like the valuation has simply run up too quickly there could be opportunities to enter nubank at a lower valuation but on a much more long term horizon i m bullish on the company

contents a flurry of diplomatic exchanges on the eve of the gcc summit gerald m feierstein senior vice president a series of diplomatic visits in recent weeks including the first ever state visit by an israeli prime minister to the uae and crown prince mohammed bin salman s mbs stop in doha presaged the likelihood of a gulf cooperation council gcc summit this week far less fraught and controversial than its recent predecessors after years of trump era friction prospects are good for a calmer and more productive consideration of key political economic and security challenges to the region by the gulf leaders joined by egyptian foreign minister sameh shoukry the dec 12 visit to abu dhabi by israeli prime minister naftali bennett is only one indicator of the degree to which diplomatic engagement has moved to the forefront of gulf regional policies recent uae outreach to qatar iran and turkey as well are indicative of the new emphasis that emirati leaders are placing on reducing if not resolving regional tensions and promoting dialogue saudi arabia too has turned to diplomacy aimed at quieting regional tensions in recent months the mbs stop in doha as part of his pre summit swing through the gcc member states was his first visit to the qatari capital since he forged the al ula agreement ending the intra gcc with egypt feud with qatar a year earlier with the hard line faction of saudi arabia the uae and bahrain taking steps to engage rather than confront regional competitors in tehran and ankara the six gcc states regional policies fall into far greater alignment than has been the case for some years despite these recent diplomatic overtures security challenges are likely to again take the prime spot on the agenda when the six leaders meet on dec 14 both iran s nuclear program and its regional policies will once again feature in the discussions particularly as they affect developments in yemen lebanon and syria palestine and libya too are likely to be on the agenda beyond that the leaders are likely to again consider key economic issues including reviving discussions about a regional rail network and overcoming obstacles in establishing a gcc wide customs union and common market even through the years of anti qatar boycott efforts to strengthen gulf economic cooperation had continued us israel contacts on iran talks about talks mark a heller non resident scholar the current visits to washington by israeli defense minister benny gantz and mossad director david barnea are but the latest links in the chain of israeli american consultations about appropriate responses to the iranian nuclear program it is not altogether clear what the israelis are saying to their opposite numbers apart from what the americans already know that iranian behavior in general and nuclear activity in particular constitute a threat to regional peace and security there is a widespread assumption that israel even more than the united states has already despaired of a diplomatic agreement that will roll back iranian advances since the u s withdrawal from the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa and repair the defects in the original agreement according to this view israel believes that only military action or at least a credible imminent military threat can pull iran back or persuade it to pull itself back from the threshold of nuclear capability consistent with this approach gantz has elicited yet another american commitment to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear weapons by other means if diplomacy fails and he has declared that he has instructed the israel defense forces idf to prepare for a military strike the idf has also announced plans for a large scale long range exercise in the spring the iranians however are apparently unimpressed by all this noise israel has been preparing for an attack for years but the time when israel might have had the capacity on its own to cripple iran s nuclear infrastructure if that ever existed passed years ago and the willingness of the united states to participate in such a campaign in order to make it truly decisive if that ever existed also seems to have passed so despite all the posturing the ability to neutralize the iranian nuclear program by military means seems lacking there are other levers of influence though more severe economic sanctions could potentially threaten the regime s survival but such sanctions to be effective would depend on the whole hearted cooperation not only of the european powers but also of russia and china that does not appear to be forthcoming it might also be possible to delay and degrade the program by means of cyberattacks but they are unlikely to be conclusive and moreover invite significant retaliation does this mean that the israeli american consultations are just political theater not necessarily iran has been able to influence the course of several countries in the middle east by manipulating and exploiting domestic differences especially along confessional i e sunni shi ite fault lines but iran is itself also vulnerable to the same kind of subversion albeit on ethnic lines only a little more than half the population is persian the rest include large azeri and other turkic speaking minorities as well as kurds in the north west baluch in the south east and arabs in the south west which was recently rocked by huge protests against water shortages all these groups have demonstrated various degrees of alienation over the years there is no indication that the u s and israel have discussed the possibility of taking a leaf from iran s playbook and turning the role of outside agitator against it but barnea s arrival in washington follows at least two visits to israel by cia director bill burns these gentlemen do not command military forces but they do preside over clandestine operations it wouldn t be beyond belief if political warfare were under consideration as an additional method to promote the policy changes in iran that military economic and cyber means seem unable to secure partial municipal elections all that remain of palestinian democracy nathan stock non resident scholar on dec 11 palestinians in the israeli occupied west bank elected local leaders in 154 village councils in over 200 additional councils no elections were held in most cases because only one electoral list was submitted where elections took place independent lists won 70 86 of eligible seats palestinian president mahmoud abbas ruling fatah party claimed victory arguing that many of their supporters ran under independent tickets fatah s main political rival hamas boycotted the election insisting on holding a national election instead the elections are indicative of the damaged state of palestinian democracy some 70 of eligible voters in the west bank live in large cities whose municipal elections have been delayed by president abbas to a second phase scheduled for march 2022 the president allowed elections to proceed in small rural communities where fatah retains grassroots support while avoiding them in the major cities where polling data suggests his party could lose it is unclear whether the march elections will take place back in april abbas summarily postponed long overdue national elections for the palestinian authority pa in the west bank and gaza strip again fearing a defeat for his fatah faction hamas also deserves blame for its part the islamist movement has long prevented any municipal elections in the gaza strip in the best case scenario elections will not end the israeli occupation or otherwise grant the palestinians civil and political rights however they could help inject new leadership into the ossified palestinian political system and elections would afford the palestinian public some modicum of participation however limited in the context of israeli military rule in pa governance egypt s growing regional energy role mirette f mabrouk senior fellow and founding director of the egypt program egypt has long stated its goal of becoming a regional energy hub and it is ramping up its efforts to achieve that aim the largest non opec oil producer in africa and the third largest dry natural gas producer egypt also serves as a major supply route from the arabian gulf to europe and the u s via the suez canal and the suez mediterranean pipeline sumed the gas has tossed a new economic lifeline to the country and it has been swift to capitalize on the energy both economically and politically through the eastern mediterranean gas forum emgf the organization headquartered in cairo is now composed of cyprus egypt france greece israel italy jordan and palestine with the european union the u s and the world bank as observers france is the newest member having used corsica as a back door to gain entry for egypt the idea is to expand services it is already a regional provider with deals with greece and israel the latest memorandum of understanding with greece was signed less than month ago it includes three major areas of cooperation among them research and exploration liquefied natural gas trading and especially relevant the linking of the two countries natural gas pipeline networks the deals have helped consolidate economic and military ties between the two countries which also share interests and priorities in the eastern mediterranean namely keeping a wary eye on turkey but there s also another aspect to egypt s energy exports and transit europe has long been heavily reliant some would say uncomfortably so on russian gas to the tune of 41 of its total imports during the latest energy shortages european storage levels dipped to their lowest in a decade and prices shot up 800 no wonder europeans have been clamoring for diversification and egypt is well placed to step up and provide relief european supply issues might ease up with the completion of nord stream 2 in the baltic sea but that doesn t materially change egypt s position the gas windfall however might eventually prove something of a double edged sword for egypt the country s economy already has two major revenue streams that are uniquely vulnerable to outside factors tourism and remittances while it isn t going to happen in the immediate future fossil fuels will have to be phased out due to growing fears over a no longer deniable climate change crisis and for providers the ability to adapt will make all the difference in egypt s case it s relying heavily on gas prioritizing projects that reduce methane emissions improving flare gas systems and working rapidly toward the adoption of hydrogen in power generation emgf has a stated mission that prioritizes energy transition and climate change action domestically egypt has invested heavily in renewables aiming to have them account for 42 of its power generation by 2030 the country s minister for petroleum and mineral resources tarek el molla has been making the international rounds last month he was at the abu dhabi international petroleum exhibition and conference adipec taking part in a session called charting the climate action from cop 26 to cop 27 and he was in the u s last week egypt will be hosting cop 27 in sharm el sheikh next year the spotlight will be firmly centered on a country attempting to balance income generation with climate adaption and mitigation and just as importantly as host attempting to hold developed countries to their promises to help emerging markets with climate change action the latter task will be the significantly more difficult one follow on twitter mmabrouk iraq militias seek to exploit us force presence robert s ford senior fellow on dec 9 the american general in charge of the anti isis international coalition in iraq said that the american combat mission had ended and u s forces would only provide advice training and assistance and intelligence to its iraqi partners the shift in roles will not much change the size of the small u s force in iraq but gen frank mckenzie commander of u s forces in the middle east said on dec 9 that the nato presence in the assistance mission should increase while the international coalition adjusts its units in iraq isis has ramped up its attacks and ambushes in diyala province northeast of baghdad including those on civilian targets as well as iraqi kurdish peshmerga units near the line demarcating areas under iraqi kurdish authority and those under the authority of the government in baghdad isis fighters for years have exploited seams along this line in northern iraq the american military tries to improve coordination between the peshmerga and federal government forces with only limited success american national security council official brett mcgurk reiterated in baghdad on sunday that the americans would not use iraq as a launching pad to attack neighboring states a clear message to iran gen mckenzie said on dec 9 that he expected more attacks against those forces from iranian backed militias his prediction followed public statements by some pro iranian militias that they would launch new attacks against american occupiers these militias are not united however the head of one prominent group the nujaba movement on dec 11 pledged to keep attacking the americans by contrast another pro iranian militia asa ib ahl al haq on dec 5 demanded the withdrawal of all american combat troops rather than all american forces the militias are struggling to maintain their legitimacy after a major defeat in the october parliamentary election and a nov 18 call by cleric muqtada al sadr for them to disarm they are also trying to wedge their political arms into the next iraqi government being negotiated now the militias will keep trying to demonize the americans and highlight their role against them in an effort to shore up their sagging support in iraq follow on twitter fordrs58 pakistan an absentee at the summit for democracy marvin g weinbaum director afghanistan and pakistan studies more than 100 countries participated in the summit for democracy held late last week pakistan was not among them though invited it chose to skip this american convened meeting joining excluded authoritarian regimes like russia and china and politically repressive regimes like turkey and saudi arabia the willingness to admit pakistan to the two days of virtual meetings had not been without controversy because of islamabad s reputed extrajudicial practices tightened controls over media and civil society and treatment of religious minorities a statement by pakistan s foreign ministry confirming the government s decision on the summit did not specify the reasons however it was felt necessary to declare that pakistan is a large functional democracy with an independent judiciary vibrant civil society and a free media committed to further deepening democracy opting not to participate in the summit together with the globe s u s designated democracies can be interpreted as a significant foreign policy step for pakistan the summit has sparked controversy for its geopolitical implications in the u s china great power rivalry pakistan s decision could serve to reinforce the idea that the country is falling ever more firmly into the embrace of china its major economic benefactor indeed pakistan s move was met with huge approval in beijing chinese foreign ministry spokesperson zhao lijian called it the action of a real iron brother pakistani officials also confirm that they consulted with china prior to snubbing the u s in rejecting an invitation to a gathering of democracies pakistan passed up what some saw as movement by the biden administration toward healing sorely strained relations pakistan has been smarting for months over the unwillingness of president joe biden to call prime minister imran khan still more khan was unexplainedly excluded from a u s led leaders summit on climate held in april india may have contributed to shaping pakistan s thinking about the summit on democracy india s invitation and special treatment did not go down well in islamabad prime minister narenda modi whom khan has likened to hitler was one of 12 leaders invited to participate virtually in a main leaders plenary session on the first day of the summit pakistan would rather like to see india painted

article article body as apple nears the point of becoming the world s first 3 trillion company its stocks at least for the moment have acquired the kind of status usually reserved for us government bonds on tuesday last week when omicron loomed large over the global economy and the us federal reserve chairman jerome powell removed the word transitory from his references to inflation wall street fell out of bed but apple shares jumped a sharp 3 2 to a then record close of us 165 30 231 71 that sent its market value above a record us 2 7 trillion 3 78 or nearly twice as much as the australian economy on current exchange rates on wednesday apple shares rose another 2 3 taking its market value above us 2 87 trillion 4 02 trillion then on friday the shares rose 2 8 to send the company s value to us 2 94 trillion 4 12 trillion just us 60 billion 84 billion short of the us 3 trillion 4 21 trillion level in the past month apple shares have risen more than 18 compared with the s p 500 the world s major market measure which is up just 0 62 that means apple shares have risen 35 year to date nasdaq the major tech stock market measure is up only 21 the share prices of rival megatechs have failed to match apple in the past month microsoft is up just 1 7 netflix is down more than 9 amazon is down 2 3 and alphabet is off 0 6 shares in meta facebook are down 3 2 apple has a different value proposition to its major rival amazon which although anchored in the consumer space with its huge e store operations in the united states and globally also has a massive cloud computing business smaller brick and mortar retailing a growing advertising business and interests in the next generation of motor vehicles but apple has a range of popular consumer products in global markets and crucially 750 million subscribers to its various services and rising it faces little of the intense regulatory scrutiny that facebook is under and lacks the bad odour of amazon and its anti unionisation tactics despite being resolutely hostile to unions after a decades long run as one of the world s best performing stocks apple is on the verge of reaching us 3 trillion in market value if it were a country it would be the fifth largest economy behind germany and its value is bigger than the entire german equity market of the tech giants only microsoft which has a market capitalisation of about us 2 5 trillion 3 5 trillion is currently comparable it s less than four years since apple first topped us 1 trillion in late 2000 amid the remains of the tech and net boom and bust apple was valued at just us 4 5 billion 6 31 billion us bonds are the traditional global safe haven gold has been relegated to the also ran list for more than a year with investors piling into them at times of stress as they have been doing since omicron the new covid 19 variant made its global debut on worry lists the rise in the apple share price suggests that us investors see the iphone giant as at least as good a credit risk as the us government s securities apple isn t merely bigger than nearly every government it s being treated as safer than most of them as well this article was first published by crikey
in the imperialist countries honest skepticism about government handling of the covid 19 crisis and the profit driven decisions of pharmaceutical companies have allowed rightist and ultrarightist groups to mobilize sections of the population behind unscientific theories that harm public health this article published in dewereldmorgen be in early december lightly edited and updated dec 13 examines this phenomenon by comparing the experience of belgium part of the imperialist world with that of socialist cuba both countries with about 11 million population translation john catalinotto larger and larger sections of the european population have been openly expressing their distrust of their governments handling of the coronavirus crisis in response the mainstream political establishment has panicked and reacted in a paternalistic and repressive manner by imposing vaccination on everyone and limiting freedom of movement this approach has failed to convince skeptics to accept the government s arguments to win acceptance would require at least listening to the fears and concerns of the unvaccinated but there are other factors at play as well a comparison with cuba s experience illustrates the problems mistrust of the government many unvaccinated people doubt and with reason the competence and or good faith of governments that now want to vaccinate them as quickly as possible we can understand these doubts since march 2020 european countries and even individual regions in belgium have been improvising their response to covid 19 their approach to the pandemic suffers from a lack of consistency and logic countries even those with similar infection rates have taken very different measures the belgian government won the gold medal of improvisation waiting until mid march 2020 before taking action six weeks too late had they acted earlier the rate of covid 19 spread would have been much slower and thousands of deaths could have been avoided they still haven t learned from their mistakes with each new wave of the coronavirus the response remains too slow although experts have been sounding the alarm for years the belgian government was unprepared for a pandemic at first they said masks were useless because there were none in stock due to a lack of adequate management then suddenly masks became mandatory in september 2021 as the numbers of infected grew belgium relaxed restrictions at the same moment with fewer cases the netherlands tightened the rules go figure in belgium when something needs changing seven health ministers have to agree on it governors and mayors simultaneously adopted stricter or more lenient rules while party presidents polished their image at the expense of public health one day the flemish minister president asks for more flexible rules for choirs and music groups the next day he calls for stricter rules when this mistrust finds its way to the streets and social media it hands the far right a slam dunk allowing the rightist movement to show empathy with people whose discontent is legitimate to succeed in drawing them into its wake the extreme right s goal of course is not to demand more democracy for the voiceless history teaches us that the far right seeks only to hasten the emergence of an authoritarian regime that will leave these people completely out in the cold it will protect the dominance of the 1 richest people and take their exploitation of everything and everyone to the extreme in any case the approach to the coronavirus crisis in belgium was and still is a hot mess but in fact the popular distrust runs much deeper than that during the last major crisis the banking crisis of 2008 it was also the ordinary people who suffered the banks that speculated with the people s money were not prosecuted they were even rescued when faced with collapse and it was ordinary people who paid the bill no more is needed to raise suspicions about the government s management of the covid 19 crisis and cuba starting january 2020 almost two months before the belgian government finally woke up the cuban government was rolling out a national plan to fight the coronavirus the government launched massive popular information campaigns in neighborhoods and on television cuban authorities issued consistent directives with no contradictions there was no need to get seven health ministers to agree no debates about the obligation to wear a mask the government took responsibility and did everything possible to nip the virus in the bud instead of making facile promises about so called sacrosanct freedoms instead of relaxing measures too quickly for electoral reasons or because of a lack of political courage it took energetic initiatives some examples tourism the main source of income but also of contamination was immediately put on hold the obligation to wear a mask applied to children from the age of six when it became clear that schools were also major sources of contamination home schooling was introduced school television has been a great help in this regard aïssa naranjo a doctor in havana explained thanks to a campaign giving correct information about health risks cubans have understood the importance of staying at home they know how disease is transmitted and feel responsible for their own health and that of their families and neighbors health care in cuba is primarily preventive and highly decentralized each neighborhood has its own polyclinic and there is a strong bond of trust between the local population and the health workers since march 2020 nearly 30 000 contact tracers have gone door to door including in the most remote areas of the island checking each family to see if any of its members have been infected university students have been mobilized to participate in the contact tracing in belgium this search has been carried out by anonymous operators from call centers an approach which inspires little popular confidence meanwhile cuba was working on developing its vaccines against the coronavirus by march 2021 three vaccines were being tested today cuba has five vaccines of its own design and production including one for children as young as two years old the policy on covid 19 is totally different in cuba than in belgium and this was reflected in the statistics at the end of 2020 cuba had 146 deaths from covid belgium had nearly 20 000 for the same period then the delta variant arrived leading to a race against time unfortunately cuban vaccines were not ready until three months after the delta variant appeared in belgium vaccination was implemented at a rapid pace starting in late 2020 which significantly reduced the number of deaths caused by the delta variant at least initially in cuba the peak of delta variant infections occurred in july 2021 causing many deaths and undermining the health care system this precarious health situation was compounded by serious economic problems due to the economic blockade imposed by the united states the halt in tourism and the rise in food prices this led to great discontent among the population from the u s some forces tried via social media to stir up this anger and channel it into demonstrations targeting the cuban government these attempts ultimately failed as soon as the vaccination campaign was launched in cuba the results were spectacular on sept 20 when the campaign began there were still more than 40 000 new infections and 69 deaths per day today cuba has fewer than 80 new infections and one death per day cuban children are also vaccinated from the age of two as of dec 6 some 90 of cubans had received their first dose this places the island second only to the united arab emirates in terms of vaccination rates no other country in latin america has such a high vaccination coverage in belgium it is at 76 distrust of big pharma many unvaccinated people in belgium find it suspicious that the government provides free vaccines all the more so because other medicines have become more and more expensive every year health care puts more strain on patients budgets but suddenly we are all required to get vaccinated for free what s behind this if you ask this question does it make you a conspiracy theorist people are well aware that big pharma is driven only to maximize profits and cares less about people s safety than it should for example between 1940 and 1980 millions of mothers to be took des diethylstilbestrol to prevent miscarriage in the 1960s they were prescribed softenon for nausea during pregnancy the use of these drugs caused thousands of babies to be born with deformities in the united states purdue pharma owned by the wealthy sackler family still marketed the powerful painkiller oxycontin after management knew full well that it was highly addictive fentanyl invented by paul janssen of the belgian pharmaceutical giant of the same name part of johnson johnson is also a highly addictive painkiller offered over the counter with plenty of advertising johnson johnson has been convicted for its role in this case in beerse in the province of antwerp the same pharmaceutical company has been producing a vaccine against covid since last year people know that pharmaceutical companies charge prices for their covid vaccines that are far too high and are heavily subsidized by the government but they are nevertheless allowed to pocket their billions in profits when these companies claim that a booster shot is necessary it raises suspicions even if this necessity is scientifically correct what about cuba in cuba there is no private pharmaceutical industry all vaccines against the coronavirus are manufactured by state owned biomedical laboratories the country produces 80 of all vaccines used in its vaccination campaigns there are no outrageous prices or excessive profits involved as in belgium everyone is vaccinated from early childhood against a whole range of diseases this is one of the main reasons for the very rapid increase in life expectancy in cuba over the last few decades life expectancy in cuba is now higher than in the united states and infant mortality is lower the last few months have proven that covid vaccines are also very effective so it s no surprise that cubans are not only confident but even proud of their domestic pharmaceutical industry distrust of science in belgium advertising indiscriminately uses real and pseudoscience to sell anything and everything food supplements perfect diapers hair growth serum high speed smartphones as a result science has lost much of its credibility with many people the frequent and large scale frauds in research only increases this mistrust a scandal such as dieselgate left its mark on people s minds added to this is the fact that many people finish high school or college without understanding statistics or its representation in articles there are just as many vaccinated people as there are unvaccinated people in the hospital we often hear all of this explains the attraction of obscure theories or at least the fact that people give credence to these theories because they think they are trying to make us believe something they want to muzzle us with their measures the cse vaccination etc they thus become an amalgam of politicians experts and the media and cuba in cuba people are rarely confronted with professional advertising they have access to science through a quality education system and noncommercial media cuban television explained even before the first case appeared on their soil what covid is how the pandemic developed in the world how to fight it and what measures would therefore follow cubans know that their scientists work for the common good they experience this almost every year when for example villages and towns in the path of hurricanes plotted by the world s best meteorologists are evacuated as a precaution they have seen hiv quickly brought under control through strong prevention measures they also see that the approach to dengue and zika is scientific effective and transparent so that these diseases have minimal casualties distrust of solidarity effective management of the pandemic requires solidarity the majority of the population who personally have little to fear from the disease must show solidarity with the very elderly and other vulnerable groups vaccination is important for everyone but also for children in order to reduce as quickly as possible the circulation of the virus in the community in favor of the weakest most people in belgium find this reason enough to do their bit this also applies to the observance of sanitary measures it is surprising that not more belgians say i am healthy and strong enough i don t need a vaccine the others can take care of themselves here the whole commercial neoliberal culture reminds people daily that they must work on their personal development and do better and better in life which is a euphemism for getting rich we are presented with an ideal of absolute autonomy we are told that we must not depend on others and certainly not on the state at the risk of being a parasite this neoliberal culture portrays the unions as protecting those who accept help from the government who they call profiteers this culture promotes streamlining the government by cutting social welfare and health care funds such a culture instead of encouraging solidarity discourages it and cuba cubans do not grow up in a spirit of competition or every person for themself they know from experience that only by working together can they meet the immense challenges facing their country they are used to overcoming problems together unfortunately now more than ever helping neighbors cleaning the neighborhood together meeting and making decisions together in the workplace etc this is how they live solidarity runs in their veins for decades they have been sending doctors nurses and teachers to the four corners of the world a small country of 11 million people with 10 times less resources than belgium has sent doctors to italy to fight against covid this attitude and way of life is the fourth reason for the near absence of anti vaccine movements in cuba

as baseball legend yogi berra once quipped about the 1973 national league pennant race it ain t over till it s over the same can be said about the ongoing bidding war between private equity firms chatham asset management and atlas holdings to acquire north america s largest commercial printer rr donnelley sons rrd on friday dec 10 rrd s board unanimously determined that the unsolicited now fourth proposal from chatham asset management to acquire all of its common stock for 10 85 per share in cash constitutes a superior proposal over atlas holdings latest bid of 10 35 per share in cash however it subjected chatham to a timing condition that gives atlas until 9 am cst on friday dec 17 to counter with a higher offer if chatham doesn t agree to extend the date of its offer rrd indicated it plans to pursue its amended agreement with atlas today s announcement is a testament to the robust process we have in place to maximize value for all stockholders john c pope rrd chairman of the board said in a prepared statement our board and management team remain committed to acting in the best interests of rrd and all its stockholders and will continue to take actions to achieve this objective should atlas not make a superior offer rrd will be required to pay a 20 million termination fee and 12 million expense reimbursement to atlas chatham if the rrd board accept its offer has agreed to pay the 20 million termination fee to atlas on rrd s behalf but in this latest iteration rrd has agreed to pay the expense reimbursement of 12 million rrd would also be required to reimburse chatham the 20 million termination fee if the acquisition agreement with chatham were not to be finalized in a letter anthony melchiorre chatham managing member chastised rrd s board for showing what chatham believes to be its overwhelming favoritism to consummate an acquisition deal with atlas rather than a sales agreement with what is rrd s largest bondholder and an approximately 14 9 common stock shareholder a portion of that letter follows despite issuing a press release on dec 1 2021 stating that its negotiation period with atlas would expire on dec 7 2021 the company s board of directors continued those negotiations for an additional two business days and refused to meaningfully engage with us or approach us with respect to countering any new offer since declaring chatham s proposal to purchase all shares of rrd not currently owned by chatham at a price equal to 10 25 per share a superior proposal under the terms of the atlas merger agreement in fact rather than engage with us during this time the board just agreed to write atlas an even bigger check if the company signs a deal with us by increasing the termination fee and expense reimbursement payable to atlas from 20 million to 32 million thereby depriving stockholders of approximately 0 39 per share that could have been completely avoided if the board had engaged with us back in october when we made our initial bid to acquire the company the board s determination to avoid signing a deal with chatham at all costs flouts any measure of good corporate governance and the directors fiduciary duties and is having a deleterious effect on all rrd stakeholders this behavior must stop the board s conduct is creating confusion in the market and for all rrd stakeholders causing a serious delay in consummating a transaction and threatening to deprive stockholders of receiving the maximum price for their shares this is not how a public company should run an orderly sale process nevertheless chatham is prepared to top atlas offer and is hereby increasing its offer to purchase all common stock of rrd not already owned by chatham at a price equal to 10 85 per share our offer remains a fully financed all cash firm offer our revised offer continues to be supported by a debt commitment letter led by jefferies finance llc in an aggregate amount of up to 1 675 billion a capital commitment letter from chatham in an amount of up to 400 million a rollover of all shares of common stock of rrd beneficially owned by chatham having a value of approximately 118 6 million based on our proposed purchase price of 10 85 per share and the equitization and or subordination into pik instruments of up to 795 3 million of the aggregate principal amount of rrd s outstanding notes that chatham currently owns which represents approximately 57 3 of rrd s outstanding notes including more than 50 of the company s 6 125 senior secured notes due november 2026 assuming all 795 3 million of the company s outstanding notes are equitized or subordinated by chatham will reduce its annual interest expense by approximately 60 9 million it appears despite the rrd board s preference toward consummating a deal with atlas holdings which is also the parent of former rrd spinoff lsc communications finch paper and several other printing paper and packaging companies chatham asset management which acquired the mcclatchy newspaper chain out of bankruptcy in september 2020 has no intentions to be outbid

washington the us air force has discharged 27 people for refusing to get the covid 19 vaccine making them what officials believe are the first service members to be removed for disobeying the mandate to get the shots the air force gave its forces until nov 2 to get the vaccine and thousands have either refused or sought an exemption air force spokeswoman ann stefanek said monday that these are the first airmen to be administratively discharged for reasons involving the vaccine she said all of them were in their first term of enlistment so they were younger lower ranking personnel and while the air force does not disclose what type of discharge a service member gets legislation working its way through congress limits the military to giving troops in vaccine refusal cases an honorable discharge or general discharge under honorable conditions the pentagon earlier this year required the vaccine for all members of the military including active duty national guard and the reserves each of the services set its own deadlines and procedures for the mandate and the air force set the earliest deadline defence secretary lloyd austin has said the vaccine is critical to maintaining the health of the force and its ability to respond to an national security crisis none of the 27 airmen sought any type of exemption medical administrative or religious stefanek said several officials from the other services said they believe that so far only the air force has gotten this far along in the process and discharged people over the vaccine refusal as a result they were formally removed from service for failure to obey an order stefanek said it is also possible that some had other infractions on their records but all had the vaccine refusal as one of the elements of their discharge it is not unusual for members of the military to be thrown out of the service for disobeying an order discipline is a key tenet of the armed services as a comparison stefanek said that in the first three quarters of 2021 about 1 800 airmen were discharged for failure to follow orders according to the latest air force data more than 1 000 airmen have refused the shot and more than 4 700 are seeking a religious exemption as of last week a bit more than 97 per cent of the active duty air force had gotten at least one shot members of the navy and the marine corps had until nov 28 to get the shots and their reserve members have until dec 28 army active duty soldiers have until wednesday and members of the army national guard and the reserves have the most time to be vaccinated with a deadline of next june 30 across the military the vaccine reaction has mirrored that of society as a whole with thousands seeking exemptions or refusing the shots but overall the percentage of troops particularly active duty members who quicky got the shots exceeds the nationwide numbers as of dec 10 the pentagon said that 96 4 per cent of active duty personnel have gotten at least one shot the number plummts to about 74 per cent however when the guard and reserve are included according to the centers for disease control about 72 per cent of the us population 18 and older have gotten at least one shot defense secretary lloyd austin has made it clear that the guard and reserve are also subject to the mandate and has warned that those who fail to comply risk their continuing members in the military but that has proven to be contentious oklahoma s republican governor and the state attorney general have already filed a federal lawsuit challenging the military mandate for the state s guard gov kevin stitt the first state leader to publicly challenge the mandate is arguing that austin is overstepping his constitutional authority stitt had asked austin to suspend the mandate for the oklahoma national guard and directed his new adjutant general to assure members that they would not be punished for not being vaccinated austin rejected the request and said unvaccinated guard members would be barred from federally funded drills and training required to maintain their guard status oklahoma s adjutant general brig gen thomas mancino posted a letter on the state guard s website however warning his troops that those who refuse the vaccine could end their military careers

bloomberg the inflation wave that s sweeping through the global economy is playing into a investment niche that a small group of people in finance have spent years developing farmland agricultural land has become attractive to institutional investors and wealthy families in recent years because returns tend to be stable and weakly correlated with other asset classes according to purdue university agricultural economist todd kuethe more investors are now seeking it out as a potential hedge against inflation asset managers say with consumer prices rising at the fastest pace in decades every single institutional phone call i ve had in the last six months has included a discussion of inflation five years ago it would have been zero said stephen johnston managing partner at calgary based veripath farmland partners lp which owns 90 000 acres in western canada across its portfolios that sentiment is echoed at fiera comox partners in montreal where about two thirds of the c 1 7 billion 1 3 billion it manages is invested in farmland from the u s to australia protection against inflation has become of heightened importance to clients chief executive officer antoine bisson mclernon said the value of u s farm real estate grew 7 in june from a year earlier to an average 3 380 an acre the biggest increase since 2014 according to a survey conducted by the u s agriculture department historically there has been a pretty strong correlation between inflation and farmland which benefits when the price of food commodities goes up purdue s kuethe said but there are other factors pushing up land values as well including low interest rates and easing global trade tensions he said investing in farmland tends to be reserved for larger institutions such as endowments and pension funds or wealthy individuals bill gates and his ex wife melinda french gates held the largest private portfolio of farmland assets in the u s last year according to a ranking by the land report a magazine agriculture focused funds capitalize on the appetite for an asset that requires specialized knowledge many investors don t have in infrastructure you can go buy a 4 billion toll road in agriculture it s still very much a fragmented market mainly family owned bisson mclernon said you need to have the right model to actually go and build scale bisson mclernon and johnston have different approaches fiera comox forms partnerships with farmers who have expansion plans and becomes a co owner its investments range from almond orchards in california to dairy operations in new zealand across 200 000 acres it hasn t made land investments in canada by contrast veripath which started under a different name in 2007 leases land it owns back to farmers and has been focused on the canadian prairies both firms use their network of contacts to identify possible sellers land rush farmland wasn t always an attractive investment several u s companies dedicated to farmland equity investment sprung up in the 1980s and 1990s but they had a hard time competing with a booming stock market according to the 2020 book fields of gold financing the global land rush by madeleine fairbairn of the university of california santa cruz but rising commodity prices in the mid 2000s pushed up farmland values fairbairn wrote and its appeal as a safe haven increased bisson mclernon saw the boom first hand in 2011 he launched the natural resources unit at canada s public sector pension investment board overseeing the purchase of 2 million acres of timberland and farmland five years later he and two former psp executives teamed up with global asset management firm fiera capital corp to create their own firm fiera comox which also invests in private equity and private credit plans to double assets under management including in farmland in the next two to three years spotting and sealing a deal can take years including months of due diligence on everything from water consumption to growth prospects farmers also want to make sure investors are committed for the long run bisson mclernon said the global land rush has caused some alarm among development researchers especially as investors and at times governments acquired or leased land in poor countries critics refer to the trend as a land grab some canadian provinces restrict foreign ownership of farmland in 2015 saskatchewan introduced measures to prohibit farmland purchases by pensions scuttling plans by the canada pension plan investment board which had just bought tens of thousands of acres there and was planning to add more fiera comox s shared risk shared profit model helps the company may help perception of its business on environmental social and governance criteria in agriculture responsible practices include eliminating pesticides selling locally rather than exporting and paying good wages said francois boutin dufresne managing partner at sustainable market strategies an esg research firm in montreal to make sure the commitments are real investors should hire their own evaluators he said bisson mclernon says he and his colleagues serve on the boards of all their businesses and spend a lot of time on due diligence the company is paying particular attention to reducing the use of resources chiefly water in a 4 000 acre orchard growing almonds a notoriously thirsty crop teams planted more efficient rootstocks and changed the irrigation infrastructure he said if you re going to enter into that space you want to make sure that you can improve the situation bisson mclernon said you will win in this industry if you re able to reduce the amount of water that you re using with assistance from alex tanzi 2021 bloomberg l p

don t miss out on juicy passive income look to invest in these cheap dividend stocks for the next decades quality dividend stocks can be great additions to any diversified investment portfolios when it comes to getting passive income investors will probably lean towards high yield dividend stocks like tc energy tsx trp nyse trp however don t disregard low yield dividend stocks that are hiking their dividends faster i ll use enghouse systems tsx engh to explain why a cheap dividend stock for passive income now tc energy is a fine pick right now for a yield of nearly 6 if you want passive income now it should be at the top of your buy list to research the energy infrastructure company has operated pipelines energy storage facilities and power generating plants in canada the united states and mexico for more than seven decades it has paid dividends for close to 60 years this year s dividend increase marked its 21 consecutive years of dividend growth investing 5 000 in the big dividend stock now will generate close to 300 in annual income investors can expect the dividend to continue increasing into the future to roughly keep pace with inflation management is anticipating dividend growth of 3 5 annually in the medium term across 20 analysts tc energy is undervalued by approximately 13 so the dividend stock could appreciate about 15 over the next 12 months while paying a high yield combined solid total returns of about 21 are possible over the near term however there s no need to trade in and out of the stock to generate nice returns it s big dividend and stable cash flow generation makes tc energy stock an excellent candidate for passive income its portfolio consists primarily of natural gas infrastructure and power and storage assets complemented by oil and liquids pipelines these assets are set to remain relevant in a world of decarbonization how can low yield dividend stocks be buys for passive income some passive income investors ignore low yield dividend stocks however it s the wrong move if you re planning to invest for decades for instance although enghouse systems investors started with a puny yield of about 1 4 in 2008 fast forward a little more than a decade to now the yield on cost of the investment would be over 18 imagine getting a return of more than 18 every year on your original investment so if your original investment in enghouse systems were 5 000 in 2008 you would generate more than 914 annually by now it is possible to enjoy the consistent returns from healthy dividend growth in particular the tech stock has increased its dividend by about 20 per year in the period that s a very high dividend growth rate that was only possible because the company maintains a sustainable payout ratio and reinvests its retained earnings skillfully enghouse system s five year return on equity roe of approximately 19 3 is relatively high investopedia explains the roe as a gauge of a corporation s profitability and how efficient it is in generating profits calculated by net income divided by shareholders equity investors could use the long term average of s p 500 s 14 as a benchmark the company has maintained a high roe close to 14 or higher in the last decade thanks to its disciplined acquisitions strategy management will simply walk away from an acquisition if it s too expensive in any case four analysts find the tech stock to be undervalued by about 27 with near term upside potential of 37 enghouse starts you off with a yield of close to 1 3 right now

yoursay what s next indian women giving up sari dr m uses chopstick example to lament challenges in assimilating non malays dizzer my two sen worth on this ludicrous identity issue a month ago as part of a module on identity i asked 20 kids in my form 4 class in an international school but all malaysian students 70 percent chinese 30 percent indian malay about where they thought they came from all of them said they considered themselves to be malaysian first even though a lot of them i m sorry to say most will end up overseas seldom returning except to see their families only one kid had any idea beyond their grandparents he had been on a family reunion to one of the southern provinces they d done a genealogical search and said it was interesting but they had nothing in common with each other of the malays two had grandparents from indonesia and yemen respectively the other two hadn t a clue why can t dr mahathir mohamad listen to the younger generation i can t think of many malaysian kids over the past 30 years that i ve thought of as constitutionally and emotionally racist but once they get out into the world the realities of the system hit them it s the system not the people mazilamani my god did mahathir when serving as prime minister and during his overseas trips ever once eat use his hands does he ever practise this in malaysia when entertaining foreign leaders or dignitaries at official dinners it is outrageously insulting to himself and not so much to the chinese community for bringing up the issue of chopsticks as for young chinese keeping links with china it may be strictly for business reasons to take advantage of the huge and expanding opportunities china has to offer and it gives them that extra advantage because as chinese they speak the same language similarly indians from malaysia have business links with tamil nadu and other parts of india what is so wrong with this why talk about us president dwight eisenhower of german stock leading the american troops against germany when we were or are not at war with either india or china in testing the loyalty of the non malays for malaysia vent i had a good laugh actually reading his puerile nonsense but i must admit this is the most bizarre example i have ever read of cancel culture the man s gone mental so the chinese have to give up the cultural dexterity of eating with chopsticks for the flexibility of eating with fingers what s next do indian women have to give up tying saris to being shrouded in baju kurung but mahathir really did himself in with this declaration in other multiracial countries once they adopt citizenship of a country they identify themselves only with that country and no longer with where their grandfathers came from perhaps but they don t reject their roots as he has nor do we ever need to patriotism doesn t need to cancel cultural heritage or faith sun indeed unbelievably naïve answers by mahathir to serious questions there are many indians and arabs who become malays by sacrificing their own ethnic identities to adopt the malay language customs and names they did not have to sacrifice their religion mahathir chinese and indians will never be treated as malays if they stick to the religion are babas treated as malays despite adopting many elements of malay culture and losing their chinese language eisenhower did not have to sacrifice his religious beliefs to be considered an american in india muslims remain muslims and are considered indians and hold important positions in the army and they protect their country against aggressors outside and within the country as indians have not the chinese and indians done the same in malaysia regardless of whatever ties they maintain with the country of their ancestors do not malay of bugis or minangkabau ancestry maintain pride in their ties to the land of their ancestry yet during the confrontation did they not fight indonesia kuniyo chinese indonesians gave up their identity but still they were targeted whenever there is political instability in the 1960s 1990s and 2018 no matter how proficient you speak the language racial supremacists will see you as the others assimilation is just an excuse to dominate and control those they see as minorities what s the point of assimilation if you still have a racial quota racists don t like minorities taking charge they prefer them to be mere multicultural displays for tourism purposes limauharimau7067 interesting the problem of assimilation is caused by eating with chopsticks instead of hands do you honestly believe that your government s frequent reminder in all official documents that one must mention one s ethnicity and religion has nothing to do with this this is not to mention the myriad policies based solely on the criteria of race the more you try to blame everyone and everything but yourself for your terrible deeds the more opportunity the rakyat will have to see the real truth bring them on keep talking mahathir hmmmmmmmm our country is unique in that we have people of different races practising each other s cultures this is our strength this is why we are called malaysians and not arabians or indonesians we can all be different and yet be united you used america as an example us is a melting pot of people from all over the world including chinese and indians as well i am very sure that many of them practise their own cultures and customs and still identify themselves as americans it is also mischievous of you to say that the chinese here identify more with china even though they are born here i do not know anybody among my friends or family who identifies with china even though we are chinese i seriously doubt there is any malaysian born chinese who would fight for china against malaysia our ancestors may have come from there but to us china is just another country alien to us if you think that non malays have not assimilated well you should start by removing all your discriminatory policies starting by not asking everybody to fill in their races in all your forms why do you need to know our races aren t we all malaysians i have never seen forms in other countries where their citizens have to state their race to do that to me already signifies evil intent gerard lourdesamy i eat with my hands and yet i am discriminated against because i am not a malay assimilation will never happen so long as article 153 of the constitution remains no other country in the world including the us has a provision to grant special status and rights to the majority race not even in indonesia or thailand affirmative action for the majority is unheard of in any other democracy only in malaysia it governs our very existence to the exclusion of close to 32 percent of the population bluecrab6133 what an unbelievably divisive and deviant mind this man has he can pick on the smallest details and blow them out of proportion to provoke all and sundry he forgets conveniently that he is the man who started malaysia on this slippery slope to failure by his racist divisive destructive and fanatic policies while catering to his cronies his comments are no longer

business as usual for now photo richard drew ap shutterstock the arrival of omicron in the u s looks likely to complicate the country s exit from a seemingly endless pandemic it might also bring another round of economic uncertainty at least in some industries i spoke with finance reporter kevin t dugan about the effect that yet another blitz of infections on top of the current one could have on the strong yet uneven american economy and why wall street seems largely unconcerned so far ben the u s is already dealing with about 120 000 covid infections a day and is now facing a new wave of the omicron variant while this iteration of the virus may may be milder than previous ones it s highly transmissible and could more easily break through vaccines it s likely to wreak havoc among the unvaccinated and is just another sign that the pandemic isn t anywhere close to winding down meanwhile inflation is running very high worker shortages are widespread and americans are very gloomy about the economy despite low unemployment and abundant jobs it seems highly unlikely that any state is going back to lockdowns or other highly restrictive measures unlike in europe but what could a more highly transmissible variant mean for the overall economic picture do you think it would just exacerbate the strange trends we re already seeing kevin you re right that so far there haven t been any drastic moves by governments to impose lockdowns but there are still some tentative reactions from companies that are looking at omicron and deciding it is not worth the risk i m talking about the delays in return to office plans here but this is in a lot of ways just status quo the question about returning to the office affects the white collar workers at amazon not so much the people who work at the fulfillment centers omicron presents a weird dilemma for the economy it s new and is getting defined and redefined each day the high transmissibility is known the virulence is still unknown the u k just had its first death with the variant but most cases have been mild you can see what you want to in it the high transmission rate will probably have more of an impact on the jobs that are creating some of the bottlenecks in the economy larry summers posted a thread on twitter today about the problem with viewing economic inflation solely through the supply chain since many of the things that are driving the rise in prices aren t stuck in ports and i think he s right in that it s not a pure supply issue the economists i ve talked to have told me that the supply of goods and services isn t weak but there are problems with the number of truckers on the road getting christmas gifts delivered if you think of the supply chain bottlenecks as a symptom of the broader labor market issues that people don t want to take jobs that are paying less are more likely to expose them to infection have few child care options or are just more physically demanding than a person recovering from covid can do that seems to go a long way in explaining both the high prices on the shelves the longer wait times for goods and the low grade dysfunction in the functioning of the economy ben the stock market is not the economy as we all know fully well by now but it s been striking to see the market react to these various new waves and continued disruption from covid there s usually a dip sometimes a sharp one followed by a rebound and that s what s happened with omicron so far the s p 500 hit a record high last week and though the dow was off a bit today it s been near record highs too why do investors remain so confident and what does this indicate if anything about this strange economy we re living in kevin the stock market isn t the economy but it is a bet on where the economy is going i think it s worth pointing out that yes even though the dow jones is at or near record highs there s also a lot of hedging going on that means that investors are buying protection in case the market falls again like it did the day after thanksgiving a sell off that was driven by fear of omicron some of that is the usual end of the year stuff basically investors just lock in their gains secure their bonuses and take the last few weeks of the year off but if you take a look at the vix the so called fear gauge it s still at a slightly elevated level after a major spike at the end of november and early december but so what right at the end of the day wall street is betting more money than not that covid is essentially over earlier this month jpmorgan put out a research paper saying that if a defining characteristic of omicron is that it causes a mild infection the new variant could accelerate the end of the pandemic essentially the bank s researchers are arguing that this could be a crossing of the rubicon for the virus an event marking a period when it isn t much more than a nuisance for most people again we don t know if this is true the long and even medium term effects of omicron are still getting hashed out but the people with money aren t running for the exits it s also worth putting a finger on what s so strange about this economy despite the initial panic about omicron things are basically status quo at least pandemic status quo we re in a period of high inflation which is usually bad for companies since it erodes their earnings but the last quarter busted records for corporate profits biden urged patience around responding to omicron and took a lockdown off the table new york s new masking and vaccination rules are a change of degree and won t affect people so much on top of that you have jerome powell who looks pretty eager to take the federal reserve out of emergency mode the fed has been sucking up a lot of risk in the markets by buying up bonds and keeping interest rates low essentially propping up an economy that had collapsed last year during the shutdown but in pushing to wrap that up and let the markets take on more risk than they have in two years powell is signaling that he s out to keep prices from spiraling out of control the response from wall street has largely been good there s also a fatalistic streak in wall street s outlook on omicron what s largely unspoken in this positive outlook is that you re still going to get a lot of people who will potentially get sick because the lower hospitalization rate will just translate to larger numbers of people in the icu if more and more people catch the strain in this outlook the variant is going to spread so fast and so wide that you re almost guaranteed to get it and if everybody gets infected and the casualties are low then things will largely return to normal ben though as intelligencer s david wallace wells points out if a strain is doubling every three days even if it s only half as severe you still hit the same number of severe cases three days later not sure that s immediately apparent to everyone kevin exactly what s optimistic about the wall street outlook is not that everyone will be happy and healthy an investor looks around and says okay what conditions do we need to have to go back to normal and make more money to have an economy that functions as it did the economy runs in normal times with lots of sick people not a defense of the status quo which saddles people with unsustainable levels of medical debt so my read on this outlook is that it s a bet that in a very short amount of time maybe a month or two omicron will wash over the world and even though the numbers might eventually shake out to be similar it marks a period when we can now think of it as something we live with ben as has been true throughout the pandemic certain kinds of businesses are more vulnerable than others to pandemic shocks this morning stocks like delta and norwegian cruise line were down presumably because industries like air travel cruise lines and by extension restaurants movie theaters gyms and more may have their marches to relative normalcy interrupted let s say these sectors see another serious blow with the government already having spent trillions and trillions of dollars on stimulus is there any kind of fallback for them of course this is a bigger concern for the café around the corner than delta kevin i m not convinced it s a bigger concern for the café around the corner but you re hitting on something here because those are two very different kinds of businesses with very different economic problems if you own a café and you go bankrupt your assets are an espresso machine or two a fridge etc and you have to deal with a lease and whatever you might owe your vendors all that stuff is pretty easy to deal with either through restructuring or liquidation if you re norwegian cruise line what are you going to do with all these boats at the start of the pandemic the airline industry received about 25 billion in bailouts to keep them ahem aloft norwegian was able to raise money through the debt markets after the government propped up the bond markets compare that with hertz they got no bailout then declared bankruptcy they sold their cars when they came back online cars were expensive and hard to come by this summer the price of renting a sedan for a weekend skyrocketed so you re looking at the odds that a company like delta would get another bailout it s unlikely the fed as i mentioned before is essentially trying to take money out of the financial system and for its part delta isn t exactly acting like it s waiting for uncle sam ticket prices across airlines are competitive according to the bureau of labor statistics ticket prices rose about 4 7 percent in november but that s after a few months of declines delta is already rejiggering its business away from cities that don t have many flights pulling out of three cities entirely so if you want to fly to lincoln nebraska cody wyoming or grand junction colorado you can t take delta there norwegian and other cruise lines are a different animal but according to an industry news outlet about half its fleet is operating so the upshot here is that if they need more money they ll probably either borrow more money from the markets or lay people off
