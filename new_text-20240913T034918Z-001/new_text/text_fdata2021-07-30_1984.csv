recently in response to an article by veteran saint lucian and caribbean journalist earl bousquet on the centenary of the communist party of china cpc many false statements were made in this newspaper about china s internal and foreign affairs and its relations with caribbean nations five of which require clarification with real and unchallengeable facts china caribbean cooperation and assistance bilateral ties between china and the caribbean in the modern era extend over five decades and caribbean governments and nations caricom and oecs have all come to know and experience understand and appreciate that china caribbean cooperation isbased on mutual trust and consultation to promote economic development and improve people s livelihoods indeed such cooperation has always been sincerely welcome by governments and people of the region china caribbean ties started in the decade of the 1970s with barbados guyana jamaica and trinidad tobago and in the 1980s expanded to include oecs member states since then all nations with china ties have enjoyed fruitful mutually beneficial relationships at all levels china caricom ties took an upward trajectory and a great leap forward since 2013 when president xi jinping took office and visited trinidad tobago for multilateral discussion with caricom leaders following which china s caribbean engagements have increased deepened and improved at bilateral and multilateral levels president xi earlier this year reaffirmed china s continuing interest in engagement with the caribbean in a telephone call to guyana s president irfan ali members of his cabinet and representatives of the guyana private sector as the 50th anniversary of bilateral ties between the two nations approaches president xi on july 14 2021 again reiterated the importance china place on its caribbean ties during another direct telephone discussion with barbados prime minister mia mottley sponsored article continues below china s role in the global fight against covid 19 is also very highly appreciated by caribbean nations and leaders despite the huge domestic demand and limited supply china has supplied more than 480 million doses of vaccines to the international community making it the largest supplier in the world it s provided vaccine assistance to nearly 100 countries from five continents including latin america and the caribbean china is also providing an initial 10 million doses to the world health organization who for use by its covax distribution chinese vaccines indeed represented the first doses available to many developing countries and china has so far provided 165 million doses of covid 19 vaccine to latin american countries which have been used effectively in caricom and oecs states likeantigua and barbuda barbados dominica guyana and trinidad tobago chinese vaccines have also won a good reputation in the international community with their safety and effectiveness widely recognized by more than 100 countries that have so far approved them the who has added china s sinopharm and sinovac vaccines to the emergency use listing and more than 30 leaders worldwide have taken vaccines made in china in the caribbean the chinese vaccine is the only one approved by the government of trinidad and tobago that allows for use by breastfeeding women antigua and barbuda prime minister gaston browne says the chinese vaccine has proven its effectiveness and safety and will make positive contributions to the early realization of herd immunity there trinidad and tobago s prime minister dr keith rowley commended chinese president xi s commitment of making chinese covid 19 vaccine a global public good as it greatly contributes to equitable access to vaccines as strongly advocated by trinidad and tobago and caricom and that trinidad and tobago and china have stood together in solidarity and support in both morale and materials caribbean leaders have also recognized the important vanguard role of the communist party of china cpc at home on the global stage and in the region as it celebrated its first century last month prime minister mia mottley also leader of the ruling barbados labour party noted that the cpc is a political party with a glorious history of 100 years that is worthy of admiration and high praise adding that the cpc has greatly improved the lives of the chinese people which also has lessons for other countries sponsored article continues below prime minister rowley underlined the cpc s exploration of the path to national prosperity and rejuvenation thepolitical leader of the caribbean s twin island republic sruling people s national movement pnm also said china has made hard won achievements in its economic development poverty alleviation social progress and other areas marisa dalrymple philibert speaker of jamaica s house of representatives said that under the leadership of the cpc the chinese people of all ethnic groups have developed the country into a major world power with firm determination and a spirit of unity the words of these caricom leaders speak louder than the shrills of those seeking to paint china caribbean ties in a negative light truth about china and the taiwan covid 19 vaccine issue contrary to the false published claims accusing china of being a stumbling block in the way of taiwan compatriots receiving vaccines china has many times offered to donate vaccines to the island sponsored article continues below heads of the red cross society branches in neighboring chinese cities fuzhou and xiamen recently expressed readiness to assist taiwan compatriots but the mainland affairs council of taiwan declined the offer recently too many counties cities and groups in the taiwan region have been calling for early access to vaccines from the mainland and some institutions even announced that they will receive donations from the mainland many well known taiwanese politicians and scholars such as hong xiuzhu and qiu yi have also gone to the mainland to get china vaccines in march 2020 shanghai fosun pharma signed an agreement with the german biontech company to participate in the development of the mrna new crown vaccine and has the exclusive commercial rights of the vaccine in mainland china hong kong macao and taiwan in january 2021 the vaccine was approved for emergency use in the hong kong special administrative region and in february it was approved by the macao special administrative region health bureau sponsored article continues below since the outbreak in taiwan in may counties cities enterprises and private organizations in the region o taiwan have proposed to purchase bnt vaccines from shanghai fosun pharma which clearly stated at the time that it was also very willing to serve the vaccine to taiwan compatriots and play an active role in the prevention and control of the epidemic on the island but the dpp authorities again ignored the facts and falsely claimed the chinese government was obstructing taiwan s purchase of vaccines it was not until late june 2021 that they reluctantly agreed to tsmc hon hai and the everlasting foundation to negotiate purchases with fosun the shanghai fosun pharmaceutical group also issued an announcement on the shanghai stock exchange on july 11 saying fosun industrial the company s subsidiary had signed sales agreements for mrna covid 19 vaccines with tsmc hon hai and everlasting foundation from taiwan according to the agreement fosun industrial will sell 10 million doses of the vaccine to the purchaser and the company will supply vaccines to taiwan in accordance with the agreement and normal business rules while it looks forward to helping taiwan compatriots strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic and return to normal life as soon as possible all this demonstrates the taiwan compatriots confidence in mainland vaccines and the prc expressed on many occasions and china sequal readiness to do our best to help them fight the virus unfortunately for our taiwan patriots however the taipei authorities turned a blind eye to the goodwill of the mainland sponsored article continues below taiwan has been a part of china s territory since ancient times and the prc will always make the utmost effort and do everything that will serve the interests of our taiwan compatriots we also always hope that the people in taiwan will get the much needed vaccine sooner than later lies about coronavirus origin tracing the referred response also deliberately misrepresented the issue of coronavirus origin tracing and highly politicized the issue in pursuit of casting blame when cooperation is most needed but here too the caribbean has also supported china s opposition to politicization of the global pandemic the who has dispatched international expert teams to china three times to conduct investigations and studies and they conducted scientific assessments of the possibility of direct transmission of the coronavirus from a natural host and the ways the virus can be transmitted into populations through cold chain foods intermediate hosts and laboratories the mission s report clearly states that a laboratory origin of the pandemic was considered to be extremely unlikely sponsored article continues below a series of studies have also shown that the united states spain france italy brazil and many other countries were indeed affected by the virus long before the outbreak in china the wall street journal reported that as early as mid december 2019 there were isolated cases of coronavirus infection on the west coast of the united states a study by the national cancer institute int in italy also showed that the coronavirus was detected there since september 2019 since then more evidence has shown the corona virus may not have a single origin as it broke out at multiple points in the world but contrary to efforts to poison the minds of caribbean people the region s leaders are very much aware of what s at stake and stand by china indeed in her telephone discussion with president xi on july 14 barbados prime minister mottleynot only called for increased and expanded china ties with latin america and the region but also spoke out against politicization of covid 19 origin tracing and appreciated china s positive contribution to promoting fair distribution of vaccines in developing countries the realities of hong kong today contrary to the twisted facts and obvious untruths contained in the publication beijing cares highly about hong kong and is ensuring the continued successful implementation of the one country to systems policy the central government in beijing has been governing the special administrative region sar in accordance with china s constitution and the basic law of the hong kong sar and the prc has ensured a true policy of hong kong people administering hong kong a high degree of autonomy has been earnestly implemented and hong kong residents lawful rights and freedoms have been fully guaranteed according to law sponsored article continues below the national security law is to prevent curb and punish crimes of secession subversion of state power terrorist activities and collusion with foreign or external forces to endanger national security it also maintains prosperity and stability and protects the lawful rights and interests of hong kong residents and protects the rights and freedoms enjoyed by the vast majority of hong kong residents including freedom of the press since the law took effect nearly a year ago hong kong has regained stability global capital keeps flowing in and foreign enterprises are more confident about hong kong s business environment the imf in its latest report again recognized hong kong s status as a global financial hub casting a vote of confidence in its growth prospects the hidden facts about xinjiang here again the published falsities fly in the face of reality because contrary to the false claims there are loads of reports that expose the contained lies for example in a recently published academic report entitled xinjiang understanding complexity building peace by fabio massimo palandi an acclaimed italian scholar of international relations he said he saw in xinjiang the full religious freedom enjoyed by ethnic minority groups including uyghurs and found no sign of the so called allegations of forced labour and genocide instead he pointed out that western accusations on xinjiang are unfounded palandi said some western think tanks scholars and media have invented false reports causing grave negative impacts through false reports packaged as independent based on which some western governments imposed groundless sanctions on xinjiang he also said the purpose of the propaganda is not to protect human rights in xinjiang but to suppress and contain china sponsored article continues below meanwhile in recent years xinjiang s social situation has been generally stable economic development has achieved important results people s living standards have been significantly improved and the international community including the caribbean has made a fair evaluation of xinjiang s construction achievements on june 22 at the 47th session of the un human rights council belarus delivered a joint statement on behalf of 67 countries including grenada stressing that issues relating to hong kong xinjiang and tibet are china s internal affairs opposing politically motivated and groundless accusations against china based on disinformation and opposing interference in china s internal affairs under the pretext of human rights more than 20 countries also supported and echoed china s position by making statements in their national capacity or co signing a letter and over 90 countries appealed for justice at the human rights council which not only constitutes support to china but is also an effort to uphold basic norms governing international relations and international fairness and justice the lies behind debt trap rumors here too the packaged bundle of untruths sought to give a contrived impression that simply echoes the lies of those bent on blaming china for everything and distorting history to try to justify their misleading claims contrary to the claims or china trapping poor countries into debt the fact is that nations engaged in financial agreements with beijing know that china s loans and assistance to countries effectively help to set up their national infrastructure promote economic development and improve social living conditions and people s livelihood sponsored article continues below the prc has long provided a large number of gratuitous aids interest free loans and concessional loans to the developing countries in asia africa latin america the south pacific and the caribbean helping to build such infrastructure projects as railways highways ports terminals airports hospitals schools stadiums and cultural centers among other facilities that have greatly improved the basic conditions for the economic and social development of recipient countries which have all been welcomed by recipient governments and peoples president xi jinping insists that on mankind s journey in pursuit of happiness no country or nation should be left behind as such we believe all countries and nations are entitled to equal development opportunities and rights and china will continue to uphold the principle of sincerity real results affinity and good faith and contribute more to caribbean countries development and rejuvenation understanding china s democratic political system finally none of the above will be fully understood without a basic understanding of china s history and the evolution of its democratic political culture and system whether a political party or government is good or bad depends first and foremost on whether it can safeguard and develop the fundamental interests of the general public sponsored article continues below in 2020 over 39 million members of cpc fought on the front lines against the covid 19 pandemic andthe vast majority of chinese people strongly feel that living in china is the safest and happiest with 95 saying they trust their government the highest number worldwide china is also committed to an independent foreign policy of peace and the prc grows not by expansion or colonial plunder but through the hard work of its people china s development also offers a new option for other countries and nations that want to speed up their development while preserving their independence the cpc has enabled the chinese people to become masters of their country their society and their own future and enabling them to move towards the goal of common prosperity in the mid 19th century hundreds of millions of chinese were plunged into extreme poverty due to the foreign aggression and the decadence of the imperial dynasty but since the founding of the prc in 1949 and especially since the reform and opening up in the 1980s chinese people s living standards have gradually improved and by 2019 china s gdp per capita exceeded us 10 000 more than 770 million of china s rural population living below the current poverty line have been raised from poverty accounting for more than 70 of the global total over the same period according to the world bank china has clearly won the battle against extreme poverty and achieved the poverty alleviation goal set on the un s 2030 agenda for sustainable development a full ten years ahead of schedule this has significantly reduced the world s poor population and made a significant contribution towards realizing a better and more prosperous world sponsored article continues below in conclusion truth always wins and lies only last for as long as it takes to expose them the reality is that the world knows better and china is not seen by developing countries as the caribbean countries know well that china s ties with fellow developing countries are alwaysbased on mutual trust and consultation to promote economic development and improve people s livelihoods and nothing the prophets of doom claim or deliberately misrepresent can change the unchallengeable facts outlined above zhengjie liu representative of the prc in saint lucia former chinese embassy gros islet saint lucia

estate related expenses including but not limited to gains losses from sales impairment adjustments and depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures our calculation of ffo is consistent with ffo as defined by nareit core ffo is a non gaap financial measure defined as ffo adjusted for gains from forfeited earnest money deposits and non recurring public company costs we believe the presentation of core ffo provides investors with a metric to assist in their evaluation of our operating performance across multiple periods because it removes the effect of unusual and non recurring items that are not expected to impact our operating performance on an ongoing basis affo is a non gaap financial measure defined as core ffo adjusted for gaap net income related to non cash revenues and expenses such as straight line rent amortization of above and below market lease related intangibles amortization of lease incentives capitalized interest expense non cash compensation expense and amortization of deferred financing costs historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time in fact real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions ffo is intended to be a standard supplemental measure of operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation and valuation adjustments from net income we consider ffo to be useful in evaluating potential property acquisitions and measuring operating performance we further consider core ffo and affo to be useful in determining funds available for payment of distributions ffo core ffo and affo do not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by gaap you should not consider ffo core ffo and affo to be alternatives to net income as a reliable measure of our operating performance nor should you consider ffo core ffo and affo to be alternatives to cash flows from operating investing or financing activities as defined by gaap as measures of liquidity ffo core ffo and affo do not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all

compute ebitda as earnings before interest income taxes and depreciation and amortization in 2017 nareit issued a white paper recommending that companies that report ebitda also report ebitdare we compute ebitdare in accordance with the definition adopted by nareit nareit defines ebitdare as ebitda as defined above excluding gains or losses from the sales of depreciable property and real estate impairment losses adjusted ebitdare is a non gaap financial measure defined as ebitdare further adjusted to exclude straight line rent gains from forfeited earnest money deposits non recurring public company costs representing consulting fees that we have incurred in preparing to become a public company and non cash compensation expense we present ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare as they are measures commonly used in our industry we believe that these measures are useful to investors and analysts because they provide supplemental information concerning our operating performance exclusive of certain non cash items and other costs we use ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare as measures of our operating performance and not as measures of liquidity ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare do not include all items of revenue and expense included in net income they do not represent cash generated from operating activities and they are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements accordingly they should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or cash flows from operations as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of gaap financial measures additionally our computation of ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare may differ from the methodology for calculating these metrics used by other equity reits and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other equity reits noi and cash noi noi and cash noi are non gaap financial measures which we use to assess our operating results we compute noi as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding general and administrative expenses interest expense or income income tax expense depreciation and amortization gains or losses on sales of depreciable property gain from forfeited earnest money deposits and real estate impairment losses we further adjust noi for non cash revenue components of straight line rent and amortization of lease intangibles and lease incentives to derive cash noi we believe noi and cash noi provide useful and relevant information because they reflect only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and present such items on an unlevered basis noi and cash noi are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and our noi and cash noi may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies you should not consider our noi and cash noi as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities

given the absolute onslaught of news we ve experienced in recent months if not recent years it can feel like the presidential debates for the 2020 election happened a lifetime ago many of us here at daily kos recall the countless times massachusetts sen elizabeth warren campaigned to tax the ultra wealthy and tried her best to break down complicated tax systems and structures for the masses as she displayed during an interview on wednesday morning warren has not lost her touch warren appeared alongside billionaire ken langone on cnbc s squawk box where langone asked warren why he a billionaire still receives social security checks among other questions about taxes on the super wealthy when he finally gave warren a moment to get a word in she certainly delivered let s check out the exchange and footage below langone who described himself as a fat cat told warren he had an easy question that would surprise her how do you justify giving me a three thousand dollars a month check every month with all my wealth why don t you people have the courage to address entitlements as to what should no longer be an entitlement he added that he shouldn t get social security and asked why corporations don t have a minimum alternative tax warren took his questions in stride starting by explaining how taxes work for the super wealthy jeff bezos has not paid taxes on the wealth that he has warren stated adding that in spite of being worth a bazillion dollars he has not paid taxes on his wealth in fact she continued jeff bezos many years has either paid nothing in taxes or has paid 1 why because his income is very very small but he continues to grow his wealth through all of his amazon stock and how does he then fund a lifestyle like he does not by cashing in amazon stock but by borrowing against it warren explained that right now our tax system simply doesn t encompass people at a certain level of wealth like bezos but does make low income and middle class folks pay in response to langone s second question about minimum tax rates warren addressed that she has herself suggested something very similar to a minimum tax on corporations which she called a real corporate profits tax she added this would be another way to get funds for universal child care and infrastructure repair and in terms of social security warren said it s set up differently in that it s structured more like an insurance policy warren broke down that you in this case langone but also the public in general pay in year after year and that it s not welfare or charity social security on the other hand is an agreement that every employee in the country who is eligible for social security paid into and gets a return on the back end surely you wouldn t want to be the person to go on national tv and say after a contract has been negotiated and someone has paid into it for 40 years that the federal government should turn around and say oops we changed our mind we re not going to give you the payout that you earned by making the payments all those years also on squawk box warren offered up a fresh zinger toward bezos when asked about how to take cryptocurrency saying i want to see us tax wealth however your wealth is tied up it shouldn t make a difference whether you have real estate or whether you have cash or whether you have a bazillion shares of amazon yes jeff bezos she added i m looking at you here is that clip published with permission from daily kos
in this december 18 2020 file photo a person passes the office of the california employment development department in sacramento california fueled by vaccinations and government aid the u s economy grew at a solid 6 5 percent annual rate last quarter in another sign that the nation has achieved a sustained recovery from the pandemic recession the total size of the economy has now surpassed its pre pandemic level ap reports thursday s report from the commerce department estimated that the nation s gross domestic product its total output of goods and services accelerated in the april june quarter from an already robust 6 3 percent annual growth rate in the first quarter of the year the latest figure fell well below the 8 percent plus annual growth rate that many economists had predicted for the second quarter but the miss was due mainly to clogged supply chains related to the rapid reopening of the economy those bottlenecks exerted a larger than expected drag on companies efforts to restock their shelves the resulting slowdown in inventory rebuilding in fact subtracted 1 1 percentage points from last quarter s annual growth by contrast consumer spending the main fuel of the u s economy surged for a second straight quarter advancing at an 11 8 percent annual rate spending on goods grew at an 11 6 percent rate and spending on services from restaurant meals to airline tickets expanded at a 12 percent pace as vaccinations encouraged more americans to shop travel and eat out companies too spent with confidence last quarter business investment surged at an 8 percent annual rate in the april june quarter adding 1 1 percentage point to gdp with consumers and businesses expected to keep spending many analysts expect the economy to grow at a robust pace of around 6 5 percent for all of 2021 despite the supply shortages and the possibility of a resurgent coronavirus in the form of the highly contagious delta variant that would amount to the strongest calendar year growth since 1984 growth that strong would far exceed the 2 percent to 3 percent average annual rates of recent decades and it would represent a striking bounce back from the economy s 3 4 percent contraction last year in the midst of the pandemic the worst decline since the 1940s underpinning the rapid recovery have been trillions in federal rescue money ranging from stimulus checks to expanded unemployment benefits to small business aid to just distributed child tax credit payments and millions of affluent households have benefited from a vast increase in their wealth resulting from surging home equity and stock market gains consumers are going to continue to drive the economic train said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics there is a lot of excess savings a lot of cash in people s checking accounts jen psaki the white house press secretary hailed the gdp report and called on congress to go further by passing the administration s proposals to vastly expand the nation s infrastructure overhanging the bright economic forecasts is the threat posed by the delta variant the u s is now averaging more than 60 000 confirmed new cases a day up from only about 12 000 a month ago should a surge in viral infections cause many consumers to hunker down again and pull back on spending it would weaken the recovery for now the economy is showing sustained strength last month america s employers added 850 000 jobs well above the average of the previous three months and average hourly pay grew by a solid 3 6 percent compared with a year earlier faster than the pre pandemic annual pace consumer confidence has reached its highest level since the pandemic struck in march 2020 a key reason why retail sales remain solid as americans shift their spending back to services from restaurant meals and airline trips to entertainment events and shopping sprees the economy is also receiving substantial support from the federal reserve on wednesday the fed reaffirmed that it will maintain its key short term interest rate at a record low near zero to keep short term borrowing costs low it will also continue to buy government backed bonds to put downward pressure on long term loan rates to encourage borrowing and spending the recovery in fact has been so rapid with pent up demand from consumers driving growth after a year of lockdowns that one looming risk is a potential spike in inflation that could get out of control consumer prices jumped by 5 4 percent in june from a year ago the sharpest spike in 13 years and the fourth straight month of sizable price jumps the measure of consumer inflation in the second quarter gdp report showed an annual rise of 3 4 percent for core inflation which excludes food and energy it was the fastest such jump since 1991 in addition to the drag on gdp from weak inventory restocking reflecting the supply chain problems housing construction fell at a 9 8 percent annual rate last quarter this decline reflected in part the troubles home builders have had in obtaining lumber and other supplies some economists have warned that by choosing not to begin withdrawing its extraordinary support for the economy the fed may end up responding too late and too aggressively to high inflation by quickly jacking up rates and perhaps causing another recession but at a news conference wednesday fed chair jerome powell underscored his belief that recent inflation readings reflect price spikes in a narrow range of categories from used cars and airline tickets to hotel rooms and auto rentals that have been distorted by temporary supply shortages related to the economy s swift reopening those shortages involve items like furniture appliances clothing and computer chips among others
buck clay and i are about to dive into all of this with house minority leader kevin mccarthy who joins us on the line great to have you congressman how are you doing leader mccarthy i m doing well congratulations you two on the show buck thank you very much we appreciate it so we just had the breaking news about the d c mask mandate we ve been talking a lot about speaker pelosi s mask rule and the possibility of fines or maybe even arrests minority leader what are you going to do about this leader mccarthy you know you need to understand where this comes from we just brought in the physician for the capitol he based his decision on the cdc the cdc has now become political this is what the country needs to understand the physician in the capitol dr monahan said well the cdc recommends based upon a report that has not been printed yet we then went further and asked the doctor did you know this report is based upon a study in india about a vaccine that isn t approved in america and doesn t even have peer review i did not know that and in the cdc recommendation it says only for hot spots in washington d c there s an 85 of the capitol vaccination rate even in the washington post they write if you were vaccinated for you to go to the hospital with a new variant is 003 it s more likely you get hit by lightning than have to go to the hospital and the most interesting part about all of this where our speaker does not understand what science means you re basing something on a study in india on a vaccine that isn t in america our vaccines work and it s not even peer reviewed what they re doing is the administration is making the cdc political because what s the next thing they did once they got them to make this report every federal employee needs one they re going to use this to shut the schools down they re going to use this you re watching it day after day just continue to grow that s what they want to have happen they first go to the house and inside the u s capitol if you re in the house side you have to wear a mask or you get fined or arrested but somewhere around the rotunda the science changes buck chuckling leader mccarthy so in the senate you don t have to wear a mask clay congressman i appreciate it this is clay i appreciate you coming on so what s the response buck and i have been talking about earlier in the show it feels to me and i m curious what you would say to your members several of whom have already started to say this that the response needs to be come and arrest me then nancy pelosi if i ve already been vaccinated and already have had covid as several of your members have there s zero scientific justification for wearing a mask leader mccarthy yes clay and i think you re right there needs to be a battle at some point you guys have to start fighting for people out there who want their kids to be in school without having to wear masks who want their small businesses to be able to stay open what s the best way to fight now leader mccarthy that s exactly what we re doing watch what if you and i were talking yesterday no one knew how the cdc got their science to make this and change the country it was the house republicans that brought it forward it was the house republicans who confronted the physician it is the house republicans the leader who challenged the speaker on the science behind it what was her response to call me names not to debate about the science but to call me names the democrats have the majority in the house and unfortunately the rules of the house all she does is she fines you 500 she won t arrest members but she tries to arrest staff we tell staff you don t have to they re trying to make americans who are vaccinated to wear a mask again it s about control and if they really want people to get vaccinated they wouldn t take information off the internet they would let somebody who hasn t been vaccinated to have all the information so they could make a decision they wouldn t tell vaccinated people what the science tells you it s not going to do anything to wear a mask because it takes away the incentive for someone to get vaccinated it s all about control and we re not going to sit back we re not going to allow this to happen we just did our other press conference out front we re united in our approach the very best thing we could do is fire pelosi because she s the one that s fundamentally driving this behind biden clay what happens with the 500 fine how they enforce that how do they make you pay leader mccarthy they take it out of your paycheck clay they take it out of your paycheck leader mccarthy you have to understand what the democrats have done in the house it s total control never in the history of congress has the speaker picked who could be on committee for the minority side she then instituted past rule that they would fine you 500 if you didn t have a mask on they take it directly out of your paycheck she magnetometers before the house chambers i don t understand it s only for members themselves if you go around it it buzzes and you go through you get fined 5 000 taken directly from your paycheck the most interesting part is clyburn the whip because he has security he walks around it it s the same thing as before remember when nancy pelosi wanted the country shut down said you can t get your hair done but she goes and gets it done clay chuckles of course leader mccarthy remember when nancy pelosi said inflation is not a problem her husband and her just made 5 million in the last couple of months how not because he invested in stocks or buildings he bought option calls what did he buy it on he bought it on tech stocks when did he buy it in the time that we were debating the bills and legislation before tech you think that s right buck no it s clearly not leader mccarthy she says one thing and the law does not abide by her buck we re speaking to minority leader kevin mccarthy here and sir i just want to know what do you think people out there because they ask us what should they do about this continued covid authoritarianism i mean it s in d c right now it s in los angeles county i m worried i m here in new york city i think i might be next although we ll see what should people who don t want their kids masked up and don t want to have deal with this do what should their next moves leader mccarthy let s go to the foundation of where they re bringing this premise from the cdc which they made political let s look at the study the study that the cdc is basing it on is it printed the study is based on a study in india on a vaccine that isn t in america our vacancies work and it s not peer reviewed how can any scientific belief harbor from this but they utility this to make the other cities to control us more why are they doing it today because they re coming after your schools next they re going back into our restaurants they re going back to our small businesses the only thing they care about is control if that wasn t the case why would why would they put magnetometers around the hill to get in why would they make you 500 if you don t wear it on the floor it s all about control in the exact same building you walk halfway across it no longer lies there in the senate you don t have to wear a mask if the capitol police officer works on the house side he s told to arrest people if they don t have one later in the day if he works on the senate side no they don t have to wear a mask over there buck chuckling so ridiculous leader mccarthy where is the science behind it america needs to stand up play by the science and show them that they re wrong we cannot take this any longer clay so i think you re 100 right on all of this do you get the sense buck and i have been talking about this do you get the sense that the american public is finally fed up because i do this newest shift from the cdc after the white house and everything else said and the bargain was get the vaccine you never have to wear a mask again and suddenly they re coming back and saying we have to wear masks again republicans are fed up but i get the sense that reasonable democrats to the extent they still exist and lots of independents are sitting around saying this is covid madness leader mccarthy this is covid madness they were afraid they were losing control why don t you put it out public how could they make a decision on a study that s not even public that you can t read that s based upon a vaccine that s not even in america how could that stand on its merit but this is what they do they take that to control the rest of our lives america will not stand for this and it s not about a republican or democrat or anybody else it s the americans themselves we re not going to go backwards it s 003 if you re vaccinated we were told if we got the vaccine we could go back to work back to school back to health back to normal now they re trying to take us back because somehow they re losing control you ve watched every step of the way from pelosi getting her hair done when they said you can t have it from gavin newsom going to the restaurant when he tells you no one else can this is fundamental they want it one way they want to control us and live another way that is not right that is not fair that is not the american way and it shouldn t fundamentally be one side we need to stand up and fight this clay house minority leader mccarthy thank you so much for joining us sir we appreciate your time today leader mccarthy thank you join with us
vladimir tenev ceo and co founder of robinhood right walks in new york s times square with fellow co founder baiju bhatt following their company s ipo thursday july 29 2021 robinhood is selling its own stock on wall street the very place the online brokerage has rattled with its stated goal of democratizing finance electronic screens in new york s times square announce the robinhood ipo thursday july 29 2021 robinhood has already changed how people trade stocks and who s doing it now its sights are on the rest of the financial industry previous next wall street gave robinhood a cool reception thursday in the online broker s debut in the stock market that it helped reshape by bringing millions of new investors shares of robinhood markets inc slumped 8 4 in their first day of trading on the nasdaq from their initial price of 38 set late wednesday it was a disappointing performance after the offering was already priced at the low end of its expected range at that price the company is valued at roughly 29 billion similar to companies like supermarket chain kroger and steelmaker nucor though its heft on the pop culture landscape may be even weightier robinhood has created plenty of passion among users and critics alike and that polarizing effect played out thursday with its shares careened from a gain of 5 9 to a loss of 12 2 within their first hour of trading the moves were particularly sharp for some of robinhood s customers who bought the stock before it began trading the company reserved a big chunk of its ipo for its own smaller pocketed customers instead of big professional firms part of its mission to democratize finance i expected a pop said jeffrey colindres soto a 26 year old from miami who bought the stock after it began trading but once it started dipping the way it did i think a lot of people just started to leave because they already knew that was the sell off right there now that robinhood s stock is trading on the nasdaq its performance gives a real time look at the market s judgment of the company s prospects the company is already delivering the strong growth that wall street is always hungry for its revenue soared 245 last year to 959 million it has amassed an estimated 22 5 million funded accounts since its 2013 founding after it did away with trading fees and made investing easier and even fun with its mobile app more than half its customers are first time investors giving them more ability to keep up with the stock holding wealthier households that had been pulling away for years but robinhood has also drawn heaps of criticism and it has paid more than 130 million in recent years to settle a list of accusations by regulators critics say robinhood encourages unsophisticated investors to make trades too often that may be too risky and the regulatory scrutiny is likely to stay high these settlements they ve made a lot of it is lack of controls lack of disclosure said josh white a finance professor at vanderbilt university and a former economist at the securities and exchange commission as they grow can they invest in the platform to be viewed as on the side of these retail investors some users are still angry at robinhood after it and other brokers temporarily locked them out of trading gamestop shares earlier this year when hordes of smaller pocketed investors were pushing the stock up in part to spite the monied elite on wall street questions also remain about whether regulators may tighten oversight of its main money maker that s routing its customers orders to big wall street trading firms which pay robinhood to take the other side of the trade beyond that robinhood stands to lose if the boom in trading it s helped create among regular people fades such worries were among the reasons for robinhood s thursday drop a notable move when most ipos get an initial pop over the last decade only 17 of ipos bigger than 1 billion saw the share price fall on their first day said matt kennedy senior strategist at renaissance capital a provider of pre ipo research the worries started early in the day for sandra marvel a 49 year old investor from raymore missouri who planned to buy shares until she saw they priced at the low end of their expected range and then initially fell i completely abandoned my plan she said it doesn t look good i think there are a lot better trades out there marvel who left her job in insurance sales last year to trade stocks full time has been using robinhood since 2018 even some fans who bought the stock did so with reservations william van horn ii a 30 year old who works in commercial real estate in pensacola florida said he uses robinhood for almost all his trading because it s so much easier to use than other apps while he s traveling between sites for work he said he bought shares thursday but he s aware of the criticism robinhood gets for its customer service he said he himself lost out on thousands of dollars due to outages of its service early last year i understand the bad of it but i m also a true believer of it he said do you go with your heart or with your logic that there are so many problems robinhood which is based in menlo park california has big plans for growth in the future continuing its evolution since launching as a stock trading app only for iphones over time we want to be the single money app the most trusted and most culturally relevant money app worldwide ceo vlad tenev said in an interview so everything that you use your money for you should be able to do through robinhood among them he said were direct deposits of paychecks and paying bills online he also pushed back on criticism that robinhood is making the stock market a casino by encouraging its customers to trade more often i think

populations of giant pandas in the wild are more fragmented and isolated than they were 30 years ago and many continue to face a high risk of extinction despite recent gains in the species overall numbers a new study by chinese and american scientists finds climate change habitat loss and reduced breeding viability an inherent risk in small remote populations where potential mates are few could pose a triple whammy for these animals the research suggests scientists need to find ways to restore connectivity between these populations or introduce new breeding animals into them the study s authors say our models show that populations with fewer than 30 individuals have under a best case scenario a one in five chance of going extinct in 100 years on average some may not be that lucky said stuart pimm doris duke professor of conservation ecology at duke university s nicholas school of the environment who helped design the new study as climate change intensifies in coming years pandas will be driven higher and deeper into china s mountains in search of their dietary staple bamboo and their populations will become even more fragmented and vulnerable to extinction the models predict this vulnerability will be heightened by the synchronistic mass flowering and subsequent mass deaths of bamboos across large parts of the pandas range an episodic event that historically occurs every 65 to 120 years the next flowering in china is due to occur in the coming decade or two pimm said demographic accidents such as the premature deaths of breeding age females or imbalances in the number of male and female offspring born over a period of years can also speed an isolated population s demise so can inbreeding which reduces fitness to assess the combined effects of these factors on animals in each of the 33 giant panda populations identified in the fourth giant panda census in 2015 the chinese and american scientists modelled each animal s fate from birth to death under dozens of different scenarios doing individual based models is quite time and labor intensive but provides a wealth of raw data about the likely fate of these populations at a granular level that wouldn t be possible by modelling at a broader scale pimm explained pimm worked with lingqiao kong weihua xu yi xiao hao shi and zhiyun ouyang of the state key laboratory of urban and regional ecology at the chinese academy of sciences research center for eco environmental sciences in beijing their peer reviewed analysis appears in nature ecology evolution the study comes at a time when giant pandas long term prospects seem to be brightening conservation by the chinese government has helped the species wild population rebound in recent decades by an estimated 17 to around 1 850 individual animals in recognition of these gains the iucn red list upgraded the pandas status from endangered to vulnerable to extinction five years ago and earlier this month the chinese government followed suit the creation of the new giant panda national park that china is developing will further boost some pandas odds of survival pimm said when completed the park will connect 67 existing giant panda reserves in sichuan gansu and shaanxi provinces and make it easier for animals there to crossbreed animals outside the park won t be as lucky there will still be many lonely pandas who can t find a date pimm predicted an estimated 59 pandas or about 3 of the total population live in 14 geographically isolated populations outside the park s future boundaries there are also four populations with 41 individuals inside the national park that are isolated from other populations by roads and natural barriers these are the populations our models show as being the most vulnerable to extinction without timely intervention while the number of these unlucky outliers may seem small with a total species population that s still shy of 2 000 any losses are worrisome losses pimm said to prevent declines corridors of protected land should be created or restored in some cases to connect the isolated populations to each other and the new park the study s authors argue failing that new breeding stock should be introduced one possible way to do this is to train pandas that have been bred and raised in captivity to forage for their own bamboo and then release them into the wild near isolated populations this isn t the easiest thing in the world some are going to starve to death and no one wants that pimm said but we have to start trying to rescue these isolated populations

high greenhouse gas emissions will drastically alter distribution of key tuna species climate change driven redistribution of key commercial tuna species will deliver an economic blow to the small island states of the western and central pacific and threaten the sustainability of the world s largest tuna fishery a major international study has found the study combines climate science ecological modelling and economic data to provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of climate change on pacific tuna stocks and on the small island states that depend on them it is published today 29 30 july 2021 in nature sustainability a consortium of institutions and organisations from across the pacific north america and europe contributed to the research including the university of wollongong conservation international the pacific community spc the pacific islands forum fisheries agency ffa and the parties to the nauru agreement office pnao the 10 island states of the western and central pacific cook islands federated states of micronesia kiribati marshall islands nauru palau papua new guinea solomon islands tokelau and tuvalu are so reliant on their tuna fisheries for economic development and food security that they are considered tuna dependent the management of most of the islands tuna fisheries through a cooperative agreement has been a sustainable development success story over several decades providing reliable and much needed revenue for development while preventing the depletion of fish stocks through overfishing around half of the world s tuna catch comes from the waters of the western and central pacific and for those 10 small island states fishing fees from industrial fishing fleets to gain access to their waters account for an average of 37 per cent of all government revenue ranging from 4 per cent of government revenue for the relatively large economy of papua new guinea to 84 per cent for tokelau study lead author dr johann bell senior director pacific tuna fisheries conservation international center for oceans and visiting professorial fellow at uow s australian national centre for ocean resources and security ancors said the key species of skipjack yellowfin and bigeye tuna were highly migratory and move over large swaths of the ocean according to oceanographic conditions currently these tuna stocks are found largely within the waters of the 10 island states however under climate change they are projected to shift eastward progressively moving out of sovereign waters and into the high seas dr bell said by 2050 under a continued high greenhouse gas emissions scenario the total biomass of skipjack yellowfin and bigeye tuna in the waters of the 10 states could decline by an average of 13 per cent as a greater proportion of fish move into the high seas the potential implications for pacific island economies in 2050 include an average decline in purse seine catch of 20 per cent a loss in regional tuna fishing access fees of up to us 140 million and reductions in government revenue of up to 17 per cent for individual pacific island states the future for the pacific island states looks more promising under lower greenhouse gas emission scenarios which would lead to smaller losses reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in line with the paris agreement would provide a pathway to sustainability for tuna dependent pacific island economies the greenhouse gas emissions of these small island states are negligible and yet they are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change dr bell said many of the island states have very few opportunities to earn income other than from their tuna resources which are expected to move from their jurisdictions due to ocean warming this is a climate justice issue that should be raised at the united nations climate change conference in glasgow later this year associate professor quentin hanich a pacific ocean governance fisheries management and marine conservation expert from uow and a co author of the study said there was also much that could be done at a regional level pacific island states can negotiate through the regional fisheries management organisation to retain the benefits they receive from tuna regardless of the future distribution of the fish he said study co author assistant professor katherine seto from the university of california santa cruz and a research fellow at ancors noted that as more tuna move into the high seas beyond areas of national jurisdiction they become vulnerable to overfishing preventing overfishing and ensuring compliance with fisheries management measures is more difficult outside the exclusive economic zones of the island states because the sole responsibility for compliance rests with the states that flag the fishing vessels often resulting in self regulation she said about the research pathways to sustaining tuna dependent pacific island economies during climate change by johann d bell et al is

we ve been a national leader in reliability customer service and safety all hallmarks of excellent utility operations and our operational performance has improved over that period for example we transformed our nuclear plants into one of the top ranked fleets in the nation while lowering our cost structure by 20 and under ben s leadership we delivered for the environment became a national leader in wind energy and highlighted by our steel for fuel strategy we ve tripled our total wind capacity from 3 400 megawatts to over 10 000 megawatts and our owned wind growing from 300 megawatts to more than 4 000 megawatts we ve significantly reduced the level of coal in our fuel mix from 50 to 21 and we reduced our carbon emissions by 51 compared to our 2005 baseline we were the first major u s utility to establish 100 carbon free goal while remaining a stalwart champion for reliability and affordability we ve delivered excellence for our financial stakeholders as well we ve tripled xcel energy s market cap from 12 billion to 37 billion and our stock prices increased from 24 per share to almost 70 per share reflecting a tsr of 300 and outpacing our peer group we ve met or exceeded our earnings guidance every year and increased our dividend in line with our earnings growth and beyond xcel energy ben s recently served as chairman of eei leading through pandemic uncertainties driving focus on the need for increased levels of research and development for new technologies and inspiring his peers to define diversity and inclusion priorities for their organizations he s had a tremendous run as ceo and will leave a lasting legacy at xcel energy for the utility industry and i would go so far as to say for the country so thank you ben and congratulations on your upcoming retirement in august i look forward to your continued leadership at the board level and partnering with you on important federal policy efforts related to infrastructure and clean energy looking ahead and i m honored with the opportunity to lead this great company and i recognize the lebron james sized shoes that i m filling since joining xcel energy five years ago ben and i have worked closely on the development and the execution of our strategy and that will not change we ll continue to lead the clean energy transition enhance our customers experience and will constantly work to keep our customers bill low and deliver an affordable product we ve had a fantastic leadership team and significant bench strength and i m confident in our ability to capitalize on the growth opportunities in front of us while maintaining our commitment to reliability and affordability i m excited about our growth opportunities over the next decade driven by our generation resource plans transmission expansion distribution investments and our electric vehicle vision as we move forward innovation is more critical than ever as we prepare to move from 80 carbon reduction by 2030 to 100 carbon free electricity i ll be focused on clean technologies in both our electric and our natural gas businesses as well as how we engage with customers in new ways through a more flexible grid i also expect innovative work practices will continue to drive efficiency and produce strong operational results and safety is another area where i plan to help drive innovation as one of our core values safety is already a priority but we can do even better i want us to move beyond traditional metrics and embrace a heightened focus on prevention and culture change eliminating the most serious events by encouraging trust transparency and learning in the coming months i look forward to continued engagement with our customers our communities our regulators our investors and of course our workforce we have the best employees in the business and i m proud of what we ve accomplished and i m excited for the future successes that we ll achieve together and to our investors we appreciate the trust that you place in us and we ll continue to be good stewards of your investments now turning to the quarter today we reported solid quarterly earnings of 0 58 per share compared to 0 54 per share last year we re off to a good start and we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance we made significant progress on various regulatory initiatives including three constructive rate case settlements that brian will discuss in more detail in addition we ve advanced our plans for adding incremental renewables in wisconsin the commission approved our proposal for the 74 megawatt mustang solar project for 100 million which will be the largest solar facility in western wisconsin in june the minnesota commission approved our proposal to buy out a repowered 120 megawatt wind farm ppa for 210 million from allete this repowered project will save our customers money while extending the life of a renewable energy resource and the minnesota commission continues to evaluate our 575 million proposal to build a 460 megawatt solar facility takes advantage of existing transmission as we phase out of coal we are confident the commission will see the customer and economic benefits and expect a decision later this year or early in q1 of next year additionally as part of our continued commitment to foster a skilled and diverse workforce we proposed a training program in minnesota to help those in underrepresented communities develop the skills to succeed in energy related construction careers program graduates will have the opportunity to be considered for participation in our sherco solar proposal and other future projects in june we filed an alternative minnesota resource plan which achieves an 85 carbon reduction by 2030 this proposal addresses the concerns of various parties by removing the sherco combined cycle from consideration and replacing it with two combustion turbines the key components of the revised plan include an early retirement of both the king and the sherco three coal units in 2028 and 2030 respectively a life extension for our monticello nuclear plant construction of new transmission lines in order to take advantage of the interconnection rights from the retiring coal units and the addition of 3 150 megawatts of universal solar 2 650 megawatts of wind 800 megawatts of new hydrogen ready cts and 300 megawatts of repowered blackstart cts 1 900 megawatts of flexible peaking resources and 250 megawatts of new storage we ve provided the commission with an outstanding resource plan that will reduce carbon while maintaining reliability and customer affordability we expect a decision on the minnesota resource plan later this year or early next in addition we continue to make good progress and are in the discovery phase of the colorado resource plan and associated transmission power pathway project we expect the commission decision on both proposals in early 2022 and between minnesota and colorado resource plans we anticipate adding nearly 10 000 megawatts of new renewables to our system to meet our 80 carbon reduction goal by 2030 with that i ll turn it over to brian brian j van abel executive vice president chief financial officer thanks bob and good morning everyone we had a good second quarter recording 0 58 per share compared with 0 54 per share last year the most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by 0 19 per share primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments in addition a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by 0 06 per share as a reminder production tax credits lowered the etr however ptcs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense which reduced earnings by 0 09 per share reflecting our capital investment programs increased o m expenses which reduced earnings by 0 07 per share and lower afudc decreased earnings by 0 05 per share largely due to placing several large wind farms into service last year turning to sales weather normalized electric sales increased by 5 3 in the second quarter this reflects a comparison to last year when the pandemic restrictions in our states were at their highest levels and our sales were most suppressed due to covid impacts our year to date weather and leap year adjusted electric sales increased 1 6 we continue to anticipate modest annual weather adjusted sales growth of approximately 1 shifting to expenses o m increased 50 million for the quarter which largely reflects the timing of expenses between the two periods last year we had significant o m reductions in the second and third quarter to offset the impact of lower sales from covid while the fourth quarter was at higher levels so the quarterly o m comparisons will be chunky this year turning to regulatory filings we reached constructive settlements in three rate cases in wisconsin we agreed to a rate increase of 66 million over 2022 to 2023 based on an roe of 9 8 in 2022 10 in 2023 and an equity ratio of 52 5 in new mexico we agreed to a rate increase of 62 million reflecting an roe of 9 35 and an equity ratio of 54 7 we also accelerated the depreciation life of our tolk coal plant to 2032 as we plan for its early retirement in north dakota we agreed to a rate increase of 7 million based on an roe of 9 5 and an equity ratio of 52 5 we anticipate commission decisions in these cases later this year in july we filed a colorado electric rate case seeking a net rate increase of 343 million based on an roe of 10 and an equity ratio of 55 6 and the 2022 forecast test year the rate case is largely driven by capital investment and we anticipate a commission decision in the spring of 2022 we also have a pending texas electric rate case we re seeking a net rate increase of 74 million after reflecting fuel savings and ptcs from the sagamore wind farm the request is driven by capital investment and is based on an roe of 10 35 and an equity ratio of 54 6 commission decision is expected in the first quarter of 2022 for the surcharge back to march 2021 as far as future filings go we anticipate filing a minnesota electric rate case in november with interim rates going into effect in january of 2022 we also plan to file a minnesota natural gas case later this year with that i ll wrap up with a quick summary we received commission approval for the mustang solar project and the allete wind ppa repowering buyout we provided an alternative to our minnesota resource plan which will deliver 85 carbon reduction by 2030 provide transparency into our long term opportunities we reached constructive rate case settlements in wisconsin new mexico and north dakota we filed our colorado electric rate case we reaffirmed our 2021 guidance range and finally we remain confident we can deliver long term earnings and dividend growth in our 5 to 7 objective range now before we open up for questions i ll turn it over to ben for some closing comments benjamin gwynn stonestreet fowke chairman chief executive officer well thanks brian and good morning everyone it s really been an amazing decade as ceo and before that as cfo i m really proud of the tremendous accomplishments we made as a company i m extremely proud of the incredible efforts and contributions our employees make in serving our customers and our local communities i ve also really enjoyed the interactions i ve had with our investors and the financial community i appreciate your interest in the company your feedback and your suggestions i m going to miss that now it s really hard to retire from a role that i ve truly enjoyed but i m leaving the company in great hands i know that bob brian and the rest of the management team will continue to do an outstanding job leading xcel energy well into the future i also plan on attending eei this fall and i look forward to seeing a lot of you there so thank you all and with that operator let s open it up for questions questions and answers operator and we ll take our first question from jeremy tonet from jpmorgan jeremy bryan tonet jpmorgan chase co analyst hi good morning ben congratulations and best of luck moving forward benjamin gwynn stonestreet fowke chairman chief executive officer thank you very much i appreciate it jeremy bryan tonet jpmorgan chase co analyst i just want to start off i guess with the renewables and if you could expand i guess on how the pipeline looks for incremental renewables after that sherco and wind repowering and also i guess how local stimulus efforts might influence this going forward robert c frenzel president chief operating officer director hey jeremy it s bob and thanks for the note this morning yes we filed resource plans in both colorado and in minnesota and as we work through those proceedings i d say by first quarter next year we ll have real visibility into the outcomes of both of those and we ll move forward with what we ll call resource acquisition plans where we propose projects and we solicit input from others for projects that are coming i think if your question is around where we are in the r r recovery plan in minnesota in particular the four wind repowerings were approved in december the allete repowering project was just approved in june and we still have the sherco solar project that is proposed that we hope for approval by end of this year or maybe early next jeremy bryan tonet jpmorgan chase co analyst got it that s helpful thank you maybe just pivoting over to uri if we could just want to see the early stages of your winter storm uri recovery proceedings how they re progressing and what changes if any do you expect operationally going forward robert c frenzel president chief operating officer director sure so we have approvals in i think four of our states at this point and we re still working through proceedings in three others i think the largest of those is both minnesota and colorado we re still working through the proceedings on as well as texas our expectation is we acted in accordance with all of our regulatory regulations prior policies and procedures and so we do expect a full recovery of our incurred costs on winter storm uri yes i think looking forward colorado has opened a docket to explore alternate mechanisms for us and others in the state to look at and they ve proposed an alternative we ve commented it s a nopr so they re looking for inputs and we ve commented to the nopr and we expect some resolution and some hearings in that process in the third or fourth quarter of this year jeremy bryan tonet jpmorgan chase co analyst got it that s helpful i ll leave it there thank you robert c frenzel president chief operating officer director thank you operator we ll take our next question from julien dumoulin smith from bank of america securities julien patrick dumoulin smith bofa securities analyst hey good morning congrats ben it s been a pleasure i will see you soon i m sure benjamin gwynn stonestreet fowke chairman chief executive officer thanks julien patrick dumoulin smith bofa securities analyst but if i can absolutely i look forward to seeing you at eei if i can pivot to the transmission side in brief here you all talked previously about this colorado being potentially expanded over time obviously you re looking for the first phase here to be approved as you talked about in the prepared remarks but can you talk about subsequent co ownership partners and just ultimately expansion of what you guys have underway here if there s been any progress robert c frenzel president chief operating officer director yes certainly happy to on transmission in particular in colorado we put forward what we think is a pretty progressive plan julien historically we d have generation be put forward first and then you d follow up with the transmission that s necessary i think where we are and certainly in colorado and where i think a lot of the country is actually is is we need to build a substantial amount of transmission to relieve congestion to enable the renewables that we see are necessary to complete this clean energy transition so in colorado we ve put forth what we call the power pathway that s largely i ll call it a super highway of transmission lines through the eastern plains of colorado to connect the good solar and wind resources of the eastern half of colorado with the load centers predominantly in denver and in the i 25 corridor so that path along with the colorado resource plan are progressing in parallel two separate dockets but in parallel we expect resolution on both of them by late this year probably early next year and your comment on we ve got a base plan and i call that sort of we re going to build the freeway but we also have to build the on and offramps and things like that so while the base plan for the freeway itself i think is about and brian correct me if i m wrong somewhere in the 1 7 ish billion range but we need to build voltage and var stability we need to build once we find out exactly where the generation resources are going to exist then we need to build support along that freeway for how those transmissions will integrate with the broader bulk electric system and that s sort of where that incremental and variation in sort of the base plan versus the other things that we ll need to do once we identify exactly where the resources are so like i just mentioned to jeremy we ll conclude the phase one of the resource plan in q1 of next year at that point we ll go into resource acquisition and that s where we picked the resource in exact locations and then we can have a better more granular answer to your question on what s the total pathway cost above and beyond sort of the base system does that make sense julien patrick dumoulin smith bofa securities analyst yes totally i get it excellent and if i can pivot to a slightly related question if you don t mind what are you seeing in terms of the impacts across your portfolio here vis a vis inflation cost structure logistics just as you guys look at your renewable build here and perhaps just some of the timing on for instance sherco here perhaps not necessarily related but just as you think about some of those decision making truths brian j van abel executive vice president chief financial officer yes hey julien it s brian good to hear from you yes certainly we re seeing inflation if you re just looking at the headlines right we re not immune to some of the headlines that everyone is seeing for us it s inflationary pressures of commodities such as steel copper and labor but really we think it s transitory in nature and i think really it s i think we found that it was pretty easy to shut down the economy and it s a lot more challenging to restart the economy from the supply chain and the demand that has followed the shutdown of the economy something that we are focused on and proactively managing from a supply chain perspective so i don t see any significant impacts as we sit here today now specifically if i want to touch on a couple of the major projects we have in flight now the four wind repowerings that we have we feel really good about those in minnesota now those are partial repowerings so i think blades in the inside of the nacelles we re not replacing the steel towers we re not facing steel price risk there and so we don t really face any significant inflationary pressures on those so feel good about that the large scale solar farm that we have in front of the minnesota commission i m sure everyone is aware of the solar panel pricing that has been increasing this year but we look at that we have a lot of flexibility in terms of construction and when we place that in service in terms of what year so we feel really good about that project too so overall something we re certainly focused on and watching but don t see any real impacts as we sit here today julien patrick dumoulin smith bofa securities analyst awesome and just to clarify from your guide here the shift in o m is offset by the gas sales just some more nuance there for 21 robert c frenzel president chief operating officer director the shift i would say gas sales certainly good to see an uptick in gas sales from 0 to 1 but if you remember gas is a pretty small piece of our business so a 1 change in gas margins is about 4 million so i wouldn t say it necessarily fully offsets it julien patrick dumoulin smith bofa securities analyst okay great thanks again guys unidentified speaker thank you operator and we ll take our final question from ryan levine from citi ryan michael levine citigroup inc analyst thank you a couple of questions one on transmission to follow up on some of those points it looks like in your presentation you highlight 300 million of cpcn for that project it looked like previously there was a 250 million number that was out there for the may valley longhorn expansion are you seeing cost inflation on that particular project or is there another dynamic that may cause the change in number robert c frenzel president chief operating officer director no look i think we re still in very early innings on sort of exact routings and pathways i wouldn t read too much into that ryan ryan michael levine citigroup inc analyst okay i mean are there a lot of different pathways that you re no pun intended around the way that that project can get built out or is it fairly visible from your mind in terms of how the project will be contracted robert c frenzel president chief operating officer director well look i think we haven t gone through local permitting we ve got a lot of just local land processes we ll have to go through so and we re early stages in engineering of that project i think we felt it was really important to make sure that the transmission and the generation proceeded in parallel and so i think that as we go through time as we get better engineering as we get better insight into the land processes those routes will be very specific there s still a pretty big range of capital expenditures for that a lot of it s based on final routing and final land approval costs so i guess then i wouldn t read too much into that particular leg extension ryan michael levine citigroup inc analyst okay and then lastly in terms of some of the recent legislation in colorado pertaining to gas are you anticipating any material impact to your business around some of the recent sb21 246 and the 1238 and 1286 and some of the others that have recently passed robert c frenzel president chief operating officer director can you repeat those again ryan that s quite a litany of bill numbers let me just i ll talk a little bit about the clean heat plan in colorado and maybe even to a parallel path the innovative gas act that was also approved here in minnesota look i think both of those bills recognize that we re in early innings of lowering our customers emissions from the gas ldc businesses and not dissimilar to what we went through in the mid 90s with renewables i mean the technology is nascent and the solutions are relatively expensive but we also recognize we need to start somewhere and so i think that the legislation in both places recognize those facts and look we are we ll do pilots we ll introduce technology we ll look at beneficial electrification and energy efficiency programs all tools that maybe aren t readily available under the current regulation schemes today but these pieces of legislation allow for some of that innovation to happen on the gas ldc side i think the legislation also recognizes it s really important to respect the reliability and affordability and i think each state addressed it slightly differently but there s a cap in colorado and regulatory approval for plans and in minnesota similarly their regulatory approval for the pilots that makes sure that they re cost justified and beneficial for our customers as well as we think about lowering their emissions profile from the gas ldc business so we re we were very active in both of those pieces of legislation and we are working with the regulatory agencies to look at how we write the regulations for those pieces of legislation and then we ll be active as we put proposals forward to help our customers reduce their footprint emissions profile in each state so yes i think there s opportunity here and we re going to continue to work with our commissions and our stakeholders ryan michael levine citigroup inc analyst alright i appreciate it operator it looks like we have a question from david peters from wolfe research david christian peters wolfe research llc analyst yes hey good morning i echo the congrats to ben just one question for me as you guys make progress working through your irps in colorado and minnesota and then the transmission opportunities as well it just seems like there s a lot of incremental capex opportunities above some of the more basic blocking and tackling just how would you kind of characterize that within the context of the kind of 5 to 7 growth targets you ve targeted here recently robert c frenzel president chief operating officer director david thanks for the question this is bob in terms of incremental capital yes i think there s some projects still out there that we re working through regulatory processes on the largest of which is the sherco solar which we talked about i think longer term we ve got base proposals on our resource plans and for our transmission planning stuff that s not included in the near term is obviously miso and spp transmission expansion plans and those are generally outside of our 5 year forecast but definitely in sort of a 10 year vision forecast and then we expect our base rate base growth plan to be right around 7 and so any incremental and i think there s a couple of incremental projects that could take us above that i think we d expect to keep our 5 to 7 earnings growth rate and we can reevaluate that regularly and we do but i think right now we re just comfortable with being at the high end of our guidance range brian j van abel executive vice president chief financial officer yes and dave i d just add to that i think what you hear from us what we re really focused on doing is providing our investors with that long term transparency as we work through our resource plans in minnesota and colorado this year looking at almost 10 gigawatts renewables by 2030 between those 2 plus the associated transmission that comes in colorado and what we could expect to see out of miso here is giving investors that transparency into extending and really feeling good about the long term growth rate not through this five but through and talk about it through the decade so something we re focused on yes and dave i d just add to that i think what you hear from us what we re really focused on doing is providing our investors with that long term transparency as we work through our resource plans in minnesota and colorado this year looking at almost 10 gigawatts renewables by 2030 between those 2 plus the associated transmission that comes in colorado and what we could expect to see out of miso here is giving investors that transparency into extending and really feeling good about the long term growth rate not through this five but through and talk about it through the decade so something we re focused on david christian peters wolfe research llc analyst great thank you for the operator and we have a question from paul patterson from glenrock associates unidentified speaker hey good morning paul paul andrew johnson vice president of investor relations hey good morning congratulations ben benjamin gwynn stonestreet fowke chairman chief executive officer thanks so much paul patterson glenrock associates llc analyst i want to absolutely so just there have been some comments out of colorado from some of the commissioners regarding rates and sort of the cumulative impact et cetera and you mentioned on the call i think that you don t see any significant you think that the inflation issues that we have currently are sort of transitory but i m wondering in terms of your goals and i think there s pretty much to be somewhat below the rate of inflation are we still on track with that with respect to your outlook in the various jurisdictions has there been any change in that because of the transitory impact or anything else that we should think about robert c frenzel president chief operating officer director hey paul it s bob and i ll let brian chime in if i miss anything but in particular with respect to colorado i think that our customers bills in colorado are about 1 3 35 less than the national average and have been basically flat for the past five years and although we filed a rate case out there we expect even after the rate case they re still going to be 25 below the national average brian j van abel executive vice president chief financial officer if we got everything we asked for robert c frenzel president chief operating officer director yes if we got everything in the case that we asked for they ll still be 25 below the national average but your longer term question is do we think we continue this transition to a cleaner energy economy cost affordably and the answer to that is yes and the impacts that we re seeing for inflation we would say are still relatively transitory i think some of the macro economists would sort of agree with that comment we think that we can transition our states at less than the rate of inflation over the next 10 years to an 80 carbon reduction colorado in particular will be 85 carbon reduction less than the cost of inflation so i think our strategic thesis holds and we don t see this current spat of restarting the economy as derailing our longer term plans brian j van abel executive vice president chief financial officer yes and i would say you see that in our resource plans right where we kind of show the bill impacts over the next decade in both colorado and minnesota and we do we run those resource plans in the cases we put forward to the commission with current tax policy and there s a lot of discussion in d c about a long term extension of federal tax credits around clean energy and we certainly support fully support senator wyden s clean energy for america act and when we run that analysis that s really good for our customers in terms of those extension of credits it only brings down the cost as we make this transition paul patterson glenrock associates llc analyst okay and just your long term just for obviously it could change but your long term inflation expectations are around 2 still is that about right brian j van abel executive vice president chief financial officer yes longer term paul andrew johnson vice president of investor relations ok awesome thanks so much guys operator and we have a question from ashar khan with verition ashar khan verition fund management llc analyst ben i just wanted to dial in to congratulate you known you for a long time and the company did wonderfully well and hope bob can continue in that spate so congrats again and if i can ask one industry question i know you ve been heading the eei and trying to get the nuclear ptcs across the board in the legislative front could you give us any update where we stand on that endeavor benjamin gwynn stonestreet fowke chairman chief executive officer well it will likely be part of the 3 5 trillion budget reconciliation process and there s a lot of moving parts with that the first part of that will be just getting the budget resolutions to the various committees and that will establish how much funding those committees have to pursue broad topics which we believe will ultimately include the nuclear ptc we like to see that in august and then of course the actual legislation would take place in the fall again there s a lot of moving parts as you know it s a 50 50 senate and a very narrow margin in the house so it s a balancing act but we are definitely advocating for that we re advocating as brian mentioned senator wyden s bill we think direct pay ptc for solar these are things that are going to really help the clean energy transition to be affordable for our customers and the industry in general and i look forward to seeing you perhaps at eei ashar khan verition fund management llc analyst certainly thank you so much you got it and it appears we have no further questions at this time i will turn the conference back over

net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding real estate related expenses including but not limited to gains losses from sales impairment adjustments and depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures our calculation of ffo is consistent with ffo as defined by nareit core ffo is a non gaap financial measure defined as ffo adjusted for gains from forfeited earnest money deposits and non recurring public company costs we believe the presentation of core ffo provides investors with a metric to assist in their evaluation of our operating performance across multiple periods because it removes the effect of unusual and non recurring items that are not expected to impact our operating performance on an ongoing basis affo is a non gaap financial measure defined as core ffo adjusted for gaap net income related to non cash revenues and expenses such as straight line rent amortization of above and below market lease related intangibles amortization of lease incentives capitalized interest expense non cash compensation expense and amortization of deferred financing costs historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time in fact real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions ffo is intended to be a standard supplemental measure of operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation and valuation adjustments from net income we consider ffo to be useful in evaluating potential property acquisitions and measuring operating performance we further consider core ffo and affo to be useful in determining funds available for payment of distributions ffo core ffo and affo do not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by gaap you should not consider ffo core ffo and affo to be alternatives to net income as a reliable measure of our operating performance nor should you consider ffo core ffo and affo to be alternatives to cash flows from operating investing or financing activities as defined by gaap as measures of liquidity ffo core ffo and affo do not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all of our cash needs including principal amortization capital improvements and distributions to stockholders ffo core ffo and affo do not represent cash flows from operating investing or financing activities as defined by gaap further ffo core ffo and affo as disclosed by other reits might not be comparable to our calculations of ffo core ffo and affo ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare we compute ebitda as earnings before interest income taxes and depreciation and amortization in 2017 nareit issued a white paper recommending that companies that report ebitda also report ebitdare we compute ebitdare in accordance with the definition adopted by nareit nareit defines ebitdare as ebitda as defined above excluding gains or losses from the sales of depreciable property and real estate impairment losses adjusted ebitdare is a non gaap financial measure defined as ebitdare further adjusted to exclude straight line rent gains from forfeited earnest money deposits non recurring public company costs representing consulting fees that we have incurred in preparing to become a public company and non cash compensation expense we present ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare as they are measures commonly used in our industry we believe that these measures are useful to investors and analysts because they provide supplemental information concerning our operating performance exclusive of certain non cash items and other costs we use ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare as measures of our operating performance and not as measures of liquidity 10 ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare do not include all items of revenue and expense included in net income they do not represent cash generated from operating activities and they are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements accordingly they should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or cash flows from operations as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of gaap financial measures additionally our computation of ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare may differ from the methodology for calculating these metrics used by other equity reits and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other equity reits noi and cash noi noi and cash noi are non gaap financial measures which we use to assess our operating results we compute noi as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding general and administrative expenses interest expense or income income tax expense depreciation and amortization gains or losses on sales of depreciable property gain from forfeited earnest money deposits and real estate impairment losses we further adjust noi for non cash revenue components of straight line rent and amortization of lease intangibles and lease incentives to derive cash noi we believe noi and cash noi provide useful and relevant information because they reflect only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and present such items on an unlevered basis noi and cash noi are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and our noi and cash noi may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies you should not consider our noi and cash noi as

paulo kakinoff chief executive officer good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to gol airlines earnings call i m paulo kakinoff chief executive officer and i m joined by richard lark our chief financial officer this morning we released our second quarter figures also we made available on the company s investor relations website three videos with the results presentation financial review and preliminary q a we hope everyone has watched them as we will now only make a few brief considerations and then move to your questions the second quarter 2021 was marked by three relevant themes for gol s sustainable growth going forward first the resilience of the brazilian air travel market demand for travel in brazil is recovering rapidly as a result of the consistent decline in covid 19 cases and fatalities since june 24 with a reduction of more than 2 per day in new transmissions registered in the country and with the reduction in all brazilian states brazilian government has guaranteed that 173 million shots will be delivered in the fourth quarter an increase over the 143 million doses made available in the first half of 2021 anyway there will be enough vaccines to completely vaccinate approximately 90 of all brazilians over 12 years old second gol s discipline yield management led the company in a continuous and very agile manner to preserve the equilibrium between capacity and demand in the second quarter keeping its load factors and use high and minimizing cash burn in the second quarter 2021 gol systematically presented a market efficiency superior to its competitors which reinforces our commitment to balancing the size of the supply with the predictive demand forecast third goes back to continuing it sustained growth based on our expectations for the vaccination roll out in brazil we anticipate that business travel will show a sharp recovery as of the first quarter 2022 when that happens we will increase the gol network to enable high frequencies in the sao paulo rio de janeiro and brazilian markets restoring those routes to pre pandemic levels gol will also resume international flights to south american and u s destinations with discipline and following the restrictions and compliance rules of each country with that i m going to hand you over to richard who is going to take us through some financial highlights richard lark chief financial officer thanks kaki a comprehensive financial review for the quarter was shared with the video presentations this morning we believe you all had a chance to access them in summary gol s adjusted ebit in the second quarter totaled brl44 million corresponding to a margin of 14 which shows the restoration of the operating margins necessary to support operational growth adjusted ebitda reached brl222 million with a margin of 22 reflecting gol s successful sustainability efforts in balancing supply and demand the net debt ratio excluding exchangeable notes and perpetual bonds to adjusted last 12 months ebitda was approximately 10x on june 30 2021 representing the lowest financial leverage among its peers even in an atypical year gol stands out among few airlines for repaying approximately brl6 billion in debt since the beginning of 2020 due to its disciplined liquidity management and its ability to extract value from current asset this strategy enables gol to focus on growing with profitability leaving the crisis with a lighter and stronger balance sheet compared to its competitors the equity issued for the reintegration of the smiles loyalty program together with the capital increase led by the controlling shareholders totaled approximately brl1 billion in new equity capital during the quarter the resumption of the market toward the normalization of demand already points to future margins of consolidation opportunities in the airline sector the agreement the gol signed for the acquisition of map airlines is in line with this trend and appears as a rational moves to strengthen our business model and increase the generation of value for our shareholders now i would like to return to kakinoff paulo kakinoff chief executive officer thanks rich i would like to close by thanking for our employees the team of eagles who are leading with care clarity and confidence resulting in successful management throughout the crisis and placing the company in a solid position in resuming its operations we reiterate our confidence as we have done over the past months that the company will emerge as stronger and even more resilient as markets normalize we remain salary committed and optimistic through the diligent management of our balance sheet and our operations throughout the recovery now i would like to initiate the q a session questions and answers operator thank you the floor is now open for questions the first question comes from mike lindberg with deutsche bank please go ahead mike linenberg deutsche bank analyst hey good morning paulo and rich just a few questions you ve provided a lot of detail in the slides about the recovery in demand and the rise on vaccinations and the reduction in transmission rate for the second half of the year though you did scale back the redeployment of capacity it s somewhat modest and maybe it s nothing more than a recalibration or even maybe acknowledgment that the business travel recovery will not really occur in earnest until the first part of 2022 is that what s driving that moderation of supply for the second half of the year can you provide some color on that thank you paulo kakinoff chief executive officer hi michael thank you very much for your question actually i could summarize that decision like in flight toward profitability strategy because we are pretty confident on the demand recovery this has been ok pretty explicit since the vaccination program in brazil took off and gained traction which is happening right now so every day we do see that there are more demand about to come mike linenberg deutsche bank analyst okay paulo kakinoff chief executive officer but also you need you to carefully read what are the current pressure on costs that we are facing i mean the exchange rate is it still playing against our cost structure we have the jet fuel prices pretty high so we need not only demand to recover but we need also a healthy fair level to be achieved and we will not depart on any market share driven strategy just to prevail our position i believe that we need to consider increasing our disciplined way to keep capacity balance with the demand so this is basically a clear measure to recover as soon as possible our profitability and therefore we are cautious about how we will deploy our capex and we have translated that into a more modest outlook regarding the number of flights that we are supposed to operate in the second half of this year and it has some impact in our revenue outlook so we are pretty bullish on the demand recovery we believe that the brazilian immunization program will be successfully developing as it has been today but the industry as a whole needs to recover the margins and therefore we are need to be more cautious about that movement and the competitors richard lark chief financial officer mike in addition to that there s a yield component in there also because the slower return of the large corporates which is a much higher yielding customer the large corporates today are not really present in our booking curve we expect for them to start coming back august september and to be back more strongly in the q4 and then fully in the q1 but as a yield component in that revenue guidance also that we initially went out and i think we re one of the few companies airlines in the world who actually put guidance back on for the second half of this year there was an assumption of a stronger return and faster return of the court large corporates which goes into the yield and we have as kaki was saying we have a quality focus on the revenue it s not just about revenue it s about high quality revenue and our yield growth in the q2 that were just behind us now was because of this dynamic capacity management and so in the q3 and the q4 there is a dynamic happening there where the q4 yields will be much more driven now by the returns of the large corporate and the q3 yield is going to still be more in the vfr leisure category and we are increasing in the q3 leisure routes in the northeast brazil with more connections but it has a lower yield and so the adjustment on the volumes also is in function of this focus on a high quality yield not just for revenue sake and i think that shows up in how we ve been managing our yields through this pandemic versus the market we re more focused on the quality and preserving the future revenues and so we re not cannibalizing future revenues to create receivables we re keeping the booking curve very short which is where the demand is and when the large corporates come back that booking curve will lengthen out another way i could say it as well we re as much as possible trying to save our future inventory for higher profitability and keeping it managed close to our vest if you will paulo kakinoff chief executive officer and michael i really appreciate your question because it gives us the opportunity to better share our view on how the market is developing right now from a more holistic point of view i think that the company is taking the right decision in proceeding so while we are also protecting our liquidity and our balance sheet i mean translating had to predictable actions once we are we have been able to achieve both important targets keeping liquidity and protecting our balance sheet while we are amortizing our debt and fulfilling our financial obligations it s important to notice that we are doing that having only 60 of the revenue that we used to get pre pandemic so ahead of us there are several fortress of our company those could unleash important potentials that we cannot utilize at the moment we should give you an example so we are pretty strong on the corporate business the corporate network and at the moment that demand is pretty reduced and also you know our business model to form the lowest cost in the industry basically because we have a standard fleet based upon a high utilization model we cannot access those benefits considering the current market size and even though we have been able to keep liquidity and protect the balance sheet so ahead of us we have a more than promising outlook considering that the demand is about recover and corporate levers will resume travels sometime in the near future we are not considering the first quarter 2022 meanwhile we will keep ourselves disciplined in deploying exactly the same strategy we will not increase our capacity over a healthy demand level this is hopefully clear to you as an answer to your question mike linenberg deutsche bank analyst kaki and rich that s great color thanks on that it s obviously very refreshing to hear that you re focused on margin rather than market share just a quick second one here just news out that american has made a minority investment in jetsmart does that open up any sort of opportunities with gol and a carrier that has a pretty good footprint in spanish speaking south america any thoughts on that thank you paulo kakinoff chief executive officer michael we know that it has a very strong partnership with american airlines and we do believe that that movement is part of their strategy to enhance their already strong footprint in the region and that might be also promising to our partnership considering that this stronger american will be in the region also the more attractive we will be our offer so i wouldn t like to speculate on any possible further top in our partnership but we do welcome that movement on american airlines in seeing further investing in our region mike linenberg deutsche bank analyst thanks kaki thanks rich paulo kakinoff chief executive officer thank you very much operator the next question comes from dan mckenzie with seaport global please go ahead dan mckenzie seaport global analyst hey guys thanks for the time here it s kind of a big picture question here gol really does seem like it s going to be a different airline in this next cycle so maybe you could just help us connect the dots on kind of before and after gol gol before versus gol after so big picture what s new in this next cycle we ve got the smiles transaction we ve got map we ve got fleet modernization we ve got a relationship with american airlines a switch from navitaire pardon me and then i think we ve got positive gdp in brazil for the second time in a decade so if investors were to collectively overlay these kind of the new gol on your 2019 results what kinds of pre tax margin earnings or upside would it have potentially driven i guess is really one question you ve unpacked some of these for us previously but i guess really what i m getting at is the potential here for better margins better free cash flow as we look ahead one to three years paulo kakinoff chief executive officer hi dan definitely we too are under a stressful situation given by the market circumstances the covid is still out there the demand is too much below pre pandemic levels but we cannot disguise our i d say satisfaction by testing our company through a very challenging period and getting out of that desk noticing how robust and resilient our business model is and that is pretty clear when you take into consideration the way chosen by our company to deal with the covid 19 so we took the path of negotiating with every single stakeholder it was demanding to say the least but we successfully came to well balanced deals where basically every single stakeholder employees suppliers the lessors even the customers considering that they were also affected by the network reduction that we were forced to implement and now that clearly the worst portion of this desert crossing is already behind us we see several promising prospective ahead of us exactly those ones you have mentioned in your question the company is like under the worst possible circumstance the worst possible scenario and we are more than strong we didn t lose the opportunity to further enhance our well tested and proven successful model being refined already for more than 20 years you can imagine that we are now even leaner than we were before we have even more efficient processes in places we didn t stop to invest in further developing our digital platform the data analytics structure the fleet renewal so taking into consideration our recent past this company went through a tough scenario much earlier than covid 19 we ve got the max grounding we got the pico constraints we we ve faced the brazilian exchange rate devaluation things can always get worse considering the external factors considering the circumstances but it s reasonable to believe that the future periods are likely to be much better than the combination of those circumstances that i have just mentioned and once the company is at the level that we are right now and we have a much better future ahead of us considering those external factors it s just a matter of time to unleash that potential the company is now in a much better shape it s not actually shaped to be pre affirmative in saying that we definitely are stronger than we were before having this pandemic in place and the company now didn t capture most of the benefits of having a significant number of new technology planes available in our operation we are just we have and 77 max in our fleet at the moment you know how fast we are about to renew our fleet and this is just one of the meaningful benefits that we are about to get i think we are happy due to the way we have managed this crisis protecting everyone companies jobs employees stakeholders investors our liquidity paying our debt obligations and what we have ahead of us it can be everything but something not promising this is exactly where we are right now well prepared and well positioned to capture what s about to come richard lark chief financial officer and maybe just a complement a couple of things there maybe just from an asset liability perspective both pre pandemic post pandemic pre pandemic as you know we spent the better part of three years dealing with the max issues the max grounding core loans a lot of pain and suffering with the asset side of the equation just getting through some distractions here in the window outside of our conference room here so post pandemic that s all behind us in fact as you know we re pivoting here in the next couple of months we re pivoting to an acceleration of the fleet transformation from the ngs to the maxs and so as we kind of roll into 2022 we ll be kind of where we wanted to be three years ago from an asset perspective and back with our more normalized activities of transitioning in new aircraft and transitioning out the old aircraft the average age of the gol fleet has kind of creeped up over the last three or four years to be about three or four years higher than we normally would want to have it so from an asset perspective we ll be back reorganized in that perspective and there s a lot of equity value creation in that regard on the liability side we will be better than we came into this pandemic we emerged 2019 as far as 2020 basically steering few times leverage down the barrel for last year then the pandemic happened but we didn t postpone any of our work on the liability management side on the balance sheet side of the equation in fact we intensified it the second quarter was a line for us we finalized the take in of the minority interest of smiles that liability was eliminated at very good economics for everybody involved and we also if you go just on the debt side of the equation since the beginning of 2020 up until now our company has amortized brl6 billion of debt there is only one remaining piece in our capital structure which is pretty much our only short term debt which we ll finalize that into q3 so by the time we get to post pandemic we not only will have significantly reduced the debt of our company we will also have reprofiled the entire network max significant debt maturity is 2024 and all that work continues during the pandemic so both from an asset perspective we corrected the asset problem we had which is you re kind of stuck for the next two to three years with the ng generation of the fleet now we re going to go back to accelerating transition from the ng to the maxs which has significant cost reductions significant equity value creation for our business in the way we do it and then on the liability side of the equation we re pretty much done that work has been completed there is a final piece to be completed here in the q3 but everything pretty much there is according to plan and so there is a lot of significant there s not a late bit value creation going back to the first part of your question that is going to necessarily transform into pre tax earnings and even post tax earnings obviously you see the exchange rate variation swings in our net results we ve always recommended to kind of put on the side and if you remember conversations we were having back in 2019 we are focusing everybody on our earnings generation earnings guidance in fact there was one analyst i think it was the first guy to publish this morning he was all talking about earnings which for me was a sign of relief to finally see sell side analysts talking about earnings as opposed to the other issues and that s the focus that we want but in terms of how that would translate into the actual numbers i would kind of point to what we were guiding you guys back in 2019 in terms of the parameters of our business in terms of margins and growth i just gave you a long answer the short answer to that question would be a normalized post pandemic pre tax margin of around 10 that s the number that comes out of how we managed the structure the operating structure and the financial structure of our business that s kind of the spot that we d look for and we re in a much better position that s what we were kind of guiding you guys in 2019 pre pandemic we re in a much better position now just the smiles taken on its own has the potential to increase those pre tax earnings by brl400 million a year and that will be starting to get phased in here in the third quarter that s done already the max the transition to the max is obviously phased in over three to five year period but on an aircraft to aircraft basis that s roughly a 15 reduction in tasks that gets phased in and that s structural both of those things that i just mentioned there just to cite a very few are structural and so the gol after the pandemic as kaki were saying will structurally be better than the gol pre pandemic and barring certain equation you know structurally in brazil we are a little bit waiting for the large we re not waiting method here for the large corporates to come back because they re the most affected by the dynamic related to the pandemic but structurally brazil given our raw material you mentioned this a little bit on the gdp side of the equation in brazil we re not like u s high end services economy or europe high end manufacturing economy we are primarily a raw materials economy with a little bit of low end manufacturing and it s a very large country with those productive elements spread off spread out across a geography the size of the 48 states and so there is a huge necessity for air travel to make brazilian gdp happen and so we ll go by the way of brazilian gdp structurally oil and gas sector agribusiness sector real estate sector infrastructure sector all those sectors are primary large corporate clients right now are traveling with us so when that springs back that immediately going to fixes the only kind of if you will balance sheet problem we have right now which is we re missing about brl0 5 billion of accounts receivables and those get back on the balance sheet immediately and eventually probably by the q1 would transform into an effective an additional brl1 billion of receivables when we get back to kind of a run rate of call it brl1 billion a month of sales that will going to translate into an overall receivables balance of about brl1 5 billion that s the only kind of piece that s missing from the management of our business right now like you said we kind of managed the business over the last almost now 18 months without that using our current other current assets and using the other tools that were available to us and at the same time operating with two pretty simple directors one was to emerge after the pandemic with the unit cost lower than we entered and we ve achieved that and number two keep the financial equilibrium to get to get us through this pandemic and pre pandemic it was kind of matching if you will revenues with expenses during pandemic it was matching cash inflows with cash outflows this is same management we were doing pre pandemic and obviously we need a lot of support we were also able to use the capital markets to provide some additional long term capital the controlling shareholder did a capital increase i think we re the only airline maybe with the exception of aleris that during this pandemic has done a capital increase so all those things already done are behind us and so we are a little bit waiting for the large corporates to come back now which we ve articulated about what our views on that but the work on the balance sheet was pretty much done pre pandemic we kept the final phases of it during the pandemic the work on the assets we had to wait for the the max situation to get resolved that s resolved and our pivoting back to that kind of what you guys were used to seeing in the first cycle of goal with all this value and cost reduction we are created creating when we did our first order of of boeing aircraft but thanks for that question because i think i think that s it s definitely where our focus is i think we kind of started our pivot in the q2 there was an effect of the second wave here as kaki mentioned the the vaccination in brazil is gaining huge momentum you re already seeing the governor of the state s followers already pretty much signaled he is going to turn off all restrictions and sao paulo is the economic engine of brazil the state of sao paulo is about one third of brazilian gdp so that s going to have a huge ecosystem effect on the country so we will have the jitters for elections that will start to pop up toward the end of the year we still have a little bit excess volatility on the currency a part of this will be affected by the currency many of the questions that we ve been getting on the results a lot of it is explained by currency and oil prices obviously we manage those within yields and risk management but those are obviously determined by this global scenario as the world ramps back up there matt i mean everybody watched the powell s comments yesterday so i won t repeat those but there s a lot of pieces that are missing in the economic system that has to get replenished here for things to get back to normal and brazil is going to benefit from that because we re a supplier in that dynamic including our oil prices benefits brazil currency is always a bit of a question in terms of how we re going to appreciate a weekend but it seems like all the signs there for a weakening dollar which would also benefit our business but maybe that that s just kind of what i would wrap around that short answer was 10 pre tax margin the long answer is what i just so thanks for that question dan mckenzie seaport global analyst understood no i appreciate the comprehensive answer the second question here is far simpler just sort of a housecleaning question the number of maxs that are on firm order coming in 2022 i guess is one housecleaning question and then secondly i know you said that the liability management is behind you is there the opportunity to optimize the cost of the liabilities i guess as you think about the cap structure the cost of your debt to optimize that as you become more profitable is there the possibility to lower interest rates with refinancings and thus drive some non operating earnings leverage as well over the coming one to three years richard lark chief financial officer yes on the right side of the balance sheet question that you asked a couple of comments one is that we have not deviated from our financial policy targets we kind of know what our rate cost of debt is our rate cost of equity and we picked our moments even though the stock goes up and down the bond prices go up and down if you look at the moments where we ve raised the capital they ve been at moments that fit in our policy so we don t see a big benefit of doing any refinancing i guess all the debts that we ve gone out we ve got maturities 2024 2025 2026 our convert is effectively a 3 coupon for us our 2025 maturity is effectively a 7 coupon for us and the secured deal we did which effectively came in around 8 it s still a reasonable number in there that the 2026 which is an 8 there has been moments flashes in the pan where we ve been kind of looking at gee maybe we could do a 6 long term financing for gol but it s always at the peak of the market in terms of our structural long term liabilities in the capital markets that makes sense yes we would always look at so activity we ve done bond buybacks over time we got the perk out there we gradually whittled away at that pre pandemic if you go back to january of last year we were thinking about just the perk actually we re starting to look more like debt than equity at that point in time just given where brazilian interest rates where and we are thinking about paying it off but remember the aircraft the main chunk of our liabilities now going forward are going to be aircraft related secured aircraft financing our entire toolbox was available to us in terms of the export credit guaranteed facilities which are effectively cost of borrowing for like 85 ltv on those assets and about 45 for year end out it s hard for us to do much better than that most of our activity on the financing side now and going forward is going to be on secured aircraft financing which is in the very low single digits and on the brazilian real side of the equation there we just go with the local market rates the only significant local working capital liability we have today is the debenture that generally said is a good low rate locally the only thing i didn t mention there is kind of the medium term stuff which generally relates to engine overhauls and import financings what you see in our balance sheet that generally kind of follows market rates and their kind of rollover working capital facilities again just so you understand how we re thinking about it we also have significant collateral available that we now have given that we own 100 of our loyalty program which if we wanted to tap into that to raise some long term money at the appropriate time that could potentially be a source of anywhere from 300 million to 500 million of additional liquidity for us if we needed to do it and the only question mark there and i purposely did not mention it because we don t have any plans to do it is using the equity instrument that we have gol continues to be the most liquid stock in your latin america universe we have a strong controlling shareholder you saw what we did in the q2 with the capital increase and so we re very disciplined and limited on what we do on the equity side of the equation i think that would be something we would only consider very much post pandemic in terms of having a fair value for the equity of the company as you know also now we re an independent in terms of not having a strategic equity partnership with any strategic partners and so obviously that possibility is also open for us as well as we would think about it but those kinds of use of proceeds if it was an equity related use of proceeds if there is no liability management for us left to do so those would be focused more on growth and investment and for us growth in investment is 95 is going to be aircraft related which is going to be demand related and what we re doing at point there but with that i kind of wanted to shift it back to your question on the maxs because whatever we re going to be doing there is going to be linked in to what we re doing in asset acquisition which is effectively maxs paulo kakinoff chief executive officer yes and then we are considering to get over the next 18 months something between 20 to 30 aircraft i mean it s likely that we will be more to the top of the range maybe even as valuable but just to give you something ballpark numbers dan mckenzie seaport global analyst that s helpful thanks for all the time you guys paulo kakinoff chief executive officer thank you operator the next question comes from savi syth with raymond james please go ahead savi syth raymond james analyst hey good afternoon if i might as a follow up to going to dan s question on max delivery how are you thinking about the ng returns and what s the typical kind of return cost for an ng paulo kakinoff chief executive officer hi savi actually we have been pretty successful in negotiating dealing with the lessors in order to get new planes replacing old contracts so that s one of the advantages of renewing the fleet at this moment so we didn t utilize that resource pre pandemic and now we have the opportunity to address the necessity to return some ngs through new contracts being dealt with the same glasses they have been pretty supportive and also interested in doing in so the ng has proven again its liquidity in the market so we have demand for our old aircraft and the deals that have been discussed or already negotiated with some lessors are showing that we do not face additional difficulties in renewing the fleet replacing the current energies is by the new max those aircraft both actually are great planes they are demanded by the markets and we are also making the most out of the effective prices that we do have in our contract that s why at the same time that the long lasting relationship with most of the lessors are bringing to us effective deals to replace those richard lark chief financial officer all of our aircraft return future aircraft return costs are already provisioned in the balance sheet the accounting rules require you fully provision all aircraft redelivery costs in your balance sheet so they re already if you will they re already expenses paulo kakinoff chief executive officer right that s a very important topic there are no surprises on the road with regards to the returning class savi syth raymond james analyst that s helpful i appreciate that as you think about the 20 to 30 maxs coming over the next 18 months are we assuming half the replacement half the growth or how should we think about the net suite view here paulo kakinoff chief executive officer this is difficult we are replacing but you know the other contract it gives the flexibility to rapidly adjust the number of aircraft in operation following the demand so we have protected our capability to either increase or reduce within the months period the size of our fleet and is those are the tools we will definitely utilize whenever needed either to increase in a very fast way the number of aircraft we are operating or further reduce in case that we would be facing any kind of possible crisis political economic or whatever could come this is important to you to highlight our ambience we got to use along the last 20 years to make this is in brazil this is possibly one of the most volatile markets in the world considering the different scenarios we are facing from time to time due to political or economical circumstances so one of the most important assets of our business model is that how fast we can adapt ourselves following the circumstances savi syth raymond james analyst i appreciate that and if i might if this is a long response we can catch it offline but since these power by the hour set ups are somewhat new i was just wondering what s the economic consideration of flying an aircraft how do they differ when you have a power by the hour versus a kind of a regular lease i understand with the power by the hour you don t have to pay unless you re flying it but does that give it a hurdle to actually fly i was just kind of curious with the differences in economic incentives are between the two types of leases richard lark chief financial officer overall we just focus on cask and so we either do a finance lease or a sale leaseback or direct operating lease it s all how that s going to impact our unit cost in our particular case at gol airlines we use that tool as a way of managing our fleet during this pandemic as i mentioned before pre pandemic we spent about almost all three years with the issue with the maxs to meet demand we had accumulated around 34 aircrafts that are on the short term leases were basically buying us time to get to the resolution of the max problems pandemic hit that became and asset because of the short term nature of those contracts and that allowed gol to negotiate very favorable terms with leasing companies which involved mark to markets power by the hour and deferrals in the power by the hour calculation in the power by the hour construct in our case and it is a goal we calculated on average how many aircraft we are going to need at the end of the pandemic which was minus we returned around 15 aircrafts during this pandemic so we did do a downsizing one of the few airlines in our market that returned aircraft number one number two then we calculated how many aircraft on average we were going to have to keep on the ground until things normalize post pandemic those are the aircraft that we then negotiated to convert into power by the hour probationally we re paying a very low fixed monthly cost and we only pay if we fly the aircraft because we also have a very high degree of seasonality here in brazil where in a normal year we would do over 1 000 flight in the peak months of january and july as well as 600 flights in the low months so we have a huge seasonality so in our case we use the power by the hour tool to be able to keep aircraft on the ground without burning cash as opposed to having to return those aircraft and then resource them on the other side of the pandemic and so we preserved our ability to rapidly ramp up and follow demand here over the next couple of months as corporate demand comes back and what i m saying also applies to flight crews we did not fire any technical people pilots and flight crews we did a deal with the unions that transform about half of those fixed costs into variable costs as well the same thing with our fleet effectively what we did with our fleet is we we transformed about 50 of it into variable cost same thing with the labor so that when we ramp up we can call back that labor and we don t have to go on and hire pilots or hire aircraft so for us it was a way of avoiding aircraft returns and extra aircraft returns which also has cash outflow as it relates to the returns stagnating that and also disconnecting employees that we would need back on the other side of it so for us both of those tools were just a way for us to kind of manage this valley of the pandemic it s not something that we normally were doing in our company we did have over the 20 years we did sometimes have power by the hour contracts but it was just at special situation it s generally not where it s flying to everything we re doing is always focused on minimizing the cask without much consideration for the cash component during the pandemic we had to prioritize the cash component in the short term so that s why we in our particular case i think be careful different airlines use different constructs on that for us it was a way of managing our assets so we wouldn t have to cut the assets during the pandemic and then pay expensive rates to rehire those assets post pandemic that was like one of the tools that we use okay savi syth raymond james analyst that s super helpful thank you both richard lark chief financial officer what i would do is we have confidence with the switch to our portuguese language we have one question on the webcast platform which i ll just read here and answer it it s from which is one of our equity partners can you comment on the increase in and cask and cask ex fuel in the q2 in comparison with the q1 what are the reasons basically on the operating side of the equation q1 to q2 we had a 5 reduction in stage length which is a function of how we are managing the network and so that obviously a 5 reduction in the stage lengths has a corresponding lower dilution of the overall costs and then there was a slight increase in nim s expenses as it relates to some of the things that we re talking about preparing aircraft for the ramp up we ve been spending money having expenses to get aircraft ready for growth in q3 and q4 as well as the transition from the ngs to the maxs that s on the ex fuel side of the equation on the fuel side of the equation from q1 to q2 we had about a 20 increase in the average price for jet fuel based on what s going on with international oil prices so those are the main reasons for that with that i think we will finalize the questions and in fact we will just give the closing remarks paulo kakinoff chief executive officer yes i just would like to thank you again for your attention and mainly for the great support along this crossing because you all have paid a huge attention to every single staff that we have taken and always giving us your calls to clarify our strategy so i just would like to thank you very much for your support and attention so far thank you have a nice day operator duration 57

with that i ll now turn the call over to keith keith allman president chief executive officer thank you dave good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today i hope everyone is staying safe and healthy we performed exceptionally well in the second quarter and demand for our products was strong this resulted in our fourth consecutive quarter of double digit sales growth and sixth consecutive quarter of both margin expansion and double digit earnings per share growth i m extremely proud of our entire team as we successfully navigated numerous supply chain challenges to enable this growth for the quarter sales increased 24 excluding acquisitions divestitures and currency sales increased 18 operating profit increased 27 and margins expanded 60 basis points to 20 1 principally due to strong volume leverage earnings per share increased an outstanding 34 our overall performance demonstrates the strength of our portfolio of lower ticket repair and remodel products that are diversified across geographies and channels serving both the consumer and the professional turning to our plumbing segment sales increased 48 excluding currency led by exceptional growth from our north american and international faucet and shower businesses and our spa business international plumbing grew 50 in the quarter excluding currency as hansgrohe sales rebounded sharply in nearly all of its markets strong operational execution and new products such as hansgrohe s rainfinity shower systems led to share gains in many of these markets new product introductions will continue as we launched the award winning axor one collection in the second half of the year this collection was designed by barber osgerby an award winning internationally acclaimed london based industrial design studio this continues hansgrohe s legacy of combining leading contemporary design with innovative functionality north american plumbing posted strong growth of 47 excluding currency in the second quarter led by approximately 75 growth at watkins wellness and robust double digit growth at delta delta faucet delivered another record quarter with growth across all channels and particularly strength in the professionally oriented trade channel we continue to invest in new products in north american plumbing as well and two days ago we introduced a frank lloyd wright collection by brizo that furthers the brand s commitment to distinctive design and innovative products lastly in plumbing at the beginning of july we acquired steamist another bolt on acquisition for delta steamist is a leading manufacturer of residential steam bath products that will complement our strong trade and e commerce product offering and is consistent with our bolt on acquisition strategy in our decorative architectural segment sales declined 5 against the healthy 8 comp for the second quarter of 2020 while bath and cabinet hardware lighting and propane grew in the quarter demand moderated for diy paint material availability and other supply chain issues also impacted our overall coatings business as nearly all of our resin suppliers were operating under a force majeure declaration during the second quarter because of these issues sell through on our coatings products was better than sell in and inventories in the channel were reduced during the quarter due to lower than expected second quarter sales and our expectation that material availability issues will persist but slowly improve we are lowering our diy sales expectation from flat to down low single digits for the full year however with the acceleration we saw in our propane business in the quarter we are incrementally more optimistic and are raising our expectations to low double digit growth from high single digit for the full year for our propane business for the decorative segment overall we now expect growth to be in the range of 2 to 5 for the full year with respect to innovation in the decorative segment we continue to invest in new products and are excited to launch a new high end line of paint in the third quarter at the home depot called behr dynasty for both diy and pro painters dynasty is our most durable stain resistant scuff resistant one coat hide paint ever it s low voc greenguard and leed certified fast drying and has an anti microbial mildew resistant paint finish this is yet another example of how our innovation teams continue to focus on the voice of the customer to deliver leading innovation and value for both the consumer and the professional moving on to capital allocation we continued our aggressive share buyback during the quarter by repurchasing 6 6 million shares for 447 million as part of the accelerated share repurchase agreement that we executed during the quarter we will additionally receive approximately 900 000 shares in july to complete that agreement bringing our total shares repurchased year to date to 13 1 million shares for 750 million this is approximately 5 of our outstanding share account at the beginning of the year underscoring our strong financial position and confidence in the future we now anticipate deploying another 250 million in the second half of the year for share repurchases and acquisitions for a full year total of approximately 1 billion finally like i did last quarter let me give you an update on what we are experiencing with inflation and supply chain tightness we continue to see escalating inflation across most of our cost basket including freight resins tio2 and packaging inbound freight container costs nearly tripled during the quarter we now expect our all in cost inflation to be in the high single digit range for the full year for both our plumbing and decorative segments with low double digit inflation in the second half of the year inflation in coatings will likely be in the mid teens later in the fourth quarter to mitigate this inflation we have secured price increases across both segments and are taking further pricing action across our business to address these continued cost escalations we re also working with our suppliers customers and internal teams to implement further productivity measures to help offset these costs despite the increased inflation we still expect to achieve price cost neutrality by year end while cost inflation has clearly been an issue material availability has also impacted our business our teams have done a tremendous job of qualifying new suppliers developing material substitutions and shifting production to adapt to this dynamic environment and to serve our customers however these raw material constraints have limited our ability to build inventory of many of our products and the channels that we serve we anticipate material availability to slowly improve in the second half of the year and we expect to replenish inventory to the appropriate levels over time the demand for our products remains strong and with an improved outlook for plumbing based on the continued strength of both our north american and international operations we are increasing our full year expectations of earnings per share to be in the range of 3 65 to 3 75 per share up from our previous expectations of 3 50 to 3 70 with that i ll now turn the call over to john for additional detail on our second quarter results john john sznewajs vice president chief financial officer thank you keith and good morning everyone as dave mentioned my comments today will focus on adjusted performance excluding the impact of rationalization and other one time items turning to slide 7 we delivered another exceptional quarter as we capitalized on strong consumer demand resulting in continued growth and increased backlogs as a result sales increased 24 with currency and net acquisitions each contributing 3 to growth in local currency north american sales increased 15 or 12 excluding acquisitions strong volume growth in north american faucets showers and spas led this outstanding performance in local currency international sales increased a robust 50 or 49 excluding acquisitions and divestitures gross margin was 36 3 in the quarter up 50 basis points as we leverage the strong volume growth our sg a as a percentage of sales improved 10 basis points to 16 2 due to our operating leverage during the quarter certain expenses such as headcount marketing and travel and entertainment increased as planned we expect sg a as a percent of sales to increase in the third and fourth quarters as these costs normalize we delivered strong second quarter operating profit of 438 million up 94 million or 27 from last year with operating margins expanding 60 basis points to 20 1 our eps was 1 14 in the quarter a 34 increase compared to the second quarter of 2020 due to volume leverage lower interest expense and lower share count turning to slide 8 plumbing growth accelerated in the quarter with sales up 53 currency contributed 5 to this growth and acquisitions net of divestitures contributed another 4 north american sales increased 47 in local currency or 41 excluding acquisitions delta led this outstanding performance delivering another quarter of robust double digit growth with a strong brand recognition and market leadership delta continues to drive strong consumer demand across all its product categories and channels watkins wellness also significantly contributed to growth in the quarter with both demand and our backlog remained strong international plumbing sales increased 50 in local currency or 49 excluding acquisitions and divestitures hansgrohe delivered robust growth as demand continues to improve across europe and numerous other countries hansgrohe s key markets of germany china uk and france all grew strong double digits in the quarter segment operating margins expanded 230 basis points to 20 6 in the quarter with operating profit of 274 million up 115 million or 72 the strong performance was driven by incremental volume favorable mix and cost productivity initiatives partially offset by an unfavorable price cost relationship and higher spend on items such as travel and entertainment marketing and growth initiatives during the quarter we also completed the divestiture of huppe a small shower enclosure business based in germany huppe sales were approximately eur70 million in 2020 this transaction closed on may 31 and net proceeds were not material given our second quarter results and current demand trends we now expect plumbing segment s sales growth for 2021 to be in the 22 to 24 range up from our previous guidance of 15 to 18 finally due to our improved sales outlook we are increasing our full year margin expectations to approximately 18 5 up from our previous guide of approximately 18 turning to slide 9 decorative architectural declined 5 for the second quarter and was 6 excluding the benefit from acquisitions diy paint business declined double digits in the quarter against the healthy high teens comp due to moderating demand and raw material supply tightness as resin plants affected by storms in the texas gulf coast region in the first quarter continued to face production challenges we expect these raw material headwinds to persist in the third quarter and now anticipate our diy paint business to be down low single digits for the full year to help mitigate these challenges we are working with our existing suppliers and qualifying new sources for materials to meet the demand of our customers which remains strong i want to thank our supply chain teams which have done an outstanding job managing through these challenges our pro paint business delivered strong double digits growth in the quarter as consumers are increasingly willing to allow professional paint contractors in their homes we expect demand in this channel to remain strong and now anticipate low double digit growth for the pro paint business for the full year up from our previous expectation of high single digits as pro paint contractors order books continue to grow our builders hardware and lighting businesses each delivered growth in the quarter as they continue to capitalize on increased consumer demand segment operating margins were 22 1 and operating profit in the quarter was 188 million due to lower volume partially offset by cost productivity initiatives for full year 2021 we now expect decorative architectural segment s sales growth will be in the range of 2 to 5 down from 4 to 9 due to lower than expected second quarter sales and persistent raw material constraints we continue to expect segment operating margins of approximately 19 as productivity initiatives in pricing help offset higher input costs turning to side 10 our balance sheet is strong with net debt to ebitda at 1 3x we ended the quarter with approximately 1 8 billion of balance sheet liquidity which includes full availability of our 1 billion revolver working capital as a percent of sales including our recent acquisitions was 16 9 an improvement of 120 basis points over prior year as we discussed last quarter we terminated and annuitized our u s qualified defined benefit plans in the second quarter and had an approximate 100 million final cash contribution to the plans to complete this activity this removes approximately 140 million of pension liabilities from our balance sheet and it will benefit our free cash flow by approximately 50 million through reduced cash contributions starting in 2022 also we received approximately 166 million from the redemption of our preferred stock related to the recent sale of our former cabinet business finally as keith mentioned earlier as of today we repurchased 13 1 million shares in 2021 for 750 million we expect to deploy an additional 250 million for share repurchases or acquisitions for the remainder of this year collectively these actions demonstrate our confidence in our business and our commitment and ability to further strengthen our balance sheet while aggressively returning capital to our shareholders turning to our full year guidance we have summarized our updated expectations for 2021 on slide 11 based on our second quarter performance and continued robust demand we now anticipate overall sales growth of 14 to 16 up from 10 to 14 with operating margins of approximately 17 5 up from 17 lastly as keith mentioned earlier our updated 2021 eps estimate range of 3 65 to 3 75 represents 19 eps growth at the midpoint of the range this assumes the 252 million average diluted share count for the full year additional modeling assumptions for 2021 can be found on slide 14 in earnings deck with that i ll now turn the call back over to keith keith allman president chief executive officer thank you john we had an outstanding second quarter driven by our strong brands our innovation pipelines and most of all our people as demonstrated by outstanding execution by our supply chain teams our strong performance demonstrates the strength of masco s balanced and diversified business masco is a broad portfolio of lower ticket repair and remodel oriented home improvement products our products are broadly distributed across geographies and channels for both consumers and professionals additionally our markets remain strong and we expect home remodeling expenditures to drive growth in 2022 the fundamentals of our repair and remodel business are strong with year over year home price appreciation of over 15 in may and existing home sales up over 23 both metrics have a strong correlation with our sales on a lag basis and the consumer is strong with nearly 2 trillion in savings and an increased desire to invest in their homes lastly we continue to invest in our business and are well positioned for long term growth we are bringing new innovative products to market fueling our growth and expanding our leading market share and with our leading margins and strong free cash flow we will continue to deploy capital to reinvesting in our business acquiring complementary bolt on companies and returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases all to drive long term shareholder value with that i ll now open up the call to questions operator questions and answers operator in order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question and one follow up question during the q a session your first question comes from the line of matthew bouley with barclays matthew bouley barclays analyst good morning everyone thank you for taking the questions i could start on i guess diy coatings it sounded like you re attributing the reduction in the revenue guide more so to supply chain than to a real change in your demand outlook i think you said sell through was better than sell in so if you could just provide a little more color on that i guess that you found that demand in diy specifically is really not that different than what you previously thought or do you think the consumer is pulling back a little bit more than expected there as well thank you keith allman president chief executive officer matt i would say that demand did moderate a bit more than we expected but certainly material availability and other supply chain challenges have played a role in the decline in the quarter and of course we had some tough comps the impact of the storms in texas and the gulf coast region continue to limit resin supply really this is an industrywide phenomenon and nearly all of our resins as i mentioned were suppliers who were operating under a force majeure declaration in the second quarter there was a plant explosion in addition at a supplier that supplies our acrylic resin but really for the industry but that affected us so we do expect while they re not over yet we do expect these material availability issues to persist in the third quarter and then slowly improve so we now expect as i mentioned our sales growth to be in the range of 2 to 5 down from our previous expectation of 4 to 9 i would like to reiterate that our supply chain teams have done an outstanding job and they ll continue to do so matthew bouley barclays analyst understood really helpful color there thank you for that second one is on a similar topic but just thinking about raw material constraints broadly it sounded like it really did constrain your ability to build inventory beyond just paint if i heard you correctly perhaps paint was most acute but i m curious if you could outline kind of where else beyond paint that you think demand may have been running ahead of what you were able to produce and maybe any color around the timing of when you think you can catch up from a production perspective thank you keith allman president chief executive officer it s been pretty broad based i think we d like to have more inventory in our channel to put it very directly when we think about spas we have never had a backlog of this size and spas and demand continues to be real robust we re doing a good job in our international front but there s pockets in certain products where we could afford to have some more inventory in the channel the same is true in north american plumbing and we re getting in better shape we re not all the way there yet but we do expect to throughout the back half of the year put our inventory positioned in the channel back to where they belong matthew bouley barclays analyst great well thanks for the color operator your next question comes from the line of susan maklari with goldman sachs susan maklari goldman sachs analyst thank you good morning everyone keith allman president chief executive officer good morning susan susan maklari goldman sachs analyst my first question is around you mentioned that as a result of some of the supply chain issues that you are seeing inventories that are obviously continuing to fall and are really lean in the channel can you give us some sense of what this means in terms of your ability to get those inventories back up and is it something that potentially could kind of bleed into early 2022 now as we think about all the headwinds that are out there keith allman president chief executive officer it s difficult to prognosticate on the future we ve seen more than just the texas gulf issue that we had in resins there was a plant explosion as i mentioned but i would tell you that we intend over the back half of the year to get our inventory back in shape susan maklari goldman sachs analyst okay all right my next question is around the margins in the plumbing segment you ve delivered about 20 5 or so in the first half of the year there the guidance though implies that the second half will come down relative to the first half and understanding that you ve got some price cost headwinds in there and things but can you just give us some more color on how we should be thinking about that relative step down and any thoughts on third quarter versus fourth quarter in there and some of those trends john sznewajs vice president chief financial officer yes susan it s john maybe i ll take this one so you re right we obviously delivered very strong margins here in the first half of year and then in the second quarter as well given our guide it does imply a little bit of a step down in margin in the back half of the year we re pleased with how we ve executed so far but as we ve mentioned on previous calls we do need to put some money back into the business in the form of investments and they ll take the form of travel and entertainment as i mentioned but they ll also take the form of some growth initiatives and you may recall in some of our prior calls we said that we thought in 2020 that we may have delayed as much as 40 million of investment spend just to make sure we appropriately contain costs as we were going through the pandemic and so we see things begin to improve here significantly we continue to expect that some of that spend will return as i mentioned in my remarks some of that spend actually started to return in the second quarter as we began to make some investments in marketing and growth initiatives so we believe that a lot of that spend will start to come back in the second half of the year and that will take additional investment in our leading brands some of the innovation that keith mentioned in his prepared remarks and in service to ensure that our customers are in full supply of our products and so we think that will also contribute to future growth of the business to better meet our customers needs at the same time as we kind of alluded to on our prepared remarks there s going to be a little bit of a price cost headwind as we go into the back half of the year we ve always talked about a little bit of a lag in getting and price in cost flowing through our p l in general even in the plumbing segment it s about a two quarter lag and so that s the second piece that will impact the margins in the back half of the year so those two a little bit of an incremental spend and then also that price cost lag that said we are very confident that we ll be price cost neutral as we exit the year susan maklari goldman sachs analyst okay that s very helpful color thank you and good luck operator your next question comes from the line of ken zener with keybanc ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst good morning everybody keith allman president chief executive officer good morning ken ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst so amazing environment you guys are operating in could you talk to obviously there was a larger coatings company that reported is there a way for you to talk to or quantify how supply inventory is affecting your coatings business whether it s diy or pro and then are you seeing because of those constraints are you seeing channel shifts at all within the pro perhaps because of those types of constraints or limited availability of coatings keith allman president chief executive officer well i would say that our inability to have our inventory position where we want it say first half compared to what we expect in the second half had an impact on revenue i m going to fall short of going down specifically quantifying ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst understood keith allman president chief executive officer but we think that inventory is going to help us in the back half in terms of channel shift we pride ourselves on having broad distribution across multiple channels when you look at our you re talking coatings now but if we look at plumbing we have a very strong position in retail which is both a pro and a consumer channel we have a leading position in trade which is principally more oriented toward the pro and then in e commerce which is mainly consumer we have a leading position there similar story when we look at coatings where we have a strong pro franchise as well as we always talk about the strong diy so we like our positioning of where we are in terms of broad channel distribution so that if there are particular shifts be it pro to diy or online to trade et cetera we have it covered and i think that s a good significant reason why we re able to perform in this dynamic environment in addition to our strong teams that have been able to address these issues where our customer wants to buy and we re quite agnostic to these kinds of shifts if they happen john sznewajs vice president chief financial officer ken the one thing i add to keith s comment is specifically to pro we ll continue to invest in that pro initiative we think that s a really strong growth driver for us over the course of the next several years and we and our channel partner the home depot look to continue to invest to grow the pro paint business ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst yes just sticking with that and it s a simple question it seems like there might be higher margins from pro versus diy and could you kind of describe it seems like these paint initiatives i know you always have them but the scuff i think is how you described it and then when behr did the primer and paint in one coating that was quite a leadership introduction do you think these latest like the scuff and some of the pro stuff is really able to pull in more demand on that pro due to the quality compared to perhaps other competitors thank you keith allman president chief executive officer we re really proud of the behr product development teams research and development we have been on the leading edge of development really since that company started paint and primer in one was a big one we also work on commercial development as it relates to the color selection center and being able to match colors and those sorts of things so this dynasty introduction is one of another of a long line of things that we have demonstrated the ability to do and we ll continue to do whether or not this is going to be as groundbreaking as paint and primer in one we ll see but this is our best paint ever no question about it in terms of scuff resistance the number of one coat hides that we have the coatings that we have on in terms of mildew and antibacterial and all those other sorts of things so this is a very big deal for us and i m extremely proud of it and i m also it s what we expect and also what we re going to continue to do ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mike dahl with rbc capital markets mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions keith john i just wanted to first a quick follow up along the same lines of kind of the cadence that was asked about margins i guess side specifically with respect to dec arc is the thought given some of the supply constraints you re talking about that 3q ends up looking a little similar to 2q and then a bit of a rebound in 4q or should we expect more even performance between 3q and 4q because it seems like overall the back half is expecting plus or minus flat in that segment john sznewajs vice president chief financial officer yes mike good question so as we look at the back half of the year we think it s going to be a pretty even performance across the last six months based on what we re seeing out in the marketplace based on supply that keith was just talking about and understanding how seasonally things fall through in terms of demand so it looks to us right now like a pretty even back half mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks and my second question is on capital allocation it s great to see that the buyback and the increased guide it does seem like just broadly speaking there s been an uptick in m a i was wondering if you could comment about just specifically in your segments there seems like there may be some assets that shake lose what are you seeing in the pipeline and what are you seeing in terms of competition for deals because it seems like right now your guide is still predicated mostly on buybacks keith allman president chief executive officer really mike not a whole lot of change in terms of what we re seeing it s been pretty similar to what we ve seen now for the better part of the year what we have and what we re doing here at masco is we have a new deal team and we have a new business development team that s been moved under john s leadership and they re building momentum clearly and doing a good job both in terms of cultivation as well as executing the deals the valuations i would say as is broadly understood and seen is still quite high compared to historical averages and that really i think informs and was a key driver of our strategy of focusing on bolt ons where we need to have synergies so the pipeline is robust we re moving various assets through that pipeline in terms of evaluation we continue to do that and it continues to look robust having said that we re patient and we will make sure that these acquisitions are the right strategic fit for us like you see with work tools international or with kraus in plumbing on the e commerce side that bolsters our leadership in that channel so we re going to continue with our strategy we ve got an outstanding team that s working it and we expect to continue with this type of deal flow john sznewajs vice president chief financial officer mike maybe just a couple of extra comments to supplement keith s i would say that the three acquisitions that we did at the end of last year are all on plan so the working teams the integration has gone well the interaction with our existing businesses have gone very well and so they re right on the business case and so we re very very pleased with those results and maybe some as keith was talking about there s a lot of activity the pipeline is robust and part of the reason we ve been playing at the lower at the smaller bolt ons is we see better value down there at this point as keith mentioned very very robust pricing in some of the larger transactions that have been received in the industry and so we just think there s better value at the lower end of the middle market right now and so we re going to continue to play down there mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay good to hear thank you operator your next question comes from the line of phil ng with jefferies phil ng jefferies analyst hi good morning everyone i guess a bigger picture looking out to 2022 you do have tougher comps certainly a lot of favorable secular drivers do you see your growth algorithm returning back to that mid single digit range for the overall company next year and how do you think about growth in your diy paint business next year keith allman president chief executive officer well there s no really returning to the growth algorithm we haven t changed it our long term growth algorithm is the same it s 3 to 5 organic growth 1 to 3 acquisition growth we re committed to buyback in that range of 2 to 4 of our shares and that puts us into that 10 eps growth through cycles on average plus the dividend yield of 1 to 2 so 11 to 12 return on our name so that hasn t changed and we believe strongly in that we believe that we will do that and execute that from the 2021 levels and we ll do it in a way that we continue to expand our margins and as we ve talked before we re not talking multiple hundreds of basis points of margins improvement but we continue to have very solid drop down in both of our businesses call it in that 25 to 30 range and we don t see that changing and we re going to continue to generate strong free cash flow and reinvest that in our business and return it to the shareholder in a very careful manner that drives shareholder value so no real change in our algorithm and we expect growth to continue what we re seeing in our product demand continues to be strong and as i ve talked about consistently and continued to believe and we re seeing it the millennial entry into the home market moving out of the more congested cities into larger homes as families form et cetera is a real deal and that s a tailwind for us phil ng jefferies analyst any color on the outlook for diy next year john sznewajs vice president chief financial officer yes phil i guess from my perspective i think of it more of a as a low single digit growth for diy because of the trends that keith just cited i do think that there s good fundamental underlying demand out there driven by these trends and so returning to that kind of pre pandemic which we were guiding low single digit growth for diy is what we expect for next year phil ng jefferies analyst that s super helpful and then any color on how your channel is performing we ve seen some data points out there that suggest retail might be seeing some normalization of trends after a pretty strong year and perhaps a pickup in wholesale just curious what you re seeing out there in terms of the channels and what that means for masco appreciating you re very diversified keith allman president chief executive officer well that s probably a good question for our channel partners but i ll tell you that in general we re seeing strong demand across the board certainly in plumbing we maintain our leadership in the retail space very strong position and strong growth in trade international we ve seen broad pickup across our international businesses particularly in our main markets in central europe and in china so that s strong so it s really broad based in terms of demand drivers channels geographies john sznewajs vice president chief financial officer yes phil maybe a little bit more color to keith s comments i d say demand s probably strong growth spread has been a little bit stronger on our trade side of our business partly because if you think about the second quarter last year most of those outlets were closed and so that growth here in the second quarter has been quite strong so maybe just a little bit more color there for you phil ng jefferies analyst okay super helpful guys operator your next question comes from the line of deepa raghavan with wells fargo securities deepa raghavan wells fargo securities analyst hi good morning everyone thanks for taking my question i ll start out with a broad question as things start to return to normalcy post covid especially in the last month and a half or so any trends or any markets that surprised you to the positive or perhaps under paced your expectations we can start there keith allman president chief executive officer on the positive of our international growth is really solid and that was nice to see and probably i would say even a little more robust than we expected so that was broadly speaking that was positive in terms of the overall deepa raghavan wells fargo securities analyst okay any trends that underpins your expectations john sznewajs vice president chief financial officer i d say deepa there s a couple of things that continue to i think trended favorably for us the demand response has been consistently strong over the course of the last several quarters and that demand continued here into q2 and so we ve got a good look for the balance of the year of the business and then even like we just mentioned our north american trade plumbing business was extremely strong and e commerce as well those trends continue to remain very strong for us so we re very pleased with how the businesses are performing pretty much across the board here in the second quarter keith allman president chief executive officer in terms of the on the downside i think it was a little lower than we had thought there was some significant supply chain constrictions that we didn t anticipate but our pro paint was stronger than we expected so when we look at say where we re going to finish 21 compared to 19 in paint we re still up mid teens so it s healthy the demand is strong but i would say diy paint is a little lighter than i thought it would be deepa raghavan wells fargo securities analyst got it my follow up is on the price cost equation how much of the inflation that you re talking about in 2021 you are going to take into 2022 given the lag should we think about on price cost heading into 2022 would turn positive like early 2022 probably turns positive price cost am i right in thinking that way and how much is there a quantification of how much inflation you re carrying into 2022 if you snap the line here on inflation thanks john sznewajs vice president chief financial officer yes deepa we probably won t go into that level of specificity that you re requesting on how much we carry into 2022 but to your general point as we look going to 22 we see a little bit of tailwind because pricing costs have moderated if they indeed just stay at the current levels yes that s definitely a possibility as we go into the first part of next year keith allman president chief executive officer i think the main point we d like to make and leave with is price cost neutrality at the end of the year and by that i mean that we will have actions in place for activity improvements working with our suppliers to drive cost down material substitutions and of course price we will have that in place at the end of the year that matches the inflation that we re currently seeing so to your point about snapping the line at the end of the year we ll be price cost neutral deepa raghavan wells fargo securities analyst got it that s pretty helpful thanks so much operator your next question comes from the line of keith hughes with truist keith hughes truist analyst thank you within decorative architectural products could you just comment on the performance of kichler or liberty hardware and just any kind of growth number you re seeing from them in the quarter and expectations for the second half john sznewajs vice president chief financial officer yes keith both liberty and kichler grew in the second quarter so this continuing trend will resume as we laid out at our investor day in 2019 particularly for kichler we kind of identified 2020 is the year for it to return to growth and that s exactly what s going on in that business through the end of the second quarter so we feel good about how kichler and jay are driving that business and so we re pleased with that as we look in the back half of the year you may recall on our third quarter call last year we did cite the fact that liberty had a very very strong quarter and so they re going to be up against some tough comps as they go into the back half of the year that said the team down at liberty is looking to continue to drive that business and we re pushing them for growth so we ll continue to see how that plays out but we do know that they ve got a very tough comp here in the third quarter coming up keith hughes truist analyst okay and the final question i know we ve talked about inflation a lot but if you based on your expectations right now in 21 if we add up all the pricing you ve got all the raw material price that you re seeing will price cost in dollars in 21 be negative i know the run rate it sounds like it s going to be but what about for the full year keith allman president chief executive officer keith i would guide you to think that we will be negative because as we ve been saying we think we will be price cost neutral toward the end of the year so i think we ve got a little bit of price cost to absorb here in the back half of the year before we get to that neutral position and so because of that and because what we experienced in the second quarter we will be price cost negative for the full year keith hughes truist analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of david macgregor with longbow research david macgregor longbow research analyst good morning everyone you mentioned the investment back into the product and into the marketing i m just wondering on diy as we head into a period of tougher compares how are retailer expectations evolving if at all with regards to your level of promotional channel support keith allman president chief executive officer again that s a decision that s made by our channel partner and obviously we support that and we develop that strategy together but ultimately it s their decision i would say that our promotional activity is about the same and will finish out this year at about the same as it was last year generally speaking our channel partner likes to compete on quality and service and brand because we re leaders in all three of those categories and i don t see that changing much david macgregor longbow research analyst okay and then second question just with respect to pricing how much pricing should be achievable i guess through just new product introductions it sounds like you ve got a pretty substantial new product introduction calendar lined up here just wondering how much pricing you should be able to get from that as opposed to the price increases on legacy products keith allman president chief executive officer it varies across category and it really is from a segment or from a channel there s differences but i think if you think about it in terms of general price increases across all of our categories for the year in the high single digit range for the full year i think that s where we will be and then in terms of new products it s really not so much a price increase it s really pricing for value and it depends on new products some of the new stuff that we re coming out in the high end with axor that i talked about in my prepared remarks and in brizo that is a very high price segment that has good margin with it in other cases where we re launching in a leaner maybe a lower price point segment there wouldn t be as much let s say pricing if you will so it varies but clearly the lifeblood of our system here is innovation and we continue to drive that as you heard from all of our new product introductions that we have in play at the moment and that will continue david macgregor longbow research analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of garik shmois with loop capital garik shmois loop capital analyst great thanks for taking my question i m just curious on the pro paint side maybe a little more qualitative but is there a sense that that segment is back to normal levels given the constraints of the pandemic last year and homeowners letting contractors into their homes keith allman president chief executive officer yes it feels to us garik like it s at normal levels and is continuing to grow that s what we d like to see out of that business and so we feel like we re in really good position to continue the growth of that business as we continue to invest in feet on the street in relationships with contractors and getting more share of wall with the existing contractors so we feel really good about how that growth is developing here garik shmois loop capital analyst okay thanks and then just on the watkins just given the strength that we saw in the quarter i know you had headwinds last year given the production issues in mexico and some of the regulations that the government was putting in place there due to covid just any color if you re back to normal it seems like you are and just the capacity in watkins and what the plan is there just given the strength in the business keith allman president chief executive officer yes we re definitely starting to get back on our feet and the production system is dialed in and we re continuing to increase our output but boy demand is strong and our backlog continues to be at record levels i think as we have the aging population in america and clearly a more tuned in population as it relates to overall wellness both physical emotional and mental health this is a tool that really aced that so we think there s some fundamental tailwinds here and as we do across our entire business we look at capacity and capacity expansion and i would expect that we will be adding capacity here garik shmois loop capital analyst thanks again operator your next question comes from the line of adam baumgarten with zelman adam baumgarten zelman associates analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my questions just curious on the paint side with raw materials it wasn t a major callout this quarter how impactful were higher raw materials in 2q and is the way to think about it that the back half is going to be where you feel the brunt of the increases keith allman president chief executive officer yes so there is a modest headwind in q2 but the more impactful part of the price cost relationship will be felt in the back half of the year adam on that one i think we re continuing to see escalation in costs not only in the resin side but on tio2 and packaging and transportation and logistics has been going up so there s a lot of cost pressures that we re seeing there but as we continue to say we do think they will continue to have pricing conversations and we do believe we can exit the year at a price cost neutral level adam baumgarten zelman associates analyst got it thanks and then just sticking with paint you gave last quarter in 1q diy was up in the teens you kind of talked about double digit declines in 2q can you give us what that looks like year to date just so we can kind of forecast for the back half keith allman president chief executive officer year to date i don t know if i ve got those numbers at my fingertips john sznewajs vice president chief financial officer we re thinking about down low single digits for the year adam baumgarten zelman associates analyst okay thanks operator your next question comes from the line of eric bosshard with cleveland research eric bosshard cleveland research analyst in the decorative architectural segment curious on the sell in expectations in the back half of the year i don t know if you could comment if you thought you d make progress on inventory in the back half but do you expect to ship in more and is that how does that link between your ability and the demand from your retail customers to bring in more inventory keith allman president chief executive officer that s directly linked it s the relationship between the retail demand and the pos and our production capabilities and as we believe these challenges will get relieved over the course of the year we ll be able to build inventory in the channel we re going to benefit from the dynasty load in eric bosshard cleveland research analyst so the net of that mean that you re you commented that the sell in was less than the sell through in the second quarter for that to reverse in the back half of the year or for you to make that up in the back half of the year or what should we expect in terms of the relationship between those two keith allman president chief executive officer yes that s right we do expect to build inventory in the back half eric bosshard cleveland research analyst okay that s helpful and then secondly in terms of this sell through momentum in paint for the back half of the year is the expectation that it looks similar to the experience of 2q or that it improves relative to 2q how should we think about that john sznewajs vice president chief financial officer yes i think it would be similar to q2 eric from what we re seeing right now in the market perhaps up a little bit maybe even a little bit better in the second half eric bosshard cleveland research analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of stephen kim with everscore isi stephen kim everscore isi analyst yes thanks guys i just want to clarify one thing with respect to your comment about sell through being a little bit better than sell in typically when you ve got supply shortages and lack of inventory on the shelves there s a sense that demand is materially better than what you were able to provide but you actually said that you thought that demand had weakened in diy more than you had thought and so i was curious as to how you know that how did you know the demand moderated if you didn t have actually enough product to sell and so you actually feel like you could have sold more if you had more product just trying to reconcile those two was it that you had an inventory decline particularly severe in like your most popular categories but then in some other skus you just simply undersold your expectations just trying to understand that a little bit better and where you think the customers actually bought if they didn t buy your product because it seems like these are industrywide supply chain challenges keith allman president chief executive officer yes there was a slight impact of lost sales due to lower inventories but i don t think we were missing a ton of sales due to stock out conditions so my point on the inventory sell through mismatch is that there s an opportunity for us to build inventory and to have better service but i m not so sure i wouldn t tag a whole lot of lost sales onto the inventory position it s more of an inventory being lower than we want certainly there was some of that but not a whole lot stephen kim everscore isi analyst okay that s clear thank you for that and then secondly keith you talked about how there s a lag historically to home price appreciation into r r demand but clearly if there s any one particular metric in the housing market that has completely blown away any historical comp it is the home price appreciation the rapidity of it the broadness of it and the magnitude that we ve seen already and i m curious as to how you think the impact on r r may be different as a result of this abruptness in magnitude do you think that it may manifest itself a little bit more quickly do you think it may manifest itself more at the high end or certain large ticket versus smaller ticket just wondering if you could give us some color on how you re thinking about that now keith allman president chief executive officer well i think a couple of things for sure when a family asset in their home is worth more they re more likely to spend to remodel it now when you look at the effect of covid and i think that while certainly there is some waning impacts that will go away there are some impacts here that are staying and that is really how we believe the consumer is viewing their home that there will not be a 100 return to work and the environment of the home is different people are doing more things in their home they re doing them differently and they re spending more time in their home so we think there s a couple lasting things here in that these are catalysts and part of the reason why we re so robust and so happy with how we ve positioned our portfolio with regards to our price point where we enjoy small projects do it yourself and we re clearly part of the large projects that are done by the professional we re in markets in europe that are falling off and we re obviously well penetrated here in north america so the home price appreciation is a very strong indicator of a robust diy market as is the changing view of the consumer as it relates to the purpose of their home stephen kim everscore isi analyst great i appreciate it thanks guys operator your last question comes from the line of michael rehaut with jpmorgan michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst hi thanks i appreciate you squeezing me in clearly an interesting quarter i was curious a lot of focus on the paint side i was hoping to get a little bit more breakout of the north american plumbing business if you could talk to and i apologize if i missed this earlier in the call talk to the trends that you ve seen in retail maybe things closer to the diy spectrum versus wholesale channels and how the trends have progressed there maybe comparing it to obviously the diy and pro in paint keith allman president chief executive officer well real strong trade business for us this past quarter and we expect that to continue people are more comfortable with pros coming into their home for longer time so we re in the throes of the pandemic maybe you d let an appliance repair person in for a quick repair but you certainly wouldn t want someone in for a major remodel that s changing and that principally not totally but principally flows through our trade channels so we re seeing a nice pickup in the trade channel having said that the dynamic more and more pros buying in retail is very real certainly seen good foot traffic in retail and our e commerce business continues to do very well and our acquisition as john spoke about of kraus is really going well we ve continued to invest in that for example we just launched delta branded sinks online utilizing the kraus offering with the delta brand that s real leverage and that s going well so as i said in my prepared remarks we are seeing broad based solid market demand in growth international domestic trade retail e commerce we re really hitting on all cylinders michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst okay i appreciate that maybe just for the second question to take a step back i was hoping maybe you could just give us a sense of the e commerce as possibly as a percent of revenue across your two different segments obviously it lends itself a lot more to the plumbing side decorative and in particular paint a heavier product maybe more difficult to ship but maybe just give us a state of where you are in both segments and where you think you might be able to take the business over the next two or three years john sznewajs vice president chief financial officer yes michael it s john and you re right e commerce has been a good growth vehicle for us over the course of last several years and actually it s grown quite significantly so if you think about 2019 our e commerce sales as a percent of our total sales were roughly 5 and in 2020 that grew nicely we finished 2020 at about 9 and if you break that down by segment our plumbing product sales were roughly 12 on e commerce platform or channel and as you might expect and you kind of alluded to in your question a little bit lower than that in the decorative architectural segment about 4 because of all the things you cited color selection s a challenge for people still to order paint online though we do have i would say the behr team has done a nice job of investing in shipping and distribution and fulfillment and so that s not going to be a limiter to our ability to transact online it s more of the consumer choosing to select the color online than anything else and as we look forward we think we re well positioned to continue to grow our e commerce presence because if you consider selling products they re packaged perfectly to ship onesie twosie to consumers as they order their faucets or showerheads online and so we think we re in a great position to do that the folks down at delta have done a great job of adding the capability to jackson distribution center to fulfill online so we feel really good about how we were set to serve plumbing growth going forward and to the extent that the paint continues to become more sought online we re well positioned to continue to fulfill there as well so we really like how we re set up as this trend continues to grow here in north america michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst great thank

smashing earnings estimates has a funny way of inspiring investors to hit the buy button what happened after inching 2 5 higher last week shares of nucor nue 0 85 are downright soaring so far this week since the market s close last friday nucor s stock is up 9 7 as of the market close on thursday the primary driver for the stock s climb this week is the company s second quarter 2021 earnings report while management s auspicious outlook for the third quarter and the congressional support of the infrastructure bill are also contributing to the stock s rise so what beating analysts top line estimate of 8 31 billion nucor reported revenue of 8 79 billion for q2 2021 last week it was the bottom of the income statement however that probably played a greater role in spurring investors to continue picking up shares over the past few days in mid june nucor provided q2 2021 earnings per share eps guidance of 4 60 to 4 70 slightly higher than the analysts estimate of 4 52 surpassing all expectations nucor reported a company record for its bottom line eps of 5 04 presumably the company s record won t last too long in its press release announcing the q2 2021 results management forecast a new company record would be set in q3 nucor president and ceo leon topalian said we expect to set a new record for quarterly earnings in the third quarter of 2021 as demand remains robust and virtually all the steel end use markets that we monitor are growing the company s q2 2021 earnings and the guidance for q3 aren t the only factors pushing the stock higher with momentum building for the 550 billion infrastructure bill it s likely that investors are choosing to pick up shares of the self proclaimed most diversified steel and steel products company in north america now what with nucor turning in a record performance in q2 and suggesting it ll do the same in q3 it s hardly a shock that the stock is flying higher this week despite the gain though shares still seem reasonably priced trading at 9 3 times operating cash flow a discount to the five year average multiple of 9 9 consequently investors interested in picking up exposure to this leading infrastructure company can still do so at an attractive price

energy corporation and consumers energy company thanks sri and thank you everyone for joining us today it s great to be with you and we thank you for your continued interest and support i m going to start today with the end in mind strong quarter and a great first half of the year giving us confidence as we target the high end of the guidance range rejji will walk through the details of the quarter and i ll share what the strong results mean for 2021 earnings needless to say i m very pleased an important gene sale of enerbank at 3 times book value moving from noncore to the core business with a strong focus on regulated utility growth the sale of the bank provides for greater financial flexibility eliminating planned equity issuance from 2022 to 2024 and in the end reggie will share how we have reduced our equity issuance need for 2021 in today s remarks furthermore with the filing of our integrated resource plan you can see the path for more than 1 billion into the utility again without equity issuance not only is there visibility to that investment that s certainly in the time line for review i m excited about this irp it s a remarkable plan many have set net zero goals we have industry leading net zero goals and this irp provides a path and is an important proof point in our commitment we are leading the clean energy transformation it starts with our investment thesis this simple but intentional approach has stood the test of time and continues to be our approach going forward it is grounded in a balanced commitment to all our stakeholders and enables us to continue to deliver on our financial objectives with the sale of enerbank and the plan to exit coal by 2025 our investment thesis gets even simpler but now it s also cleaner and leaner we continue to mature and strengthen our lean operating system the ce way which delivers value by reducing cost and improving quality ensuring affordability for our customers and our thesis is further strengthened by michigan s supportive regulatory construct all of this supports our long term adjusted eps growth of 6 to 8 and combined with our dividend provides a premium total shareholder return of 9 to 11 all of this remains solidly grounded in our commitment to the triple bottom line of people planet and profit as i mentioned our integrated resource plan provides the proof points to our investment thesis our net zero commitments and highlights our commitment to the triple bottom line by accelerating our decarbonization efforts making us one of the first utility in the nation to exit coal or increasing our renewable build out adding about eight gigawatts of solar by 2040 two gigawatts from the previous plan furthermore this plan ensures reliability a critical attribute as we place more intermittent resources on the grid the purchase of over two gigawatts of existing natural gas generation allows us to exit coal and dramatically reduces our carbon footprint existing natural gas generation is key and like we ve done historically with the purchases of our zeeland and jackson generating stations this is a sweet spot for us where we reduce permitting construction and start up risk it is also thoughtful and that is not a 40 to 50 year commitment that you would get with a new asset which we believe is important as we transition to net zero carbon and yes on other hand our plan is affordable for our customers it will generate 650 million of savings essentially paying for our transition to clean energy this is truly a remarkable plan it is carefully considered and data driven we ve analyzed hundreds of scenarios with different sensitivities and our plan was thoughtfully developed with extensive stakeholder engagement i couldn t be more proud of this plan and especially the team that put it together we ve done our homework and i m confident it is the best plan for our customers our coworkers for great state of michigan of course you our investors to hit the triple bottom line the integrated resource plan is a key element of michigan s strong regulatory construct which is known across the industry as one of the best it is a result of legislation designed to ensure a primary recovery of the necessary investments to advance safe and reliable energy in our state michigan s forward looking test years and the three year pre approval structure of the irp process is visibility on our future growth it enables us and the commission to align on long term generation planning and provide greater certainty as we invest in our clean energy transformation we anticipate an initial order for the irp from the commission in april and a final order in june of next year the visibility provided by michigan s regulatory construct enables us to grow our capital plan to make the needed investments on our system on slide six you can see that our five year capital plan has grown every year our current five year plan which we ll update on our year end call includes 13 2 billion of needed customer investment it does not contain the upside in our irp the irp provides a clear line of sight to the timing and composition of an incremental 1 3 billion of opportunity and as i shared on the previous slide the regulatory construct provides timely approval of future capital expenditures i really like this path forward and beyond our irp there is plenty of opportunity for our five year capital plan to grow given the customer investment opportunities we have in our 10 year plan our backlog of needing investments is as vast as our system which serves nearly seven million people in all 68 counties of michigan s lower peninsula we see industry leading growth continuing well into the future so where does that put us today as i stated in my opening remarks we had a strong quarter and a great first half of the year the bank sale and now the irp filing provide important context for our future growth and positioning of the business let me share my confidence for 2021 we are focused on delivering adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 2 61 to 2 65 per share and we expect to deliver toward the high end of that range for 2022 we are reaffirming our adjusted full year guidance of 2 85 to 2 87 per share given the strong performance we are seeing this year the reduced financing needs next year and continued investments in the utility there is upward momentum as we move forward now many of you have asked about the dividend we are reaffirming again no change to the 1 74 dividend for 2021 as we move forward we are committed to growing the dividend in line with earnings with a target payout ratio of about 60 while we are not going to provide 2022 dividend guidance on this call i want to be very clear we are committed to growing the dividend in 2022 it s what you expect it s what you own it and it is big part of our value i will offer this our target payout ratio does not need to be achieved immediately it will happen naturally as we grow our earning finally i want to touch on long term growth rate which is 6 to 8 this has not changed it s driven by the capital investment needs of our system our customers affordability and the need for a healthy balance sheet to fund those investments historically we ve grown at 7 but as we redeploy the proceeds from the bank we will deliver toward the high end through 2025 i ll also remind you that we tend to rebase higher off of actuals we have historically either met or exceeded our guidance all in a strong quarter positioned well for 2021 with upward momentum and with enerbank and the irp it all comes together nicely positioned for the long term with that i ll turn the call over to rejji to discuss the details of our quarterly and year to date earnings rejji rejji p hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy thank you garrick and good morning everyone before i walk through the details of our financial results for the quarter you ll note that throughout our materials we have reported the financial performance of enerbank as discontinued operations thereby removing it as a reportable segment and adjusting our quarterly and year to date results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and while we re on enerbank i ll share that the sale process continues to progress nicely as the merger application was filed in june with the various federal and state regulators will be evaluating the transaction for approval and we continue to expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year moving on to continuing operations for the second quarter we delivered adjusted net income of 158 million or 0 55 per share which excludes 0 07 from enerbank for comparative purposes our second quarter adjusted eps from continuing operations was 0 09 above our second quarter 2020 results exclusive of enerbank s eps contribution last year the key drivers of our financial performance for the quarter were rate relief net of investment related expenses recovering commercial and industrial sales and the usual strong tax planning year to date we delivered adjusted net income from continuing operations of 472 million or 1 64 per share which excludes 0 19 per share from enerbank and is up 0 37 per share versus the first half of 2020 assuming a comparable adjustment for discontinued operations all in we re tracking well ahead of plan on all of our key financial metrics to date which offers great financial flexibility for the second half of the year the waterfall chart on slide nine provides more detail on the key year to date drivers of our financial performance versus 2020 as a reminder this walk excludes the financial performance of enerbank for the first half of 2021 rate relief has been the primary driver of our positive year over year variance to the tune of 0 36 per share given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for electric and gas businesses as a reminder our rate relief figures are stated net of investment related costs such as depreciation and amortization property taxes and funding costs at the utility the rate relief related upside in 2021 has been partially offset by the planned increases in our operating and maintenance expenses to fund key initiatives around safety reliability customer experience and decarbonization as a reminder these expenses align with our recent rate orders and equate to 0 06 per share of negative variance versus 2020 it is also worth noting that this calculation also includes cost savings realized to date largely due to our waste elimination efforts through the ce way which are ahead of plan we also benefited in the first half of 2021 from favorable weather relative to 2020 in the amount of 0 06 per share and recovering commercial and industrial sales which coupled with solid tax planning provided 0 01 per share of positive variance in aggregate as we look ahead to the second half of the year we feel quite good about the glide path to delivering toward the high end of our eps guidance range as garrick noted as always we plan for normal weather which in this case translates to 0 02 per share of negative variance given the absence of the favorable weather experienced in the second half of 2020 we ll continue to benefit from the residual impact of rate relief which equates to 0 12 per share of pickup and i ll remind you is not subject to any further mpsc actions we also continue to execute on our operational and customer related projects which we estimate will have a financial impact of 0 21 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2020 given anticipated reinvestments in the second half of the year we have also seen the usual conservatism in our utility non weather sales assumptions and our nonutility segment performance which as a reminder now excludes enerbank all in we are pleased with our strong start to the year and are well positioned for the latter part of 2021 turning to our financing plan for the year i m pleased to highlight our recent successful issuance of 230 million of preferred stock at an annual rate of 4 2 one of the lowest rates ever achieved for a preferred offering of its kind this transaction satisfies the vast majority of funding needs of cms energy our parent company for the year and given the high level of equity content ascribed to the security by the rating agencies we have reduced our planned equity issuance needs for the year to up to 100 million from up to 250 million as a reminder over half of the 100 million of revised equity issuance needs for the year are already contracted via equity forwards it is also worth noting that given the terms and conditions of the enerbank merger agreement in the event enerbank continues to outperform the financial plan prior to the closing of the transaction we would have a favorable purchase price adjustment related to the increase in book equity value at closing which could further reduce our financing needs for 2021 and provide additional financial flexibility in 2022 closing out the financing plan i ll also highlight that we recently extended our long term credit facilities by one year to 2024 both at the parent and the utility lastly i d be remiss if i didn t mention that later today we ll file our 10 q which will be the last 10 q owned by glenn barba our chief accounting officer who most of you know from his days leading our ir team glenn announced his retirement earlier this year after serving admirably for nearly 25 years at cms which included him signing over 75 quarterly sec filings during his tenure glenn thank you for your wonderful service to cms you certainly left it better than you found it and we wish you the very best in this next chapter in your life and with that i ll turn the call back to garrick for some concluding remarks before we open it up for q a garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy company thanks rejji and thank you glenn for your service as we ve highlighted today we ve had a great first half of the year we are pleased to have delivered such strong results we re positioned well to continue that momentum into the second half of the year as we focus on finalizing the sale of the bank and moving through the irp process i m proud to lead this great team and we can t wait to share our success as we move forward together this is an exciting time at cms energy with that rocco please open the lines for q a questions and answers operator today s first question comes from jeremy tonet from jpmorgan please go ahead jeremy bryan tonet jpmorgan analyst hi good morning garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy company good morning jeremy how are you jeremy bryan tonet jpmorgan analyst good thanks just wanted to start you mentioned growing earnings at the high end of the 6 to 8 range and kind of as the proceeds get redeployed here over time just wondering if you could dig in a little bit more if there s any more color you can provide on how to think about the timing here it seems like a lot of opportunity with the irp but how should we think about the high end i mean basically i m trying to think what type of glide path could we see where the earnings trajectory could overlap i guess pre enerbank guide at that point garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy company jerry i think you said some key words opportunity in one word i d add or two words i guess i would add to that is upward momentum and so off of 2022 6 to 8 we re going to lever toward the high end of that through 2025 and then when i think about the irp there s obviously two big tranches let s say covert in 2023 and the acquisition of that facility and also the enterprise facilities on 2025 those are incremental to the plan to the capital plan and those strengthen and lengthen that growth through that time period and so again i feel confident in our ability to deliver on that and i think this is a great plan with upward momentum as we look at that time period from 2022 to 2025 jeremy bryan tonet jpmorgan analyst got it that s very helpful and then i know we re early in the irp process here but just wondering if you could expand a bit more i guess on early stakeholder feedback and just your thoughts at this point garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy company jeremy i wish you could see my face i ve got a big grin on my face i m smiling i d love to have a case leader there s no pushback and there s no intervenors that happened with every case as you well know but here s why i see the irp there s a win in here and this is why it s a remarkable plan there is a win for every one of the interveners or stakeholders when i think about the environmental community 60 reduction in co2 well above and beyond the requirements of the paris accord the two degree and the 1 5 degree scenario well above and beyond what biden proposed for 2030 so a big win for the environmental community in there and big win for our customers affordability 650 million of savings that s a great opportunity reliability of maybe better stated resiliency of the electric grid this is a more reliable plan than our previous irp we ve done more homework to ensure that we don t have texas like situation as we look forward to the future with intermittent resource i feel really great about that and then for our investors over 1 billion incremental investment the ability to treat these assets securitization is the ability to treat these assets the existing assets and the book value as a regulatory asset process i feel really good there s a winning here for everyone and then there s a win for everyone the opportunity to reach settlement and even if it s not settlement to go to a whole distance i feel really good about that and just one last reminder on this 2018 irp jeremy bryan tonet jpmorgan analyst gotcha that s really helpful sounds promising just a small one if i could just want to reconcile i think the equity 100 million could have balance of the year i think within the slide and a good chunk that we already lost in but were there any comments if possible be even less than that just want to make sure that i have that straight as part of the equity balance of the year garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy company i m all out rejji grab that one rejji p hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy yes good morning jeremy good question so where we re we re comfortable saying up to 100 because of the preferred stock issuance and remember we ve got a little worth of 50 million of that already locked we ll continue to evaluate opportunities over the course of this year and if we can reduce we may do that but for now we are comfortable to say up to 100 million jeremy bryan tonet jpmorgan analyst got it that s very helpful i ll stop there thanks rejji p hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy thank you garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy company thanks operator our next question today comes from insoo kim with goldman sachs please go ahead insoo kim goldman sachs analyst thank you just first question is following up on jeremy s question on the earnings growth trajectories i just want to clarify from my end that you re saying often to 2022 a guidance range your growth is gonna be toward the upper end of 6 to 8 percent range through 2025 and that irregardless of whether the hierarchy garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy company thanks for your question it s great to hear from you that s exactly what we stated six to eight we expect to deliver toward the high end and the irp cohort and those enterprises assets strengthen and lengthen that path so absolutely insoo kim goldman sachs analyst got it got it and then just so picking the irp side you ve been so consistent in achieving that 10 range like clockwork for a long time i guess going to that upper end again excluding the irp what kind of gives you confidence that maybe that could what the longer term run rate could be of that type of growth rate garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy company well i d actually started with this year in 2021 this momentum that we have right now carries into 2022 hopefully you heard that in our comments from the 2 85 to 2 87 and we ll continue to revisit that on the quarterly calls but again that carries into this plan and remember what we do we rebase off that source so we deliver we either meet or exceed guidance and then that s the point where we rebase off of and so it s that compounding effect that you ve seen time and time again and so that s an important piece of it but also we think about the entire triple bottom line and so i think a great example of this irp we re going to put 1 3 billion in and it saves our customers 650 million that s at ce way mindset coming play making these investments attacking the cost stack share of wallets 3 it was 4 went to 3 share wallet so we balance all those things the affordability the balance sheet and make this come together so again i feel really confident about our glide path forward and rejji might have some comments on that as well rejji p hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy insoo the only thing i would add to garrick s good comments is as you think longer term we noted in the irp that we intend to do about eight gigawatts of solar new build and that s about two gigawatts higher than the prior plan and so that creates additional capital investment opportunities we re assuming it s a similar construct where it s about 50 owned and 50 contracted however if we continue to be more and more cost competitive that could create additional upside to own more of that opportunity over time you couple that with the fact that we ve talked about the 3 billion to 4 billion of upside opportunities in our 10 year capital plan a portion of which we think will be in our next five year plan but there ll still be balance after that and so as we continue to take costs whether it s through the ce way or some of these episodic opportunities like ppas repricing and so on well that creates more headroom to bring in that additional capital so we feel very good about the long term glide path for capital growth which drives rate base growth and then earnings insoo kim goldman sachs analyst understood that s definitely helpful just one more if i could going back to that irp plan i think a lot of the questions that people have is whether this plan which basically swaps out coal for at least in the interim gassing the portfolio and how that will be received by the various stakeholders i appreciate your comments on working with the various stakeholders as well as the commission on this type of plan but how confident are you in this time being the best one and if there are some i guess room for negotiation if this doesn t end up being the best plan for the commission what are some of the alternatives that could potentially also work garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy company well this is the best plan for michigan one of the things that our first irp taught us is that we learned a lot from that and this is i would just say a great plan remarkable plan for all the reasons i mentioned a few minutes ago and so there s a win in here for everyone and when there s a win there s an opportunity to reach settlement or go the whole distance and so again i would just reference 2018 we were very successful with a number of interveners and being able to get to a settlement but that s what s great about this regulatory construct we re working with these interveners in the process and if there s an opportunity to settle where there s an outcome that is good for all we will do that and so we re early on into and again i m very optimistic we have a great plan and i don t know rejji do you want to add to that rejji p hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy insoo the only thing i would add to that is that trust that we evaluated the number of different permutations that as instructed for the irp construct and so we certainly looked at whether we could transition to renewable power more rapidly or fully in as a substitute for the retirements and the economics just don t get you there plus you also introduce significant reliability and resilience trends given the lack of really long term storage solutions and so we certainly evaluated it but as garrick noted we deem this plan where it sits today as the best plan for michigan and also with the gas facilities and obviously foregoing the o m and capital we know we would have on our coal facilities you take that into account with the fuel arbitrage you get from gas versus coal and just less purchases you now have controllable dispatch it just brings substantial cost savings to customers which would not be offered if we went to a full renewable solution in lieu of gas as a bridge fuel so we feel like this is the most economic opportunity for all stakeholders garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy company yes i m going to add to that i just want to be just crystal clear on this not only affordability piece but those natural gas plants are required for resiliency in the state you can t get here from there that s just bottom line and so it s that crystal clear and that s why i have just a high degree of confidence insoo kim goldman sachs analyst that s great color thank you so much operator and our next question today comes from anthony crowdell with mizuho anthony christopher crowdell mizuho analyst hey good morning garrick thank you so much just one quick question on the dividend you ve laid out a nice plan for earnings growth rate and you re pretty confident in that 2025 high end but you what s your concern over providing that type of detail on the dividend growth rate garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy company well you said pretty confident i would change that word to really confident and so there s a little bit your question but i m equally confident in our dividend piece and what you heard from me is that confidence in dividend growth for 2022 we recognize the importance of it and we have it built into our financial plan i really want to hand it over to rejji here because there is an important piece that s associated with the sale of the bank and closure in q4 that also shapes that dividend and so that s why we re most pieces have to come together so that we can share that potential here at the end of the year but go ahead rejji rejji p hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy yes that s right so if you think about some of the dynamism we might see in the second half of the year the closing and the timing of the closing of the enerbank transaction could certainly impact what we might plan to do for 2022 dividend but to go back to garrick s comments our commitment is to grow the dividend beyond the 1 74 per share where it is today and then longer term again we ll certainly have that dividend grow commensurate with earnings but certainly the bank sale and the timing of that will have an impact in the near term and then longer term again right in line with earnings growth and so we feel highly confident that we will have a competitive dividend and we know that it s a core part of our value proposition as garrick noted in his prepared remarks garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy company and just add to that there s with the sale and that closure there there s upside potential there from a dividend perspective again so we want to be able to our investors to be able to share some of that positive news anthony christopher crowdell mizuho analyst if i could just jump in with one last question related to the irp is there any part of the irp you think maybe be the most challenging or may generate the most concern with the interveners garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy company i don t know about most challenging i think that s i ll just tell you this anthony back in 2014 and 2015 i was a policy witness i ve been on the stand with interveners been crossed by attorneys they go after a lot of different things in the case and here s again we ve got strong testimony we got great precedent we re used to this stuff we do this all the time with our rate cases we ve done it with a previous irp i don t think there s anything this team can t handle frankly and so and we re prepared to do that as rejji alluded to a minute ago there s a lot of detail a lot of modeling and data that went into this and so it s a very strong case anthony christopher crowdell mizuho analyst great thanks for answering my questions operator and our next question comes from durgesh chopra with evercore isi durgesh chopra evercore isi analyst hey good morning team thanks for taking my questions maybe just on the irp i noticed that you proposed a couple of coal plant shutdowns but then including them in the rate base post their shutdown just kind of curious as to sort of if the state has done that previously or are there some precedent there that you feel comfortable with that proposal garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy company well i do feel comfortable with it there s a precedent set in colorado florida wisconsin for a similar approach in michigan we do have a nice ability to securitize but it is voluntary and that s an important piece of this and so it s essentially in 2025 it s about 1 2 billion of remaining book value to going through and securitize that just doesn t make sense this is going to be a drag in credit metrics they have an impact on cost of capital which ultimately shows up on the customers bill that s i mean that doesn t make sense and so we ve really got a good approach there it s different than how we ve approached it previously but again there s a nice precedent that s been set and i m really the testimony i ve reviewed the testimony it s we re in a good spot durgesh chopra evercore isi analyst understood i appreciate the color there and obviously you can always fall back to securitization if that leads if that ends up being the case but i appreciate the color there and then just maybe to rejji can you clarify sort of the i m trying to see the equity elimination through 2024 you don t talk about 2025 so should we assume sort of the normal cadence of equity i believe that was 250 million per year to go back to that starting in 2025 i m just trying to reconcile that to the comment that the 1 billion additional in the irp you don t need to finance that with equity just any color there rejji would be helpful rejji p hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy yes happy to durgesh first let me just circle back to your closing comment just to be unambiguous around this and so the notion of falling back on this securitization as we noted when we rolled out the irp as we noted in our prepared remarks this is the proposed plan this is not a buffet we re not thinking about any type of fallback option and again from a securitization perspective to garrick s comments given the impact it could have on our balance sheet we ve already done with the inclusion of con one and two in the retirement and securitization there we will already have 1 billion of securitized debt on our balance sheet as of 2023 so we really cannot accommodate alternatives like that so i want to be very clear we do not view that as a fallback option and the proposed plan is what it is so with respect to the question around equity yes you re right in that as we disclosed when we announced the enerbank sale we are not planning to issue any equity from 2022 through 2024 even with the capital opportunities that we ve announced today with the irp and potentially some of that upside opportunity so no additional equity for 2025 you can assume the up to 250 million level that we articulated when we first rolled out our five year plan so that s still a good working assumption for now but obviously there s a lot of time left and if we can recalibrate and see the data moving away that supports reducing that at some point we may revisit that but for now assume 250 million in that out of year of 2025 is that helpful durgesh chopra evercore isi analyst very helpful and thanks for clarifying that securitization comment operator and our next question comes from shar pourreza with guggenheim please go ahead constantine lednev guggenheim analyst this is actually constantine here for shar but i think if i may if i can just follow up on kind of one more kind of i guess irp capex related question what are some of the constructs that are that the incremental portion of capex fall under is it all fully covered by the irp as proposed plus kind of the annual rate case process that you have any kind of does any of the non irp work can need any incremental trackers but does any of this incremental work can start prompting more equity needs down the line or is it fully kind of baked in at this point garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy company i think rejji and i will tag team this one and so let me just kind of frame up when i think about our capital plans and i think we ll talk about our current work across our utility but also this irp and so at the end of the year in our january call we re going to add another year to that five year capital plan and that s going to be more capital opportunity that five year plan is going to grow and it s going to be in our gas business it s going to be in our electric distribution business and so there s some growth opportunity there then we ll continue to follow this irp through the process through that 10 month process again we feel confident in the outcome of that and then that s an incremental 1 3 and so you can imagine in q2 of 2022 we re going to with a successful outcome there will be an adjustment in 2023 to accommodate the covert facility and then also an adjustment in 2025 and so you can see some of that play out over the five years and into the 10 year because when you look at this integrated resource plan it goes from 25 to 27 and so some of that still will be able to fall in the 10 year piece as well and so there s some update that will take place along those lines so that s kind of the capital layout but rejji certainly tag team this with me rejji p hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy sure happy to so constantine i appreciate the question we re pretty methodical so i ll put the irp aside we re pretty methodical in how we think about the capital plan of the utility and we really spend a lot of time providing long term visibility on customer investment opportunities across each of the businesses and so the current five year plan has around 2 5 billion of what i ll call clean energy generation spend and then the balance is electric and gas infrastructure spend and so we noted when we filed our gas case a couple of years ago that we had about 10 billion of gas infrastructure related investments for safety reliability and decarbonization of about 1 billion per year of run rate and so you can expect an extension of that capital investment opportunity and subsequent iterations of year plans and so we ll do more gas infrastructure and again we run about 1 billion per year run rate in that regard electric infrastructure is comparable where we re doing a little over 1 billion per year of electric infrastructure work to improve reliability and the irp is also where we re seeing capital investment opportunities so the existing irp remember we re still executing on a 1 1 gigawatt tranche and we re going to own half of that and so all of that is going to be part of the next iteration and so those are the sort of non new irp opportunities again we ll see those come in and we also talked about starting to take on some of those upside opportunities which in our 10 year plan of 3 billion to 4 billion we wouldn t do all of that in the next vintage but a portion of it and again it s more electric and gas infrastructure as well as clean energy generation related spend and so those would be some of the projects that we would invest in beyond this new irp we re highly confident that we ll be able to create the headroom to introduce those into the capital plan you asked about trackers the only thing i would mention in that regard is in our gas infrastructure capital plan we do have the equivalent or comparable structure like a tracker and that s in our enhanced infrastructure replacement program and so we have that on the gas side but we don t have any other say sort of a historical type trackers like that and so we obviously put them into the cases we filed on a serial basis and then that dictates what ends up in the final plan does that make sense constantine lednev guggenheim analyst it does i think that s very helpful and if i may shift a little bit to more of a fundamental question so the electric sales volumes seem to be normalizing with reopening more or less and especially with the strong kind of c i growth and residential coming down a bit can you kind of talk about your thoughts on the residential load and how sticky it is versus expectations and maybe kind of the reversion of the residential load causing headwinds in terms of earnings for 21 or expectations in 22 garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy company i m going to have rejji start with some of the specifics and then i ll talk about some macro at the end so rejji why don t you grab it rejji p hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy yes constantine we ve been quite pleased with what we ve seen really across all of the customer classes to date and so we have good detail on the 15 page guide just we distributed also in the appendix you can see the year to date trends in the presentation today and so we ve got residential year to date down a little over 1 that compares favorably to plan we had much more bearish expectations because we were assuming a more rapid return to facilities and so our full year plan was something closer to down roughly 5 and we re ahead of plan so that does imply that we re seeing a good level of stickiness to this mass teleworking trend which i do think will be part of a post pandemic normal and obviously that s higher margin load and so residential continues to outperform our expectations and then we re also seeing commercial and industrial as i mentioned in my prepared remarks come back nicely and so year to date commercial is up around 3 5 and we had in our plan about that level and then industrials at 13 year to date 2021 versus 2020 and our plan we said on a full year basis about 6 up and so we re seeing surprise to the upside across all fronts and so intra year that obviously creates upside and potential contingencies as we go into the second half of the year but longer term as you roll that into your rate cases that creates headroom because you re introducing more kilowatt hours into the denominator of your rate calculation so we feel very good about the road ahead to date it s still early days the pandemic is not behind us yet but again we re still seeing very encouraging trends on the load side the other leading indicators we ve talked about in the past are just interconnection activities new service requests they re up over 30 year to date versus where they were in 2020 and 2020 may not be the best comp given the pandemic so we also look at 2019 again up 30 versus where we were pre pandemic so interconnections are strong staking requests are strong customer counts are quite good with commercial up 1 and so again everything seems to be trending from a load perspective in the right direction garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy company i ll just add to that just a little bit of clarification so those new service connections interconnections those are installs those aren t someone dreaming of a house or thinking about a business those are actually in the ground and so again it gives you some idea of the momentum here we continue to have unemployment rates well below the national average here in michigan in the heart of our service territory grand rapids it s even better and just to give you a little flavor over the quarter we ve even seen growth in again macro trends and people opening new business in michigan in fact we re under an nda right now with the company but it s 300 million investment 30 megawatts 150 jobs that are locating here in our service territory in michigan and i could two other examples of that and so coming out of the pandemic here and we re seeing a nice economic development growth here in michigan as well constantine lednev guggenheim analyst thank you operator next question comes from paul patterson with glenrock associates please go ahead paul patterson glenrock associates analyst good morning guys how are you doing garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy company good we re doing great paul paul patterson glenrock associates analyst so most of my questions have been answered but just back on that securitization question could you remind me the size of the asset that s now going to be amortized as opposed to securitized garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy company the remaining book value in 2025 of those coal plants would be 1 2 billion that is under consideration in this filing paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay and you guys mentioned that the securitization you thought would be credit negative in comparison to the plan that you re putting forward and could you i mean just to sort of walk just sort of very high level the reason for that is because you ll be amortizing the cash flow faster is that the way to sort of think about the excuse me you ll be amortizing the assets faster and the cash flow will be stronger is that how you re looking at this or is there something else i should be thinking about rejji p hayes executive vice president and chief financial officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy so paul this is rejji so a couple of things there so moody s as you may recall treat securitized debt as debt in their metric calculations and so you have that levering effect of securitizations because they are effectively nonrecourse debt but moody s is the one rating agency that does impute it as debt and so that 1 2 billion that garrick noted would be dollar for dollar accounted as debt in our credit metric calculations so you ve got credit dilution there and then you couple that with the fact that you re going to forego earnings on 1 2 billion of rate base over time and so you couple sort of the impact on the denominator where you just have dollar for dollar debt of 1 2 billion and then you have the dilution in your numerator because you re foregoing earnings on that equity portion of that rate base over that period of time that s what offers that levering effect paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay i follow you on that of course you re getting the cash upfront though with the securitization so i mean i m just sort of maybe we can take that off line but ok i understand that and then in terms of the plan i mean it sounds like it really is a win win win i m just wondering has there been any change in the trajectory or your what you re expecting in terms of customer rates going forward as a result of the irp or is it too early to sort of tell are you guys pretty much on track as you were thinking before and this is just going to be some incremental savings that will help you meet your goals do you follow what i m saying garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy company i do follow what you re saying and so we look at across that 5 year plan of investments we look at the rate impact and two the bill impact which is also critically important for our residential and commercial customers and so that is part of the five year and as we again this incremental capital of 1 3 billion it provides 650 million of savings over our current plan and so this is so again this comes together nicely to your point paul from an affordability perspective for our customers paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay well awesome thanks so much and congratulation garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy corporation and consumers energy company thank you paul operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes the question and answer session i d like to turn the conference back over to garrick rochow for closing remarks garrick j rochow president and chief executive officer of cms energy

sandri president chief executive officer thank you julie good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today for the second quarter of 2021 we reported net revenues of 3 6 billion and adjusted ebitda of 372 million or a 10 2 margin compared to 4 a year ago and an adjusted eps of 0 63 per share we are extremely pleased with the results of our core business during the quarter although the pandemic continued to affect our business our second quarter revenues and adjusted ebitda grew significantly versus the prior year but more importantly our u s and mexico revenues and adjusted ebitda surpassed second quarter 2019 results the results were driven by a resilient business model across all business units including the u s mexico and europe the unique challenges of covid 19 presented an opportunity to demonstrate the value and strength of our well diversified portfolio including our presence in multiple geographies and our ability to generate more consistent results despite specific market volatility we remain guided by our principles of an uncompromising commitment to the safety of our team members our ability to provide high quality foods globally and our responsibility to provide continued employment opportunities and benefits for our team members during the dynamic we have offered employment incentives and bonuses in addition to bonuses to those who receive the vaccine we hold safety protocols above all standards and when coupled with high vaccination rates at our facilities we are creating a work environment with our employee safety front and center we thank the governors and other state authorities in many of the locations where we operate who have supported the vaccination of our workforce labor availability continues a significant challenge for us the pandemic unemployment benefits still available in some states and brexit impacts on the labor market in u k although we are gaining ground in u s labor shortages continue to affect our product mix by limiting our ability to produce higher value products we believe the labor challenges will further stabilize in the third quarter in u s with the u k labor market improving toward the end of the year in the u s market covid continues to affect where people eat and how they buy their food retail remained strong although down slightly from a very strong q2 2020 retail value gained grown from the first quarter benefiting from a slight increase in average trips per week although not at pre covid levels shoppers are starting to feel more at ease going into stores food services in the u s we re seeing a rapid recovery as most restaurant restrictions were at ease in q2 and consumers increased mobility both in q2 to service demand back above 2019 levels fewer than as anticipated commercial restaurants closed driving demand as she can purchases per operator increase food service demand is expected to taper after the initial surge of pent up demand and summer travel comes to an end retail demand is expected to ease although remaining above 2019 base levels as consumers keep freezers and pantry stock the noncommercial channel is expected to remain below 2019 levels until a new school year begins viewers have adjusted volume and mix between channels to adapt to changing consumer demand whether that s foodservice making a comeback or retail consumer shifting between curbside pickup and in store shopping we are well positioned to adjust product and channel mix given our presence across all bird sizes from large to small commodity large bird deboning continued its moment from the first quarter and generated a largest profit improvement year over year this volume revenue and profit growth was driven by support from foodservice and a strong export market the continued strength in the third quarter in this business and we continue to see momentum in foodservice reopening our case ready business delivered volume and revenue growth versus the prior year but especially by the increase in grain and labor input costs we have implemented price increases and operational improvements to address a significant portion of these cost headwinds and continue to partner with key customers to deliver both growth and value for them the airport trajectory of foodservice reopening strong qsr demand and retail daily improvements drove year over year and sequential increases in our small bird volumes revenues and profitability we see continued strength in this business unit with a further improvement in foodservice reopenings and the strong demand for qsr key customers our u s prepared food sales volume was up 3 5 operational performance improved year over year despite increases in underlying raw material costs and our branded retail growth has been extremely strong driven by investments in our just bare and pilgrim s bands our consumer packaged foods experienced over 200 growth in the second quarter in addition we have added branded distribution in major retailers where we previously didn t have a presence in the second quarter according to usda data the u s chicken supply increased 2 4 year over year lagging significant production declines in april 2020 despite the increases growth appears to be constrained due to poor hatchability a comparison of our fda s statistics for egg hatch versus chicks placed illustrate the shortfall in hatching commodity pricing across all cuts have remained consistently strong trending near the top or above historical ranges whole food pricing remains stable also near the top of historical ranges corn prices increased during the quarter with the market focused on expected low core crop ending stocks and smaller than expected new crop planted area in the latest report usda reported a crop ending stocks at 1 1 billion bushels the lowest level since the 2012 2013 crop year in june planting intentions report usda reported new crop planted area at 92 7 million acres although an increase of almost two million acres from last year it was below expectations the fda is projecting new crop ending stocks could increase to 1 4 billion with a production increase of nearly one billion bushels from last year given the strong export demand we are seeing for corn we believe the market will remain very sensitive to weather changes for the balance of the summer with relatively low old corn crop stocks unlike corn soybean meal prices were under pressure since last quarter weighted down by higher than expected domestic production soybean oil prices have increased sharply since the first quarter causing higher processing rates which resulted in oversupply of soybean meal in the u s the fda is forecasting old crop ending stocks at 135 million bushes the lowest level since the 2013 14 crop and a modest increase of 155 million bushes for new crop despite the relatively low soybean carryout soybean meal prices remain moderated by the increased value of soybean oil driven by the growing demand for renewable diesel we expect to see relatively good supplies of domestic soybean meal as a result of renewable diesel initiatives despite a relatively low soybean carryout looking at wheat we re expecting a large rebound in production in europe this year including a more than 50 increase in u k our largest sourcing region combined with large supply increases in the other exporting countries we feel very good about the wheat supplies heading into the fall as we have said previously our risk management approach is adapted to the conditions and risks we see in the market and we feel very comfortable with our current strategy based on the risk we see in the market today our u s business has managed increased labor costs and higher and more volatile grain prices through the benefit of a strong cutout and increased pricing to our customer base to recover these higher input costs while effective operations are helping to control costs following our strategy of a diversified portfolio and balance of cost plus market and fixed price contract structures provides us the platform to manage through the volatility of our input costs at the close of q2 industry chicken inventory was relatively flat to its position at the end of q1 however usda indicated inventory was down 15 from previous years even after marginal moved over marked increase in june combined dark meat inventories are down 10 year over year quarterly inventory levels has been unable to build despite year over year supply growth as healthy retail and foodservice demand have maintained consistent draw on supply turning to export markets pulp prices were 54 higher in q2 compared to a year ago both pricing and demand exceeded expectations and nontraditional export items were upgraded from frozen inventory while the data is still in complete for q2 total broiler export sales for may grew by approximately 4 from a regional perspective the industry enjoyed gains in most geographies with the exception of the middle east and asia where significant declines occurred to covid issues in some of the larger poultry importing countries it is also not to work with that china was down 16 5 on imports of u s broiler meat due to a softer pork market pork congestion issues and larger than expected imports of poultry in q4 2020 that being said the pork market in china is displaying very strong demand and historically high prices export numbers are indicative of a more balanced trade scenario for the remainder of the year although some countries have experienced a resurgence of covid issues other are managing the pandemic well we expect to ease with ongoing issues to improve in the second half of the year it s still prudent to recognize that the dark meat shipments to china are very low relative to last year which bodes well for the future dark meat demand we are already seeing an uptick in china demand for u s as we enter q3 our mexican operations delivered strong results in q2 given a well balanced supply demand equation our fresh business continued to improve its efficiency we re prepared food saw a double digit growth encouraging very strong performance in the qsr and foodservice channels we continue to invest in our pilgrim s del dia and alamesa brands and we expect chicken and prepared food consumption to continue to grow in coming years our mexican team continues to be relentless focused on delivering exceptional operational results moving to europe the moy park business has continued to produce steady results despite finding grain prices through the first six months of the year moy park delivered an improving ebitda sequentially the first summer quarter the price formulas have addressed partially the increase in feed costs however along with grain costs other operating costs like labor and utilities continued to climb during the quarter we continue pursuing the recovery of this costs in the second half of the year we continue to be pleased with moy park s relative performance to the industry for the past 12 months issues arising from brexit such as mix changes and labor charges along with seasonal influenza consequences affect our ability to export some of our dark meat production impacting results moy park was able to mitigate some of the severe feed and other cost impacts through further operational excellence initiatives that continue to deliver labor efficiencies better agricultural performance and improved yields while keeping tight control over sg a costs we have seen consistent improvement in moy park foodservice sales as this sector showed significant recovery year over year despite covid 19 restrictions experienced throughout the second quarter although under continued cost pressures moy park s performance is improving and will continue to do so as feed costs stabilize covid 19 costs came down and restrictions are eased the pilgrim s u k business has been negatively impacted by increased grain costs and extremely low half prices due to african swine fever in germany which negatively impacted exports to china backing up supply in europe this business is benefiting from operational execution but improvements are outweighed by sluggish pre pricing in the u k despite market challenges including worsening labor ability in the u k we have now been profitable on an ebitda basis for the last nine quarters in a row during q2 our year over year retail volume declined as the retail market fell versus last year as foodservice normalized and category sales began to return pre covid levels also our year over year volumes to china decreased due to the continued suspension of our export license at two plants as a result of covid 19 we expect the licenses to be reinstated later this year however total sales volume showed 2 growth while the decline in retail sales was compensated by sales into the food service market we are optimistic about building our operational improvements by continuing to optimize our manufacturing footprint extracting best in class operational excellence capitalizing on export opportunities optimizing our portfolio and strengthening and growing business with key customers to drive innovation in value added higher margin areas we have a great team in europe dedicated to generating results by focusing on factors within our control while ensuring and protecting the safety and health of all team members to further strengthen our portfolio in u k and our relationship with key customers and to continue executing against our growth strategy we signed an agreement to acquire the meats and meals business of kerry consumer foods the meats and meals business acquisition will position pilgrim s as the leading food company in the u k and ireland with a value added protein and prepared foods business anchored by a portfolio of strong brands with 2020 sales of more than gbp725 million and 4 500 team members the business well balanced portfolio of products brands and consumer base aligns with our growth strategy this acquisition will support our strategy of developing a differentiated portfolio of diverse complementary business models continue to relentlessly pursue operational excellence and becoming a more valued partner with key customers with new and innovative products and creating an environment for safe people safe products and healthy expects we expect to transition this transaction to close early in the fourth quarter of 2020 and finally i d like to point out that we recently released our 2020 sustainability report which includes the 5 year results of our 2015 sustainability goals and aggressive new global targets that will guide our sustainability strategy over the next decade and beyond the report details the company s progress in key priority areas animal care team members environment communities customers and consumers and suppliers across our operations in the u k europe mexico and the united states

world in a sustainable manner that is both ambitious and collaborative while creating the opportunity for a better future for our team members with that i would like to ask our cfo matt galvanoni to discuss our financial results matthew r galvanoni senior vice president chief financial officer thank you fabio and good morning everyone for the second quarter of 2021 net revenues were 3 64 billion versus 2 82 billion a year ago with an adjusted ebitda of 372 million and a 10 2 margin compared to 112 million and a 4 margin in q2 last year we achieved 154 million adjusted net income which includes the discrete income tax charge in the quarter of 32 million associated with the u k s increased statutory income tax rate from 19 to 25 we reported a gaap net loss of 167 million versus a loss of 6 million in 2020 the most significant adjustment in the quarter was a 396 million accrual related to legal sales adjusted ebitda margins were 10 5 in the u s 18 9 in mexico and 5 2 in europe our adjusted ebitda in the u s in q2 was 237 1 million versus 93 7 million a year ago and 236 4 million in 2019 sales were up due to strong market pricing and slightly higher volumes compared to both 2020 and 2019 gross profit margins were higher than 2020 due to significant covid 19 impacts last year however were down compared to 2019 due to higher grain costs and labor inefficiencies in mexico adjusted ebitda in q2 was 85 7 million versus a loss of 27 7 million a year ago and a positive 75 8 million in 2019 net revenue was up due to higher market pricing and slightly higher volumes the mexican business has benefited from a balanced supply demand dynamic from linked adjusted ebitda in q2 was 33 5 million versus 34 7 million a year ago and 37 3 million in 2019 pilgrim s u k had adjusted ebitda of 15 7 million in q2 compared to 12 3 million a year ago volumes have continued to improve during the year the gradual reopening of the u k and european economies however gross profit is down year over year as we ve been able to pass through some but not all of the grain cost increases experienced in the first six months of the year in total we incurred covid related costs of approximately 12 million in the second quarter 2021 this is a decrease of approximately 37 million compared to the prior year overall our sg a in the second quarter was higher than prior year primarily due to legal costs associated with the various u s litigation matters and increased investment in our brands we will continue to prioritize our capital spending plans this year to optimize our product mix and strengthen our partnership with key customers we reiterate our commitment to invest in strong roce projects that will improve our operational efficiencies and tailor our operations to address key customer needs to further solidify competitive advantages for pilgrim s our balance sheet continues to be robust given our relentless emphasis on cash flows from operating activities focus on management of working capital and disciplined investment in high return projects our liquidity position remains very strong with more than 1 25 billion in total cash and available credit at the end of the quarter our net debt was 1 8 billion with a leverage ratio of 1 6 times last 12 months adjusted ebitda our leverage is below our target ratio of two to 3 times and we continue to expect to generate strong operating cash flows this year we expect 2021 interest expense to be approximately 110 million exclusive of the debt extinguishment costs of 24 million we recorded in the second quarter in any interest expense associated with the financing of the pending kerry transaction we ll stay focused on creating shareholder value as we optimize our capital structure to continue executing our growth strategy our capital allocation strategies remain aligned with our growth strategy and each opportunity be evaluated against our value creation standards operator this concludes our prepared remarks please open the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you very much we will now take in the question and answer portion first question is from the line of ben theurer from barclays please go ahead benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc head of the mexico equity research director yes thank you very much good morning perfect congrats on the results first question just could you elaborate a little more in detail on that close to 400 million for litigation settlements because if i look at it on an ltm basis we re now close to like 600 million of which a lot was like the price fixing last year but just to understand if the incremental 400 million from the last quarter is that already all settled in cash or is a lot of that like just in order to be prepared if there is more to come and do you think this is it that would be the first question fabio sandri president chief executive officer good morning ben yes we can t comment on active investigation and litigation however the company continues to cooperate with the department of justice on its investigation and we ll continue to defend against the claims and to resolve its material litigation in a manner that we believe is the best interest of the company and the shareholders based on that that is a combination of actual settlements and accruals that we expect to happen benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc head of the mexico equity research director okay so it s not all with an actual settlement as there s partially as brawl fabio sandri president chief executive officer no benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc head of the mexico equity research director okay that s good and then second just on the u s if we take a look at the underlying performance i mean it s been clearly on an improving trend and it seems like you ll start to get pricing through and maybe a little bit of an easing on the cost side still you ve highlighted labor shortage and certain other issues on the cost side how do you think about the current quarter and what s next once those benefits run out in terms of getting labor back in being more efficient on the facilities and ultimately further pushing those price increases through with your key customers so where do you think the profitability is heading in the second half just based on where the current environment is fabio sandri president chief executive officer yes thank you it s a long answer ben but on the pricing and contracts we have this differentiated portfolio i ve been talking about this for years right that protects us from the downside and we have exposure to the commodity segments that enable us to capture upside in the market all of these different segments are behaving differently during the last year to be honest right so commodity is really strong right now and we are seeing a strong demand in the foodservice that is growing really fast while retail continues to be strong so as of today the commodity segments are way more profitable than all other segments the small bird segment has continued its strength with the growth of the qsrs but the contracts that we have in those segments are more connected to grain pricing and that profitability is very stable so we have a very stable part of our portfolio and a part of our portfolio that is really connected because commodity prices that we can achieve the results that we are achieving going forward what we are seeing in the market is that retail will continue to be strong i think consumers are back to older habits of more trips to the grocer which will help the also the daily section so the retail continues to be very strong and the foodservice is reopening i think today we are seeing that traffic is close to only 60 6 percent lower than the pre pandemic levels so very good level affordability while the noncommercial part of the foodservices still 29 to 30 down and we expect the schools to reopen very soon for the next year which will boost the foodservice industry so going forward we continue to expect or we expect to see retail continue to be strong and the commodity segments to be really demanded given the extra increase in the foodservice benjamin m theurer barclays bank plc head of the mexico equity research director perfect thank you very much fabio fabio sandri president chief executive officer sure operator thank you the next question is from the line of ben bienvenu from stephens benjamin shelton bienvenu stephens inc md analyst hey thanks and good morning everybody fabio sandri president chief executive officer good morning benjamin shelton bienvenu stephens inc md analyst i want to ask first about the grain side of things and the feed cost and then my second question is about mexico so on the feed side of things i appreciate your commentary on the current i noticed in your disclosures that you re not overly hedged from derivative coverage exposure but you are as hedged as you ve been in a few years and so i m curious kind of your thoughts there around how you re positioned relative to the market any commentary you could provide on basis exposure as well and what we should be considering relative to your positioning around all of that as we head into the back half of the year fabio sandri president chief executive officer sure thank you ben well like we said previously our risk management strategy is adapted to the risk we see in the market and we feel very comfortable with where we are positioned right now what we are seeing is that we are following the summer crop developments in the u s very close given the low stock situation we have for both corn and soybeans so while there have been some areas that have been drier than we will like particularly in the western corn belt we think overall the u s crop are in an ok condition now but require additional monitoring for sure in addition to the condition in the u s crops and despite some volatility and recent cancellations we are still seeing strong demand for corn and expect that to continue in the next years and given all that we re looking at an increase in feed cost of approximately 300 million in u s for the second semester with the q3 being impacted the most while we are seeing that impacting our cost around 0 08 per life pound what we are seeing is that the commodity and even the normal pricing and the cutout has increased by significantly more than that almost 0 30 so the commodity pricing has been able to offset these grain prices so far our position as we mentioned are not the largest we ever had as we are monitoring all these costs and we believe that we have the right position right now benjamin shelton bienvenu stephens inc md analyst okay that s great thank you my second question on mexico congratulations on the solid results i m curious just given that that market can be incremental from quarter to quarter what you re seeing so far in the third quarter you noted a stronger economic environment more balanced s d better product mix on the non commodity piece of your business maybe just any color you could give as we look to the back half of the year on that business fabio sandri president chief executive officer yes temperamental it s a good time now thank you for that we know that quarter over quarter the performance can be very volatile what we are seeing in mexico is that we have a well balanced supply and demand scenario right now and we expect that to continue in q3 our fresh business continues to improve its efficiencies and while the prepared foods saw a very strong double digit growth anchored in a very strong performance of the qsrs and service channels the economy is recovering well we are watching the covid case pretty close right there but we don t expect a major impact in the current positive recovery trend of the economy as relation always our key members and our team continues to be focused on delivering these operational results and committed to growth and support the growth of the mexican economy benjamin shelton bienvenu stephens inc md analyst awesome thank you that s call for the back up fabio sandri president chief executive officer thank you ben operator thank you the next question is from the line of michael piken from cleveland research please go ahead michael leith piken cleveland research company equity analyst yes good morning just wanted to talk a little bit more about the hatchability issues within the industry when do you see that improving and how are your how is your hatchability doing and what steps are you taking to improve that fabio sandri president chief executive officer yes thank you michael yes hatchability has been the issue in the industry and that is constraining the industry to exceed the growth that everybody is expecting which is less than 1 for 2020 the main reason for the hatchability issues is that when we try to solve the blotting breath issue as you remember two or three years ago the genetic selection of this new breed prioritized quality feed conversion and carcass utilization rather than these reproductivity trades so even with the larger flock that we are having right now it is producing less eggs and less eggs are hatching some of that can also be explained by management and we expect that we can manage better around making recoup 0 5 to 1 the gap today is close to 2 5 so 0 5 to 1 we believe that we can recoup with better management of this new breed but the rest will take a much longer term because we will need a breach michael leith piken cleveland research company equity analyst great and then shifting gears you talked a little bit about the adverse mix effects and maybe if you could talk about kind of the steps you re taking or your thoughts on automation and how much that might play into your future plans and do you have any projected capex spending related to that if you are going to go to more automation thanks fabio sandri president chief executive officer sure sure and again like you said the labor market is really tight and it has been not only constrained by the impact of discontinued governmental benefits but now what we are seeing is that reopening of the economy after the covid putting a big competition for a very small labor pool and as we mentioned we are considering all options and one we are aggressively addressing the situation on the attraction retention and management of these absent in our labor force and of course investing in the automation we are happy to see that our staffing levels have improved over the last three months and it helped our mix effect but we will need to continue to invest in automation because we don t believe the labor force is going to increase significantly in the coming future we over the last two years reduced 2 200 positions with automation and we expect to invest around 100 million more in the next year to reduce around 5 600 positions we are investing also in some new technology in big bird deboning automating that big bird deboning which is very unique and we expect those plans to be operational about this year operator is your question answered mr piken as no response on the line we will move to the next question that is from the line of adam samuelson from goldman sachs please go ahead adam l samuelson goldman sachs group inc equity analyst yes thank you good morning everyone fabio sandri president chief executive officer good morning adam l samuelson goldman sachs group inc equity analyst so i guess first question maybe keying off of mike s question about the hatchability just trying to get a sense your volumes in the u s were basically flat in the quarter industry production was up about 2 5 i m just trying to get a sense for in terms of your internal production is that the actability in your own operations is that the labor availability is that an issue around mix maybe on the prepared poultry side for foodservice just help us think about your own volume shipments relative to industry and how you re thinking about your production in the back half of the year fabio sandri president chief executive officer yes of course adam thank you and yes our production during the quarter was flat a little bit up but in total flat year over year with the industry is increasing by 2 5 but we need to remember that during the pandemic our production did not reduce as much as the industry so despite being flat year over year and the industry is higher but the industry reduced pretty more than us in q2 last year it s not a matter of hatchability we re having the same issues in hatchability as everybody else we are in line with the market it was also related a little bit with the storm that we saw in texas it happened last quarter but impacted a little bit of our feed conversion and the volumes on this quarter adam l samuelson goldman sachs group inc equity analyst got it that s really helpful and fabio you talked earlier about the impact of feed inflation on your costs you ve kind of alluded to some of the labor challenges i m just trying to think about maybe nonfeed inflation in aggregate whether it s labor materials packaging how we should think about what your nonfeed inflation is running at through the second quarter and what you think through the balance of the year particularly as we kind of try to check that against the pricing side of things as we come off some of the seasonal peaks from here fabio sandri president chief executive officer sure sure and i think adam we re seeing inflation everywhere in our country and in other countries right i think it starts with the freight right we are seeing freight increasing by between 10 and 20 in terms of cost and depending on the lane where we are in and we are watching really close to any potential disruptive supply chain in the supply chain the increase in freight for us in the quarter is about 15 million but 65 of that freight is spent on deliveries directly to our customers so most of which has been recouped the remain we need to mitigate through pricing and as you as we mentioned we are seeing the supply and demand situation in a very favorable situation for the chicken part and we believe that we can pass all those costs in terms of freight to our contracts there s other increase in cost as we mentioned which is labor labor as i mentioned to be in a really short position right now we increased our salaries close to 40 million on an annualized basis and with that we ve been able to improve our staffing levels we are seeing soybean meal and soybean oil also in our prepared food has increased in terms of inflation but all in all we have a differentiated portfolio and again we have a differentiated portfolio not only of product but also of contracts while the supply demand in chicken industry continues to be in balance we believe that we can pass through this price these this cost increases to our prices and as i mentioned in the other answer the chicken demand continued to be really strong and we expect to be really strong for the next quarters adam l samuelson goldman sachs group inc equity analyst that s really helpful i personally thanks operator thank you the next question is from the line of peter galbo from bank of america please go ahead peter thomas galbo bofa securities associate hey guys good morning thanks for taking a question fabio i just want to ask a couple of clarifying questions in regards to some of the prepared comments you gave first on the retail business i know you said you re having pricing discussions at this point to offset some of the cost increases i just wasn t sure if you had said you re going to be able to offset all of the cost increase or just partial on the retail side and then just as you were talking about kind of schools getting back in the fall and some of the commercial business just what have you kind of seen early days are you seeing any kind of preordering ahead people worried about not being able to get product anything you can tell us kind of on that side of the business fabio sandri president chief executive officer yes thank you and yes retail continues to be really strong and we re seeing a lower demand today versus 2020 because of pantry loading but we are seeing demand greater than 2019 levels which is a very good for our production and our key customers and we have this key customer strategy we have discussions with them all the time on the bulk pricing and as i was talking to adam there is a lot of pressure in terms of costs both in feed and in nonfeed costs and we ve been discussing with them how can we pass this through the prices and help them continue with innovation and continue with features in terms of volume we are seeing today a very tight market for the retail because labor in the retail operation is very intensive and we ve been very challenging in the labor situation as we mentioned right so the production in the retail segment has been constrained by labor so what we are doing is to support our key customers and giving them the best on time in full that we ve seen in years as we are seeing also some features increases for the retails for the retail in the chicken side because the delta between the chicken and the beef and pork has never been as big as it is right now so that is very supportive on the demand for chicken so even with the increases that we are seeing chicken continues to be the best value and the best option for the end user peter thomas galbo bofa securities associate got it okay and then on schools maybe i missed the comments on some of the commercial side fabio sandri president chief executive officer yes sure on the when we call on commercial which is the schools and other segments yes we are seeing some preordering and we re seeing some expectation of a big increase there as i mentioned it s close is down close to 30 right now in that segment we expect that to stabilize and get to normal levels by early 2022 peter thomas galbo bofa securities associate got it okay okay and then i guess just putting that all together right as we re thinking about some of the sequential headwinds and tailwinds right labor i think you said is maybe improving sequentially on the margin feed you re rolling through some of the higher cost but just looking back historically at periods where chicken prices are relatively high you ve been able to earn a pretty substantial level of ebitda in your higher ebitda quarters right second and third quarter so as we re thinking about modeling out the third quarter is it fair to assume that you re expecting a similar level relative to 2q i mean is that putting it all together the right way or are there other things we re missing fabio sandri president chief executive officer yes we are seeing the supply and demand equation to be similar to q2 of course as we enter the fall we always see some decline in pricing but we re also seeing some reduction in the feed side of course the cost of the feed in q3 will still be impacted by the cost of the what we purchased in q2 so we expect the mitigation of the or the reduction in feed cost to be more in q4 than in q3 so we still see some elevated feed costs in q3 but we are seeing once again the supply and demand in a very good position we are seeing some reopening of the foodservice as well i think it will all depend as well on the covid numbers if there is any more restriction and we go back to some sort of restriction in terms of movement or in terms of the foodservice we can see the supply and demand to get less in a positive position that we are seeing right now but as of today we are really optimistic about what we are seeing peter thomas galbo bofa securities associate got it that s very helpful commentary thank you very much fabio sandri president chief executive officer thank you operator thank you next question is from the line of zen sorry ken zaslow from bank of montreal please go ahead kenneth bryan zaslow bmo capital markets md of food agribusiness research and food beverage analyst hey good morning everyone fabio sandri president chief executive officer good morning kenneth kenneth bryan zaslow bmo capital markets md of food agribusiness research and food beverage analyst just a quick one on this one i know we ve talked about a lot i m just trying to put it all together the labor how much do you think it impacted this quarter not just the cost side but also delivering you did say the dark meat how do we kind of put it together and then would you say that within the 2022 it would be resolved and therefore 2022 should have a relative change relative to this year is that the way to think about it i m just trying to put it together sorry for beating a dead horse here fabio sandri president chief executive officer no sure well again labor is what we re trying to manage better and as we said there is so many moving parts and it s really hard to define what is the impact because there is impacting mix right so we can t be one as much as we want there s impact in cost of course and yields we are losing yields as well because as you do debone everything the same day so we roll front or you sell fronts you see a lot of yield losses so it is very significant on the other hand we are working with our key customers to simplify our mix as well so we are deboning less we re putting some simple forms reducing the number of skus so there s a lot of moving parts i think the good news and it s included in your point is that we expect in 2022 that to be resolved we re investing in more automation and we are seeing the labor force and we re seeing the number of applicants increasing already as the governmental assistance is reduced so we expect that 2022 the labor market to be improved from the levels they are today and we believe that with all the operational improvements that we ll do in our business we ll get to a better operation standard let s say to where we are today kenneth bryan zaslow bmo capital markets md of food agribusiness research and food beverage analyst okay and my last question is what prevents pilgrim s pride from getting to the 2017 or that type of level margins in 2022 do you just need the lever to come back is it positioned there already or do you need other things to happen given that you ve progressed on your strategy you ve progressed on your efficiencies the market seems to be going that way is that a way to think about it is it the labor the inhibitant to getting to that 2017 margin structure or is there anything else that we should be thinking about fabio sandri president chief executive officer yes well 2017 was a strong year in the commodity segment but and at the same time we don t have the increase in the feed that we are seeing today with all the disruptions we have in the and the view that we are seeing in the feed side of course you re right on the operational side we have a lot of opportunities given the labor situation where we are in and i think that could create an environment where we get close to 2017 levels but that will also require the supply and demand to be in balance if you look at in terms of supply we re seeing very limited opportunity to increase supplies we don t have any new plants coming online and we still have the hatchability issue that we expect to get something back but not the significant improvements in hatchability that we need to significantly increase the production for next year so we expect the production next year to increase close to 1 to 2 as we are seeing this year it all depends on supply demand ken if we re seeing the economy really strong as we are seeing right now in the retail we expect to continue to be strong and the foodservice is strong yes we can see 2017 level margins kenneth bryan zaslow bmo capital markets md of food agribusiness research and food beverage analyst thank you very much operator thank you this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to fabio sandri for closing for over to you sir fabio sandri president chief executive officer thank you i would like to take this opportunity to speak directly to our team members to thank you for your continued

mahbod nia chief executive officer good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings call i m joined today by david smetana our cfo i m pleased to share that we had another active quarter during which we made significant progress on a number of key initiatives as we seek to unlock value for our shareholders we further simplified our business and strengthened our balance sheet while positioning our assets to maximize their leasing potential and streamlining our internal operations to realize operational cost savings and other ancillary benefits that will anchor us for future success i will discuss each of these in more detail later the us economy appears to be at the beginning of a strong recovery supported by the government stimulus and high vaccination levels the international monetary fund recently raised its 2021 growth projections at 7 the highest level since 1984 however risks remain including market concerns related to rising inflation levels and the potential resurgence of covid infection rates and new variants though we cannot control what the future brings we believe the quality of our multifamily portfolio combined with our live work and play office proposition makes us well positioned to continue capturing leasing demand as the economy reopens and employees return to the office the rebound in economic activity is particularly visible in our multifamily portfolio which now accounts for approximately half of our noi and has seen an incredibly strong resurgence in leasing during the last 90 days our 5 825 unit operating portfolio was 97 5 leased and 94 4 occupied as of july 25 up from 92 8 and 89 7 as of march 31 respectively we have removed concessions across the majority of our properties and have started to increase rents at a number of them turning to development during the quarter we opened a third residential community riverhouse 9 a 295 unit apartment building located in port imperial despite having only recently come online the asset was 60 leased as of july 25 ahead of our internal expectations with respect to both leasing velocity and rent level achieved we also successfully secured strong levels of leasing at our other two recently completed properties as of july 25 the upton in short hills and the capstone at port imperial were 94 and 70 leased respectively our 750 unit apartment building at 25 christopher columbus remains on track for initial occupancy early next year turning to office we are encouraged by the progress we have started to make in leasing in the first six months of the year we signed 87 000 square feet of new leases and lease extensions on the waterfront the waterfront assets are now 75 4 leased up from 74 2 at the end of the first quarter with the growth primarily due to a new 52 000 square foot piece at harborside two and 24 000 square feet of lease renewals or expansions that were signed with harborside two and 101 hudson we also unveiled a repositioned harborside campus anchored by a pedestrianized hudson street recreational areas retail amenities and new jersey s first ever smallest board location all of which have driven plentiful foot traffic to harborside and reinvigorated the campus as both a community hub and workplace solution for the future we also continue to identify ways to advance our sustainability and innovation efforts to become a more environmentally and socially conscious landlord as an initial step in this direction i m pleased to share that all of our electricity usage at our headquarters at harborside 210 is now from fully renewable sources we also remain highly focused on our strategic objectives of simplifying the business and streamlining the balance sheet as illustrated by the disposal of virtually all of our remaining suburban assets during the quarter substantially in line with our pre pandemic valuation expectations in total we sold 387 million or 1 8 million square feet of suburban assets these sales included the short hills portfolio for 255 million the river center portfolio in red bank for 84 million and a wegmans anchored retail center in hanover for 46 million earlier this week we completed the sale of seven giralda farms for 29 million allowing us to fully retire the 150 million term loan moving to operations during the quarter we took steps to establish a more efficient organizational architecture that we expect to result in operational cash cost savings of up to 5 million per annum on a run rate basis we expect these changes along with some targeted technology investments that we are contemplating to have the potential to drive both top line revenue enhancements and further operational efficiencies we also bolstered our team with new talent that we believe will help us achieve our full potential as a best in class multifamily owner and operator jay minchilli a seasoned multifamily operations leader with 16 years of multifamily experience at jpmorgan and carmel a multifamily specialist managing over 40 000 apartments joined us this quarter he will work closely with other members of the team to further optimize our multifamily platform and innovate the needs of our stakeholders while overseeing the third party property management services that we provide to a number of institutional clients with that i m going to hand over to david smetana our chief financial officer who will update you on our financial performance during the quarter david j smetana chief financial officer thank you mahbod we reported core ffo per share for the quarter of 0 15 versus 0 28 per share in the prior year the year over year reduction in core ffo per share was primarily due to the impact of our suburban office asset sales program and effects of the pandemic on hotel parking and multifamily operations this quarter our team drove significant improvements in multifamily operations underpinned by increasing occupancy net effective rents have stabilized due to lower concessions and we are now beginning to show sequential revenue growth on a sequential same store basis we reported a revenue increase of 1 5 and a sequential same store noi increase of 1 4 also in the quarter we received our share of the sale proceeds from the urby tax credit of 2 6 million which was included in core ffo historically this credit was received in the third quarter the waterfront office leasing team continued their efforts to reinvigorate the portfolio resulting in 76 000 square feet leased compared to 58 000 square feet leased last quarter the waterfront portfolio incurred a cash same store noi reduction of 9 6 largely attributable to decreased parking income year over year and previously announced tenant move outs gaap same store noi increased by 2 5 due primarily to prior year s straight line rent write downs for the balance of 2021 we have approximately 190 000 square feet of our waterfront office leases remaining to expire 44 000 square feet of which relate to the additional td ameritrade move outs at harborside six in the fourth quarter and 100 000 square feet of which relate to a natixis move out at harborside five at the end of july looking ahead 2022 has a manageable lease role with only 100 000 square feet expiring and no single lease greater than 26 000 square feet set to expire i d now like to take a moment to provide an overview of our current portfolio it is currently comprised of 21 operating class a multifamily assets which produced approximately 53 of our pro rata noi one multifamily project in construction our six waterfront office assets two remaining suburban office assets one of which is in discontinued operations our two hotels in a land bank comprising 14 development sites as our multifamily development pipeline stabilizes we expect to have embedded noi growth gradually begin to contribute to earnings we will also continue to derive incremental income as occupancy rises and concessions burn off in our multifamily operating portfolio turning to the balance sheet in the second quarter booked 300 million april 22 bond issue and the 275 million may 23 unsecured bonds were retired with proceeds from the sale of our suburban office portfolios simultaneous with the retirement of the bonds we entered into a new revolving credit facility and 150 million term loan with the closing of seven giralda farms earlier in the week our term loan has now been fully repaid further derisking our balance sheet we are left with a favorable debt maturity schedule with a single 3 8 million mortgage maturity in 2021 and only one maturity in 2022 related to our successful class a apartment construction loan totaling 74 million which has a one year extension if needed we are pleased with the progress we have made on our balance sheet and the flexibility our new credit line provides us as we continue executing on our strategic objectives this concludes our prepared remarks operator can we open the call for q a questions and answers operator thank you we can now take our first question it comes from manny korchman of citi your line is open please go ahead manny korchman citi analyst good morning office concessions remain elevated as witnessing your leasing is that sort of the new normal for now and when do you expect those to come back down mahbod nia chief executive officer good morning manny thanks for the question yes i think the concessions obviously are elevated relative to pre covid levels but certainly if you look at the package that we offered on the that mgm lease really there there was a very minimal rent free that was granted so really the majority of the concessions really went into the ti package so we re leasing at levels that are accretive to the business from a value perspective and from an earnings perspective massive incentives we re pleased to or encouraged really to have started to see some traction on that front and hope to see that continue manny korchman citi analyst great and then mahbod during our meeting at nareit you spoke about expanding the multifamily platform outside of sort of the core in new jersey and maybe new jersey plus base what are you saying on that is that something you re actively pursuing at the moment mahbod nia chief executive officer yes i would say really that the comment was more centered around concentration risk and whether to the extent that we do gravitate more toward becoming a multifamily reit whether we should be more concentrated in our current markets or look to new markets and we have a presence in boston as you know there are some interesting dynamics on the job and earnings growth front and general economic front in that market and then a couple of others in that northeast corridor so we re at the point where we re really evaluating potential options for us in the future but no conclusive decisions have been made at this point manny korchman citi analyst thank you mahbod nia chief executive officer thank you manny operator thank you we can now move along to our next question it comes from brian spahn of evercore your line is open sir please go ahead brian spahn evercore analyst okay thank you good morning mahbod nia chief executive officer good morning brian spahn evercore analyst could you maybe just talk about leasing interest at the waterfront what does the pipeline of activity look like there s a bit of acceleration in the quarter so just kind of can you add some color on what s in the pipeline in terms of types of tenant size industry mahbod nia chief executive officer sure i think certainly with the investment that we ve made into the waterfront onto the harborside complex the sense of the place making initiatives that we ve implemented it really is a live work play campus now that coupled with the fact that we have a pretty diverse offering in terms of the type of space that we have available for tenants means that it s a pretty varied and diverse group of tenants that are showing an interest and so without getting specific it is pretty diverse it s financial services professional services insurance technology advertising entertainment it s really pretty broad and the requirements are pretty diverse as well brian spahn evercore analyst great ok and then i guess just switching over to multifamily with the apartments leased over 94 as of a few days ago you talked about tapering back concessions and starting to be able to push rents how aggressive do you think you can get given current market conditions and where do you plan on settling out on the occupancy front there mahbod nia chief executive officer yes it s a good question it really i would say we having tapered that concessions on substantially all of the assets and having reached leasing of 97 5 occupancies at just over 94 we are at that inflection point now where the next natural phase and the evolution of the story should be rental growth so on a very case specific basis we ll be working closely with the team and on the ground to assess what s feasible but certainly it s an encouraging sign the rebound really in occupancy and leasing over the last quarter and we still haven t seen all the constituents that would reside in our apartments return yet so with the borders being shut and office returns still being more of a sort of post september labor day type of an event generally speaking we would hope with the borders opening overseas students returning and a wider return to the office there s still more momentum on the demand side that could help us realize the rental growth brian spahn evercore analyst okay great color and lastly dave is there anything left on the suburban office front in terms of sales or is that completed david j smetana chief financial officer yes thanks brian good question so i want to make sure everybody understands where all the assets remaining assets are accounted for so there are technically two suburban office assets left for gatehall which is under contract and held in discontinued operations and our 23 main street asset which is really a big office campus which ultimately may turn into a land play may not but that one will probably be around with us a little bit longer than for gatehall but we re down to two remaining suburban office assets so really the focus and you can see in our bullets and on the call is on the waterfront and the leasing momentum there brian spahn evercore analyst great thanks very much operator thank you we can now move to our next question it comes from jamie feldman of bank of america your line is open please go ahead jamie feldman bank of america analyst i guess just a follow up so for gatehall is that on the market now or you re not marketing that just yet david j smetana chief financial officer it is it s currently under contract jamie feldman bank of america analyst okay and looking at the giralda farms cap rate 10 i know the i know it s 60 ish leased i mean do you expect something similar for this asset or lower david j smetana chief financial officer both these assets are located in the parsippany and giralda submarkets which have a lot of sublease space due to a couple of mergers of some big pharma companies so we re not going to give cap rate guidance but the price per square foot should be in the same price per square foot is a decent way to think about that last remaining sale jamie feldman bank of america analyst okay thank you and mahbod had mentioned talking about the cost savings and maybe some of the platform improvements technology investment can you just talk a little bit more about what you guys have in mind and how that might help the business mahbod nia chief executive officer sure good morning jamie well so as you know we have an established multifamily operations platform we manage our own assets we manage assets for a number of blue chip institutions as well so the steps that we ve taken are really on the one hand to just further optimize and enhance the operational efficiency within which we operate internally and then equally importantly really to ensure that we remain ahead of the curve in terms of achieving our objective of being a best in class owner operator in that sector and so with that there are a number of initial changes as i talked about the organizational architecture and hiring in jay minchilli who i believe will be tremendous at leading that effort for us and some of the changes that i mentioned on the technology side will be targeted at the revenue side and more effectively monitoring and managing controlling the revenue side of the business and some of them will be more focused on the cost side so they re incremental we already have a platform it works well it s validated by others who rely on us to manage assets for them but we really want to make sure we remain best in class and that we re really at the leading edge of the market when it comes to utilizing technology and in the way that we operate our assets that s really what that s targeted at jamie feldman bank of america analyst okay and then david and then when you think about the core portfolio excluding those two suburban assets it sounds like you still have the td move out in natixis in the back half of the year 22 probably less and when do you think noi bottoms because it sounds like you are feeling pretty good about the apartment pickup david j smetana chief financial officer yes sorry jamie do you have me without the feedback now apologize jamie feldman bank of america analyst yes now you re good brilliant david j smetana chief financial officer all right so a good question so and we have a couple of countervailing forces i highlighted the move outs which are well known of natixis at the end of this month and then another 44 000 square feet from td ameritrade so to the positive we do we are starting to see a recovery in parking income albeit slight and our hotels and we have our multifamily development pipeline coming online coupled with now sequential growth in our residential portfolio so i think putting that all together i think we re seeing ebitda starting to bottom toward the end of this year and grow going into next year but this is kind of the peak of the dilution as we re finishing up the suburban office asset sales and these couple of big move outs which we ve been trying to notify everybody about for a couple of quarters in a row now jamie feldman bank of america analyst okay that s helpful and then just to confirm you re saying on the waterfront in 22 you really have nothing meaningful moving out david j smetana chief financial officer yes and i highlighted in prepared remarks there s a 100 000 square feet total in our largest lease rolling this 26 000 square feet so nothing like the large tenant move outs we had this year in 2021 jamie feldman bank of america analyst okay all right great thank you operator thank you we can now move along to our next question it comes from tom catherwood of btig your line is open please go ahead tom catherwood btig analyst thank you good morning everyone dave just wanted to swing back i appreciate the comments on the suburban office sales and the two remaining assets there as we think though kind of about the track for repaying the remaining secured line of credit is there anything else besides just the operating office that s kind of in the noncore sales bucket things like remaining office land maybe any of the non core land within roseland or anything else that was non core kind of like the wegmans center is there anything else besides office that s going to come out to help kind of alleviate the balance of that debt david j smetana chief financial officer yes great question tom and you know the company well that s right we have the remaining two suburban office assets we have some land over on the mack cali s side some perhaps excess land on the roseland side and i think we ve messaged to yourself and many of that hotels probably are not part of our long term kind of operating core portfolio so those in total should be able to take care of the remaining line balance tom catherwood btig analyst got it appreciate that dave and then when we look at office leasing obviously new jersey put its emerge new jersey incentive program in not too long ago any sense on when those benefits could kind of start flowing in and do you expect them to have a positive uptick beyond what was obviously a positive quarter on the office leasing front mahbod nia chief executive officer good morning tom let me take that so it s definitely made a difference i would say in terms of helping further enhance the appeal of a jersey city so tenants obviously to varying degrees will qualify for it but it can be a pretty meaningful subsidy and can make it even more appealing from a pure financial perspective for tenants to relocate there so we re very pleased that it s been introduced at the beginning of this year we do think it s already making a difference i think we just need the mobile widespread return to the office plan to continue as it appears to be today and i m sure we ll see the benefits of that come through tom catherwood btig analyst appreciate that mahbod and then last question for me and i know it s tough to ask about retail especially as things are just kind of starting to reopen but if we look at your office business segment there s 190 000 square feet plus of retail among a variety of buildings it s not generating any noi right now what are your kind of thoughts as far as filling that space up utilizing that space and as the reopening continues and then what could that ultimately generate in terms of earnings for you as it stabilizes david j smetana chief financial officer yes tom it s david so on retail a couple of things you re starting to see in the quarter our base building office tenants the ones that we do have are starting to come back to us get current on rents so we have some write ups there and the larger kind of retail footprint we have in the base of harborside we view that space as really amenity to the office as the occupancy picks up and our leasing guys want to get it at least as well to help induce our office tenants we ll start to see more impact from the retail but we want to go slowly on that now and make sure we get the right tenants but i would not be modeling in any big pickup from a retail contribution but when you re in jersey city you will start to see increased retail leasing but we re going to hold off on really modeling that retail income coming in tom catherwood btig analyst understood appreciate it thanks everyone mahbod nia chief executive officer thank you operator thank you that concludes our q a session i can now hand the call back to the speakers for any additional or concluding remarks thank you mahbod nia chief executive officer thank you everyone for joining us this

per share of 0 66 which represents 20 growth over the prior period or 60 growth excluding significant items in both periods sales activity remains strong and we have exceeded pre pandemic levels in a number of areas total life and health nap was up 35 over the second quarter of 2020 and up 10 relative to 2019 levels our results also benefited from ongoing deferral of medical care which boost our health margins solid alternative investment performance and continued share repurchase activity premium collections remain strong in our underlying margins excluding covid impacts performed well as expected our capital and liquidity remain conservatively positioned we ended the quarter with an rbc ratio of 409 and 336 million in cash at the holding company while also returning 105 million to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends we continue to execute well against our strategic priorities specifically successfully implementing our strategic transformation that we initiated in january 2020 growing the business profitably launching new products and services expanding to the right to slightly younger wealthier consumers within the middle income market and deploying excess capital to its highest and best use turning to slide 5 and our growth scorecard as was the case for 6 consecutive quarters prior to the pandemic all 5 of our scorecard metrics were up year over year life sales remained strong fueled by continued momentum in both our direct to consumer and exclusive field agent channels overall health sales were up almost 90 over the prior period which reflected the first full quarter of the pandemic when state home restrictions were first instituted total collected life and health premiums were up 1 this reflects continued solid growth in life nap and persistency of our customer base offset as expected by lower medicare supplement premiums annuity collected premiums were up 42 year over year relative to the second quarter of 2019 annuity collected premiums were up 1 client assets in brokerage and advisory grew 33 year over year to 2 6 billion fueled by new accounts which were up 13 net client asset inflows and market value appreciation sequentially client assets grew 8 fee revenue was up 50 year over year to 31 million reflecting growth in 3rd party sales growth within our broker dealer and registered investment advisor and the inclusion of directpath results turning to our consumer division on slide 6 we continue to leverage our cross channel sales program our hybrid sales and service model which blend virtual engagement with our local field exclusive field agents has led to significant improvements in lead conversion rates customer acquisition costs and sales product life and health sales were up 32 over the prior period and 19 over the same period in 2019 life sales climbed 8 for the quarter to over 50 million reflecting the 6th consecutive quarter of year over year growth direct to consumer life sales were level with the record production in the prior period life sales generated by our exclusive field agents were up 23 and comprised over 40 of our total life sales leads from our direct to consumer business supported this growth within our health product lines supplemental health and long term care sales saw healthy growth over both the second quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2019 these results benefited from initiatives that enable our products to be sold through multiple channels our 3rd party medicare advantage party sales were up 20 in the second quarter medicare supplement sales remain challenged med sales were up modestly over the first quarter however as discussed in previous quarters our market is experiencing a secular shift away from medicare supplement and toward medicare advantage we continue to invest in both our medicare supplement and medicare advantage offerings to ensure we are well positioned to meet our customers needs and preferences consistent with the first quarter roughly 50 of our consumer division life and health sales were completed virtually consumer selecting to engage virtually held steady even as communities reopened and vaccination rates increase this is a profound change in how we connect with consumers and further validate the transformation we initiated in january of 2020 it will continue to have significant implications for our business going forward among other things this change expand our agents ability to interact with customers across a broader geographic area as i mentioned annuity collected premiums were up 42 as compared to the prior year and up 1 versus 2019 the number of new annuity accounts grew 16 and the average annuity policy size rose 14 our portfolio of index annuity products continues to be well received by our middle market consumers our recently launched guaranteed lifetime income annuity plus was a key contributor to our second quarter annuity sales growth of course we continue to maintain strict pricing discipline on our annuities to balance sales growth and profitability participation rates and other terms are reviewed regularly to reflect current macro environment conditions client assets and brokerage and advisory grew 33 year over year and 8 sequential to 2 6 billion in the second quarter combined with our annuity account values we now manage 12 7 billion of assets for our clients this has fundamentally shifted the relationship we have with our customer base unlike some insurance products which can be transactional in nature investment products tend to create deeper and longer lasting customer relationships we continue to reap the benefits of the shift in the agent recruiting strategy that we initiated several years ago we now rely more heavily on targeted recruiting approaches including personal referrals this has periodically resulted in fewer new agent recruits however the new agents we appoint are more likely to succeed and stay with us over time relative to the year ago period our producing agent count increased 7 sequentially our producing agent count was down slightly but overall our agent force remained stable our securities licensed registered agent force was up 6 improvements in agent productivity had became more important driver of our sales growth then agent count in recent quarters and we have significant runway for future growth turning to slide 7 in our worksite division it looks like sales were up sharply in the second quarter as compared to the year ago period we expect to approach 2019 sales levels when access to workplaces improves ongoing pilots and programs to target new employer groups offer new services and capture new business continue to progress retention of our existing customers also remained strong with continued stable levels of employee persistency our producing agent count was up 15 year over year and 7 sequentially recall that we slowed our agent recruiting during the pandemic due to workplace restrictions as a result agent count remains down nearly 40 from pre covid levels to help boost recruitment and support a return on to pre covid production levels we are rolling out a field agent referral program this program is designed similarly to our successful consumer division program relative to 2019 levels our veteran agent count is up 7 retention in productivity levels among our veteran agents who have been with us for more than 3 years remains very strong these agents have been the driving force behind our recent sales momentum and are expected to be instrumental in helping to rebuild our overall agent force few revenue generated from our business is more than doubled in the quarter due to the directpath acquisition feedback has been strong surrounding the unique combination of products and services we can now bring to the worksite market we are realizing early cross sale successes between web benefits design and directpath and the pipeline continues to grow along with strong client retention these business has also generated double digit increases over both 2020 and 2019 in various metrics turning to slide 8 our robust free cash flow enabled us to return 105 million to shareholders in the second quarter including 87 million in share buybacks we also raised our dividend 8 in may and 9 consecutive annual increase our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged we intend to deploy 100 of our excess capital to its highest and best use over time while share repurchases form a critical component of our strategy organic and inorganic investments also play an important role and with that i ll turn it over to paul paul h mcdonough chief financial officer thanks gary and good morning everyone turning to the financial highlights on slide 9 operating earnings per share were up 20 year over year and up 60 excluding significant items the results for the quarter reflect solid underlying insurance margins ongoing net favorable covid related impacts strong alternative investment performance and continued disciplined capital management over the last 4 quarters we have deployed 337 million of excess capital on share repurchases reducing weighted average shares outstanding by 7 return on equity improved 90 basis points in the 12 months ending june 30 2021 compared to the prior year period the sum of expenses allocated to products and not allocated to products excluding significant items increased by about 6 million sequentially driven by incentive compensation accrual adjustments related to earnings outperformance in the first half of the year the increase in expenses over the prior year period also reflects lower a management expenses in 2020 due to covid related restrictions and the june 30 2020 conclusion of a transition services agreement related to the long term care reinsurance transaction completed in 2018 in general our expenses continue to reflect both expense discipline and operational efficiency on the one hand and continued targeted growth investments on the other hand turning to slide 10 insurance product margin in the second quarter was up 17 million or 8 excluding significant items net covid impacts were 21 million favorable in the quarter as compared to 6 million unfavorable in the prior year period excluding covid impacts margins in the quarter remained solid and stable across the product portfolio the net favorable covid impacts in the quarter reflect continued favorable claims experience in our healthcare products particularly impacting medicare supplement and long term care due primarily to continued deferral of care this was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of covid related mortality in our life products the favorable covid impact in the quarter exceeded our expectations as the outlook that we provided on our april earnings call assume that healthcare claims would begin to normalize in the second quarter including an initial spike in claims due to pent up demand that did not materialize in the quarter regarding our annuity margin recall that in the second quarter of 2020 we saw a favorable mortality in our other annuities block unrelated to covid which translated to 10 million of positive impacts as we noted at the time this resulted from a handful of terminations and large structured settlement policy which we expect from time to time in this block but not on a regular basis turning to slide 11 investment income allocated to products was essentially flat in the period as growth in the net liabilities and related assets was mostly offset by a decline in yield investment income not allocated to products which is where the variable components of investment income flow through increased 40 million reflecting a solid gain in the current period and our alternative investment portfolio and a loss on that portfolio in the prior year period recall that we report our alternative investments on a 1 4 lag our new money rate of 3 38 for the quarter was lower sequentially reflecting a continuation of our up in quality bias from the first quarter and continued spread tightening in general partially offset by higher average underlying treasury rate in the second quarter versus the first quarter our new investments comprised 1 1 billion of assets with an average rating of single a and an average duration of 16 years this higher level of new investment reflected reinvestment of maturing assets and a higher level of prepayment activity in the period our new investments are summarized in more detail on slide 22 and 23 of the earnings presentation turning to slide 12 at quarter end our invested assets totaled 28 billion up 8 year over year approximately 96 of our fixed maturity portfolio is investment grade rated with an average rating of single a this allocation to single a rated holdings is up 200 basis points sequentially the bbb allocation comprised 39 4 of our fixed income maturities down 140 basis points both year over year and sequentially we are actively managing our bbb portfolio to optimize our risk adjusted returns to the extent suitable and attractive opportunities develop we may over time balance recent up an quality bias with a modest increase in allocation to alternatives asset backed securities closed or investment grade emerging market security turning to slide 13 we continue to generate strong free cash flow to the holding company in the sector with excess cash flow 114 million or 128 of operating income for the quarter and 432 million or 119 of operating income on a trailing 12 month basis turning to slide 14 at quarter end our consolidated rbc ratio is 409 which represents approximately 45 million of excess capital relative to the high end of our target range of 375 to 400 our holdco liquidity at quarter end was 336 million which represents 186 million of excess capital relative to our target minimum holdco liquidity of 150 million even after returning 105 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter our excess capital grew by approximately 22 million from march 31 to june 30 of this year this primarily reflects the strength of our operating results in the quarter and the recent up in quality bias in our investment portfolio turning to slide 15 while uncertainty related to covid continues we believe it is very unlikely that any future covid scenario would cause our capital and liquidity to fall below our target levels for that reason we are no longer running a formal adverse case scenario as we had been doing through the first quarter of this year instead we are updating a single base case scenario or forecast with upside and downside risks to that forecast in our most recent forecast we expect a continuation of the sales momentum we ve seen in the past 5 quarters we expect a modest net favorable covid related mortality and morbidity impact on our insurance product margin for the balance of 2021 and the modest net unfavorable impact in 2022 this assumes that covid deaths do not worsen in the second half of this year and that healthcare claims begin to normalize after a brief spike beginning in the 3rd quarter due to pent up demand from deferral of care when and if a spike actually occurs and when our health product claims actually normalize is highly uncertain so far we have seen some intra quarter volatility in our health claims during the pandemic but nothing that has persisted long enough to establish a trend on the mortality side impacting our life products the number of covid deaths we will see for the next several quarters is also uncertain given the recent rise in infections largely from the delta variant and the potential for material impacts from additional variants certainly one of the biggest risks to our forecast is how exactly covid will evolve from here but again we believe however it evolves it represents an earnings event for us favorable or unfavorable not the capital or liquidity of that assuming no shift in interest rates we expect net investment income allocated to product to remain relatively flat in this base forecast as growth in assets is offset by lower yields reflective of both the lower interest rate environment and are up in quality shift in asset allocation in general we expect alternative investments to revert to a mean annualized return of between 7 and 8 at some point and over the long term but the actual results will certainly be more variable with likely more upside potential than downside in the near term given the current economic outlook we expect fee income to be modestly favorable to the prior year as we grow our 3rd party med advantage distribution and improve the unit economics of that business growth in web benefits design earnings and the inclusion of directpath will also contribute to fee income we expect the sum of our quarterly allocated and not allocated expenses tax significant items for balance of the year to be generally consistent with levels reported in the first quarter of this year allowing for some quarterly volatility and finally as covid related uncertainty diminishes which is certainly will at some point we expect to manage our capital and liquidity closer to target levels reducing our excess capital over time and with that i ll turn it back over to gary gary c bhojwani chief executive officer thank you paul we are pleased with the healthy results we ve generated this quarter and in the first half of the year the strength of our diversified business model and the steady execution of our strategic priorities and organizational transformation underpin that success the consumer division has met or exceeded pre pandemic performance and our worksite division is making meaningful progress as we enter the second half of the year we remain squarely focused on maintaining our growth momentum building upon our competitive advantages and managing the business to optimize profitability cash flows and long term value for our shareholders we thank you for your support and interest in cno please continue to take care of your health including vaccinations for those that are eligible stay safe we will now open it up for questions operator questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of colin johnson with b riley securities colin johnson b riley securities hey thanks good morning thanks for taking my question just first wondering given that deferral of care had contributed favorably in the quarter despite the fact that may be coming into the quarter we expected that to abate as things reopen further if any insight as to maybe why that might have been taking place why we would have been seeing a slower resumption of care than otherwise expected on the part of the consumer gary c bhojwani chief executive officer thank you for the question the short answer is we ve got a bunch of theories i don t know if we have anything that i would point to is being hard and fast but i m happy to share with you some of the theories we ve heard and seen first is some consumers are still afraid to go back to see their doctors some consumers have conditions that they would have otherwise thought healthcare on but those conditions passed some of the consumer that would have gone to see doctors now they themselves have unfortunately passed there are a variety of other things that the short answer lee from i haven t seen anything that says here s exactly what happened we know that fewer people are seeking healthcare and our healthcare claims results benefit as a result but i ve seen more theories then i can tell you what to do with in terms of what exactly is the underlying explanation colin johnson b riley securities okay thanks that s helpful and then kind of looking at new annualized premium i think this is the second quarter now that we re about half of the life and health nap work digital do you think that that number presents maybe longer term equilibrium percentage so to speak or there might be more room to the upside with respect to that gary c bhojwani chief executive officer i think there is more this is gary i think there is more room to the upside on that the one thing i want to be transparent about some of this depends on how you define it so let s say you re sitting in some city in iowa and you buy a policy from an agent who is also in iowa but that interaction takes place over a zoom call and you complete the paperwork via email now the agent is there locally and is happy to meet at your kitchen table but you happen to do all of the digitally and that particular product is completed as i described visually but the next product they sell they come to see you at your kitchen table is that a digital relationship or what was that and i share that with you because we re watching this evolve much more quickly than we expected but the bottom line for all of our shareholders we expect an increasing number of interactions to take place virtually but not to the exclusion of that in person interaction at some level i want our consumers to interact with our agents in person because that s one of our differentiating characteristics that s one of the things that we can do that others cannot we can do both so i want consumers that want some of both but the short answer is we that the number of digital interactions will continue to grow colin johnson b riley securities got it thank you and just as a follow on so as digital the number of digital sales potentially arises do you think that could have any sort of a positive impact on operating expenses a digital sales versus one in person gary c bhojwani chief executive officer i think over time it will over time a given agent should be able to increase their productivity they can cover broader geographic area and so that should definitely help us i want to emphasize the over time part because it s important to remember that in the near term we re investing in certain technologies and training so it will take time for all these to work its way through paul do you want to add anything that paul h mcdonough chief financial officer the only thing i d say is that i think we re at a position now where as we continue to grow the business and sustain that growth over time we ll get better operating leverage from our expense base which has the potential to grow earnings and improve roe colin johnson b riley securities okay thank you that s helpful these were all my questions operator your next question comes from the line of humphrey lee with dowling and partners humphrey lee dowling partners good morning thank you for taking my questions a question for paul looking at the annuity earnings and margin specifically for fixing back annuities they were very strong in the quarter just wondering was there some sort of going to market benefits running through the numbers for this quarter and if so can you provide some color in terms of what the normalized margin would be followed for the fia paul h mcdonough chief financial officer sure good morning humphrey so the sequential improvement in the annuities margin is reflective of market conditions creating favorable option impacts so just to drill down a bit higher equities lower treasuries and lower volatility created situation where the value of the option assets increases in value more in the embedded derivative reserve and just to be clear this is really it s an accounting and phenomenon if you will we would expect that the favorable trends to moderate the trends between q1 and q2 to moderate depending on market conditions in terms of longer term sort of run rate trends i would just point to our disclosure over the last couple of years and i think if you look at that there is a noticable sort of underlying run rate humphrey lee dowling partners okay got it my second question is related to your fee revenue growth which was very impressive up 50 year over year can you provide some color in terms of what s the driver for that growth and how much was there was from adding directpath versus the growth of your existing a fee based business paul h mcdonough chief financial officer yeah the biggest driver is directpath but we are also seeing growth in the fee revenue related to distribution of med advantage and from wbd humphrey lee dowling partners so as we think about like normally first quarter and 4th quarter tend to be your higher of fee revenue quarters and that used to be kind of 30 million ish so now because with the second quarter you kind of had 30 million now how should we think about that seasonality gary c bhojwani chief executive officer i think you should continue to expect the seasonality will follow the annual enrollment period which is q2 q3 q4 because remember the med advantage policies we sell during the annual enrollment period is fee income humphrey lee dowling partners but so is the 30 million count now come that the new run rate going forward for low seasonality quarters paul h mcdonough chief financial officer yes certainly q2 of this year includes a full quarter of directpath wbd and on the m a distribution humphrey lee dowling partners okay got it thank you paul h mcdonough chief financial officer yeah operator your next question comes from the line of jack meyer with autonomous research erik bass autonomous research hi this is actually erik bass first is do you have an estimate for the rbc ratio impact of adopting the naics new c1 factors and will you make any changes to your rbc target range as a result of this paul h mcdonough chief financial officer good morning eric so the impact of the new c1 factors as of june 30 pro forma all else equal is about 16 points on our rbc which translates to about 80 million of capital there is some things that we could do in the investment portfolio that s sort of arbitrage is the the new risk factors and that improves the 16 basis points by a couple of points as to how we think about it i think it s evolving i ve seen some speculation in the analyst community that some companies will simply reduce their target rbcs we re in the process of doing some an analysis with our own internal capital models to drive how we re thinking about it so i d like to come back to this question on a future call as to whether we ll reduce sort of formally reduce our target by some amount either the entire sort of adjusted 16 or something less than that i also think it will be helpful to continue our dialog with the rating agencies to better understand how they think about it so more to come on this but that s the pro forma all else equal impact erik bass autonomous research got it that s helpful thank you and then maybe moving kind of sales and earnings i mean your sales obviously had a nice recovery and as you noted are back to pre pandemic levels at least in the consumer business are you now at a level of sales where the enforce block is growing for most products and if so should this start to translate into faster organic earnings growth paul h mcdonough chief financial officer yes so we re at the in force block has been relatively flat looking backwards but i think we re now at a point with our expense base and with our growth profile that as we continue to grow that business and that s sustainable and we certainly think that it is we ll begin to get better operating leverage going forward erik bass autonomous research got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john barnidge with piper sandler john barnidge piper sandler yeah thank you for the opportunity you re at 183 million in buybacks for the year clearly a good cadence but down linked quarter the stock declined obviously a little bit but can you think about can you talk about how you re thinking about capital return a little bit more on the balance of the year gary c bhojwani chief executive officer yeah sure john this is gary thanks for the question i ll give you some high level thoughts and then if paul wants to share any more details i ll let him give but i ll start us out so some of this for those of user been long term participants of this call some of this is going to be a repeat of what you ve heard from me before in terms of my thought process but i would just remind you of a few factors number one we don t have any incentive to hold excess capital if you look at our incentive comp plans and everything else we have no incentive to hold excess capital we have has historically at least since i ve been in the chair of ceo which i can go 15th quarter now particularly quarter i have declined to provide specific guidance but instead talked about our capacity and then asked all of our shareholders and analysts to judge us by our actions not our words and during the time i ve been ceo we bought back stock every single quarter except one and with the benefit of hindsight everyone realizes the one quarter we didn t was to fund the ltc s transaction so again i ask you to judge us by our actions not our words in terms of where we are right now i think about this quarter in particular and any in the first half of the year and a really simple way i really like where we re positioned in terms of our capital i like the fact that given all the uncertainty with covid we re still conservatively positioned i like the fact that despite that we were able to invest in growth we made some investments in terms of certain technologies and abilities as well as the directpath acquisition and despite that both quarters 2021 we were able to return a nice amount of money 100 million and 87 million to our shareholders in the first quarter the second quarter as to the specific amounts in any given quarter one of the things the factors into this analysis is how we think about price not surprisingly the members of management we believe that the intrinsic value is well above the gaap book value but that doesn t change the reality that when we buy shares at 95 of book value say versus 80 percent of book value the benefit is different i think our long term shareholders would prefer to see us buy more stock when it s at 80 a books and say at 95 a book not because of any commentary on the belief in the company but just because of the accounting treatment how it benefits us so i think what you saw happen from q1 to q2 when the stock is trading lower we ll buy more when the stock s trading higher will buy less and i want to emphasize that a commentary on our view of the intrinsic value of the firm rather it s a simple recognition of the accounting treatment and the greater discount to book ie the cheaper the stock is the more we ll buy so i wouldn t read into that small delta of 13 million between q1 and q2 as anything meaningful it s nothing more than an acknowledgment of where the stock is trading john barnidge piper sandler okay that s fantastic thank you gary c bhojwani chief executive officer i think just in case paul wants to add anything paul you want to paul h mcdonough chief financial officer no i think that captures it gary c bhojwani chief executive officer okay go ahead john john barnidge piper sandler alright yeah thanks gary and then the follow up safe to say claims tailwind persisted to a greater level than initially expected can you talk about maybe how each month of the quarter progressed and how you re thinking about it run rating into the 3rd quarter paul h mcdonough chief financial officer yeah john this is paul i d say broadly speaking there has been there has been some volatility from month to month over the course of the pandemic going back a year going back more than a year now within an individual product line yeah you might have a month where it s up and in the next month it s down but it s been relatively stable there is certainly not in any persistent trend up toward more normal levels as we said in our outlook through the 3rd quarter in a row we think it s going to begin to trend up toward more normal levels the next quarter and we ll see i think that if our base case assumption holds that we don t see another spike in material spike in infections and deaths and i think that s a reasonable expectation if we do see another spike in infection and death it s probably not but it also doesn t necessarily mean that we ll have the same behavior by consumers that we ve seen so far in other words there is a possible scenario where spike again and you have the mortality impact but consumers say you know what i need to get back to my doctor s office and they begin doing that so i guess i d just emphasize that how things actually evolve is very uncertain and i wouldn t pretend to know exactly what that may look like gary c bhojwani chief executive officer john this is gary the only thing i d add to that i think what you re hearing from us we don t know we ve been surprised as paul indicated for the 3rd quarter in a row we thought claims to come back and they did so we simply don t know but we keep trying to send the signal then take a conservative position because we feel like that s our obligation to try and say hey we think it will come back next quarter the reality is especially that now that we ve been wrong for 3 in a row i wouldn t even know how to give you how the likelihood is that it s actually going to come back we just don t know but we re trying to be as conservative as we can john barnidge piper sandler no that s helpful i guess it s like a ping pong ball you ll have all these assumptions and they ve done a day it s going to land further on one side of the other based on an average so i appreciate that that s all from my questions best of luck gary c bhojwani chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ryan krueger with kbw ryan krueger keefe bruyette woods hey good morning i was hoping you could talk a little bit about recruiting trends some of your peers have talked about in some challenges in terms of recruiting due to tight labor conditions i know you ve also been shifting away or shifting some of the sort of the recruit so just hoping for some commentary there gary c bhojwani chief executive officer yeah thanks thanks for the question ryan i ve been involved in a handful of other groups both within the insurance industry and other industries with other business leaders i don t know a ceo out there right now that s not worried about ability to get labor every single ceo i ve talked to regardless of industry has expressed concerns over the tightness of the labor market and how difficult it is to get help so we are absolutely no exception in that regard one could argue that some of that trend is even more difficult for us because remember our agents work on a commission basis they eat what they kill they don t sell anything they don t make money now we have support programs and so on early on but those difficulties are absolutely hitting our business frankly we got very lucky a couple of years ago we started to make a move to de emphasize just a raw number of recruits and instead try and focus on more targeted recruiting with an idea that would benefit our productivity and our tenure even if we didn t grow the topline in terms of agent count quite as much so we re staying consistent with our strategy i think that strategy is really good in this environment and again just out a pure luck we started a few years ago so we re well into that we re going to stay on that path you ll see us continuing to emphasize productivity we of course do need to grow agents but i am less focused on that are more focused on productivity and tenure and if you could look at our numbers you can see that on both of those metrics we ve done a pretty reasonable job and we ll continue to do that but right agent count will continue to be challenging no question about it ryan krueger keefe bruyette woods got it and then can you comment at all on persistency trends you ve seen in the life and health business through the pandemic if you ve seen any benefit to persistency i guess maybe particularly in the life business as you ve gone through the last couple of years now paul h mcdonough chief financial officer sure hey ryan good morning yeah the persistency really across our product portfolio through the pandemic has been relatively stable a little volatility here and there that has driven some pluses and minuses on the margin but by and large it s remained relatively consistent with pre covid experience ryan krueger keefe bruyette woods great thank you operator so at this time there are no further questions i will turn the call back over to jennifer childe for closing remarks jennifer childe vice president of investor relations thanks very much for your participation in the call we look forward to speaking

thank you operator good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on our call to review our second quarter 2021 results and to discuss our recent alaska communications acquisition with me here is michael prior as chief executive officer during this call i ll cover the relevant financial information and as michael as usual will provide an update on the business and outlook before i turn the call over to michael for his comments i d like to point out that this call and our press release contains forward looking statements relating to concerning our current expectations objectives and underlying assumptions regarding our future operating results and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described also in an effort to provide useful information to investors our comments today include non gaap financial measures for detail on these measures and reconciliations to comparable gaap measures and to for further information regarding the factors that may affect our future operating results please refer to our earnings release on our website at atni com or to the eight k filing provided to the sec i should also note the sec filings for alaska communications up through the first quarter of 2021 can be found on the website alsk com and we re still finalizing the business fiscal purchase accounting and expect to file our eight k that will include the pro forma financial results around the end of september and with that i ll turn the call over to michael michael t prior president and chief executive officer thank you justin we are pleased to close the acquisition of alaska communications last week more or less on the time line we expected as we have discussed on previous calls we are excited about both the near and long term opportunities here and thinking this is an excellent fit from our operating portfolio and extension of our core business strategy which is building and operating critical communications infrastructure into more remote and challenging markets where we can maintain a long term competitive advantage i will provide more thoughts on this addition shortly otherwise our existing businesses performed well overall for the quarter with solid revenue growth led by broadband and global additions we did of course experience higher year on year expenses against an extraordinarily low in the second quarter last year when many expenses were usually reduced or mitigated by government action added to that were expense increases in several categories including regulatory and some unusual expenses which we don t expect to continue into the current quarter including a legal accrual so i ll turn it back to alaska for the past few years this business has had good success growing its business and wholesale revenue which now represents over 2 3 of revenue and much of that is under multiyear contracts we expect that strategy and success to continue as we leverage fiber facilities built on an anchor tenant return model and look broad opportunities to generate incremental cash flows on those facilities at the same time as we continue to pursue additional strategic builds we re also exploring opportunities to refine and accelerate their business strategy these include taking advantage of recent fiber bills at northwest and sdu business and providing resources to better pursue public private partnerships managed services and private network opportunities and we ll speak more about that in coming quarters in meantime i want to officially welcome the alaska communication to the atn s family our teams have been off to a fast and productive start and i am grateful for the very positive and forward looking attitudes of all concerned i also want to thank the internal teams who ve got the deals done and are still working on the details of integration our financing partners freedom three capital and the bank led by fifth third bancorp as well as our financial legal advisors are all critical to getting this done and will be just as critical moving forward thank you all the us telecom segment which is going forward we ll account for roughly 1 2 of atn consolidated revenues in the third quarter little over two months of results will be included in our consolidated results and justin will add some more details on the balance sheet impacts as well in a few minutes so sticking with the domestic businesses from our existing us telecom business had a similar quarter to the first quarter this year with ebitda at almost exactly the same level these points are similar as well the first that build continues on schedule and construction revenue for that is still more than offset by construction expense as expected spending on the developing private networks business also has continued at a similar pace the previous quarter and justin will provide some numbers on that as we alluded to in the release after reviewing the directions of progress for the underlying businesses in this segment we concluded that while there are some important common operational resources our rural business under the umbrella of common rural networks and our private networks business universe would be better served with the more formal operation similar to how we pursue different markets in our international telecom segment the businesses are distinct and the customers that are pursuing in services they re offering have different attributes further we see some interesting opportunities for both organic and strategic expansion and they want we may want to utilize strategic or financial partners to pursue those particularly on the private network side as to rural networks we re pursuing a fiber first strategy of connecting rural communities we are looking to utilize a combination of carrier wholesale customers enterprise customers and government incentives ticking at each community and then we look to certain the full scope of the markets communications needs directly or through local partners as an example of that we expect to complete two middle model fiber bills in northern arizona in the current quarter nearly all of the construction cost is covered by government incentive payments to build into educational sites and provide high speed data services we are augmenting that build and expect to provide backhaul to wireless towers data services to enterprise customers and wholesale transport services to some local broadband providers the business is looking to execute on more of this sort of ratio to connect to rural communities out west in addition our rural broadband revenue in these markets is growing roughly 10 higher for the first six months of the year and we think there s room to grow selectively from here with network improvements and expansion but our focus for now is on the enterprise and wholesale side moving to international telecom broadband growth was more essential for its story in international telecom subscribers increased by 6 year on year while some of the largest bills are behind us we are continuing to invest in expansion of the reach of our fiber based networks and on our overall capacity and quality we see plenty of additional opportunity in broadband subscribers and enterprise revenue with our fixed data services while maintaining low levels of churn relevant to that there are two developments worth noting in the canada market one the government shows an innovative and forward looking approach in removing that charges from broadband services they are focused on getting people connected learning for business activity and for general quality of life second another sign of change in how we have landed contracts to provide substantial fiber facilities in advanced mobile services including private lte to oil and gas customers and we expect that to continue to grow international telecom segment mobile subscriber levels also continued to grow continuing a trend a year ago as a result of a number of measures our teams undertook to improve our competitive positioning in select markets year on year we got a 16 increase in overall subscriber levels accelerated increase on the prepaid and postpaid subscribers many subscribers on the demand continue is behind on what subscriber remains expenses rise in the segment for the second quarter in a row as explained in our release some of that was in the level of onetime costs and some of them increased regulatory other expense outside the long time items there are no quick fixes but we will continue to improve operating efficiencies to manage expenses down where we can in many areas as revenue opportunities related to the network expansions i referenced are a higher priority we ve been asked on previous calls about the impact and timing of the pandemic recovery as an update i note that most of our international markets are still feeling economic pain for very limited travel of into and out of the market we are encouraged by the pickup in leisure travel and are hopeful that the next 12 months will look better than the past 12 months and that staying for us to recap and to provide a little bit of a higher level perspective following this major chain reaction more than 3 4 of our revenue is mostly recovering drive through the operation of a collection of domestic and international communications services companies operating in smaller and typical mobile markets and then in each case have substantial infrastructure a strong and extensive track record in market is either the first or second week provider of the relevant services and infrastructure and good momentum around their core service offerings we believe we can continue to expand in these markets as the light markets the remainder of our business which is domestic is comprised of a small but growing rural fiber and broadband business that has simpler atrophies to those more geographically distinct markets a wholesale wireless business engaged in multi multiyear restructuring and an emerging private networks business we are working to create additional value and a clear story around those ladder assets for now if we simply annualize the first half performance for both atn and alaska atn would have annual revenues of about 740 million with the vast majority derived from recurring and contracted resources and adjusted ebitda of about 160 million we believe that is a great platform on which to create value and with that i ll turn it over to justin but i ll just note that we are hearing feedback that says the call quality has been a little rough we re going to continue but so we hope you can hear us well enough to understand justin d benincasa chief financial officer thank you michael for the second quarter total consolidated revenues were 123 9 million up 14 from last year and consolidated adjusted ebitda was 25 2 million versus 29 1 million in the second quarter of 2020 i ll speak to the specifics of these comparisons as i cover the segment details starting with the international telecom segment revenues were up 8 from 80 1 million last year to 86 2 million this quarter and adjusted ebitda was 28 4 million slightly down from 28 7 million of a year ago as michael mentioned in his comments segment revenue benefited from broadband and mobile subscriber growth in several markets but we ve seen higher expenses compared to last year which led to modest to a modest decline in adjusted ebitda and reduced margins expenses in the prior year benefited from several temporary savings related to reduced operations and delayed maintenance during the pandemic in addition to those costs during this year in addition to those costs returning this year we had increased costs related to expansion of our managed service business higher regulatory and license fees in certain markets and we also incurred a 1 1 million onetime legal expense in the quarter as in past quarters we continue to opportunistically purchase minority owner shares in one communications our bermuda and cayman island subsidiary and now own approximately 78 of the outstanding equity of this well performing business and that compares to 59 a year ago capital expenditures in the quarter were 11 3 million for this segment and 21 8 million year to date for the full year in this segment we expect to be at the higher end of our guidance of 45 million to 55 million in the us telecom segment revenues were 37 6 million for the quarter up from 28 2 million a year ago this includes 9 3 million of construction revenue related to the firstnet project we still anticipate completing 50 of the 85 million project this year which will bring us to approximately 65 completion at year end the decline in adjusted ebitda for the segment to 4 5 million from 7 5 million last year was due to higher operating costs we discussed last quarter which includes the operating costs associated with the completion of the cares act funded build out of our rural broadband sites and that s in advance of the anticipated additional revenues in the firstnet sites coming online in addition we spent 3 1 million on our developing private network business in the quarter which was 1 3 million over last year as noted in the release from the july 22 close through the end of this year we expect the alaska acquisitions to contribute between 105 and 109 million of revenue to our us telecom segment and between 27 and 29 million of adjusted ebitda with regards to cost synergies we expect to achieve approximately 2 million of cost savings in the next 12 to 18 months similar to past atn transactions in new markets we ll work to gain cost efficiencies and margin improvement over time where they make sense and don t impede our ability to continue growing the business capital expenditures in the us telecom segment this quarter were 3 9 and 18 8 million year to date we also expect capital expenditures in the u s segment to be at the higher end of our guidance of 40 million to 50 million excluding alaska and alaska to continue at similar levels to the first half as they continue with several customer specific fiber builds and network expansion consolidated net income for the quarter was 2 million or 0 13 per share and was helped by a tax benefit of 1 5 million included in the operating expense for the quarter was 2 2 million of noncash stock based compensation expense moving to the balance sheet on june 30 total cash and short term cash investments were 96 million and total debt outstanding was 71 million excluding the firstnet customer receivable credit facility put in place to monetize the structured payment receivable under the contract this facility is secured by those customer receivable and has no recourse to atn subsequent to the end of the second quarter in conjunction with completion of the alaska communications acquisition atn borrowed 73 million to fund its equity portion of the transaction and subsequently repaid 10 million of that borrowing we also facilitated a new credit agreement that alaska communications entered into at the close that is non recourse to atn alaska borrowed 210 million under that term loan facility and 110 million under the 35 million revolving facility for the consolidated company including alaska our leverage is slightly over two times and approximately 1 6 times on a net cash basis still giving us substantial resources to fund additional growth initiatives and with that operator we d like to open the call up for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of rick prentiss from raymond james your line is now open rick prentiss raymond jame analyst thanks good morning guys it was a little garbled a little bit like underwater but things got better toward the end there a couple of questions hopefully you can hear me ok we think the information on alaska showing the first quarter sorry second quarter in year to date in there how should we think about what alaska means and how you guys report your segment reporting are there going to be some more changes should we expect well alaska itself reporting your style reporting how should we think about that justin d benincasa chief financial officer it s going to be a little bit of a hybrid technic i think where we report more by line of business they report by kind of customer business so we re going to basically provide it kind of a little bit of both in the segment so we re going to it will be mostly by our predominant reporting will be by type of service and then we re going to do further breakout by customer type rick prentiss raymond jame analyst okay and appreciate the color on the alaska capex it looks like they spent about 22 million in the first half so we re expecting maybe 22 million in the second half mentioned finished some customer orders how should we think longer term about what the capital intensity you guys will be spending at alaska but in total really michael t prior president and chief executive officer i think i ll start and justin can add i mean i think right now we see fairly significant opportunities for new fiber builds many of which will have the anchor tenant construct i talked about so there s a top line there s a gross capex number if you will and then there s there will be a fair amount of that we expect will continue to be reimbursed but but more broadly we just think there are opportunities to continue to work on the network expansion they ve been doing that should pay off well so i think we expect significant capital expenditures in the near term rick prentiss raymond jame analyst makes sense and nice getting the reimbursements you guys report that or would you report that as a net capex i know having just gotten off a tower company call the accountants make them report reimburse capex through revenues and ebitda amortization of prepaid rents for you guys how does that reimbursement come in is it really a net capex justin d benincasa chief financial officer are you referring to the reimbursable capex we speak there rick prentiss raymond jame analyst yes and also i think michael has talked about how sometimes you ll get government incentives back also michael t prior president and chief executive officer yes i mean i just mentioned it so we have a couple of different kinds we have capital expenditures where there is repayment from customers anchor tenants in the form of a nonrecurring charge so that will come through revenue and the full capital expense will be deployed and then most of the government programs also have you recorded the gross capex and revenue but there are justin i don t know if you can speak to we had in the past had some contra actually could be with future programs we that could occur justin d benincasa chief financial officer yes it does depend on the flavor of it i d say we have both reporting both ways for the most part we have found actually is just strictly account of capex and others that do come as revenue but i will say that the deal that michael referred to contra capex rick prentiss raymond jame analyst and when you do receive it as or when you book it as revenue does it come in in a lump sum does it come in monthly quarterly annually just trying to match up revenues and cash flow type thing justin d benincasa chief financial officer yes i mean there s things like high cost support right that will come through revenue but i think the and i m not quite sure on the tower company you re referring to but i would say that the grant things that we impact that michael was referring to those are mostly just coming through as contra capex for us rick rick prentiss raymond jame analyst okay that helps justin d benincasa chief financial officer let s just make i just want to clarify that rick prentiss raymond jame analyst and then obviously you guys are seeing some interest in your accelerating your growth with possibly some pools of funds that might be out there can you talk a little bit about are you thinking pension funds infrastructure funds obviously a lot of money chasing opportunities but how should we think about what kind of magnitude or potential partners they might involve justin d benincasa chief financial officer can you repeat that rick rick prentiss raymond jame analyst yes you mentioned in the press release about potential strategic partners and funding how should we think about the available pools is that pension fund infrastructure funds private equity funds and what kind of magnitude might this these partnerships kind of entail justin d benincasa chief financial officer i don t want to speculate on that i think the magnitude will depend in part on the use of proceeds right are we giving two step kind of deals where we re combining or extending the business with strategic transactions then the magnitude will be higher obviously we don t from the rural business is more likely to have infrastructure oriented partners and the private networks business is more likely to have more private equity or strategic partners but there we ve seen signs that there could be infrastructure interest in there as well rick prentiss raymond jame analyst okay a lot of money out there for sure final one from me is obviously headlines coming out of washington with biden apparently getting bipartisan support for an infrastructure bill rural broadband mentioned is one of the categories how should we think about where you guys might be able to play in that space i know it s early the legislation is just coming together but give us an updated thought on dc infrastructure what it might mean for you justin d benincasa chief financial officer yes i mean look i mean if you think about that the rdof program which some of those awards have now been peeled back but that first program was up to 9 billion and something less than that awarded there s and right now from what i ve read 65 billion is earmarked for broadband type infrastructure under this build that is being pursued our like a lot of people we re waiting for more information and more details are do we think there s opportunity for us in that we do and we also think there s an opportunity in funds that have already been earmarked and we re pursuing some of that we continue to build out some things even today related to the cares act funding and our belief at this point is that it feels to us more likely that that will come through state and local distributions as opposed from federal to state and local to two projects as opposed to federal nationwide program option i could be wrong about that but that s how we re looking at it as is more probable and we think that will play well for us because we have good ties in the areas we are operate and a good reputation and we have a good team for pursuing and analyzing those opportunities so it s absolutely on our radar screen rick prentiss raymond jame analyst great appreciate the color justin d benincasa chief financial officer sure operator our next question comes from the line of hamed khorsand from bws financial your line is now open hamed khorsand bws financial analyst good morning so first off i wanted to ask you about geoverse what are you seeing in that business from demand side and opportunities that now you re thinking that to accelerate the growth of that business by seeking outside capital justin d benincasa chief financial officer i think that the last year was slow for a lot of us including others in pursuing private networks the pandemic did not help that but we re seeing the same we re seeing the interest from multiple levels in private network solutions or private cellular solutions there s it just solves a number of problems and with the continued with the continued distribution of 5g technologies and interest in 5g technologies and what it does as well as even 4g technologies there s the use cases are growing so what we see that could make it more significant and require more funding is it s we really are looking at what we ve been doing is we ve been developing a platform it s really a platform more than a sort of unit based infrastructure build which makes it a bigger opportunity but it makes it also need more net funding in the short term and then there are some a lot of the people we are talking to customers partners are thinking about this in sort of big way multisite ways multi use case ways and so some of those applications if we re successful will require could require a fair amount of capital i don t want to speculate on exactly how much and what but i think that s hopefully that gives you a flavor for how we re looking at it hamed khorsand bws financial analyst okay and then before you atn has been mostly wireless centric so now it sounds like for this call and press release it was you re focusing more on fiber can you disclose how many miles of fiber you have now and what your expectations on adding how many miles per year and how costly is in some of the geographies that you re looking to add those miles justin d benincasa chief financial officer yes i don t want to do that now i m not sure i have the combined numbers in my head anyway so not prepared to do that now but i would just say two things to that hamed first of all we have had a fairly fiber forward approach for a while in a number of markets we did two transactions in 2016 in our international telecom that brought in substantial wireline assets as you know and we went and did multiyear fiber expansion in those markets an additional market and so we re seeing great take up we re seeing very low churn rate and we continue to see multiple values for delivering fiber solutions there s different flavors of it in different markets as we ve talked about alaska for example is very much business and wholesale driven with some retail as well but our offshore markets it s probably it flip the other way a lot of most it s more servicing residential broadband is the biggest unit there so there it s a similar approach of being one of the top you have the leading are second provider of core infrastructure in these markets and fiber is the core infrastructure now the mobile is still important in a number of our markets and we re doing well there so it s just a different delivery mechanism if you will for in some ways and it s a little bit different product with full mobility but it still requires all that fiber backbone these days because it s all about data services whether it s connected or whether it s fixed or mobile so that s the way i look at it we could look at providing more data on that in the future hamed too on some of the fiber extension i will be careful because some of the fiber mile information out there is kind of silly because it s route miles is obviously more useful than fiber miles but that also is it s a little hard to do apples to apples comparisons because it depends on the use cases and the density hamed khorsand bws financial analyst got it ok and then my last question was regarding alaska what is it that you think that you could improve upon in alaska and how fast do you think you could generate those revenue synergies that you mentioned in the press release justin d benincasa chief financial officer well first of all they ve been doing a lot of things well so we like their core strategy but they it was pretty i think it was they would tell you it s pretty distracting the last few years they ve been considering strategic alternatives they of course had an active a shareholder that involved and and they were going through a process and then since then speaking closing approval and so i think it s just generally its ability to by effectively going private it s just really focus on business and business first and no other distraction so we trying to give them that we also have despite their pretty good size we have some operational capabilities and know how that they re excited about they think we can help them execute on their plan and so that s part of where our optimism comes from and then how fast it comes it s hard to say in alaska it s interesting with builds right there s some things you just in some parts of the last you can t build as much in the winter of course and so some of it will take time but we re we see opportunity and i think what our focus is keep growing it and grow very stable strong long tail recurring cash flow streams and that incrementally will should really start to drive value rick prentiss raymond jame analyst okay thank you operator our last question comes from the line of mr rick prentiss from raymond james your line is now open rick prentiss raymond jame analyst hey guys appreciate a couple of follow ups first justin you called out a 1 1 million onetime legal cost in the second quarter was that in the international segment and what was that justin d benincasa chief financial officer it was in the international yes rick prentiss raymond jame analyst anything specific we should be looking at as far as what it involves justin d benincasa chief financial officer no we don t want to get into too much detail but hopefully it s once and done michael t prior president and chief executive officer it doesn t have anything to do with any ongoing business or personnel issues or anything like that rick prentiss raymond jame analyst okay that s good to know and then international business also had continued a couple of quarters now of nice mobile subscriber growth talk a little bit about the trends you re seeing there why do you think you re winning share into something you can continue to do justin d benincasa chief financial officer yes i think it s mainly that in a couple of markets we felt that and we talked a little bit about this a year or so ago that we felt that we needed to do a better job with our competitive positioning our retail strategy and so we undertook a number of steps to improve that and it s been bearing fruit since basically four quarters in a row so i think enough to call it a real trend and really positive so it really was just about improving our competitive positioning shifting our strategy a little bit from the retail and marketing standpoint okay that was it rick prentiss raymond jame analyst and i think there s still room to continue to win success in the markets justin d benincasa chief financial officer yes i do and i think there s also sort of macroeconomic lift in guyana in particular but not entirely i think there s other there are other opportunities there rick prentiss raymond jame analyst okay and last one for me a lot of similar questions on this question when you re putting in new fiber what kind of strand counts are you putting in just not to the nearest strap but just ballpark wise how much fiber are you putting in when you do new construction justin d benincasa chief financial officer it depends on the location rick right so if we re doing it in denser areas in our international markets i don t even want to quote the strand count but very strand rich many more strands than you think you re probably going to ever need and that just makes as you know it makes the it s not just allows you to be opportunistic in the future but it lowers your cost it allows you to reduce latency have dedicated fiber pair for many uses and so that s the way the industry has been going and it s strands of class so it s the incremental cost of doing strand rich deployment is not much then if you go really on haul you don t put as rich in certain things particularly in like subsea those are far far for your strand counts in those situations but even middle longer miles stuff in the u s we would tend to do pretty strand rich deployment just because it gives you future opportunity rick prentiss raymond jame analyst right and the incremental cost like you point out is not that much there s a lot of labor costs so we re thinking in the 100 to maybe thousands michael t prior president and chief executive officer no i ve read some of those things that must have been faced it might have been faced if i could be wrong about that at only 5 000 into their data set nothing like that rick prentiss raymond jame analyst hundreds makes sense okay great thank you guys michael t prior president and chief executive officer sure operator there are no questions at this time please continue justin d benincasa chief financial officer that s all we have operator so we can end the call at that we look forward to speaking with everybody in the next quarter michael t prior president and chief

growth through the first half of 2021 exl achieved better than expected results in the second quarter on revenue and adjusted eps our q2 revenue was 275 1 million which represents a 5 2 sequential increase and a 22 3 year over year increase both on a constant currency basis adjusted eps for the quarter more than doubled to 1 14 per share our analytics business reported revenues of 111 4 million growing 8 8 sequentially and 35 1 year over year the demand for analytics has increased in the post pandemic environment this growth is driven by three long term trends one adoption of data driven decision making across the enterprise two hyper personalization of customer interactions and three an accelerated shift to the cloud our investment in the advanced analytics ai capabilities cloud capabilities and our proprietary data assets gives us a competitive advantage it has helped us accelerate our growth across all our targeted verticals our operations management business generated 163 7 million in revenue in the second quarter up 2 8 quarter over quarter and 14 9 year over year driven primarily by higher revenues from our insurance and emerging businesses before diving further into details of our business performance i d first like to give you a brief update on the covid 19 situation across our geographies as you know we have all been through a very challenging period across the globe and despite progress on many fronts the threat from the virus remains we continue to monitor the situation closely and are providing health related assistance and relief to employees in areas that are still affected we have reopened our physical office locations in the u s with limited capacity and continue to operate a hybrid work from home model in india the philippines europe and latin america companywide we anticipate maintaining this hybrid model in the near term in india the second wave spikes that occurred in april and may served as a stark reminder of the severity of this pandemic several of our employees were directly impacted we systematically addressed the situation by leveraging our resources forming strategic partnerships and working closely with our clients we provided essential medical supplies isolation centers vaccination support and financial assistance to help employees and their families we have an active vaccination program in place and expect to have 75 of our employee population in india fully vaccinated by the fall thankfully the situation in india has improved but we continue to monitor it closely i must commend the commitment of our employees and the collaborative spirit of our clients in helping us get through this daunting challenge without any significant interruptions to service delivery our employees and clients immediately sprung to action to health i cannot thank them enough for their support flexibility and empathy getting back to our q2 performance i m delighted to share that our strategic client relationships have strengthened as we advanced our cutting edge analytics offerings and reinforced our delivery capabilities we have been successful in growing multiple new engagements while securing significant strategic client renewals our analytics and digital capabilities have emerged as key differentiators helping our clients enhance their end user customer experiences we continue to invest in new digital and analytics capabilities and maintain a robust pipeline heading into the second half of 2021 an example of this is our work with a leading global bank with whom we are deploying data flow and decision automation capability to transform their wholesale and retail banking operations building on an engagement that started in the midst of the covid 19 crisis we created automated data ingestion and decision making procedures for the bank to process applications and provide timely funding to customers applying for relief under the cares act paycheck protection program our engagement has now expanded to a multiyear global contract to design and deploy similar solutions in several markets within the u s u k europe and apac regions the program has already driven significant cost reduction benefits and improved customer experience it has also addressed the need for automating manual sarbanes oxley compliance and other operational controls similarly our ai powered digital collection solution paymentor has been resonating well with our clients in a recent example exl partnered with an international bank to engage and activate customers using multiple channels including email and two way sms the solution enables the client to reduce phone calls significantly and payment does reinforcement learning based algorithms achieved response rates that were close to twice the industry standard benchmarks we also deployed paymentor at a fortune 1000 client in a b2b context enhancing collections and reducing delinquent receivables we were able to pivot the solutions b2c focus to a b2b use case by making subtle changes to the underlying algorithm thereby dramatically expanding our addressable market to support the continued growth of our data led strategy we have aggressively ramped up our talent acquisition training and talent development efforts we have a particular focus in building competencies in the areas of data analytics and digital expertise in order to meet the growing demand of our clients we have been hiring at a rapid pace in q2 and have been successful in onboarding new clients new talent at scale we have also scaled up our leadership capacity to enable the achievement of our strategic goals in addition to building our capabilities through talent acquisition we are also developing internal talent to take on more significant responsibilities one of the core elements of our capability development program is an agile learning ecosystem called exl infinity this ecosystem provides personalized ongoing development of employees across multiple disciplines the program is ai driven and it anticipates individual learning needs to develop diverse skill sets continuous micro learning the platform has seen a major shift in learning toward digital and analytics capabilities helping us build an internal talent pipeline we also transformed our communication and engagement systems to support real time feedback loops and enhance employee experience we expanded our reach and frequency to keep up with the demands of remote working exl has demonstrated a true spirit of collaboration responsiveness and creativity and this has helped us get through the uncertainty over the last several quarters we have been able to continually grow our business and form closer partnerships with our clients i am confident in the resilience of our business model and the commitment of our people to support one another and our clients through a fast changing and complex business environment we have emerged stronger from this experience our business continues to grow supported by a stronger pipeline we are confident in our ability to maintain this momentum in the second half of 2021 i will now invite maurizio to highlight our q2 financial performance and 2021 guidance maurizio nicolelli executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you rohit and thanks everyone for joining us this morning i will provide insights into our financial performance for the second quarter of 2021 followed by our updated outlook for 2021 as rohit mentioned this was our best result in the last 23 quarters with revenue of 275 1 million up 23 6 year over year while adjusted earnings per share was 1 14 all revenue growth numbers mentioned hereafter are on a constant currency basis revenue from our operations management business as defined by three reportable segments excluding analytics was 163 7 million up 14 9 year over year sequentially from the first quarter revenue was up 2 8 our insurance segment generated revenue of 94 7 million up 14 9 year over year driven by an expansion in existing client relationships and higher volumes compared to the first quarter of 2021 revenue was up 3 8 the insurance vertical consisting of insurance operations management and analytics businesses grew 3 8 sequentially from the first quarter healthcare reported revenue of 28 2 million up 13 1 year over year driven by higher volumes in our clinical services business and new wins of 2020 the healthcare vertical consisting of our healthcare operations management and analytics businesses grew 3 7 sequentially from the first quarter emerging reported revenue of 40 7 million up 16 2 year over year this growth was driven by new client wins of 2020 and 2021 in finance and accounting banking and utilities sequentially emerging revenue grew 8 1 the emerging vertical consisting of the emerging operations management and analytics businesses grew 8 2 sequentially from the first quarter analytics revenue totaled 111 4 million up 35 1 year over year analytics was 40 5 of revenue in the second quarter and had its highest growth rate in the last eight quarters this growth was driven by higher volumes across all industry verticals with expansion in client relationships particularly banking and the ramping up of new wins in 2020 and 2021 as clients embrace our data led solutions compared to the first quarter of 2021 revenue was up 8 8 our sg a expenses were 20 4 of revenue up 160 basis points year over year driven by investments in front end sales and onetime covid related spending totaling 2 2 million for the health and safety initiatives we undertook for our employees our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 17 9 up 850 basis points year over year driven by operating leverage from higher revenue continued cost optimization measures lower infrastructure expenses and reduced discretionary spending our adjusted operating margin was down 230 basis points from the first quarter driven by annual salary increments and onetime covid related expenses as mentioned earlier our adjusted eps for the quarter was 1 14 up 115 year over year on a reported basis exl s balance sheet continues to remain strong with a focus on liquidity and cash flow generation from operations our cash and short term investments at june 30 was 295 million and our debt was 165 million for a net cash position of 130 million during the second quarter we reduced our revolver by 74 million our dso at june 30 was 58 days now moving to our six month performance our revenue for the period was 536 5 million up 13 5 year over year this growth was broad based driven by analytics insurance and healthcare adjusted operating margin for the period was 19 up 670 basis points year over year adjusted eps for the period was 2 32 up 72 year over year on a reported basis in the first six months of the year we generated cash flow from operations of 53 9 million compared to 58 9 million in the same period last year now moving on to our outlook for the year the economic environment in the u s and u k is improving and we have a strong pipeline which continues to expand in our non u s delivery centers we will continue to assess the impact of the pandemic and respond to changing circumstances with the primary focus being the health and safety of our staff we have proven that we can manage our delivery commitments and we will continue to be responsive to changing conditions based on our strong first half results the continued strong demand for our services and solutions particularly analytics and improved visibility for the second half of 2021 we are increasing our revenue guidance for 2021 to be in the range of 1 08 billion to 1 1 billion up 35 million at the midpoint and 30 million at the top end of the range this represents a year over year growth rate of 13 to 15 on a reported basis and 12 to 14 on a constant currency basis in 2021 we expect analytics to grow in the low 20 range and operations management to grow in the 6 to 8 range we expect a foreign exchange gain between 3 million to 4 million net interest expense of 2 million to 3 million and our effective tax rate to be in the range of 23 5 to 24 5 in terms of capital allocation we will continue to invest in analytics digital solutions and technology we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of 35 million to 40 million during the first half of the year we repurchased 600 000 shares at a cost of 55 4 million we anticipate buying back our shares in the second half of 2021 at a pace similar to the first half of the year based on the above we expect our adjusted eps to be in the range of 4 30 to 4 50 up 22 to 27 driven by increased revenue in 2021 in conclusion we had a good start to 2021 despite the challenges created by the recent pandemic surges we have demonstrated a flexible and resilient business model our investments in analytics data and digital solutions are successfully meeting our clients transformation agenda which is accelerating our pipeline of opportunities now rohit and i will be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from maggie nolan with william blair margaret marie niesen nolan william blair company llc analyst hi thank you so you re obviously experiencing good growth and momentum nice client additions etc but i m wondering can you kind of frame for us how much of your client base outside of new additions is kind of back to pre covid level spending and can you give detail as it pertains to op management and analytics somewhat separately if possible rohit kapoor co founder vice chairman and chief executive officer sure maggie so for us you re absolutely right we are adding on new clients at a very fast pace we are growing our ops management business and our analytics business nicely and the growth rate of the analytics business is obviously a lot higher than the growth rate of our ops management business in terms of the client spending as compared to pre covid levels we would say that almost all of them are back to pre covid levels except for some clients that we have in the travel industry there we do see the volumes still being lower than the pre covid levels and as things return back to normalcy we would expect to see that come back in terms of analytics clearly the pandemic has accelerated the use of data based decision making by clients and that is powering ahead our analytics business and we are engaging with clients in a much more strategic fashion in a much more certain fashion and we re able to demonstrate clear value for them as we build our relationships with them the operations management business for us is also growing nicely and the embedding of digital and analytics and technology into our operations management business is what is providing the growth momentum in the ops management area so frankly we are very pleased with the positioning that we took the strategy that we have the capabilities that we ve built and the way in which we are executing our business in conjunction with our clients margaret marie niesen nolan william blair company llc analyst very good and then there s a lot going on with your employee base you ve obviously touched on that and attrition seems to be picking back up a little bit since the low of the pandemic but i m curious what your expectations are for that just given the additional support you ve provided them the environment and then even some of these training and development platforms is it feasible that those drive the structural or historical attrition rate a little bit lower rohit kapoor co founder vice chairman and chief executive officer sure maggie so first and foremost the health and safety of our employees is paramount and we will do everything that is possibly necessary to ensure the health and safety of our employees our employees recognize that and they see that to be a great trust factor and loyalty factor between our employees and the company in terms of some of the change that s taking place we are actually investing heavily in terms of reskilling our employees upskilling our employees and creating the right kind of an environment for them to be able to take on greater responsibilities work on much more complex products and solutions and enhance their careers as they continue to work with exl the attrition rate in the second quarter has picked up from the first quarter but as you know that is a very normal practice given the fact that we have salary increments that take place on first of april for a majority of our workforce and we typically will see a higher attrition rate in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter i think the real issue is about the ability to source talent and develop talent for being able to manage the growth expectations of our clients and some of the work that we are signing up with our clients as we go forward we are very very confident about the brand that we have built with our employee base of being able to attract the best talent develop the talent internally and to be able to meet the growth aspirations of our clients of exl and our employees at the same time so we think we are in a period where there will be an ability to match the growing demands from our clients and match that with the talent side margaret marie niesen nolan william blair company llc analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from bryan bergin with cowen bryan c bergin cowen and company llc analyst hi good morning thank you i wanted to dig in a little bit on the emerging segment so can you provide some color on the underlying businesses that you saw there in 2q and the outlook for that going forward and aside from travel i m curious of you re largely past prior issues in some of those areas and if so does that allow you to grow ops management potentially at a higher pace going forward and i m really trying to understand in the context of that 6 to 8 ops management growth target given the first half performance on the second half comps rohit kapoor co founder vice chairman and chief executive officer sure bryan so the emerging business segment for us certainly has clients from a number of different industry verticals we are seeing a broad based engagement and growth take place across our portfolio as you know we ve got clients which are in utilities we do a fair amount of work there in finance and accounting we do a fair amount of work with some of the emerging technologies and support them in terms of the finance and accounting and back office operations we do work with travel with our clients we work with transportation and logistics so there are a whole series of clients across multiple industry verticals broadly speaking we are seeing good demand momentum and the deployment of digital in ops management for the emerging sector seems to be resonating really nicely for our clients and for our business so that s the reason why we think the growth there is taking place the travel side is still muted because most of the work that we do with clients on the travel side is pertaining to business travel and that still has not resumed at the same level as consumer travel so that s something which we think will happen over a period of time and it might take a few more quarters for that to revert back there are new areas that we are getting into in the emerging business vertical and that is actually very encouraging for us and when we talk of a 6 to 8 growth of ops management across industry verticals we think the emerging business will be able to do really well as they apply more digital technologies and more digital interventions into the ops management for our clients sure bryan so the emerging business segment for us certainly has clients from a number of different industry verticals we are seeing a broad based engagement and growth take place across our portfolio as

bergin cowen and company llc analyst okay thank you and a follow up on margin did you see any meaningful return of costs associated with t e or s m spend and how should we be thinking about discretionary cost resumption of those as you go forward and as we think about projecting normalized operating margins from here maurizio nicolelli executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so bryan thanks for the question when we think about margins for the second half of the year we have a certain amount of expenses starting to creep back into our p l and you start to see some of the return to expenses start to come in in q4 and a little bit of an uptick on travel but this is going to be a gradual process of these expenses coming back into our p l we have an assumption that a certain amount of our employees come back to the office in the fourth quarter of 2021 and that s something that we continue to review on a monthly basis that s kind of a fluid situation for us but we have assumed a certain amount of expenses coming back into the second half of the year and you can see that also in a little bit in our guidance bryan c bergin cowen and company llc analyst alright great thanks guys operator our next question comes from moshe katri with wedbush moshe katri wedbush securities inc analyst thanks and congrats on strong results so the pipeline looks pretty robust demand looks pretty strong post pandemic i don t know if but hopefully we re toward the end of this and you spoke about potentially accelerating growth are you ready to talk a bit about the potential for that actual growth rate in the midterm maybe talk about where top line growth could be what should we expect and then can you talk a bit about wage inflation what are we seeing there and obviously it s been spiking how is that impacting the p l and then how do we offset that down the road thanks rohit kapoor co founder vice chairman and chief executive officer sure moshe thank you for your comment so in terms of the pipeline the pipeline is strong we are seeing larger sized deals into the pipeline and the sales velocity of us being able to close deals while it is about the same as what we ve seen in previous quarters because the size of the pipeline has increased you can see that the number of new clients that we have won in the first quarter of 2021 and the second quarter of 2021 is at a good pace so we re very encouraged by that the acceleration of growth is clearly visible in data analytics and you can see that our growth in analytics in this quarter was about 35 year on year but for the year as maurizio shared in his prepared remarks we expect analytics for calendar year 2021 to grow above 20 and that is certainly much higher than the 15 growth rate that we had shared with all of you in our investor day back in november the engagement of digital that continues to provide growth for us but the ops management business will continue to grow at 6 to 8 so for 2021 we are seeing acceleration in growth rate for subsequent periods we ll provide guidance as we do normally in february of next year coming to your second question on wage inflation certainly we are seeing a number of things increase on the scarcity of talent and the inflation of wages but keep in mind that this is actually spread differently across different skill sets and across different geographies one of the benefits of the safety for our employees to work from home is also the fact that commute time has been cut back and some of the costs associated with commuting has been brought down we have to invest a lot more in terms of technology and making sure information security is in place so those are areas that we are adding on to our expense structure and we ve managed the wage inflation in a balanced and cautious manner so far what we are seeing is wage inflation in india and in the u s and in other geographies continues to remain pretty much the same as what we have seen previously but certainly we understand that with the demand environment actually accelerating and increasing that that s something which we have to be careful about and try and manage that appropriately we will need to engage with our clients in a model that is a lot more sustainable and make sure that the appropriate levels of productivity digitization different levers that we can deploy to maintain profitability can be applied and we can continue to build and grow our business both on the top line and on the bottom line as we ve shared with you in the past our expectations are to try and grow our top line revenues medium term at low double digits and for us to be able to grow our profitability slightly faster than our revenue growth moshe katri wedbush securities inc analyst understood thanks for the color operator we have a question from puneet jain with jpmorgan puneet jain jpmorgan chase co analyst hi thanks for taking my question so rohit this year is obviously unusual but given the investments you are making in analytics and the need for that service from your clients is there potential for that segment to outperform 13 to 15 long term growth that you shared at last year s analyst day rohit kapoor co founder vice chairman and chief executive officer yes thanks puneet so clearly as part of our long term strategy we have consciously and proactively invested in analytics way ahead of competition and our peers and at first and that was an area where we could create value for our clients we thought that was an area that would grow rapidly and it was a large addressable market so we are really really happy with the progress that we ve made with our data analytics business in calendar year 2021 the acceleration on analytics is very visible and it s certainly showing up in our numbers as of now based on the kind of pipeline that we are seeing there the kind of engagement that we re seeing there we are finding that our clients are all becoming data led businesses so our strategy of focusing in on data and helping them with data analytics and create insights from the data analytics piece and embed that into operations seems to be resonating very nicely certainly for 2021 the growth rate of analytics like we said is going to be well up the 13 to 15 growth rate and it s going to be 20 plus on a go forward basis all the signals that we have to evaluate that seems to suggest a good strong growth rate but we ll provide you with more color on that as we get to the beginning of next year puneet jain jpmorgan chase co analyst got you got you and your headcount addition was in this quarter you re still back to pre pandemic level in terms of the overall headcount while your revenue is much higher so is the mix of the business different like you said like analytics is much bigger piece than what it was before or do you need to catch up by growing headcount at much higher rate over the next few quarters maurizio nicolelli executive vice president and chief financial officer hi puneet it s maurizio that s a very good observation you made when you look at our total headcount at the end of q2 we re just slightly above where we were at the end of q1 of 2020 but the mix has changed a little bit we have 1 000 more people in analytics in that mix and slightly and less in ops management so we ve become more efficient in our ops management headcount and we re really driving analytics going forward with additional headcount and that s really reflective in our growth rate in analytics we re really investing now fairly heavily into analytics to really power that growth in the upcoming years so your assessment is correct the mix has changed and we re starting to get back to right around that headcount level of for q1 of 2020 just with a much higher revenue base puneet jain jpmorgan chase co analyst understood thank you operator our next question comes from vincent colicchio with barrington research vincent alexander colicchio barrington research associates inc analyst yes maurizio if t e expenses were the same this year as pre pandemic level how many points would that take off margin to give us a sense for the impact maybe next year maurizio nicolelli executive vice president and chief financial officer so when you think about t e going forward the one thing that i would say about t e is that we had a lot of travel prior to covid and we re starting to reassess t e to really think about what is really the right level of t e now going forward i don t have the exact number on the effect to margin if we went right back to where we were pre pandemic but i would tell you that the way we look at t e right now is that that mix is going to change a bit going forward in that it s going to be a percentage of that t e spend going forward so we don t envision getting right back to that significant t e that we had in pre pandemic so when you look at our margins it will have some basis point effect but nowhere near where it was pre pandemic vincent alexander colicchio barrington research associates inc analyst and can you give us an update of your thinking and perhaps actions you re taking on real estate reductions maurizio nicolelli executive vice president and chief financial officer so we re currently working on our new operating model going forward globally we re going through a process within hr to really understand for each individual starting with our enabling function on how many days someone really needs to be in the office or what s that optimal time that someone needs to be in our office on a weekly basis what we re starting to find is that you re going to have a lot of people that are going to be hybrid working from home and the office and that s going to start to change the requirements that we have within our offices particularly here in the u s and so that s going to start our process to reconfigure our offices and potentially start to reduce the amount of space that we have going forward our process is going to be to review our leases and start to see when our leases come up and we know that and then start to put together a plan on reducing that amount of office space really going into 2022 as we could finish out this process toward the fall winter of 2021 vincent alexander colicchio barrington research associates inc analyst and then one quick one if i may how much exposure do you have to south africa and is the unrest there having any impact on your operation rohit kapoor co founder vice chairman and chief executive officer yes vincent i ll take that so in south africa our operations are in cape town and most of the unrest is taking place in other areas within south africa particularly around durban and johannesburg we have beefed up our security protocols out there and are doing a number of things to make sure that our employees are safe and secure out there so far we ve not seen any real impact with the disturbances that have taken place in south africa on our operations our exposure to south africa continues to be very small it s not a very substantial part of our business but it s an important part of our business that is growing nicely and we ve got a very good talent pool out there and we d like to build up our capability there vincent alexander colicchio barrington research associates inc analyst okay thank you nice quarter guys rohit kapoor co founder vice chairman and chief executive officer thank you vincent operator and our last question comes from david grossman with stifel david michael grossman stifel nicolaus company inc analyst thank you i wonder if i could just maybe follow up a couple of questions that have already been asked and maybe the first one is i think there have been a couple of different approaches to the margin question and what s a sustainable equilibria for the business given all the distortions that we re seeing over the last several months is there anything you can add to what you ve already said i mean you said that t e probably doesn t go back to pre pandemic levels you d probably require less office space it sounds like you re higher rate in om is at a lower rate than your revenue growth so can you at all convention for us what is when we think beyond this year how we should be thinking about operating margin even if you don t give specific guidance but at least give us some context to think about it maurizio nicolelli executive vice president and chief financial officer sure david let me expand on it a little bit more so when you look at this year s margins obviously we had elevated margins in the first half of the year when you look at the second half of the year they start to come down and so what s happening really within our margins in the second half of the year we have a number of things that are flowing through in particular we restarted our increments or salary increases and we have another round that s going to happen in the fourth quarter of this year we also are spending on technology similar to rohit talked about in terms of the work from home environment that we re investing in we gave out margin kind of guidance of 16 to 17 to get to that level in 2022 that is right around where we would be in the second half of the year more toward the upper end of the year as we get toward the end of the year we re going to start to finalize our new operating model for the go forward and that s going to help us make decisions on office real estate and those changes will bleed into 2022 but within our guidance also we do talk about to a certain extent of the return to office in the fourth quarter of this year and we have a certain amount of people coming back to the office that we have assumed in the fourth quarter that may also bleed into q1 so when you look at margins really on a go forward basis i would still focus you on what we talked about at investor day 16 to 17 but i would be at the upper end of that range at a minimum really going forward and that s how we re thinking about it at least right now going into the fourth quarter for 2022 but obviously as we get into 2022 and if we do foresee more people working from a work from home environment and we do start to optimize our footprint and we do have a lower amount of spend that comes back from a number of different areas particularly t e that will give us also additional margin enhancements going for 2022 that will help us bridge the gap between 2021 and 2022 operator duration 53 minutes call

room for everyone to grow in this business in july 2020 a few months before the share sale brasilagro ceo andré guillaumon pitched his group s credentials in a chat with xp investimentos we have a portfolio of nearly 300 000 hectares in brazil he said adding there s room for everyone to grow in this business in september last year it was btg pactual s turn to enter the fray the investment bank had taken over a new fund linked to brasilagro valued at more than 363 million reais 70 million by may 10 this year according to the brazilian financial and capital markets association anbima btg pactual effectively controls part of the assets and liabilities of the agribusiness giant through this fund in this way the bank trades the shares belonging to são paulo based group charles river which specializes in riskier equity market investments on the stock market the group holds nearly 10 of brasilagro s shares among the other shareholders in the agricultural giant that have voting rights are funds linked to u s banks citibank and jp morgan both accused of complicity in the destruction of the amazon rainforest and its peoples as well as swiss bank credit suisse and brazil s itaubank s a part of the itaú financial services group both btg pactual and xp investimentos declined to comment when contacted by agência pública foreign interests take aim at brazil s national territory since 2010 incra has been responsible for authorizing the sale of land to foreign interests particularly for medium to large estates which is brasilagro s niche the company has already made the case to the government that it does not own rural real estate but government inspectors have revealed that as of 2016 the company had acquired a total of 319 000 hectares or about 788 000 acres to prove that this arrangement was not illegal brasilagro had to show the land titles in its name and demonstrate show that it wasn t a company with a foreign directorship as there had already been suspicions raised about the company incra opened proceedings to clear up the matter in may 2016 obliging brasilagro to send in the month following the start of the investigation a long list of documents 200 pages of statements fiscal documents and a complete list of its shareholders at the time what the federal land agency discovered was that every share traded on the stock market in brazil or abroad corresponded to a vote in brasilagro s general assemblies one can conclude that whoever holds the highest number of shares is the one that has the real decision making power in the company it said in an official document and the largest group of shareholders government inspectors found are those registered under foreign names the rapid progress of the investigation in 2016 the year brazil was consumed by the impeachment drama of then president dilma rousseff stalled during the subsequent administrations of michel temer and jair bolsonaro in practice the directors of incra at the time appointed by the centrão the group of politicians from various political parties who lack a defined ideological orientation and instead seek a close relationship with the executive branch of government in order to increase their influence and defend their interests did not proceed with the investigators requests delaying any future discoveries about the company the investigators requested information from notary offices across the cerrado region to confirm or dispel their suspicions incra would have to search the notary offices to find the records for the farmland declared by brasilagro during the same period the issue regained political prominence at the end of 2020 the brazilian senate approved legislation that would ease the process of selling land to foreign interests with the bill now before the chamber of deputies brazil s lower house of congress musical chairs less than a month into the investigation incra had identified 241 289 hectares 596 238 acres of farmland bought and not yet sold by brasilagro the agency told agência pública that these purchases had not been approved shortly before in january 2016 the then president of the company was looking ahead to making further purchases in the country when we look at the exchange rate and our margins and we see very important acquisition opportunities these kinds of deals are becoming more interesting júlio césar de toledo piza neto told the newspaper estadão after eight years at the company piza neto left his roles as the company s president and director of investor relations piza neto was one of brasilagro s biggest names on the financial markets today he s a member of the agribusiness superior council at the federation of industries of the state of são paulo fiesp with his term set to run until the end of 2021 piza neto wasn t the first big name previously associated with brasilagro at least not publicly before him billionaire property developer elie horn nurtured a strong relationship for over 15 years with brasilagro s majority shareholders the founder of cyrela one of the biggest construction firms in brazil horn worked to boost brasilagro s credibility on the financial markets according to bloomberg although he left brasilagro s board in june 2012 horn remains a shareholder he holds shares in the company giant under his own name and that of his company cape town llc registered in the u s state of delaware in an interview with agência estado horn predicted a new property boom following bolsonaro s victory in the 2018 election i would just like for the boom to not be as big as it was in the past he said at the time he also declared himself thrilled with the incoming government a laborious process after the first few indications of irregularities at brasilagro incra needed to find the registration records for the company s rural estates in the notary offices that would allow inspectors to ascertain where it was that brasilagro was suspected of having rented taken over or bought land illegally at this point the investigation started to slow it took nearly two years between a recommendation to take further action and a request to send off official documents to the notary offices in march 2018 just one signature by the director of land ownership planning was needed in order to expedite the documents instead there was another delay for one year until they were finally sent in may 2019 three different directors had passed through the role by then one of the officials involved in the investigation into brasilagro told agência pública that they didn t remember if the internal changes at incra affected the investigation investigations often take a long time because we have very few staff at our disposal we can only look into what our team can handle in terms of the workload the official said speaking on condition of anonymity officially incra says the investigation continues under the auspices of the division for inspection and monitoring of foreign acquisitions the latest development was the expedition of eight official letters to notary offices in the states of piauí maranhão mato grosso bahia minas gerais and goiás the government maintains the understanding that rural properties were purchased by brasilagro without the authorization of incra or the national congress following the publication of parecer agu la 01 2010 the legislation that regulates the issue the alleged method agência pública contacted the notary offices that had received requests for information by incra as part of their search for the records of brasilagro s farms only one responded an office in correntina in the far west of the state of bahia the official responsible there claimed to have not received any documents from incra but in the material consulted by agência pública there is proof of shipment by incra following this loose end agência pública identified a possible method behind brasilagro s activities the chaparral estate in correntina is one of the five farms that the company owns in the western bahia more than 2 000 times the size of rio de janeiro s cavernous maracanã stadium the estate lies along one of the main trucking routes for agricultural produce in this part of the country the br 020 highway and produces cotton corn and soy cases of deforestation in the region have already been flagged by the consortium chain reaction research such as in december 2018 when brasilagro was suspected of clearing almost 2 000 hectares 5 000 acres of native forests in the region even though chaparral is under the control of brasilagro it s not registered in its name according to the federal government s land management system the farm belongs to imobiliária cajueiro ltda whose legal guarantors are the president and the director of brasilagro andré guillaumon from são paulo and gustavo javier lópez an argentinian national both companies are located at the same são paulo address on avenida brigadeiro faria lima it is a very common practice in the country because in the event that any problems arise the businessmen are able to cut ties thereby stopping any penalties hitting their assets for foreigners however this practice is illegal according to an official at incra involved in the brasilagro case in six months it was possible to reach a conclusion on the case by asking the notary offices for information making inquiries and contacting bodies responsible for shareholding control in the country the official said also speaking on condition of anonymity brasilagro used the same approach with its eight other properties in the cerrado valued at approximately 380 million reais 74 million according to the special department of federal revenue of brazil as the second incra official explained there are companies that divide their territories into two three or multiple cnpjs sometimes with the intention of evading inspectors although it s also an accounting control and legal maneuver commonly employed in brazil by doing this the official said brasilagro could dissociate its farms from its own national registry number when you create a string of cnpjs like this you make it very difficult for the people working at the notary office since they will be evaluating the documents of a company registered in brazil with its headquarters in brazil with brazilians among the shareholders which nevertheless will be companies controlled by corporate groups abroad it s a way of getting around the law says maurício correia a lawyer who coordinates the association of lawyers for rural workers of the state of bahia aatr the association has been monitoring the purchase of land by foreigners in the cerrado for years according to correia the same practice of real estate control by foreign owned groups has already been identified in the far west of bahia he says the government could decree brasilagro s purchases to be null and void if the irregularities are proved in practice the investors would lose their land without there necessarily having to be an official deregistration in the municipal notary offices correia says one billion reais worth of land data from the special department of federal revenue of brazil gathered by the website brasil io show that brasilagro is worth more than 1 billion reais nearly 200 million when taking into account its real estate and direct affiliates the company opened seven of these affiliates after the 2010 legal landmark that restricted the sale of brazil s land to foreign interests it is these affiliates under which the arrojadinho farm also in western bahia and the são josé ii farm in são raimundo das mangabeiras maranhão state among others are registered são josé ii is a little more than 17 000 hectares 42 000 acres of which 10 000 hectares 24 700 acres are dedicated to the cultivation of corn and soy in the maranhão area of the cerrado brasilagro itself announced this 100 million reais 19 million purchase to its shareholders in 2017 the same method has been used again in the state of piauí during the pandemic in may 2020 the company bought a farm measuring 4 500 hectares 11 100 acres in baixa grande do ribeiro one of the front lines in the advance of soy plantations in the matopiba region it paid 25 million reais 4 8 million for the land once again without the oversight of incra or the national congress brasilagro told agência pública that it is a brazilian company with stocks listed on the novo mercado segment on the b3 stock exchange and we conduct our business using the very best practices in corporate governance we would like to reiterate that all deals and transactions carried out by the company are in line with the relevant legislation the company said via a note for our report xp investimentos told agência pública that allegations of improper land deals have no basis in truth brazilian in name only argentine ranchers as well as the bank of new york various pension funds in the u s and many offshore companies registered in tax havens are among the beneficiaries of brasilagro s operations cresud the argentine agribusiness giant holds the majority of individual shares in the company it has made no attempt to cover up the risks that its activities in brazil entail to investors in the u s the implementation of the law could mean we require approval before future purchases and other additional procedures which could result in delays and or the inability to obtain the approval required by the law cresud said in a june 2020 filing to the u s securities and exchange commission on brasilagro s website there is barely a mention of other shareholders but agência pública was able to identify major investors from the u s such as a number of retirement funds ranging from the utah retirement systems to the los angeles city employees retirement system and the public school and education employee retirement systems of missouri all of which have voting rights in brasilagro s stockholder meetings one of the representatives of these investors in brazil is ricardo josé martins gimenez a businessman and decision maker at brasilagro on behalf of the bank of new york and the pensions fund division of the new york city comptroller martins gimenez also represents an offshore company called kopernik based in the cayman islands and the state of delaware according to u s regulators kopernik also has voting rights in brasilagro s stockholder meetings none of the u s pension funds or the argentinian investors from cresud had responded to agência pública s requests for comment by the time this report was published a north american offensive the brasilagro case highlights once again the presence of u s investors in the brazilian cerrado there are two other noteworthy groups involved the retirement fund for north american teachers known as tiaa and harvard university reports by the social network for justice and human rights suggest that both groups have accumulated more than 750 000 hectares 1 85 million acres of land in brazil since 2008 adding the land owned by brasilagro u s investors hold sway over more than 1 million hectares 2 5 million acres in the cerrado it s estimated that harvard alone has already spent nearly half a billion dollars on land in this region that serves as the cradle of many of brazil s great waterways as reported by agência pública the money from the ivy league university financed land grabbing in the state of bahia for a farm bigger than the city of são paulo the case led to a lawsuit in state level courts with developments in the case in october 2020 as reported by mongabay

specific identified events these items are non gaap measures that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by

in this manner i would now like to turn the call over to methanex s president and ceo mr john floren for his comments and a question and answer period john floren president and chief executive officer thanks kim good morning everyone today i m pleased to discuss our excellent second quarter 2021 financial results in addition we will share our view of the methanol markets review our operational results and discuss our outlook entering the third quarter we would also make a few remarks regarding our decision to restart construction on our geismar 3 project our strategic shipping partnership and our priorities around capital allocation including the recent announcement to increase the quarterly dividend then we will open up the call for your questions turning to our financial results we increased our average realized price in the second quarter to 376 per tonne a 13 increase compared to the first quarter adjusted ebitda increased to 262 million in the second quarter an increase of 20 million compared to the first quarter we also recorded higher adjusted net income of 95 million or 1 24 per share in the second quarter an increase of 13 million or 0 17 per share compared to the first quarter these results illustrate the significant leverage that our earnings have to methanol prices now turning to the methanol market over the last 12 months methanol prices have rebounded as the global economic recovery continues and vaccines rollout worldwide current methanol industry dynamics are favorable supported by strong methanol demand low global inventory levels ongoing industry supply challenges and a constructive energy price environment we estimate that the global demand methanol demand increased by approximately 3 in the second quarter compared to the first quarter we anticipate that global methanol demand will surpass pre pandemic level later this year strong methanol demand combined with ongoing industry supply challenges around the world and the delayed start up of new industry capacity additions supported higher prices in the second quarter with tight market conditions continuing into the third quarter we estimate that the industry cost curve set in china has increased to approximately 300 to 320 per tonne supported by rising coal and natural gas prices we recently posted our august prices which remained at 542 per tonne in north america and 420 per tonne for asia pacific we set our european contract price quarterly and our third quarter posted price is eur410 or approximately 485 per tonne as we mentioned on our call in mid july over the last few months we completed a comprehensive review of the medium to long term industry outlook we reviewed our expectations for demand growth the timing for new industry capacity additions and industry operating rates for new and existing methanol plants over the coming years based on that work we believe that the methanol industry medium term outlook is positive and new industry supply will be needed to meet growing methanol demand over the next 5 years now turning to our operational results our second quarter 2021 production of 1 5 million tonnes was lower than the first quarter primarily due to the lower gas availability in new zealand and chile in new zealand our production was lower in the second quarter compared to the first quarter due to ongoing lower gas deliveries in addition we agreed to a short term commercial arrangement with genesis energy to make natural gas available to support a tight new zealand electricity market as a result we temporarily idled one of our motunui plants for approximately 3 months we expect the margin from the sale of gas will be offset the margin loss from the lower forecasted production volume of 85 000 tonnes we estimate that production in new zealand for 2021 of 1 4 million tonnes the upstream gas sector is completing several field development projects that could improve gas availability over the coming years in geismar our production in the second quarter was higher than the first quarter as we completed a planned turnaround at our geismar 2 facility in the first quarter we finished the debottlenecking project at our geismar 2 plant in the second quarter of 2021 following the work completed at our geismar 1 plant late in 2020 as a result our operating capacity for our geismar facilities is now 2 2 million tonnes on an annual basis an increase of 10 completed for capital costs were approximately 125 per tonne for the addition of 200 000 tonnes of capacity in trinidad our production in the second quarter was higher than the first quarter as we received full gas deliveries based on current gas delivery we estimate that production in trinidad for 2021 to be 1 1 million tonnes reflecting methanex s equity interest in chile as expected our production in the second quarter was lower than the first quarter we typically experience lower gas deliveries in the southern hemisphere winter months impacting our second and third quarters we should receive higher gas deliveries in the fourth quarter and we estimate production in chile for 2021 to be 800 000 tonnes to 900 000 tonnes in egypt our production in the second quarter was slightly lower than first quarter due to minor technical issues that have been resolved in medicine hat our production in the second quarter was similar to the first quarter as the plant ran at nearly full operating rates now turning to our balance sheet we have a strong financial position with over 750 million in cash on our balance sheet at the end of the second quarter this amount reflects our strong adjusted ebitda results in the second quarter and the repayment of 173 million drawn on our g3 construction facility we ve previously announced a strategic partnership shipping partnership with mitsui o s k limited or mol with the proceeds of 145 million expected by the end of 2021 this transaction will not have a material impact on our earnings our waterfront shipping subsidiary generates revenue from shipping methanol to methanex customers and third party backhaul arrangements as a result of the partnership mol will be entitled to a proportional share of waterfront net earnings which fluctuate based on ship volume and tanker market rates however in terms of our financial statements our ownership of waterfront shipping now and after this transaction is complete is accounted for on a consolidated basis resulting in a 100 of the revenues and expenses being included in our financial statements we continue to generate meaningful cash flow across a wide range of methanol prices and have an undrawn backup liquidity including our 600 million g3 construction facility and our 300 million revolving credit facility now turning to our geismar 3 project we were pleased to announce that our board unanimously approved the restart of the construction of our geismar 3 project a unique project with significant capital and operating cost advantages that enhance the project returns an abundant low cost natural gas supply in the us underpins production for this project in addition we estimate that g3 will have one of the lowest co2 emission intensity profiles in the industry ultimately geismar 3 will strengthen our asset portfolio and substantially improve our future cash generation capability we believe that geismar 3 will deliver significant long term value to our shareholders our capital cost estimate for the project is 1 25 billion to 1 35 billion we expect that approximately 435 million will be committed to the project as we end as at the end of q3 2020 around through the care and maintenance period we expect approximately 800 million to 900 million remaining capital cost after resuming construction in october 2021 we are confident in our ability to complete this project on time and on budget we have substantially reduced the project execution risk profile over the last 24 months we are well positioned from a labor perspective as construction on our project is ahead of other major capital projects in the region we have also secured prices for the majority of our bulk material costs our remaining budget includes allowances and contingencies for both escalation and the remaining risks on the project and lastly turning to our capital allocation priorities our capital allocation priorities remain the same we use the cash that we generate to maintain our business pursue value accretive growth opportunities and continue our strong record of returning cash excess cash to shareholders going forward we will increase our emphasis on financial flexibility in three ways we plan to hold more cash targeting targeting a minimum of 300 million of cash on hand plus the remaining g3 capital cost during construction we plan to target lower leverage and reduce our debt levels over time to a target of approximately 3 times debt to ebitda at methanol prices between 275 per tonne to 300 per tonne and we will increase our weighting on flexible vehicles for distribution such as share buybacks combined with sustainable dividend to return capital to shareholders we recently announced that we reset our quarterly dividend to 12 5 cents per share we anticipate that we will have the ability to further de lever and increase shareholder distributions such as share buybacks in a few quarters at methanol prices of approximately 325 a tonne or higher geismar 3 is the only significant growth capital in our plans over the next few years we expect that g3 will substantially increase our cash generation capability and support a significant increase in our future shareholder distribution potential now turning to the outlook for the third quarter we expect to realize methanol prices in the third quarter of 2021 will be similar to the second quarter based on our posted prices so far we forecast that our third quarter production will be similar to the second quarter we anticipate our adjusted ebitda results in the third quarter to be similar to the second quarter finally i wanted to mention that we recently published our annual sustainability report we have publicly reported on our sustainability performance since 1997 and continue to enhance our sustainability and esg related disclosure to align with evolving best practice and to support greater transparency and comparability this year our disclosure is aligned with the sustainability accounting standards board or sasb reporting standards for the chemical and marine transportation sectors also our disclosures reference some aspects of the task force on climate related financial disclosures or tcfd and some requirements of the global reporting initiative or gri we will continue to look at ways that we can improve our sustainability performance and reporting over the coming years i would now be happy to answer any questions questions and answers operator thank you and the first question is from steve hansen from raymond james please go ahead your line is now open steve hansen raymond james ltd analyst yeah good morning guys john just thinking about chile specifically for a minute in the past you ve gone through the effort of refurbing chile i and then starting chile iv this is all pre covid but just give us a sense for where the gas availability might lie there in the region right now and any plans you might have over time to think about two plant operation i understand that covid required some reshuffling of the production asset profile but just getting it done for now that we re in a recovery mode here where you what do think about that that complex moving forward john floren president and chief executive officer yeah the gas profile in argentina has improved a lot in the last 12 months we re running our plant right now on chile gas and that profile has also improved in the last 12 months so our expectation steve today is by the third late third quarter early fourth quarter that we ll be running both plants in chile steve hansen raymond james ltd analyst okay great that s very helpful and just just can you clarify i missed the number but the metric that you cited on the cost per tonne to complete the g1 g2 debottlenecking and just now that those two projects are now complete any other debottlenecking projects that you might be contemplating across the portfolio thanks john floren president and chief executive officer yeah we re always looking to get more methanol out of our existing so we re always have lots of ideas that we look at and execute if they make sense so we are continuing to look for other debottlenecking opportunities but nothing to report today steve the cost for completing the 200 000 additional debottleneck in geismar was 125 per tonne steve hansen raymond james ltd analyst very helpful thanks i ll jump in the queue john floren president and chief executive officer thanks steve operator thank you the next question is from ben isaacson from scotiabank please go ahead your line is now open ben isaacson scotiabank analyst thank you very much first question is given the changing operating in your portfolio over the past year or so can you update us as to what percentage of your sales go into each of the three or four major methanol markets depending on whether you grade china out of asia or not and based on the review that you conducted at the methanol market to restart g3 do you see g3 impacting your regional sales allocation in the future how do you see that changing john floren president and chief executive officer yes so we ve earmarked 100 of g3 to go to asia in the modeling that we ve done for the economics and the irr calculations that we ve shared so that hasn t changed so if we re able to do better than that and place some in the atlantic basin obviously that makes the economics even more attractive than what we ve already published really attractive economics we don t disclose ben where our product goes around the world it s a very fluid supply chain and we move product to optimize our net backs as well as to take advantage of certain spot situations that may arise in different parts of the world and to balance out our supply chain and inventory so we don t really disclose what product goes where ben isaacson scotiabank analyst thank you and my follow up is can you just talk about how the freight market is impacting the company maybe discuss the magnitude of freight rates versus normal who is bearing the additional cost is it methanex or is it built into prices and i guess you being an active shipper and an owner of waterfront do you have an outlook in terms of how freight rates will evolve john floren president and chief executive officer well we wish there were a lot higher i mean despite what we re seeing in container markets and dry bulk liquid tankers for chemicals are still not that great below what i d call average prices so we d like to see higher prices because obviously we make more money with higher prices and we think we have a competitive advantage on our shipping so there seems to be still lots of tanker capacity in the world and we re not seeing the same thing that the world is seeing on dry bulk and containers ben isaacson scotiabank analyst great thank you operator thank you the next question is from john roberts from ubs please go ahead your line is now open john roberts ubs securities llc analyst thank you lyondellbasell had an unfortunate incident yesterday with their acetic acid plant is that methanol unit running do you know and will that come into the merchant market here until they can get the acetic acid plant back up again john floren president and chief executive officer yeah i don t have any more information about that site than what s been reported in the press and i haven t seen anything reported regarding operations my understanding based on what i ve read they were in planned turnaround for the acetic acid unit so it was a planned and they were just starting the turnaround is what i understand and that s why their contractors were entering the unit i don t know any more than that john john roberts ubs securities llc analyst okay john floren president and chief executive officer yeah i agree a really tragic event and i think it really illustrates all the attention that we ve put on safety and process safety and you can never take your eye off the ball because there was another event in germany this week as well in leverkusen where two other people were killed so really tragic events john roberts ubs securities llc analyst and then since you just updated your longer term industry outlook what did you assume longer term for your gas constrained plants did you do you assume an eventual restart at titan or eventual restart waitara valley in the longer term outlook or how long do you wait before you think about other options for the equipment that s there john floren president and chief executive officer yeah we re optimistic that over time we ll get those plants restarted we ve put a little bit in our 5 year outlook but certainly not full rates for those two sites john roberts ubs securities llc analyst thank you operator thank you the next question is from joel jackson from bmo capital markets please go ahead your line is now open joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst hi good morning john coming to a couple of a couple of questions i ll go one by one john thanks for giving the guidance for q3 it looks like you re guiding to a 19 discount rate again in the third quarter so third quarter in a row of back is it fair to say that based on your contracts and what s going on here and that we should be modeling as a placeholder now 19 discount rate not 17 now last quarter you had said that the 19 discount rate a little bit higher than 17 was because of some weak chinese spot prices the chinese spot prices rose a fair bit in the third quarter can you help us reconcile all of it john floren president and chief executive officer yes i m not changing my guidance joel on the discount rate at this time if we think it s a permanent structural change we ll certainly change the guidance we re comfortable on 17 i think i would look at the overall net back price that s what we look at 375 for the quarter was an excellent quarter and generated over 1 billion run rate so we re very happy with the realized price in the quarter and we re expecting strong pricing to continue in the second half of this year joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst thank you for that so my other question is obviously different investors want different things you know that being in this role for a long time and you ve laid out and thank you for this couple of weeks ago what your strategy is will be around buybacks now you want to make sure on your balance sheet you have your cash buffer i think you said 300 million and then you would have enough cash on the balance sheet build up to finish g3 so one other question for you is looking at what the share price is doing there s a clear valuation disconnect i think between the stock price and where your earnings and cash flow power are where commodity price levels are typically the finance book says you should be doing share buybacks right you should be going in the market buying your stock and reducing that disconnect you have g3 it makes sense why you re doing it but does this all make you think about maybe changing some of the thought that maybe you should take on a bit more risk and buyback stock a bit earlier before having all the cash for g3 on the balance sheet john floren president and chief executive officer yes so our financial strategy has not changed i mean we fine tune it as you point out a couple of weeks ago but uses for cash that s generated from the business are to maintain the business grow the business with value accretive projects like g3 and then return excess cash to shareholders the slight tweak is to have a little bit less on a fixed return to shareholders so we reset the dividend at 12 5 and have more flexibility to returning cash in a flexible way to shareholders so at 325 per tonne and higher methanol realized prices we think in a few quarters as we de lever a little bit and increase a little bit of cash on the balance sheet for g3 that we ll be able to enter into a share buyback but our policy of borrowing money is not to buy back share so any money that we borrow is for the project g3 and remind you we did change our strategy there during covid where our plan was to use the construction loan and to draw on it as we continued on a project and with covid we decided and then replaced that so the construction with bonds over time and we decided to because the markets were open last september to just go out and get all the bonds at that time so that s why we have quite a bit of cash on our balance sheet but it s allocated for g3 and we re not going to use it to buy back shares joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst thank you operator thank you the next question is from eric petrie from citi please go ahead your line is now open eric petrie citigroup global markets analyst hey good morning john john floren president and chief executive officer good morning eric petrie citigroup global markets analyst methanex s posted methanol price spread between asia and north america is kind of at a record of roughly 100 a tonne so how do you think about it is it sustainable and going forward how do you see that level trending john floren president and chief executive officer yeah we ve said for a number of years despite lots of analysts writing to the contrary that we think the basin balances and price differentials will continue and they are higher than we would have even assumed and that s based on production issues in the atlantic basin so how long this record i don t know if it s a record but it is on the higher end of the differential goes it really depends on what we and our competitors do with product that we re producing in the atlantic basin so i can t predict what our competitors are going to do we know what we re going to do and we would expect that the basin differentials to continue maybe not at the current levels but they will continue eric petrie citigroup global markets analyst okay helpful and my follow up question you mentioned the higher china coal prices and natural gas prices i think you know coal was trading around a thousand rmb per metric tonne double that from recent lows so how do you see prices of coal going forward and the cost curve evolving into 2022 john floren president and chief executive officer yeah there s coal remains quite we understand not readily available in china and they re consuming a lot for power generation so if economic activity continues we would expect coal to continue to be priced higher than what we were thinking there is two markets in china for coal let s remember there s the power generation market which is really set by the government and that s not anywhere near thousand rmb per tonne and then there is the spot market or the other traded market which where chemicals and others get their coal and the reason it s a thousand is because of supply demand fundamentals you re right to point out gas has really shot up not only in north america you know it s almost close to 4 an mmbtu now but in europe it s at 12 and nobody was predicting that a year ago and that s really impacted methanol methanol production in europe there is two plants in holland one is shut down and the other one is operating at minimal rates because of the high gas prices and you know it s hard to see at this point that those gas prices coming down in the near future based on the on the inventories that we see in the united states but you know these things have a way of changing quickly and nobody predicted 12 gas but i think it s a function of a couple of years 150 gas with no investment so i always say the cure for high prices is high prices and the cure for low prices is low prices and that s what we see in commodities eric petrie citigroup global markets analyst great thank you operator thank you the next question is from hassan ahmed from alembic global advisors please go ahead your line is now open hassan ahmed alembic global advisors analyst morning john john floren president and chief executive officer morning hassan ahmed alembic global advisors analyst john a question on demand you mentioned sequentially global demand was up according to your estimates by i believe 3 and if i remember correctly sequentially in q1 demand was down so the question is what are you guys seeing or what are you forecasting in terms of demand growth for the remainder of the year and i guess where i m going with this question is that again and again you mentioned it a bunch of other chemical companies mentioned it about obviously supply chain disruptions that have happened over the last couple of months inventory is being lean people sort of back filling sort of orders probably a function of winter storm uri as well so just trying to get a sense of where you feel underlying demand is and could we even expect a further bump up from this 3 that we saw in q2 john roberts ubs securities llc analyst yeah like i said in my remarks we expect to get back to pre pandemic levels later this year so that is increased demand in q3 there are some mto plants that are taking some planned maintenance the mto industry has been operating at really high rates for a couple of years and in q2 they operated at 92 which is above our even estimate so we expect to have them to have some maintenance which could impact demand but we expect demand to continue to grow through the second half of this year a couple of applications are still lagging are the fuels applications mtbe biodiesel those kinds of applications because we re still not seeing globally a return to normal driving habits because of the pandemic so but we expect those to improve as we get back to more normal habits as people are vaccinated and the pandemic is brought under somewhat of a control hassan ahmed alembic global advisors analyst understood and the other side of the equation on the supply side obviously a healthy pricing environment and pricing continues to tick up obviously you guys announced the restart of or work on geismar 3 but what are you guys seeing broadly speaking in terms of the broader industry supply response and are you seeing any sort of project delays or maybe even people sort of ratcheting up their plans in terms of bringing online new supply john floren president and chief executive officer yeah i think having the price environment that we just come through for almost 2 years a lot of projects that were being thought about were shelved or cancelled altogether we expect the koch plant to run at some point now we understand they ran for a bit in july but they will they will get lined up and run at some point during this year is our current expectation beyond that we have a bit of supply coming on in iran how it runs is anybody s guess certainly the track record has not been great and then china will add a bit of capacity in the inner mongolia backward integrate a couple of mto plants and some other plants will come out as more and more restrictions on on the east coast of china so net net we re not expecting much new supply beyond what s coming in from koch and iran over over the coming 3 years to 5 years hassan ahmed alembic global advisors analyst understood very helpful john thanks so much john floren president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you the next question is from nelson ng from rbc capital markets please go ahead your line is now open nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst great thanks good morning john john floren president and chief executive officer morning nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst just a quick question for you so you mentioned earlier that you were optimistic on gas availability in the various regions going forward in new zealand in particular i think gas production has been pretty low this year do you have any color on production levels going forward in terms of like production issues drilling activity and whether current prices are like incentivizing lower exploration john floren president and chief executive officer yeah i ll remind you the gas in new zealand is very wet gas so there are lots of barrels of liquids and oil prices have any that really helps the economics and they re really going after the liquids so a higher energy complex in general is positive for our business and that s one of the reasons it incentivizes more exploration and development yeah situation in new zealand really was the field failed and that lost 30 of its production late last year and nobody was expecting that and that s caused the gas market to tighten up quite substantially the current situation in their winter as well they had a lack of rainfall which is leading to lower than expected hydro power it s rained again in new zealand so that situation is behind us now and there is drilling going on i think that s the positive thing for us is that the upstream owners of the field maui and pohokura are drilling and planning to drill more so we ll know a little bit more in the next 12 months the results of those drilling and like i said we re certainly contracted for two plants for the to the end of the decade and we re optimistic the drilling will be successful and we ll see a third might have a reasonable opportunity to start up as well this is not new in new zealand we ve seen this before and they pretty well develop the reserves and the country needs them so yeah we re optimistic but really i think we d be modeling a two plant operation at this point until we see the results of what s happening in the upstream nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst great thanks for the additional color i ll leave it there john floren president and chief executive officer thanks operator thank you the next question is from laurence alexander from jefferies please go ahead your line is now open laurence alexander jefferies llc analyst hi there could you give a update on what line of sight you have to the amount of global shipping capacity that is ordered or under construction that would could use methanol as a flex fuel and what that could mean for methanol demand over the next 4 years or 5 years and similarly what you re seeing in the chinese industrial boiler market development john floren president and chief executive officer yeah so we have eight of our owned ships on order proman our competitor out of trinidad and maersk has one that s what s on order at this time a loss of other interest so takes about 2 years to build a ship laurence so i don t know how many more orders are going to be placed in the next few years but we would expect more each ship around a 50 000 deadweight vessel running on methanol 100 of the time would consume between 10 000 tonnes and 12 000 tonnes so you can do the math there as far as boilers yeah we continue to see that market replacing coal but there s other potential natural gas as well and diesel so that market continues to be a couple of million to 3 million tonnes of methanol demand and we would expect it to grow laurence alexander jefferies llc analyst and do you have a sense in your more industrial or the formaldehyde applications and so forth what s the kind of level of pent up demand is i mean downstream companies are talking about having lost 1 to 2 of volume because of supply chain issues but there is probably some kind of multiplier effect when we get back up to the commodities that you supply john floren president and chief executive officer yeah i d be guessing laurence and i probably don t have a good guess but i would agree with the assumptions there is pent up demand laurence alexander jefferies llc analyst yeah thank you operator the next question is from matthew blair from tudor pickering holt please go ahead your line is now open matthew blair tudor pickering holt co analyst good morning john it looks like trinidad natural gas production is down about 21 year to date versus same period last year you raised your trinidad volume guidance pretty meaningfully so that s just good work from your procurement team or is there anything else going on there john floren president and chief executive officer yeah we did the supply to 100 of our gas allocation for atlas for most of the year and that s what we ve been told to expect for the balance of the year and that s the guidance we provided matthew blair tudor pickering holt co analyst great sounds good and then on our modeling your implied costs seem to drift up a little bit in q2 would you agree and were there any factors that you can point to and then as we look at q3 i m just thinking about the higher net gas environment in the us i know you re hedged but could you talk about whether this would be something we should be thinking about for q3 modeling john floren president and chief executive officer yeah nothing abnormal in our cost structure quarter to quarter some there could be a few things here and there but nothing really our cost structure is actually quite a bit lower than it was last year as we ve taken a lot of steps to reduce it and as far as yeah you re right we ve hedged about 70 of our requirements for g1 and g2 so we re exposed about 30 to the spot market so depending on what price you re using for q3 versus what you have in your model it would impact us by about 30 of our gas requirement matthew blair tudor pickering holt co analyst great thanks for the color john floren president and chief executive officer you are welcome operator thank you the next question is from roland rausch from crown extra investments please go ahead your line is now open roland rausch crown extra investments ag analyst hey good morning john how are you john floren president and chief executive officer good morning good thanks roland rausch crown extra investments ag analyst well congratulations on another good quarter i would like to ask a two pronged question around liquidity and capital returns also coming back to one of your comments previously around there is quite a bit of cash on your balance sheet so if i round the updated numbers i see that the company has paid down 2 net million in debt for this year it s on over 750 million in cash if up to four shipping transaction that s around 900 million in cash plus there is a 900 million in lines of credits with the 300 million undrawn rcf and the 600 million unutilized construction loan so i got to a total of 1 8 billion of liquidity and then you just guided for another q3 in line so i assume we are looking at 2 billion in cash and lines of credits by the end of september where this is a total g3 that s only kicking in next year of 800 to 900 so why do you and your board do not think the shareholders deserve a large dividend or a clear share buyback program and i want to come back to one comment you made on your recent announcement on the call where at what prices you would start buy back the shares obviously we re on year to date lows so do you consider the current share price level as attractive to buy back shares thank you john floren president and chief executive officer yeah it s attractive to buy back shares the current price level i would agree with that we stated pretty clearly our financial strategy around what we want to do with our balance sheet and returning cash to to shareholders that hasn t changed so we want to maintain 300 million of cash plus the additional whatever g3 spend is left on the balance sheet once we ve achieved that we will start to return more cash to shareholders flexibly like we ve described and that could would include buybacks we reset the dividend and fixed dividend at 12 5 cents and our plan hasn t changed that we ll grow the company and we ve over the last 10 years growing the company in down spending about 3 billion and we ve returned over 2 billion to shareholders in the same period through dividends and buybacks so our balanced approach is the same right now we re spent having cash generation going toward the g3 project in addition to what s on our balance sheet and once that is achieved then we will look to return cash to shareholders so nothing s really changed roland rausch crown extra investments ag analyst okay operator thank you the next question is from cherilyn radbourne from td securities please go ahead your line is now open cherilyn radbourne td securities inc analyst thanks very much and good morning in terms of the outlook for methanol supply i was hoping you could give some perspective on what you think the current environment is like to contemplate a new methanol plant as far as being able to lock in a fixed cost with an e c partner in light of inflationary pressure and what sort of price deck financial institutions might be prepared to lend on john floren president and chief executive officer yeah it s a good it s a good question obviously that s going to impact us as well post g3 so it s something we look at all the time we may have some other brownfield opportunities but if we re assuming greenfield there s two projects that have been recently completed our public information around and that s the koch methanol plant that s in the process of starting up and the oci natgasoline plant both of them are around 1 7 tonnes or 1 8 million tonnes give or take and they were well north of 2 billion to complete based on public information that we saw so if you use those numbers that s public that s over 1100 a tonne and assuming gas pricing in the 300 to 350 range and a double digit return of around 10 to 11 you would need 400 methanol to get or higher to get that return so we certainly like and we love 400 methanol for 20 years to get a payback on a project like that but we ve seen quite a bit that of volatility in the last 12 years in our commodity and i think that if i m a bank looking to lend money to a potential project with those kinds of returns and what you doing on methanol price it seems in the hard to do category but having said that there s lots of seems to be lots of money out there trying to find a home so we ll see what happens but those are the kind of the number cheryl cherilyn radbourne td securities inc analyst and then second one is just could you speak to the company s confidence in the view that mto demand for methanol will be stable over the coming 5 years john floren president and chief executive officer yeah well i guess we can only look at what has happened in that industry and what s been going on in a high price and low price environment so the industry started up 4 years or 5 years ago that was what we call the first wave which is just about being completed now there s a couple of more plants that one is close to completion and one trying to get completed in the next couple of years and that s what we call the first wave and as the first wave was being commissioned there was a second wave and certainly with oil prices in the 40 range and naphtha in the 400 range it made more sense to look to naphtha crackers than 2 mto plants so we never expected the second wave and we re not we re not anticipating so what we think will happen is what s there will run we have 85 to 90 operating rates and i think we can only go on the history when we had 400 plus methanol pricing in 2018 they all ran at high rates when we had a low olefins cycle last year because of covid they ran at high rates and they continue to run at high rates so it s something we watch very closely because it is a big demand driver for methanol and like most things it s hard to predict the future but based on what we ve seen today we would expect that 85 to 90 operating rate cherilyn radbourne td securities inc analyst thanks operator thank you the next question is from chris shaw from monness crespi please go ahead your line is now open chris shaw monness crespi hardt co analyst good morning john how are you doing john floren president and chief executive officer good morning good chris chris shaw monness crespi hardt co analyst if one were to take a really pessimistic view on i guess global gas availability going forward outside of say medicine hat geismar what can you mind me what both the potential for moving any of your other plants ala the first few geismar plants or to another site and it doesn t have to be i guess geismar specifically but not only the potential but i guess the economics and i mean is that a possibility at all any of those plants in the future john floren president and chief executive officer i would say very unlikely what we ve looked at the kit that we have in the other locations the way it was built the way it s installed pretty expensive to move we had a unique opportunity we had two twin plants in chile and the way they were built we could lift them up and move them but i think that was unique to chile i sorry to chile ii and iii which are now geismar 1 and 2 but we look at things all the time but right now our focus is to get those plants running and where they are and we re not giving up any hope yet that we won t be able to achieve gas contracts to allow us to run all of our kit over time so we ve seen this in the history of our company i mean we didn t have any production in north america for the longest time and we re going to have 4 5 million here pretty soon 4 7 i guess with the debottlenecking so yeah so our focus is trying to get those plants running based on gas there and not moving them at this time chris shaw monness crespi hardt co analyst thanks and then just a reminder do you know i can probably jot down the math but not off the top of my head but the your cost per tonne for geismar 3 relative to what it would be for the when you say geismar 2 when you move similar or it s one lower john floren president and chief executive officer no about the same we ve got it to bit lower but not significantly and that s probably going to the gas efficiency on the geismar 3 spot is much superior to geismar 1 and 2 chris shaw monness crespi hardt co analyst okay got it thanks a lot operator thank you and the last question is from steve hansen from raymond james please go ahead your line is now open steve hansen raymond james ltd analyst hey john just one quick follow up if i may how do you feel about your human resources capabilities across the existing operating complex today it strikes me that everywhere we look we re hearing about strained labor resources both skilled and unskilled i m not so focused on the g3 but just on your existing operating complex today are you are you well positioned right now are you looking for people how you actually think about that and whether you re well positioned going forward here john floren president and chief executive officer yeah one of the benefits that we ve enjoyed in our company is a low turnover rate i mean if you compare our turnover rate on average to the industry not just not chemicals and other industry industry applications like that we were very low so where it doesn t mean we don t have turnover and retirements are becoming a bigger and bigger issue as especially in the western countries as we tend to the aging to retirement age so i don t have any concern today that we re at risk of not being able to run our plants efficiently because of labor but it s something we talk about all the time so things like diversity inclusion are really important to our company and to really expand our labor potential where we can look for new team members is really really important and each region is a little unique trinidad we have all kinds of labor today because of what s happened on that island in egypt we re employer of choice and certainly i m not concerned in the short term but it s something we think about all the time and we want to make sure that we re a great place to work we pay good wages and that we have people stay for a long long time and we re not planning on changing that strategy and philosophy steve hansen raymond james ltd analyst okay great that s helpful thank you john floren president and chief executive officer thanks steve okay well thanks we re very pleased to share our excellent financial results with you today we continue to generate meaningful cash flow across a wide range of methanol prices our capital allocation priorities remain the same we use the cash that we generate to maintain our business pursue value accretive growth opportunities and continue our strong track record of returning excess cash to shareholders thank you for joining us today and we will speak with you again in october and thank you for the interest in

million just after quarter end bringing our year to date total investment activity to 79 million in aggregate the quarter was highlighted by the growing and steady pace of our investment activity in convenience and automotive retail assets we continue to successfully execute on our multiple investment strategies which include traditional sale leasebacks accretive acquisitions of net leased properties and construction loans for new to industry assets we also broadened our portfolio further during the quarter by adding both new geographies as we added the state of michigan and new tenants as we added both valvoline and mavis tire s to our roster the company also continues to benefit from the strong performance of target asset classes as evidenced by our stable rent coverage of 2 6 times once again getty realized full normalized collections of our recurring rental income during the quarter as well as the covid related deferments we agreed to in 2020 which were due this quarter more broadly industry data published this month by the national association of convenience stores further demonstrates the health of the overall convenience store sector which had another record year of profits in 2020 despite the covid pandemic as we enter the second half of the year we are pleased that our year to date investment activity has positioned the company to raise our affo guidance at quarter end looking ahead we are committed to maintaining our healthy portfolio through active asset management in addition our team continues to work diligently to source and underwrite new opportunities to invest in our target asset classes including convenience stores car washes and automotive related retail properties and by unlocking embedded value through selected redevelopments we remain encouraged by the growing opportunities in our investment pipelines we are confident with our targeted investment approach which prioritizes acquiring real estate in strong metropolitan markets across the country we ll continue to drive additional shareholder value as we move through 2021 and beyond finally i would like to formally welcome evelyn infurna to our board of directors evelyn has a long track record of advising and investing in real estate companies and reits and i m excited about the value she will bring to our company i look forward to working with her for years to come with that i will turn the call over to mark to discuss our portfolio and investment activities mark j olear executive vice president and chief operating officer thank you chris as at the end of the quarter our portfolio includes 994 net lease properties six active redevelopment sites and five vacant properties our weighted average lease term was approximately 8 9 years and our overall occupancy excluding active redevelopments remain constant at 99 5 our portfolio remains spread over 35 states plus washington d c and our annualized base rents 65 of which come from the top 15 msas in the us continue to be well covered by our trailing 12 month tenant rent coverage ratio of 2 6 times in terms of our investment activities we had another busy quarter in which we invested 44 1 million in 53 properties and subsequent to the quarter and we acquired one additional property for 4 6 million bringing our year to date investment activity to 79 million across 60 properties our completed acquisitions during the second quarter included the purchase of 46 valvoline branded oil change centers for 31 million the triple net leases which are guaranteed by valvoline inc were acquired with 11 5 years of remaining base term and have multiple renewal options the properties are located primarily throughout the detroit grand rapids lansing msas in michigan and the toledo metropolitan area in ohio additionally we ve closed on the acquisition of three additional car wash properties for 10 4 million during the quarter these properties were added to our existing unitary lease with whitewater express car wash and have approximately 15 years remaining of the base term with multiple renewal options these properties are located in cincinnati ohio subsequent to the quarter end the company acquired a mavis tire center located in the chicago illinois msa for 4 6 million in aggregate we expect all of our completed acquisitions to generate cash yields that are in line with our historical quoted acquisition cap rate range for our targeted asset classes getty also funded an additional 2 7 million of construction loans for four new to industry convenience stores with refuel a c store operator with more than 100 locations across the southeast united states and texas bringing the total amount funded by getty to 11 1 million year to date as part of this transaction we will accrue interest on our investment during the construction phase of the project and we expect to acquire the properties via sale leaseback transaction at the end of the construction period we ended the quarter with a strong investment pipeline remain highly committed to continuing to grow our portfolio with convenience and automotive retail real estate and we expect that we will continue to pursue direct sale leaseback acquisitions of net lease properties and funding for new to industry construction moving to our redevelopment platform during the quarter we invested approximately 200 000 in sites which are in our pipeline at quarter end we had 11 signed leases or letters of intent which includes six active projects four signed leases on properties which are currently subject to triple net leases but which have not yet been recaptured from the current tenants and one signed letter of intent on a vacant property at quarter end rent commenced on a redevelopment project leased to 7 eleven in baltimore and maryland msa we invested approximately 125 000 in the project expect to generate a return of nearly 40 on that investment the company expects to rent expect rent to commence at a number of additional redevelopment sites during the second half of 2021 in total we have invested approximately 2 1 million in the 11 redevelopment projects in our pipeline and estimate that these projects will require total investment by getty of 7 8 million we project these redevelopments will generate incremental returns to the company in excess where we can invest these funds in the acquisition market today turning to our asset management activities for the quarter the company did not sell any properties but did exit four leased properties which had a de minimis impact on our financial results as we look ahead we will continue to selectively dispose the properties that we determined are no longer competitive in their current format and do not have compelling redevelopment potential with that i will turn the call over to brian to discuss our financial results brian r dickman executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks mark good morning everyone i ll start with a recap of earnings affo which we believe best reflects the company s core operating performance was 0 49 per share for the second quarter representing a year over year increase of 11 1 nareit ffo was also 0 49 per share for the quarter our total revenues were 38 7 million representing a year over year increase of 4 5 rental income which excludes tenant reimbursements and interest on notes and mortgages receivable grew more than 8 to 34 4 million strong acquisition activity over the last 12 months and the current our leases were the primary drivers of the increase additional contribution from rent commencements at nearly all the projects on the expense side g a cost increased in the quarter primarily due to employee related expenses including stock based compensation and non recurring retirement costs as well as certain professional fees property costs and environmental expenses both decreased in the quarter the reduction in property costs was largely driven by decreases in real estate taxes and certain professional fees related to redevelopment activities and the decline in environmental expenses was mostly attributable to lower professional fees and related expenses that flow through to affo as we note each quarter environmental expenses are subject to a number of estimates and non cash adjustments and will continue to be highly variable turning to the balance sheet our capital markets activities we ended the quarter with 542 5 million of total debt outstanding including 525 million of long term fixed rate unsecured notes and 17 5 million drawn against our 300 million revolving credit facility our weighted average borrowing cost was 4 2 and the weighted average maturity of our debt was 6 8 years in addition our total debt to total market capitalization was 29 our total debt to total asset value was 38 and our net debt to ebitda was 5 times each of these leverage metrics are calculated according to the terms of our loan agreements we have no debt maturities until june of 2023 other than our revolving credit facility which matures in march of 2022 but has a one year extension option at our election we were selective with equity issuance under our atm program during the quarter raising 9 5 million at an average price of 32 94 per share year to date we ve raised a total of 30 3 million through the atm program in general as we think about our future capital needs we re committed to maintaining a strong credit profile including meaningful liquidity and access to capital low to moderate leverage and a well laddered and flexible capital structure with respect to our environmental liability we ended the quarter at 47 9 million which was a decrease of 150 000 from the end of 2020 for the quarter net environmental remediation spending was approximately 1 4 million finally as a result of our investment and capital markets activities in the first half of the year we re raising our 2021 affo guidance to a range of 1 89 to 1 91 a 0 03 per share increase from our prior guidance this guidance includes transaction activity completed year to date it does not otherwise assume potential acquisitions or capital markets activities for the remainder of 2024 specific factors which may impact our guidance include variability with respect to certain operating costs including environmental expenses variability with respect to the recapturing of properties for redevelopment which results in foregoing rent and our expectation that we will remain active in pursuing acquisitions and redevelopments which could result in additional expenses including certain property demolition costs and transaction costs for deals that are not ultimately completed and with that i ll turn the call back to chris christopher j constant president and chief executive officer thanks brian operator we will take questions at this time questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from todd thomas with keybanc please proceed with your question todd thomas keybanc capital markets analyst hi thanks good morning first question i have is just on investment activity which increased in the quarter compared to the first quarter but looks like closings have slowed up a little bit in the last one to two months since the last update i realized there is no incremental investment activity in the guidance but just curious if you can comment generally on the pipeline and the pace of investments going forward as we move further into the second half of the year mark j olear executive vice president and chief operating officer so this is mark our as we broadened our investment strategy that we announced recently to include all other automotive asset classes we re pretty comfortable in addition to cng opportunities we re pretty comfortable with the current state of our pipeline the pace of opportunities both inbound and opportunities that we ve been generating through our business development and so i think that some of the closings are just merely a factor of timing in the pace of the deal in each individual deal but i think we re pretty comfortable where the pipeline is right now todd thomas keybanc capital markets analyst okay and you i think you indicated that initial yields or cap rates are in line with the market what does that look like today what were the cap rates for the acquisitions completed in the quarter and can you talk about cap rate trends in terms of the future here mark j olear executive vice president and chief operating officer sure so our acquisitions to date have been in the mid to high 6 range some of that compression is due to kind of the overall market tightening and kind of as well as i just referenced our broadening of our investment targets through different automotive verticals and some of those being more mature and more competitive but we continue to feel comfortable that we ll be able to deliver accretive acquisitions as we ve done over the last few years todd thomas keybanc capital markets analyst okay and then just on the construction loans can you just talk about that opportunity that you have there your desire to originate more construction loans and also can you just remind us what kind of premium spread on pricing through the sale leasebacks you re achieving relative to market pricing mark j olear executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah i think on the loan program broadly speaking the industries that we target have been consolidating obviously multiples are high as you d expect and certain of our operators have chosen to really focus on their organic growth pipelines and as we partner with existing relationships or new relationships it s really a way to continue for our operators to grow their business and for getty to find a path to the ownership at the end of the construction period so i think the opportunity will continue to grow for us and we re quite comfortable we have the redevelopment capabilities in house and this is a natural extension from that team so we re pretty comfortable operating there in terms of premium yield there s certainly a premium over the acquisition market i wouldn t call it significant and it does vary a little bit by sector but again we like the opportunity we think it s going to continue to grow and it s certainly applicable to all the target asset classes that we re focused on todd thomas keybanc capital markets analyst and is that an opportunity though that you do you have an opportunity you feel to ramp that program up or more meaningfully mark j olear executive vice president and chief operating officer i think it s going to continue to grow over time i don t want to put a number on it or a target range behind it todd but i certainly feel like it s an avenue for getty to continue to deploy capital accretively brian r dickman executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer it s brian the one thing i would add i think we spoke about it the objective and somewhat reiterated what chris said it s not to build a large loan portfolio per se that s not the business that we re looking to get into it s ways that we can add value to our partners to our tenant partners and continue to work with them to help grow their platforms which obviously helps us grow as well and as chris said explicitly it gives us another path to feed simple ownership of the type of assets we want to own and that s probably the key those last two pieces are really key component to it todd thomas keybanc capital markets analyst okay all right thank you operator thank you our next question comes from john massocca with ladenburg thalmann please proceed with your question john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst good morning christopher j constant president and chief executive officer good morning mark j olear executive vice president and chief operating officer good morning john john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst so maybe just a little more on the kind of construction loan opportunity you said and ultimately trying to pull those assets on to your balance sheet i mean are those type of transactions you re looking at primarily kind of greenfield de novo construction or is that like redevelopment where you re kind of coming in and kind of funding a developers redevelopment of an existing maybe out of date kind of c store concept and they re revamping that mark j olear executive vice president and chief operating officer it s mark we ve done a little bit of both both with our existing in place tenants where they want to put material capital improvements into our lease properties we ll partner with them to bring them up to industry standards i would say it s more heavily tilted toward the greenfield as you said the de novo buildings where it s a net new operation for our tenant partners where it is truly state of the art so in addition to all the financial metrics that were just discussed it s kind of a reinforcement of our partnership with operators that they want to be on the leading edge and new to industry delivering all the latest and greatest in meeting the consumer demands so these are not only state of the art facilities but obviously have a tremendously long useful life present well look great and it s the program is repeatable with these key partners where it s ease relationship to rinse and repeat on their new program and we ve become kind of a dependable partner for them in that process john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst and i guess maybe big picture i mean how big is the opportunity set in terms of essentially how much kind of de novo construction is there out there in the c store space right now is it just give any it does seem like some of the m a activities going to be a little bit more muted i guess maybe in the near term christopher j constant president and chief executive officer todd had sort of a similar question so i don t want to put a box around it john but what i would tell you is if you look across the c store sector the car wash sector in particular right there is a significant amount of growth what we call a chain store operators right so as the traditional mom and pop c store operator or car wash may be going away there is an opportunity for tenants in the space to grow their brand right with their prototype store that mark was talking about the state of the art facility whether that s a express car wash tunnel or whether that s a 5 000 6 000 square foot c store with a qsr inside of it the opportunity is certainly there for c stores car washes to create the brand recognition which also has the royalty program and the absence side of it where it becomes sort of that go to destination that the consumer is looking for right across either a specific region or a chunk of the country so again i think it s certainly repeatable but i m not going to put up timeframe or a dollar amount behind but i think the opportunity is john massocca ladenburg thalmann analyst okay and then on the balance sheet side of things i mean how should we think about atm issuance going forward i think if i heard correctly you issued 9 million during the quarter in terms of dollar amount which would seem on a gross invested basis maybe a little bit kind of light versus kind of in place portfolio today but i know that can kind of be variable quarter to quarter but should we kind of still expect maybe on a net debt to ebitda this 5 range can be a good target i m sorry 5x range to be a good target going forward brian r dickman executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yes john i think the atm issuance itself is obviously a function of a number of different factors leverage metrics as you alluded to liquidity at the time in terms of on balance sheet stock price and investment pipeline and all the rest what we re really focused on as i said in my prepared remarks is ensuring that we maintain strong liquidity access to capital that we keep low to moderate leverage and if you just go back to the end of 2020 right we ended the year at i think it was just under 5 times on leverage the revolver was undrawn completely or it was early january when we paid off the year end balance and as a result of some asset sales and legal settlements there s a lot of cash on the balance sheet so if you go back to again the end of the year you ll see that back pattern and i think that back pattern lends itself to us being a little bit less active on the atm kind of this first half of the year and so i think as you go forward we ll continue as we have and we stated in a number of our peers do to utilize the atm it s a great tool for our business leverage is right down the middle i think we typically said 4 5 times to 5 5 times maybe at different points in time 5 times to 6 times but we re low to middle end of that range and that s really what we re looking at as we execute on the atm operator thank you our next question comes from joshua dennerlein with bank of america please proceed with your question joshua dennerlein bank of america analyst hey good morning everyone i guess i was just curious on maybe a impact on inflation on your portfolio could you remind us maybe what percent of your portfolios has escalators linked to like the cpi or for spis just trying to get a sense of what we can see an acceleration in the earnings growth as a result of more inflation brian r dickman executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer sure it s brian josh one fact i ll start with is upwards of 97 98 of our leases do have some escalator in them so the bulk of the portfolio does have annual escalators of that roughly two thirds is annual escalators and then the balance is your typical your 10 every five years or something thereabouts on a cpi basis it s de minimis there might be one or two leases that s not a typical structure in our leases at least to date so the blend of all that is about 1 6 annual and i think it s a nice way to start off each year obviously growth in our earnings in our value creation will be acquisition and redevelopment based as it is for most in our space but i think that going into year with that level of escalator is helpful and then the other thing i ll add given that the majority of our activity is sales leaseback activity as mark and chris said we had and we ll continue to buy existing leases but at least when you re originating your own leases in my humble opinion it gives us at least some opportunity if the environment and the markets really changing from where it is and where it s been to at least have that conversation with tenants and prospective tenants about getting either different levels or different types or frequency of escalators in the leases so a little bit more control over our destiny so to speak than if we were only acquiring existing leases joshua dennerlein bank of america analyst yeah interesting have those conversations changed a lot maybe in the last like year or two or is it like what you would want in a lease mark j olear executive vice president and chief operating officer i would think that if you re talking specifically about escalators it s more the as brian just mentioned we strive for annuals do our best to get an annual increase if not something certainly near term but not a material change in the dynamic of those conversations joshua dennerlein bank of america analyst okay awesome thanks guys i ll leave it there operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the question and answer session i will now turn the call over to mr christopher constant for closing remarks christopher j

fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and antero midstream partners wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of june 7 2021 brendan krueger vice president finance thank you operator thank you for joining us for antero midstream s second quarter 2021 investor conference call we ll spend a few minutes going through the financial and operating highlights and then we ll open it up for q a i would also like to direct you to the homepage of our website at www anteromidstream com where we have provided a separate earnings call presentation that will be reviewed during today s call before we start our comments i would first like to remind you that during this call antero management will make forward looking statements such statements are based on our current judgments regarding factors that will impact the future performance of antero resources and antero midstream and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond antero s control actual outcomes and results could materially differ from what is expressed implied or forecast in such statements today s call may also contain certain non gaap financial measures please refer to our earnings press release for important disclosures regarding such measures including reconciliations to the most comparable gaap financial measures joining me on the call today are paul rady chairman and ceo of antero resources and antero midstream and michael kennedy cfo of antero resources and director at antero midstream with that i ll turn the call over to paul paul rady chairman chief executive officer and president thanks brendan i ll start on slide number 3 highlighting the continued improvement in the financial strength of antero midstream s primary customer antero resources antero resources or ar has paid down almost 600 million of debt year to date and has reduced its leverage by almost 1 5 to 1 7x achieving its leverage target of 2 0x well ahead of schedule this resulted in an undrawn revolving credit facility and 1 9 billion of liquidity as detailed on the right hand side of the page as we mentioned this morning on the antero resources call ar is targeting over 750 million of free cash flow in each of 2021 and 2022 assuming current strip prices this level of free cash flow strong balance sheet and flexible liquidity position collectively provide protection against a downside price scenario and further derisks the long term growth outlook for antero midstream now let s turn to slide number four which illustrates the benefits of ar s firm transportation portfolio on throughput certainty for am the green line on the chart illustrates ar s historical gas price differential to nymex and the red line illustrates the appalachian differentials as you can see ar s ft portfolio has generated a premium to nymex and significantly reduced realized pricing volatility over the last several years this provides am with consistent volume and cash flow assurance as ar does not need to shut in volumes when appalachia basis blows out like many of its peers have to this gives antero midstream an additional level of protection as we begin construction on additional infrastructure supporting ar and the drilling partnership in addition this competitive advantage resulted in ar generating price realizations that were 0 90 an mcf better than in basin appalachian pricing which was 0 72 an mcf behind nymex these attractive price realizations further support drilling economics that underpin the volume growth and returns at am i ll finish my comments by looking at slide number five to highlight am s asset utilization rates and discuss future growth projects as you can see on the left hand side of the page despite ar s transition to a maintenance capital program in 2019 and 2020 am was able to maintain asset utilization rates greater than 90 across its assets am s joint venture processing capacity over the last year has been 100 utilized and we recently commissioned the new smithburg one processing plant which added an additional 200 million cubic feet a day of processing capacity in the third quarter this brings am s total joint venture processing capacity to 1 6 bcf a day smithburg one will support processing volume growth from the drilling partnership targeting marcellus liquids rich development over the next several years similarly on the compression side we are currently constructing two stations in the marcellus liquids rich regimes that will add 480 million cubic feet a day of additional compression capacity these two stations along with the associated high pressure gathering projects are expected to be placed online in 2022 to facilitate the development in tyler and wetzel counties in west virginia importantly am has the visibility into ar and the drilling partnerships development plan that allows am to maintain these high asset utilization rates as we transition back to a growth outlook as depicted on the right hand side of the page we expect volume growth combined with high asset utilization rates to generate ebitda growth and more importantly mid to high teens returns on invested capital on average through 2025 with that i will turn it over to brendan brendan krueger vice president finance thanks paul i ll begin my comments with second quarter operational results at am beginning on slide six titled year over year midstream throughput growth starting in the top left portion of the page low pressure gathering volumes were just under 2 9 bcf a day in the second quarter which represents a 1 increase from the prior year quarter as we look ahead to the third quarter we expect ar to be slightly above the lp earn out threshold of 2 9 bcf a day driven by the continued outperformance of ar s wells compression volumes during the quarter averaged 2 7 bcf a day a 1 increase compared to the prior year quarter our 50 50 joint venture gross processing volumes averaged just over 1 4 bcf a day a 3 increase compared to the prior year quarter and our gross fractionation volumes averaged 38 000 barrels a day a 165 increase year over year as you may have seen we did experience a few days of downtime at sherwood at the end of the second quarter and into the third quarter due to a shutdown downstream of the facility we do not expect this to have a material impact on our volumetric or guidance outlook as we incorporate sufficient risking in our forecast freshwater delivery volumes averaged 104 000 barrels a day a 2 increase from the prior year quarter adjusted ebitda for the quarter was 225 million a 12 increase year over year capital expenditures during the quarter were 71 million consistent with our comments on the first quarter call we expect to invest roughly 2 3 of our 2021 capital budget of 240 million to 260 million in the second quarter and third quarter combined as we build out the infrastructure supporting the drilling partnership this results in expected third quarter capital of approximately 90 million to 100 million and from there we expect a decline in the fourth quarter to remain on budget for the full year during the second quarter of 2021 we generated 111 million of free cash flow before dividends a 3 million increase compared to last year importantly for the third time in the last four quarters we generated free cash flow after dividends which totaled 3 million during the quarter year to date free cash flow after dividends has totaled 42 million which has allowed us to reduce our leverage to 3 6x as we look to the back half of the year we expect a modest outspend driven by increased capital expenditures as just discussed which will result in a full year 2021 profile that is approximately free cash flow neutral after dividends moving on to the balance sheet i wanted to highlight the debt maturity profiles at both ar and am given the drastic improvements over the last 12 months which we have outlined on slide number seven at this time last year ar had over 2 billion of senior note maturities within the next three years fast forward to today as depicted on the top half of the page ar does not have any senior note maturities until 2025 ar s successful refinancings and debt reduction efforts through asset sales and sustainable free cash flow generation have transformed it into one of the strongest producers in appalachia the bottom half of the page illustrates am s senior note maturity schedule which tells a similar story during the second quarter we refinanced the 2024 senior notes extending the maturity to 2029 at the same coupon of 5 5 this resulted in our next senior note maturity not occurring until 2026 in addition we had 514 million drawn on our 2 13 billion revolving credit facility resulting in 1 6 billion of liquidity as of quarter end as a reminder we previously announced that we are targeting approximately 500 million of free cash flow after dividends from 2021 through 2025 and low to mid single digit annual ebitda growth as a result of the drilling partnership between ar and ql partners this financial strength and free cash flow outlook at both entities positions us well as we expect to extend the credit facilities over the next year in summary we are incredibly proud of the improvements of the balance sheet at both ar and am over the last year both of which have never been stronger before i close i ll finish my comments with slide number eight titled uniquely positioned with midstream entity the last two years have been transformational for antero midstream and we believe we are well positioned for the unique business model not only in appalachia but in the overall u s in 2019 we converted to a c corp significantly enhancing our corporate governance and shareholder rights which facilitated am s inclusion into equity indices like the s p 400 as we look at the universe of investable securities in the u s am checks all the boxes as a c corp of scale earnings growth driven by the drilling partnership and an inflation protected fee structure of the approximately 6 000 publicly traded securities in the u s about 900 companies are investable c corps with scale and enterprise value greater than 6 billion narrowing down those companies to those with earnings growth which we measured as a 3 year ebitda cagr greater than 3 narrows it down to just over 650 companies additional filters for companies with derisked business models that are self financing with strong balance sheets which we measured as leverage under 4x and the population continues to shrink to just 421 companies of those companies only one offers an attractive dividend over 7 which is antero midstream today at a 9 yield am presents a unique opportunity with an attractive return of capital profile earnings growth and declining total debt and leverage which will further derisk am s business model going forward with that operator we are ready to take questions questions and answers operator our first questions come from the line of brian reynolds with ubs please proceed with your questions brian reynolds ubs analyst hi good afternoon everyone starting off with guidance just wondering if you can provide some color around the drivers toward the upper and lower end of the ebitda guidance range it seems just annualized in the first half of 21 it seems we re at the high end of the range i m curious if you could share some thoughts around second half expectations thanks paul rady chairman chief executive officer and president yes brian i ll take that one overall as we put the guidance range together it was a function of looking at the full year and potential fee rebates was one of the items that could go either way as you saw in the second quarter so the range provides a nice range in terms of where you could end up on that fee rebate perspective the other components are of course we risk for production i think as i mentioned in my remarks ar s wells continue to outperform so from a throughput perspective we continue to see strong results at the am side of things as we look into the second half i think we feel good about the range still with water in particular we put on about 41 wells in the first half of the year our guidance of 70 to be serviced throughout the year so you have service more than half of that which leads to lower water volumes in the second half of the year as we look forward so that s the big driver in terms of where why we feel good about where we re at even though we were ahead to start the year we do expect some pullback from the water volumes just due to the cadence of the year brian reynolds ubs analyst great thanks for the quarter lastly are there any updates on the lawsuit against veolia water technologies i know there s a pending court case in january but i was wondering if there s any signpost that we can be tracking or if this could ultimately be resolved outside of the court thanks paul rady chairman chief executive officer and president yes there s no material update at this time i think as you saw disclosed in our 10 q the trial is set to begin in early 2022 which is a slight pushback from the original scheduled date just due to some covid delays in the courts but otherwise no update there brian reynolds ubs analyst turn up thanks for taking my questions and have a great day operator thank you our next questions come from the line of jeremy tonet with jpmorgan please proceed with your question james kirby jpmorgan analyst hi good afternoon guys this is james on for jeremy just going back to the rebate you guys mentioned i think you guys mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expect to hit the threshold in 3q just going forward looking at 2022 especially with strong ngl prices if antero resources returns to growth how have you guys budgeted that into your longer term forecast that you guys laid out during fourth quarter of last year with your guidance through 2025 paul rady chairman chief executive officer and president yes so as we look ahead i think we did provide some color there with the drilling partnership ar is still on the maintenance capital plan that s ar the drilling partnership does add growth from a gross volume perspective so as we look out to 2022 we d expect to hit three or four of those fee rebates as currently planned and then 2023 just given the growth we d expect to hit all 4 and it will depend on where that growth is in terms of whether you hit different thresholds of the rebates but would expect to hit all four of those fee rebates in 2023 james kirby jpmorgan analyst got it that s very helpful i appreciate the color there and then last question for me you mentioned the additional build out i think of stations next year just wondering on the capex front if you guys can ballpark kind of a range for next year especially again as it kind of pertains to kind of longer term free cash flow guidance and how much those stations might cost paul rady chairman chief executive officer and president yes i think mike mentioned i think on the first quarter call i think we re still in that 275 million to 300 million for next year and then you d see i think as we talked about we expect to be free cash flow neutral for the most part in 21 and 22 and that 500 million of free cash flow after dividends is really 23 24 25 and that s where you see capital come down from that 275 million to 300 million more to the 200 million in lower levels after that james kirby jpmorgan analyst got it thanks i ll stop there operator thank you our next questions come from the line of kyle may with capital one securities please proceed with your question kyle may capital one securities analyst hi everyone a couple of questions on the water side in the release you mentioned opex was lower due to water blending operations just curious if you can talk more about what antero is doing if you ve made any changes there and if there s any further cost savings that you can realize paul rady chairman chief executive officer and president yes i think overall just on the ar side it s driven by just continued efficiencies on the water side piping to our blending facilities and overall timing and cadence of the development plan the ar level so continue to see lower cost on loe at ar which is driving down the opex on the am side related to that water blending operations kyle may capital one securities analyst okay got it that makes sense and then also have you made any changes to the amount of fresh water that s used in the wells or do you anticipate any changes there paul rady chairman chief executive officer and president no so we re still at 36 barrels a foot i think we were flat on volumes quarter over quarter and we had less wells serviced i think some of the disconnect was just we had wells that were being serviced at the end of the first quarter that were counted in those wells serviced in the first quarter but most of that water showed up in the second quarter so it was about 20 wells serviced in each quarter if you think about the amount of water being used per well but there s a little bit of disconnect in terms of timing there kyle may capital one securities analyst got it that s helpful that s all for me thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of john mackay with goldman sachs please proceed with your question john mackay goldman sachs analyst hi thanks all for the time just wanted to ask one quickly on the sherwood outage i know you said there was enough kind of flexibility in the guidance which is why you didn t change numbers but since ar called it out specifically can we think about a similar volume impact for you guys in the third quarter as ar called out paul rady chairman chief executive officer and president yes i think that s fair so if you run the math on that volume impact it d be about 6 million to 7 million on an isolated basis again i think with the risking that we provide and the outperformance we ve seen we still feel very good about the range we have of 840 million to 880 million for the ebitda range john mackay goldman sachs analyst okay great and then i guess we talked you guys talked about it a little bit already but just on the drilling partnership i think we saw ar at a rig back into the utica just curious if everything in terms of timing is in line there with as you guys talked about beginning of the year and then just wanted to clarify too and i think you said it before but on the two new compressor stations you talked about adding next year that those were included in the kind of long term drilling program affiliated capex through 25 right paul rady chairman chief executive officer and president yes that s correct so to your first question overall drilling partnership is going well as planned nothing to note on that front in line with what we ve provided publicly and then those compressor stations we were just calling out more details around those but those are in line with the long term guidance that we called out earlier this year in our guidance and long term targets john mackay goldman sachs analyst that s all for me thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of sunil sibal with seaport global securities please proceed with your questions sunil sibal seaport global securities analyst hi good morning guys thanks for all the clarity on the call so just starting off on the smithburg start up could you remind us if that plant is fully dedicated to antero or are there any third party volumes in that plant paul rady chairman chief executive officer and president no that s fully dedicated to antero sunil sibal seaport global securities analyst okay then a little bit of a broader question on capital allocation or capital strategy when you laid out the strategy at the end of last year since then it seems like the high yield markets have improved quite a bit obviously you ve kind of refinanced some debt was kind of curious considering that the credit spreads are so much tighter now is there any rethink on your part in terms of the capital allocation strategy whether is it just paying down debt versus any incremental cash being used toward other users obviously you have the share buyback program open too paul rady chairman chief executive officer and president no i think overall certainly nice to see the improvement in capital markets from the am perspective we had just over 500 million drawn on the credit facility at the end of the quarter we expect to generate as mentioned 500 million in free cash flow so it s nice to have some borrowings on the facility to be able to pay down over time and as we get to that 3x leverage target we ll look at other potential return of capital but still focused on continuing to get down to lower leverage levels on the am side of things operator thank you our next questions come from the line of gregg brody with bank of america please proceed with your question gregg brody bank of america analyst good morning hi guys i know this is the am call but this is slightly related to ar just the in the past you ve said ar am makes sense separate and i think that s still the case i m curious what you ve what you think about on the ar call you were asked about what you would do with all the free cash flow once you get to your leverage target is it possible that ar would buy more of am is the amount that am that ar is with am in the right amount today and could you also sort of lead that conversation into how you re thinking about m a right now paul rady chairman chief executive officer and president yes no there s no thoughts around increasing or decreasing our ar position in am we own ar owns 30 of am and sees that as an appropriate level as you heard on the ar call really we re just trying to delever ar with the free cash flow and then evaluate return of capital there am with its free cash flow will be delevered down to 3x and then evaluate its return of capital there from an m a standpoint really it s hard for m a to compete like we mentioned we have growth at am 3 to 4 the return on invested capital is in the mid teens that s a risk adjusted return on invested capital we know exactly when the projects are coming on just in time there s no speculative capital so very hard for m a to compete and with ar s drilling partnership we kind of view that as the m a we are getting third party volumes there and have that growth and i think we only want a handful of midstream companies with growth and highly visible growth at that so no real need for m a gregg brody bank of america analyst i appreciate the operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i d like to hand the call back over to brendan krueger for any closing comments brendan krueger vice president finance yes thank you for everybody for joining today s call and please reach out with any further questions thanks operator

joining us i will begin with a review of baxter s second quarter results and also share a few words about our upcoming investor conference jay will then provide a deeper dive on our financial performance and outlook and we will wrap up with q and a baxter delivered second quarter sales growth of 14 as reported 9 on a constant currency basis and 8 operationally growth was driven primarily by the ongoing global recovery from the covid 19 pandemic resulting in favorable performance comparisons for a number of our businesses versus the prior year as the pandemic affect the patient treatment dynamics and demand mix in the prior year on the bottom line second quarter adjusted earnings per share were 0 80 up 25 year over year and exceeding our original guidance all three of our geographic segments contributed to the positive quarterly performance the americas and emea achieved high single digit growth and apac achieved a low double digit growth all at constant currency rates while we are clearly experiencing recovery from the pandemic across all three of our geographies the situation on the ground varies considerably by market as always we salute the healthcare workers who continue to face enormous challenges every day on the front lines of care i also want to express my personal gratitude to all the baxter employees who tirelessly support these clinicians and caregivers while helping to ensure we address the needs of patients across our vast life sustaining portfolio turning to our performance by business five of our seven product categories achieved growth on a constant currency basis performance was led by biopharma solutions and advanced surgery which delivered 49 and 48 constant currency growth respectively growth in bps was filled by contracts to assist in the manufacture of covid 19 vaccines advanced surgery growth reflects a favorable comparison to the prior year spurred by improving surgical volumes as pandemic recovery advances globally as you saw in this morning s press release we are building on our momentum in advanced surgery with the acquisition of perclot polysaccharide hemostatic system perclot marks our entry into the global hemostatic powder segment which will allow us to serve surgeons and their patients with an even broader range of options to control into operative bleeding across active and passive solutions our medication delivery business grew 12 at constant currency rates also benefiting from a favorable comparison driven by improving rates of admissions at hospitals as compared to the prior year looking ahead medication delivery is continuing to position for the u s launch of our novum iq infusion platform including those iq safety software in our iq enterprise digital connectivity suite following up on our recent fda resubmission we are now in the process of responding to an additional information request from the agency we continue to expect to launch novum iq in the u s before the end of the year our clinical nutrition category advanced single digits at constant currency rates reflecting ongoing strength in the u s pharmaceuticals also grew at single digits constant currency adjusting for the recent caelyx and doxil acquisition pharmaceuticals was flat year over year although we expect competitive pressures to continue in this marketplace we remain focused on launching molecules with differentiated presentations and or complex formulations we have several projected launches of new generic injectables in the coming years that will help to fuel growth in this business and mitigate some of the competitive pressures we are experiencing performance in renal care was comparable to the prior year at constant rates with growth in the u s offset by a decline across international markets on a global basis the market continues to be dampened by the impact of the pandemic which has contributed to a higher mortality rate for patients with kidney disease combined with a slowing of new patient diagnosis as we said last quarter we expect the recovery of this market to continue returning to its pre covid dynamics over the next one to two years in this quarter we saw returned positive year over year pd patient growth globally including mid single digit pd patient growth in the u s the pandemic has highlighted the vital importance of the home dialysis therapy option and as a leader in recognized innovator in this space it has never been more urgent to support education awareness and access our global safer at home campaign which has been underway for more than a year is dedicated to helping clinicians patients and other stakeholders learn more about the benefits of home care particularly amid pandemic conditions lastly performance in acute therapies declined mid single digits at constant currency rates year over year this decline was expected given the extremely challenging comparison following last year s historic surge in demand for continuous renal replacement therapy in light of the pandemic we remain excited by the prospects for the advanced treatment options in the crrt market in fact q2 marked the launch of prismax to the latest version of our nex gen platform for crrt and organ support with embedded trueview digital health technology from an esg perspective earlier this month we announced our 2030 corporate responsibility commitment which will help to drive baxter s environmental social governance efforts over the next decade and beyond this work is integral to how we advance our mission to save and sustain lives and serve all of our stakeholders from patients and clinicians to our communities and investors our 2030 commitment is built around the three overarching objectives empower our patients protect our planet and champion our people and communities full details can be found in our 2020 corporate responsibility report now posted on baxter com briefly looking ahead we continue operating in an environment of some uncertainty we fully anticipate broader trend of pandemic recovery to sustain but geographic disparities and emerging variants could slow and undermine the pace all storages like our healthcare peers and countless other companies baxter is subject to the impact of inflation in the rising cost of freight fuel and other raw materials and commodities we will continue to look for opportunities to offset the impact from these incremental expenses as i wrap up i want to highlight that our 2021 investor conference will be held on monday september 20 in deerfield illinois at the conference we plan to focus on our key strategic objectives to enhance growth and drive innovation in addition as a critical part of our ongoing business transformation jim borzi senior vice president and chief supply chain officer will outline the next phase of our manufacturing supply chain journey which is expected to enhance our operational effectiveness and drive margin improvement now i ll pass it to jay who will share a closer look at our results and our outlook for the balance of the year james saccaro executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks joe and good morning everyone as joe mentioned we re pleased with our strong second quarter performance second quarter 2021 global sales of 3 1 billion advanced 14 on a reported basis 9 on a constant currency basis and 8 on an operational basis sales growth this quarter reflects the ongoing recovery in hospital and surgical volumes along with the benefit from covid vaccines we estimate these factors contributed just over 450 basis points of sales growth in the quarter ous sales of caelyx doxil totaled approximately 30 million in the quarter on the bottom line adjusted earnings increased 25 to 0 80 per share exceeding our guidance range driven by disciplined operational execution and a lower than expected tax rate now i ll walk through performance by our regional segments and key product categories starting with our three regional segments sales in the americas increased 8 on both a constant currency and operational basis sales in europe middle east and africa grew 8 on a constant currency basis and 5 on an operational basis and sales in our asia pac region advanced 10 on a constant currency basis and 9 operationally moving on to performance by key product category note that for this quarter constant currency growth is equal to operational sales growth for all global businesses except for our pharmaceuticals business for which we will provide both constant currency and operational growth adjusted for the acquisition of rights in select territories outside the u s of the caelyx and doxil global sales for renal care were 964 million were flat on a constant currency basis performance in the quarter was driven by our pd business where we observed both the sequential and year over year improvement in global patient volumes this was partially offset by declining international sales of in center hd dialyzers reflecting the impact from the pandemic as well as competitive dynamics we continue to monitor the impact of excess mortality among esrd patients and delays in new patient diagnoses resulting from the pandemic our expectation remains that pd patient volumes will continue to ramp over the course of the year although the pace may vary by market in particular we are monitoring covid resurgences in asia pac and parts of the europe sales in medication delivery of 697 million increased 12 on a constant currency basis strong global growth in this business reflects the recovery in the pace of hospital admissions in many markets following the height of the pandemic last year we estimate that in the second quarter the rate of u s hospital admissions was down approximately 7 as compared to pre covid levels a market improvement from the second quarter of 2020 which saw u s admissions down approximately 20 pharmaceutical sales of 546 million advanced 5 on a constant currency basis and were flat to prior year on an operational basis performance in the quarter benefited from the recovery in surgical procedures and hospital admissions demand for our international pharmacy compounding business and the contribution from ous sales of caelyx doxil this growth was partially offset by declines in our u s generic injectables portfolio which faced a headwind from prior year sales of select injectable drugs used to treat critical covid 19 patients as well as increased competitive activity for certain molecules moving to clinical nutrition total sales were 237 million increasing 3 on a constant currency basis performance in the quarter was driven primarily by growth in the u s partially offset by lower international sales of vitamins resulting from supply constraints sales in advanced surgery were 256 million increasing 48 on a constant currency basis within the quarter we estimate surgical procedures were at or slightly above pre covid levels contributing to strength in the quarter sales in our acute therapies business were 188 million declining 4 on a constant currency basis reflecting the challenging year over year comparison due to surge in product demand this time last year related to the covid pandemic as joe mentioned we anticipate that covid related demand for crrt will moderate this year but will improve over time through the launch of new products and increased awareness of this therapy biopharma solutions sales in the quarter were 183 million representing growth of 49 on a constant currency basis reflecting incremental sales related to the manufacturing of covid 19 vaccines moving through the rest of the p and l our adjusted gross margin of 42 6 increased by 100 basis points over the prior year reflecting operational improvements in manufacturing and a favorable product mix as the impact from covid receives adjusted sg and a of 649 million increased 12 on a reported basis reflecting the impact from foreign exchange the improvement in sales and resulting increase in commissions and increased promotional spend in support of new product launches adjusted r and d spending in the quarter of 139 million increased 18 on a reported basis driven by the impact of foreign exchange and investments in our new product pipeline both adjusted sg and a and r and d spending reflect a somewhat more normalized level of spend as certain expense categories were depressed last year as a result of the pandemic particularly those related to employee bonus accruals adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 17 2 an increase of 120 basis points versus the prior year net interest expense totaled 34 million in the quarter and other nonoperating income contributed 2 million in the quarter the adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 17 8 an increase over the prior year driven by lower stock based compensation award deductions as compared to the prior year period the tax rate was favorable to our expectations driven by a favorable change in earnings mix and as previously mentioned adjusted earnings of 0 80 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of 0 72 to 0 75 per share within the second quarter we repurchased approximately 300 million or 3 7 million shares of common stock year to date we have repurchased 600 million or 7 3 million shares of common stock which has been partially offset by option related dilution on a net basis our outstanding share count has declined by approximately five million shares through the second quarter in addition during the second quarter we announced a 14 increase in the company s quarterly cash dividend rate the strength of our financial position has fueled our ability to increase our quarterly dividend rate on an annual basis for the sixth consecutive year we continue to follow a strategic approach to capital allocation that is balance between inorganic and organic initiatives with the objective of accelerating growth and expanding margins driving innovation and returning value to our shareholders with respect to cash flow in the first half of 2021 we ve generated 854 million of operating cash flow and 525 million in free cash flow let me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2021 for full year 2021 we expect global sales growth of approximately 8 on a reported basis 5 to 6 on a constant currency basis and 4 to 5 on an operational basis this assumes a benefit of approximately 100 basis points to both reported and constant currency revenue growth for the acquisition of caelyx doxil as well as approximately 250 basis points of positive top line impact from foreign exchange on reported growth our expectation remains that on a full year basis hospital admission rates will stay below pre covid levels with rates improving throughout the year and exiting down low single digits based on surgical procedure data in the u s to date we now expect surgical procedures will continue to be a 100 of pre covid levels for the remainder of the year moving down the p and l we continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand between 40 to 60 basis points for the year we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 17 5 and a full year diluted average share count of approximately 510 million shares based on these factors we now expect 2021 adjusted earnings excluding special items of 3 49 to 3 55 per diluted share specific to the third quarter of 2021 we expect global sales growth of approximately 9 on a reported basis approximately 7 on a constant currency basis and approximately 6 on an operational basis and we expect adjusted earnings excluding special items of 0 93 to 0 95 per diluted share with that we can now open the call up for q and a questions and answers operator thank you and our first question comes from the line of bob hopkins with bank of america securities bob hopkins bank of america securities analyst thank you and good morning can you hear me ok jose e almeida chairman president and chief executive officer yes we can bob good morning bob hopkins bank of america securities analyst great good morning so i just have two questions and i ll just state them upfront in the interest of time so i guess first for maybe for jay just wondering if you could flesh out the renal performance in the quarter a little bit more what happened internationally and how quickly you think renal could get back to better growth rates so that s question number one and then a follow up on question number two is more strategic for joe and joe i realize you won t talk about market speculation but i do think it would be helpful for investors to hear maybe a little bit of an update on your thoughts on m and a generally and maybe talk about what the circumstances would have to be for you to pursue a larger deal how important it is that m and a improves the company s growth rate things of that nature i just think an update there would be much appreciated so those are my two questions thank you very much james saccaro executive vice president and chief financial officer great i ll address the renal question first from a q2 performance standpoint and then turn it over to joe for the second question overall as you mentioned the u s had a solid performance in renal growing 4 we ended up td was a little bit in excess of that 5 with the hd business slightly below that and then internationally you re right we had a decline in the quarter which we do not expect to continue there were a couple of drivers of that one is we ve talked historically about patient census challenges and that being a headwind that we re facing and contending with this year which is kind of disrupted the normal orderly cadence of patient growth that we see internationally and that was pronounced in the second quarter our pd business actually slightly declined so 1 decline in the quarter we do expect that to return starting in the third quarter and the fourth quarter and frankly we ve seen in certain markets delays in procedures of establishing new pd patients like for example in japan along with this patient census issue all of these things came together to impact the growth rate in the quarter like i say in the second half of the year we do expect to see an acceleration and feel solid about that and then in the hd business we did have some pricing competition on dialyzers we see that from time to time so the hd business declined in mid single digits and we will expect that to normalize in the second half of the year so while the renal business has been a fairly consistent performer for us internationally and if you look at that over a series of multiple quarters i think you can expect or you can gain some confidence in the second half of the year we ll grow that business internationally roughly 3 and i ll turn it over to joe to address the other question jose e almeida chairman president and chief executive officer thank you jay let me give you how i think about m and a to answer your question bob first is size being a secondary conversation first is you strategically fit for the company we look at the areas of growth for the future you look what is going to make a difference in the healthcare in five to 10 years where this baxter is going it s now where the puck is where the puck is going sometimes we get it attached to growth rates and things of where things are we ve got to look where things are going and baxter is doing a lot in connected health and we need to make sure that we have the ability to deploy capital in that area as well as adjacencies going into areas of no correlation to baxter to create presenting much more challenging environment for the company in terms of m and a not impossible to do it but it s something that is more difficult second is how do we see returns the returns are always the same we look at internal rate of returns to be above our cost of capital about a few hundred basis points as well as we look at roic very similarly on a five year base posted deal we look also the ability for the company to generate cash flow and our ability to bring the company integrated into baxter which i feel confident that we through our digital transformation have a much better ability of bringing companies in than a few years ago and the third and last one is that not every deal is created the same and we examine multiple opportunities at all times so the company has a significant amount of cash and it doesn t go against deals it goes back to the shareholders in form of in terms of buybacks as we have done as you saw we just did some buyback this quarter and for the year we are around 600 million so this is how i think about m and a bob hopkins bank of america securities analyst that s great thank you very much james saccaro executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks bob operator robbie marcus of jpmorgan is on the line with a question please state your question robbie marcus jpmorgan analyst great thanks appreciate it jay maybe i could start with you i wanted to touch on guidance you guys had a really nice eps beat in the quarter you have admissions trending toward pre covid levels over the back part of the year maybe you could just walk us through the updated guidance and how you ended up where you did especially on eps james saccaro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure you re right robbie thus far we re seeing a fairly stable admissions environment relative to our expectations underlying our guidance we re expecting roughly 98 of admissions in the united states in the fourth quarter of the year we watch that of course very carefully and i ve talked about the risk and the sensitivity around that in the past and we re particularly watching given the delta variant but feel solid that we ve got our hands around this at this point and so then as we translate that to the rest of the p and l let me talk first about a full year basis and then maybe make some comments on the second half on a full year basis we are seeing some challenges in the pharmaceuticals business related to competition and pricing and so on a full year basis probably 0 06 of a headwind from pharma offset by 0 06 of a benefit from our biopharma solutions business which is performing better than our expectations so those items kind of sort of counteract each other and then we have roughly 0 08 or so on a full year basis of global supply chain costs that we re contending with and so essentially we re seeing things like freight and premium freight cost that s roughly 0 03 we actually have a fairly substantial manufacturing facility in colombia we ve had a couple of cents of impact from colombia unrest and ensuring we re getting product to our patients and product out of the country in an expeditious manner and then of course through some purchase price variations which there is some inflation in that rounding out the 0 08 but offsetting that we have we re committed to really using resources efficiently as a company and so we re able to counteract the vast majority of that so roughly 0 07 of benefit from measures that we have in place that are enhanced versus our expectations really looking at all of the spending categories and challenging ourselves to make sure that we re using resources as efficiently as possible of course when we do those exercises we don t touch things like quality or critical r and d programs but we really do look hard at the cost base to ensure we re being efficient and offsetting where possible so that s really the story on a full year basis but if you think about it and then there s financial assumptions that kind of wash out we had some benefit in the first half from a number of assumptions and then we have some headwinds in the second half but if you look at it exclusively from a second half standpoint i ll say that fx is actually 0 03 of impact so that is really one of the big drivers of the second half performance we ve seen dollar strengthening and so that has an impact on our translation back of our overseas business that s roughly 0 03 bps and pharma again kind of wash out in the second half and then we have a couple of cents of supply chain expenses but i think really the most notable impact to the second half is this foreign exchange impact that we re contending with right now robbie marcus jpmorgan analyst great and jay i don t know if you want to take this or joe i think it is worthwhile spending a little more time on the 0 06 pharma headwind what s driving that what drugs what makes you feel better you could overcome it in the second half and just any detail there would be great thanks jose e almeida chairman president and chief executive officer robbie when we think about pharma what s the value proposition of our pharma business is complex formulations and delivery in novel ways premixes and waste that have not been yet launched or a combination of both so we are in process of delivering our portfolio the conditions of the market have deteriorated in terms of pricing headwinds as well as covid with the patients that have not gone to a hospital and the budget of the pharmacies right so when we look at this whole thing where do we stand today we still see the headwinds that that business has don t confuse the whole category that we have which is has two very separate businesses one is our anesthesia business which are gases instead of gases and that has declined consistently over the last 24 months because the type of delivery systems the anesthesiologists are using across the globe for gas from our pharmaceutical business so i tell you that we just had three products conditionally approved we re going to be launching three in the next six to nine months we are excited about the portfolio and follows the same recipe of difficult to formulate and novel ways of delivering so if you think about that it is still a good business has very very very strong and healthy profitability so what we need to do is to make sure that our innovation will does not stop and we continue to bring products organically and sometimes inorganically to the portfolio to be able to augment the growth of this business and keep ahead of the competition baxter has put together a very good group of r and d scientists in the united states as well as india and together they are working 24 hours a day in tandem to be able to deliver on that i m still fan up that portfolio understanding the headwinds that that portfolio can have every so often as some drugs will go out in contribution based on competition but then we re able to launch new products remember there are 22 new product launches this year probably around half of them are pharmaceutical products so we do not see a long term issue for this business but more so a every so often issue that you have when you have competition coming into your market that has just happened in the last 12 months robbie marcus jpmorgan analyst appreciate it thank you james saccaro executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks robbie operator pito chickering of deutsche bank is on the line with a question please state your question pito chickering deutsche bank analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my questions two on renal the first one is the u s grew sequentially about 1 million can you walk us through sequential pd growth versus non pd and how much the january excess mortality from covid impacted that sequential growth jose e almeida chairman president and chief executive officer so pito i will start and jay will pick up from there our sequential growth has improved from q1 to q2 in the overall u s market from 3 3 to about 4 in q2 and going there to peak about 6 in q4 for a pretty good performance on a post 2020 year which is which was really hit hard in terms of new patients and the death of patients on covid i would say that the pd market is still very much a good market to be in it has grown above the overall renal dialysis business across the globe particularly in the u s we re still very optimistic on the vector of the growth that despite all that happened in 2020 we re able to have growth this year and expect to return to a high single digit patient growth to double digit patient growth probably toward the end of 22 going into 2023 clare trachtman vice president of investor relations yes and pito just to add to that basically by the end of the year we would expect the dialysis population in the u s to grow just under 1 so it is starting to recover after being down more than 2 again this is the treated dialysis population in 2020 so it will return to grow up this year and then continue to grow even faster in 2022 and beyond pito chickering deutsche bank analyst okay great and then a follow up question on the renal ous how much of the impact that you guys saw in this quarter was from excess mortality from covid like you mentioned to bob that you expect this to normalize in the back half of the year i just want to understand how much is purely temporary like the procedures in japan for pd versus more permanent in nature james saccaro executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so what i would say is it is really a mix of those two items and we don t differentiate we don t split that out for a number of different reasons but understand those drivers internally the 1 decline we re going to expect to see in the second half of the year 4 growth as we start to see procedures normalize and then we start to lap the headwind of the very unfortunate patient mortality situation so again if you look at as i commented earlier if you look at the international business on a rolling 12 month basis in pd and renal internationally it s a solid grower for us we expect that story to continue moving forward pito chickering deutsche bank analyst alright thanks so much james saccaro executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator vijay kumar of evercore isi is on the line with a question please state your question vijay kumar evercore isi analyst hi guys thanks for taking my question maybe my first one a high level big picture question for joe joe when you think about the business at pre pandemic versus post pandemic at a very high level has anything changed fundamentally for the business right whether when you look at your end markets margin structure and but fundamental i mean there are obviously some temporal issues here but these all seem to be workable solvable temporal in nature but fundamentally has anything change when you think about the pre and post pandemic universe jose e almeida chairman president and chief executive officer vijay i think that there is changes in how patients are being treated and how hospitals are seeing the influx of patients i when you think about 2019 you saw and you see how we are looking at for the rest of the year we see this year as a recovery year where the admissions toward the end of the year they exit into 2022 will be probably 100 98 to 100 of going back to the admission flow rates that we ve had before so if you think about the major dynamics of the market i would say there is a move from the acute care to the less acute care and what is the impact for baxter if you think about baxter as a healthcare supply company with products that are must have independents that are setting we follow the patient with our products in many places if you go to a less acute site you will need a pump no matter what you still need fluids you need medicines injectables you still need things that are needed to treat that patient to the home side we have that advantage and have spoken about the pd advantage that is a positive for the company not only by the rule in the u s with a kidney dialysis and transplant changes that were done during president trump s tenure but also the place to be if you have sick patients that don t want to go to acute sites or dialysis clinics so that is a positive when we look at what i see is temporary the inflation that we are seeing in the disruption in supply chain i think not only baxter is working hard to offset that but also i don t believe those are fundamental changes that will alter the completely the going forward dynamic of our logistic costs as well as raw material costs we will face headwinds in this area we have spoken about the cost of containers are very expensive fuel and everything else we re offsetting that as you could see this quarter and we have done for the year and we plan to continue to do it the thing is how do you see that is that a fundamental change in the cost structure we don t think so we think that that will eventually subside but at the moment we don t have that in our numbers in our numbers what we have is us offsetting headwinds coming in from the cost point of view market wise as i said they are changed a significant amount of telehealth connecting the dots of information coming from icus so the better off we will be better off but continue to develop our digital health products as we re doing if you think about our share source with the companion with the mobile companion that we just launched earlier this year a true view in our crt as well as half of the portfolio with the fda today regarding our new pump is not a mechanical electrical pump is actually software that is going with it that will be installed in the hospitals networks as gateway to be able to manage traffic and bring information back and forth so that boat has shipped that boat has sailed there s no way to not be in the connected market going forward vijay kumar evercore isi analyst that s extremely helpful joe jay one quick one for you you take a lot of pride in free cash flows obviously the pandemic there s been a lot of moving parts year to date the free cash conversion is up 70 i m curious what are temporal items here and should we think about baxter when should we think about baxter getting back to being a premium free cash conversion company james saccaro executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks for the question vijay as you know joe and i are both really focused on driving free cash flow and driving free cash flow performance sustainably and frankly we ve made a series of decisions over the last couple of years to suboptimize the base case to protect against severe situations that could emerge all of these things were absolutely the right thing to do carrying extra inventory into the pandemic as we sit here today carrying select inventory of incremental product as we look at a hurricane season which could be a challenge and so these things have we ve had a little bit excess inventory relative to our normal expectations as we move toward the end of the year and as we ve been able to improve the predictability of sales by product line in a post pandemic world we ll start to be able to optimize cash flow a little bit more carefully and closely and so i think as we move to 2022 and 23 we ll start to see more normal years for cash flow obviously 2020 was a huge anomaly 2021 continues to be anomalous because of again just really being sensitive to having enough product available to support patients in a very challenging situation but as i said i think as we emerge in 2022 and 23 we ll be able to optimize the inventory a little bit better continue our focus on accounts receivable and then furthermore on the days payable really work to optimize that working closely with our suppliers and then finally from a capex standpoint there are certain investments that we always make and we ll continue to make those especially those that support growth in businesses like our pd business so we ll continue to look for those value creating opportunities and those exist so we ll have more capex and that will be a continued area for us of great investment but i think 2022 starts to become a more normal year and then even more so in future beyond that vijay kumar evercore isi analyst that s helpful jay thank you guys operator lawrence biegelsen of wells fargo is on the line with a question please state your question lawrence biegelsen wells fargo analyst hi good morning thanks for taking the question one on bps one on novum iq obviously joe bps was really strong this quarter i d love to understand the contribution from the covid vaccine and how sustainable that is how should we think about is that still a 50 million to 100 million annual opportunity and joe you signed a contract last year with a partner on a non covid vaccine so when could we start to see that contributing just trying to understand the outlook for bps and i had one follow up jose e almeida chairman president and chief executive officer the outlook has been improving because of the necessity for vaccines so right now we re looking at about a north of 100 million this year of contribution from bps clare trachtman vice president of investor relations specific to the covid vaccine jose e almeida chairman president and chief executive officer specifically with covid vaccine now bps as a business is larger than that but just bps vaccine north of 100 million lawrence biegelsen wells fargo analyst and it turns in a sustainability of that i guess there s no way to comment on that at this point jose e almeida chairman president and chief executive officer it s tough larry we on one side we hope that we don t ever need to produce another file of vaccines so this disease goes away and the world is back to normal on the other hand we re doing what we can to help the world get through this so i would say that you re probably going to have some residual production in 2022 because as you can see it was overseas about a few weeks ago and the scarcity of vaccine is remarkable so there s still a lot of places in the world that don t have vaccines and i think eventually those vaccines will reach there so we re not making a prediction in 2022 but we think there will be residual production in 2022 for vaccines clare trachtman vice president of investor relations and we do have some of our projects to extend out through 2022 as well lawrence biegelsen wells fargo analyst thank you for that on novum iq joe obviously it s a very important product for you i m wondering if you ll talk a little bit about the nature of the questions you received and the timing of the response and your confidence in the 2021 approval thanks for taking the questions jose e almeida chairman president and chief executive officer larry i ll give you an update overall but the nature of the question is a little too much we re not going to get into it but i would say all the questions are answerable and all the questions are not out of this world in terms of complexity to put them on a piece of paper and get back to the fda i don t comment all of you know on the call and outside the call that i don t comment on behalf of the agency the agency will do what the agency will do what we can do is make sure that our engineers and scientists and the regulatory folks are focused on this we have a lot of people focused on getting those answers to the fda we hope that they will be happy with the answers and we can have the product launched this year as we re planning at the moment i also want to just make sure that you all know we re having pretty good demand for our spectrum pump our current pump so it s not all or nothing we do have really good demand for our pump very large contracts coming about so i just want to make sure that we feel very comfortable with where we are in terms of our technical responses to the fda we think we have it we are very happy with the design of the bump and the future that holds because it s a very different platform that will hit the markets when approved and hopefully bring this industry at a different level of technology but nevertheless baxter has three different groups of pumps novum iq spectrum version nine as well as the pump that is yet to be approved by the fda lawrence biegelsen wells fargo analyst thank you joe operator danielle antalffy of svb leerink is on the line with a question please state your question danielle antalffy svb leerink analyst hi good morning everyone thanks so much for taking the question just a follow up to vijay s question jay this is for you on what s fundamentally changed you did have pretty strong sg and a control this quarter and just wondering is that something that s sustainable going forward and should we be thinking about that as a more meaningful lever going forward as we head into the analyst meeting and i have one more higher level follow up james saccaro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure i think the controls that we had in place we were pleased that we were able to save a substantial amount in the second quarter roughly 0 06 relative to our expectations on the opex line and as we move to the full year there s probably a couple more cents relative to our expectations we ll always look to optimize spending for sure and what we were pleased that we were able to drive an impact in the face of a challenging worldwide supply chain environment in the second quarter but there is part of the savings that we experienced this year that are related to a slower resumption of activity and so as we look at the second quarter we had sort of anticipated a very substantial increase in sg and a you ll note that we did have a nice sized increase in sg and a but it was just not quite at the pace that we anticipated so we ll expect that to resume here s what i would say about sg and a and other spending categories and cost of goods going forward at the investor day we ll talk about things like the work that jim borzi is doing to really optimize manufacturing and supply chain and really taking a cutting edge approach in that arena and then the other thing that i will tell you about is the digital transformation that we re undertaking and that will have a nice impact in terms of really spending across the company and i think that s something that will feature prominently in the meantime we were pleased to drive a short term result but i don t think all the changes that we re making are the ones that we ll be talking about with you when we get together in september danielle antalffy svb leerink analyst understood thanks for that jay and then joe i guess the question is for you and again back to shifting fundamentals you mentioned site of care things like that how are pricing conversations or contracting conversations different between the two sites of care talking more ambulatory or outpatient versus hospital and inpatient and is that something that we need to consider as we look over the long term for baxter thanks so much jose e almeida chairman president and chief executive officer danielle i will say that a lot of these sites are owned by large hospital systems they are not just independent sites the configuration of products in some of those sites are different than use in hospitals so price points may differ for products used in non acute or step down significant step down of facilities that are not part of a hospital campus but that is not there s no two different conversations going on we believe that our products are have price consistency across customers and we negotiate every single contract with the intent to have as much penetration as we can within that integrated supply chain for the hospital so if you think about negotiations are all about class of products and quality availability of products and evidently price is a big deal no best price usually wins so i don t see tremendous distinction danielle antalffy svb leerink analyst okay thank you jose e almeida chairman president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator matt miksic of credit suisse is on line with a question please state your question matt miksic credit suisse analyst hi thanks so much i wanted to ask a follow up for jay on some of the environmental trends that you re seeing and then i had one question for joe as well if i could so on january remarks you mentioned this sort of sustained high level of surgical volume performance you re expecting in the u s throughout the rest of the year and i m just wondering where what gives you that confidence or visibility that that s kind of where it will stay and i mentioned one follow up james saccaro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure yes in my prepared remarks we commented that we re seeing roughly at historic levels of surgical procedures roughly 100 of prior levels we have some line of sight in the short term but our crystal ball gets murky as we look toward year end that s very clear and so i would say that one point of procedure volume in the u s is roughly 0 5 million of impact per month and so that s something that we watch carefully i think when we put together the sales guidance for the year we have the ability to withstand a little bit of softness in surgical procedures and admissions as it relates to delta variant but this is an uncertainty that we re contending with not only on the surgical procedure side but also on the admission side and i ve talked historically about a lot of the work that we ve done in terms of forecasting and modeling and i think we ve done a really good job kind of relating our business to some of these fundamental drivers but you re right there are this is a valve of world that we re living in today and we ll have to watch carefully as we move through the rest of the year if the virus changes course substantially at this point we don t have any reason to believe that will be the case and feel good about the numbers i ve sized the downside risk it s not enormous so i think we re in ok shape matt miksic credit suisse analyst that s great and then just one follow up for joe i think to bob s question you had mentioned that size was not so much of a consideration or determinant but that i d love to get your sense of i guess two things on the m and a environment one is sort of asset pricing or the challenges that you face in making a med device or supply of acquisition in this environment that s been a part of the conversation for baxter for a number of years and then also the balance that you see the pluses and minuses of putting more capital work in a large deal the risks associated with that and continuing with some of the tuck in acquisitions that you ve done before jose e almeida chairman president and chief executive officer if you think about tuck in acquisitions they re always going to be there because it s a way for us to augment product lines and adjacencies we just announced actually one today and that is a good way we don t have that kind of product we need that kind of product to compete so there s a really good thing where we saw in our pharmaceutical business with doxil and caelyx so it is needed but then you think about where the future of healthcare is going where the confluence of the forces coming about how do we look at our portfolio going forward and what would be a good complement for the portfolio so the size doesn t play a role obviously if it s something enormous and unachievable we don t discuss that but the size by itself will never be a determinant as i said before this is strategic strategy or strategic appeal second is the returns the third would be our ability to integrate well and if we don t find anything to deploy the cash we deploy the cash back to the shareholders so don t think about size ever been a determinant think about strategic fit and future of healthcare matt miksic credit suisse analyst got it thank you operator the last question comes from the line of joanne wuensch with citi group please state your question joanne wuensch citigroup analyst thank you for taking my question just a couple of pieces of clarification what was the covid vaccine benefit in the quarter on a dollar basis clare trachtman vice president of investor relations it was just over 40 million joanne wuensch citigroup analyst i m sorry 30 million clare trachtman vice president of investor relations 40 million 4 0 just over 40 million joanne wuensch citigroup analyst excellent and how much novum iq dollars incentive in the current guidance james saccaro executive vice president and chief financial officer yes we have approximately a little north of 25 million in the fourth quarter joanne wuensch citigroup analyst thank you and just to confirm you re expecting hospital volumes to be at pre covid levels exiting the year james saccaro executive vice president and chief financial officer no at 98 in the fourth quarter and so if we were to split it at the very end of the year the run rate would be basically at the prior year level so into q1 of next year joanne wuensch citigroup analyst excellent thank you so much i appreciate it and have a great day jose e almeida chairman president and chief executive officer i just want to make sure that you all know that our we are not predictors of disease here neither infection rates so we do the best we can in putting our models in place we base our numbers on that we will all expect to hopefully the delta variant will be contained in most places in the world and we move on but at the moment the admissions in the u s of course were 98 exiting the year hopefully in 2022 at 100 things can change as you can see by the infection rates but the death is still much smaller than were before so we do the best we can when we give these numbers is what we think is going to happen clare trachtman vice president of investor relations thank you that will conclude our call operator duration 59 minutes

gaap financial measures this earnings release includes the following financial measures that are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 1 adjusted operating margin which the company defines as operating margin excluding acquisition related amortization of intangible assets and discrete items such as acquisition and related integration costs environmental accrual adjustments gains or losses on the sale or disposal of property plant and equipment restructuring severance impairment and other related costs utis fire charges and the related income tax effect on these items collectively discreteitems 2 adjusted net income which the company defines as net income excluding amortization of acquisition intangible assets and discrete items 3 adjusted earnings per diluted share which the company defines as earnings per diluted share excluding amortization of acquisition intangible assets and discrete items divided by adjusted weighted average shares outstanding diluted 4 adjusted ebitda which the company defines as net income excluding interest expense net income tax expense depreciation and amortization stock based compensation expense and discrete items 5 adjusted ebitda margin which the company defines as the percentage that results from dividing adjusted ebitda by total net sales 6 free cash flow which the company defines as net cash provided by operating activities less non acquisition capital expenditures management believes adjusted operating margin adjusted net income adjusted earnings per diluted share adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are useful to investors because they allow for comparison to the company s performance in prior periods without the effect of items that by their nature tend to obscure the company s core operating results due to potential variability across periods based on the timing frequency and magnitude of such items as a result management believes that these measures enhance the ability of investors to analyze trends in the company s business and evaluate the company s performance relative to peer companies management also believes free cash flow is useful to investors as an additional way of viewing the company s liquidity and provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the company s cash flows however non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from or as alternatives to financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap in addition these non gaap financial measures may differ from and should not be compared to similarly named measures used by other companies reconciliations of the differences between these non

and chief executive officer thank you pat and good morning everyone i m proud to share that oshkosh has delivered another quarter of strong performance experiencing strong orders sales growth and robust backlogs across all of our segments our third our strong third quarter results include sales of 2 2 billion and adjusted earnings per share of 2 09 an increase of more than 60 of over prior year adjusted eps we are pleased with this strong performance and i m proud of our team s perseverance to deliver growth and solid results in the face of one of the most challenging global supply chain environments in recent memory our third quarter was highlighted by several exciting announcements on the heels of the usps next generation delivery vehicle or ngdv win in the second quarter in early june we were notified that we won the u s army s stryker medium caliber weapons system or ncws program which represents an important new adjacency for our defense business less than a week later we held a joint news conference with the city of madison wisconsin to announce our revolutionary new electric fire truck the pierce volterra madison is the first city in north america to be operating an electric fire truck as part of its fleet and we re pleased to report that the truck has been performing extremely well this is a big step forward for our evs and is another milestone in our two decade plus history of electrifying products as we ve been discussing over the past year we have significant electrification projects in all of our business segments and in last and in late june we announced spartanburg south carolina as our newest manufacturing facility the spartanburg factory will be the home of our usps ngdv production we are proud to be creating over 1 000 manufacturing jobs in south carolina for this exciting new program as we look at the current landscape many industries including our own are seeing a rapid increase in demand with market recoveries causing significant stress on global supply chains and that is only intensified over the past quarter at oshkosh we are witnessing the effect of these supply chain disruptions primarily within the access equipment business impacting sales by approximately 100 million during the quarter importantly we believe these supply chain issues will eventually subside and we are well positioned to capitalize on the market recovery as we address these disruptions we are updating our expectations for 2021 adjusted eps and now expect 6 35 to 6 50 tightening the range a bit heading into our fourth quarter reducing the top end of the range reflects the ongoing supply chain issues that i mentioned mike will share more details in his section now let s turn to slide four and get started on our segment updates with access equipment the recovery momentum we discussed on our last call continued in demand for our industry leading access equipment strengthened while we expected some supply chain disruptions in the back half of the year the magnitude of the impact has been more significant than we previously expected our access team did an outstanding job minimizing the volume impact during the quarter which allowed us to deliver nearly 90 revenue growth versus the prior year we are seeing strong demand led by north america elevated fleet ages combined with strong equipment utilization and a healthy rental market are fueling this demand we expect a multiyear opportunity for robust replacement demand as rental companies look to lower the overall age of their fleets which were at historically high levels entering 2021 we expect further opportunities when nonresidential construction rebounds as a result of these market fundamentals our customers are already beginning to plan for their 2022 capital requirements orders were strong during the quarter leading to a backlog of 1 75 billion up more than 200 versus last year and an all time record for access for the third quarter we continue to be pleased with customer interest and orders for our electric booms and scissor lifts the move toward electric is still in its early stages and is gaining traction with customers that are looking for improved performance benefits total cost of ownership benefits and carbon footprint reduction the bottom line for the segment is that we are still in the beginning of what we believe is a multiyear growth cycle as economies recover and customers use our safety and productivity enhancing equipment in more applications please turn to slide five and i ll review our defense segment our defense team delivered solid third quarter results with double digit sales and operating income growth and continues its success entering new adjacent markets to supplement a market leading position with tactical wheeled vehicles as i mentioned in my opening remarks we announced the decision to build the usps next generation delivery vehicles in spartanburg south carolina in late june spartanburg is an outstanding location with deep automotive manufacturing routes and we look forward to bringing new team members on board to help build these game changing 0 emissions and low emission last mile delivery vehicles for our nation s postal carriers our team has already begun preparing the facility for the planned production launch of the ngdv in 2023 recall this is a 10 year contract that calls for between 50 000 and 165 000 vehicles with a mix of both zero emission vebs and fuel efficient ice vehicles we are continuously engaged with a broad cross section of usps representatives including postal carriers procurement and technology professionals and are very encouraged by the positive feedback we received on the great technology we are building into the ngdv we look forward to sharing our progress during our analyst day this september in wisconsin in early june we were notified that we won the stryker mcws competition which will result in our team integrating the mcws on the stryker vehicles that are used by u s army brigade combat teams sbcts the six year contract includes a full spectrum of system technical support interim contractor logistics support and integrated product support to achieve this win our team brought together the best in class capabilities for system design manufacturing and integration to provide a highly capable solution that meets current stryker mcws program requirements while offering the flexibility to upgrade in the future the six year contract is worth up to 943 million this is a great example of our team s ability to successfully compete for and win programs in adjacent markets that are part of the army s priorities our january acquisition of pratt miller was instrumental in our ability to win this important program before i leave defense i wanted to mention some late breaking news that our bid for the omfv or optionally manned fighting vehicle was selected as one of five proposals to participate in the concept design phase of the program we are working with some outstanding partners and this is a significant win for oshkosh it s also another example of our ability to compete in adjacencies outside of tactical wheeled vehicles the omfv is planned to replace the bradley fighting vehicle and the program involves several milestones over the next several years let s turn to slide six for a discussion of the fire emergency segment the fire emergency segment delivered excellent performance in the quarter with solid sales and an operating income margin of 14 7 despite the challenging supply chain environment as we ve shared over the past year we had some concerns with municipal budgets as we emerge from the pandemic that could lead to downward pressure on fire truck demand our expectations are changing as communities have been more resilient through the pandemic buoyed by strong residential construction and increasing property values we now expect 2022 to be a solid year as evidenced by our better than expected order rates f e finished the quarter with another solid backlog of 1 2 billion an increase of 8 5 over last year orders in the quarter were impressive at 247 million an increase of 69 over last year pierce is the industry leader in municipal fire trucks and that leadership was punctuated with our june announcement of north america s first electric fire truck a milestone for both oshkosh and the industry the city of madison is piloting our new volterra pumper as part of its frontline fleet and it has successfully responded to hundreds of emergency calls the volterra highlights our expertise with electric vehicles and provides all the operational functional and safety benefits our customers have come to expect from peers while not sacrificing performance our customer is saving over 100 gallons of diesel fuel per week with the pumper and they are also inviting the community and other fire departments to see the unit up close throughout the summer we also launched the volterra electric rf vehicle which will be visiting airports around the united states please turn to slide seven and we ll talk about our commercial segment our commercial segment returned to growth this quarter with a revenue increase of over 12 our efforts to drive margin improvement through simplification and innovation in this segment are working as evidenced by our 10 6 operating margin performance in the quarter surpassing last year s 10 2 adjusted operating margin our third quarter results were particularly impressive given the challenging supply chain environment as most of you are aware our commercial segment is more reliant on third party chassis than our other segments commercial has been working diligently to address reduced chassis availability that has been prevalent across the industry during the recovery our team has maximized production in the face of these headwinds by adjusting our schedules thus allowing our production lines to remain operational and effective despite these hurdles our outlook is supported by orders in the quarter for both rcds and mixers as the u s and canada moved beyond the pandemic these orders led to an all time high backlog of just under 500 million providing solid visibility into 2022 we are pleased to report that rear discharge concrete mixer production in our focused factory in london ontario canada is proceeding very well and the transition is complete we are also focused on optimizing rcv production in our dodge center minnesota facility in the coming quarters we also delivered the first unit of five electric rcvs for boise idaho working closely with one of our oem partners we look forward to working with our customers and partners as they establish and implement electrification and emission reduction strategies for the long term finally we are participating in the advanced clean transportation expo in long beach california in late august we plan to showcase our fully electric cobalt concrete mixer truck concept i encourage all of you to check it out if you plan to attend the expo i m going to turn it over to mike to discuss our third quarter results and expectations for the remainder of 2021 michael e pack executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks john and good morning everyone please turn to slide eight we delivered strong third quarter results despite significant supply chain disruptions which impacted our ability to complete and deliver units consolidated revenues were approximately 100 million lower than our prior expectations as a result of these disruptions largely at access equipment consolidated sales for the third quarter were 2 2 billion or 628 million higher than the prior year representing a 40 increase the sales increase was driven by an 89 increase at access equipment a 27 increase at defense and a 12 increase at commercial excess equipment sales increased due to improved market demand as we exit the pandemic driven by strong replacement demand last year demand was negatively impacted as covid 19 shelter in place restrictions peaked around much of the globe in our third quarter defense sales increased in the quarter due to higher jltv volume and the benefit of pratt miller sales which we acquired in the second quarter of this year fire emergency sales were approximately flat in the quarter and commercial segment sales were up due to increased rcv demand as we emerge from the pandemic offset in part by the lack of concrete batch plant sales as a reminder the concrete batch plant business was divested in the fourth quarter of the prior year consolidated adjusted operating income for the third quarter was 205 1 million or 9 3 of sales compared to 128 8 million or 8 1 of sales in the prior year quarter as a reminder we benefited from approximately 60 million of temporary cost reduction actions as a result of the pandemic during last year s third quarter as we shared on prior calls the return of the majority of these expenses to our run rate was a headwind year over year incremental margins in the quarter excess equipment adjusted operating income increased as a result of higher sales volume offset in part by higher incentive compensation expense higher material costs and unfavorable customer and product mix defense operating income increased as a result of higher sales volume and lower new product development spending offset in part by unfavorable price cost dynamics iron emergency operating income decreased in the current year quarter as a result of higher incentive compensation expense offset in part by favorable product mix and commercial segment operating income increased largely due to higher sales volume and favorable product mix offset in part by higher material costs corporate costs increased 16 8 million due to higher incentive compensation expense and the return of other spending subject to temporary cost reductions in the prior year during the quarter we repurchased approximately 107 000 shares of common stock for a total cost of 13 million adjusted eps for the quarter was 2 09 compared to adjusted eps of 1 29 in the prior year our gaap eps of 3 07 for the quarter includes a tax benefit of 1 per share related to a u s net operating loss carryback to previous years with higher federal statutory rates this tax benefit is excluded from adjusted eps please turn to slide nine for a discussion of our updated expectations for 2021 during our last earnings call we shared that our expectations assume no major supply chain disruptions as we discussed today we are facing significant supply chain challenges which 7 8 billion and adjusted consolidated operating income range of approximately 610 million to 630 million and an adjusted eps range of 6 35 to 6 50 compared to our prior range of 6 35 to 6 85 at the segment level we are estimating access equipment sales of approximately 3 2 billion a 28 increase compared to 2020 and adjusted operating income margin of approximately 10 5 our revised expectations reflect production constraints manufacturing inefficiencies and increased freight costs due to the current supply chain environment we are reaffirming our full year expectations for defense and fire emergency we expect sales and an operating income margin of approximately 2 5 billion and 8 respectively at defense in sales and an operating income margin of 1 2 billion and 14 respectively at fire emergency within the defense segment we have analyzed the accounting treatment for the usps ngdd contract award and have determined that we will begin recognizing revenue upon production of units which is planned to begin in 2023 as such we expect to see very limited usps revenue over the next 18 to 24 months we are estimating commercial segment sales will be up modestly versus higher expectations to approximately 950 million and we expect operating income margins of approximately 8 we estimate corporate expenses will be approximately 155 million we estimate our adjusted tax rate for 2021 will be approximately 22 5 and we estimate an average share count of 69 3 million shares for the full year we are estimating free cash flow of approximately 750 million an increase of approximately 100 million versus our prior expectations we also estimate capital expenditures will be approximately 140 million looking at the fourth quarter we expect consolidated sales to be up approximately 18 over the prior year with access equipment largely driving the increase we expect that material and freight cost increases will be a 35 million headwind to consolidated margins in the quarter and we expect a 30 million year over year headwind as a result of temporary cost reductions in the prior year quarter i ll turn it back over to john now for some closing comments john c pfeifer president and chief executive officer we announced another solid quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year continues to be positive we ve made adjustments to our expectations as we work through supply chain challenges importantly we believe the supply chain challenges will subside over time we won some big programs recently and we are taking actions to drive profitable growth as we innovate serve and advance the company our long term outlook is strong as we leverage technology and innovation to generate industry leading performance and further distance ourselves from the competition i hope you will consider attending our investor day in september we have a full agenda that will provide an excellent overview of our company a chance to speak with our leadership team and experience our industry leading innovative products firsthand while portions of the meeting will be live streamed you will need to be here in person to get the full experience we hope to see you there please reach out to pat if you have any questions i ll turn it back over to pat to get the q a started patrick n davidson senior vice president of investor relations thanks john operator please begin the question and answer period of this call questions and answers operator our first question comes from stephen volkmann with jefferies please proceed with your question stephen volkmann jefferies analyst hi good morning guys thanks for taking the question the question is really on sort of price versus cost and i think you talked about 35 million of headwinds from material and freight in the fourth quarter i assume that s net of any price increases you re putting through but if you could just kind of describe what s happening with price and when and if that kind of normalizes and maybe even gets better in 2022 whatever commentary you could have around that i d appreciate michael e pack executive vice president and chief financial officer sure steve this is mike i can take that yes so really from a price cost perspective what we re what we re seeing for next quarter the 35 million i referenced is in line with what our expectations were last quarter when we said about 45 million that we did see about 10 million to 12 million in this in the third quarter we just wrapped up we do expect that we ll continue to have some cost price headwinds in our first quarter of next year but by the time we get to the january quarter or second quarter that will start moderating certainly since the last call we have continued to see commodity escalation in some cases we ve taken further pricing action during the past quarter so we re going to continue to manage it in a disciplined manner but again by the time we get to the second quarter we should start seeing moderation to get back to an equilibrium there and again if you go back to 2018 when we saw the steel escalation we did see a benefit on the back end of that so i we don t have reason to believe we wouldn t see something similar in this go around stephen volkmann jefferies analyst great thank you michael e pack executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator thank you our next question comes from nicole deblase with deutsche bank please proceed with your question nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst thanks good morning guys can we talk a little bit about what s going on with the supply chain and i guess did you actually have to shut down production as a result of that all in the third quarter and then when we think about fourth quarter in access is the anticipation are you guys anticipating shutting down production at certain points during the quarter john c pfeifer president and chief executive officer yes thanks nicole the supply chain was definitely the headline for us this quarter as the markets have rebounded really sharply the supply chain has had a tough time catching up and when we talk about supply chain disruption we re talking about it beyond just say the chip challenge suppliers are really facing challenges in hiring employees across industries shipping itself has been a major challenge we have global supply chains so there s a lot of freight imbalance it s added two weeks sometimes up to four weeks of lead time just in freight from asia or europe that s caused problems so we ve had a lot of i ll call it disruption slowdown in manufacturing a couple of times where we ve had to stop lines for temporary periods of time and that has had a bigger impact the access equipment segment where we have a lot of high volume manufacturing than the other segments but it s a challenge across our entire business we expect that this will subside we don t think this is going to last for a long period of time we re we believe we re in it for another couple of quarters and as we get into 2022 we believe we ll start to see much more normalization and have caught up with this quick recovery that we ve all been struggling to keep up with nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst understood and maybe for my follow up just on the free cash flow guidance increase is that all working capital driven just curious in earnings at the top end has come down a bit john c pfeifer president and chief executive officer yes it indeed is free cash flow some customer advances and modestly lower inventory levels nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst got it thank you operator our next question comes from chad dillard with bernstein please proceed with your question chad dillard bernstein analyst hi good morning guys so can you talk a little bit about your conversations with rental companies at least as it pertains to 2022 are they happening earlier any color you can give on just initial thoughts on how you re thinking about pricing john c pfeifer president and chief executive officer yes so it s john i ll kind of give you maybe an overview of the access customer environment and demand environment and also try to answer your question about 2022 so needless to say the current environment is really really strong and that you see that in our backlog 1 75 billion in backlog and when i talk to nicole s question about the supply chain hey we re not losing business we ve got lots of orders are strong our backlog is good this is all business that will continue to our orders that we ll continue to fulfill right now when you look at the rental market we believe that the demand is largely driven by replacement demand we ve been talking for several quarters about how fleets are aged and our customers now they re more confident in the recovery they re more willing to spend capital to upgrade those fleets and that s what they re doing now there s also fleet growth that s happening they re trying to grow the fleet because there s finding new opportunities to apply the equipment that s also of course very good this this all means that there s really strong utilization rates even with not such great nonresidential construction metrics these demand rates have been strong and again it s that replacement demand that s really been fueling it we believe that as nonresidential starts to improve in the future that s just going to continue to help our demand which is why we believe we re in a multiyear recovery period so if you look at 2022 the one thing that i ll say about it is we are having already speaking with our customers regarding their plans and their purchases for 2022 and we know and we ve always said that hey we ve got some cost inflation in our business with material cost on some of the freight rates and we intend to make sure that we recover that sometimes there s a little bit of a lag effect because we ve got backlog but we will fully expect to stay ahead of it over time so that s what i can tell you about it chad dillard bernstein analyst okay that s helpful and then maybe a little longer term question on some of your new electric products versus internal combustion can you just talk about just what the margin difference would be potentially is there any margin difference can you talk about just your philosophy on r d and the level of intensity that you think is appropriate and just lastly just manufacturing footprint are you thinking about having dedicated lines or is it going to be integrated with the legacy products john c pfeifer president and chief executive officer the last point there ll be some of both some will be integrated some will be independent lines it really depends on the segment it depends on the product what i can tell you about the electrification business hey i ll tell you in general we re an innovation company and we innovate all the time whether it s electrification or autonomy or with data and how we use data to provide better performance of a product and better insights to our customers when you look at electrification i think the most important thing to understand with electrification is electrification the fact that it provides 0 emission is good but that s not that s only one benefit that we all get out of electrification the other benefits that are big are there s big total cost of ownership benefits because it s more efficient to run off of electricity than it is off of diesel or gasoline for that matter number two there s a lot of performance benefits that we provide for the product for our customers for productivity with electrification that you don t necessarily get with an internal combustion engine so the answer to your question is absolutely that leads to our ability to to improve our margins because we re able to solve customer problems better and the economics are there so that s one of the great compelling things about electrifying a lot of our product lines and this will go on for years we re not going to see entire end markets electrify overnight it s going to be it s going to take several years for the adoption by our customer base some will adopt faster than others but this is a positive trend on many different levels chad dillard bernstein analyst thanks i will pass it on operator thank you our next question comes from jamie cook with credit suisse please proceed with your question jamie cook credit suisse analyst hi good morning i guess just a few questions john obviously 2021 is a challenging year but as you think about 2022 is there any way you could outline for us which markets you think have the opportunity for growth and if anything if sales that were that we couldn t get in 2021 because the supply chain is that sort of additive to your 2022 outlook and then i guess just a longer term question i think you ve done a good job sort of talking about how oshkosh can grow sort of in adjacent markets whether it s the option land vehicle market or last mile delivery can you talk about sort of when we think cash can start like do we start to see those benefits in 2022 or do those does the growth from adjacent markets is it should we expect it further out john c pfeifer president and chief executive officer yes yes so i think that from our for the most part if you look at all of our commercial segments non defense segments let s call them we expect really healthy markets in 2022 we had and i ll give you an example we had previously been very concerned about the municipal spending and municipal budgets and we talked about that in past quarters because usually after a recession municipal budgets get squeezed and sometimes that can have a downward pressure on fire truck demand we are not seeing that we re seeing municipal spending that is better than we anticipated where we see the market for our fire trucks to be better than maybe we thought it would be several quarters ago so that s positive we see multiyear growth in the access segment for a lot of factors that also include global and china and so forth the defense segment the teco weel vehicle budgets are going to be under a little bit of pressure in 2022 and 2023 so there ll be some pressure there but defense is what you mentioned in the second half of your question our ability to validate it the last six months usps is a big big program for us mcws is a near billion program for us these are adjacencies that are much more in line with funding priorities we were just down selected on the omfv that s optionally manned fighting vehicle that will replace the gigantic inventory fighting vehicle or the bradley that s in the market so to get down selected to participate on that is a big deal so i ll give you some color on the timing so on mcws there ll actually be a little bit of revenue in 2022 from mcws and we ll get but the material revenue will come from 2023 and that will last about six years for that program to run and on postal we go into production in postal in the second half of 2023 so we ll see some revenue in 2023 we ll see material revenue in 2024 and up to full rate revenue in 2025 and that s a long term program and a big program so that s a little bit of color i can provide you jamie cook credit suisse analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from mig gilbert with baird please proceed with your question mig gilbert baird analyst yes good morning everyone mike maybe this question for you i m sort of trying to understand the moving pieces to your updated outlook here on the cost side i do remember you selling out for us the raw material headwind in terms of dollar headwind that you had in fiscal 21 as well as the cost reversal the temporary cost reversals so can we get an update as to how you re thinking about these figures again in your updated fiscal 21 outlook and then how much in terms of dollars all these supply chain issues are dragging your full year outlook michael e pack executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so mig i think first of all really the cost price is fairly similar to what we expected this past quarter so we talked about the 45 million in the back half of the year we had about 10 million in the third quarter rising to about 35 million in the fourth quarter the other is headwind year over year was those temporary costs reversing was about 60 million and a lot of those came back this past quarter in the third quarter is about 30 million and the fourth quarter so those are sort of the foundational number if you really look at it from a margin standpoint we we were geared up and john and i also said in my prepared remarks that we missed probably about 100 million of revenue or had an opportunity for about another 100 million of revenue largely in access and obviously we re geared up from a staffing perspective to really build that revenue and deliver those products and and realize that revenue so and that would have been obviously if you think about it that s out 0 25 of eps in the quarter so i think when you factor in a bit more volume and so on i don t know that the cost price dynamic is really any different than what we ve been talking about freight may be modestly higher than what we thought that i would say materials versus my last assumption that our last dissension we shared probably a small bit less than in the fourth quarter mig gilbert baird analyst okay okay that s helpful and then again you talked about things starting to normalize in the second quarter of 2022 and i m sort of curious here as to what your visibility is on that and people already asked about pricing for access in 2022 but do you feel like the market is tight enough to where you actually do have the need of pricing power in order to offset the multiple headwinds we re talking about michael e pack executive vice president and chief financial officer yes we re watching the cost dynamics very closely and back in the second quarter we implemented price increases in our non defense businesses in some cases we ve implemented additional price increases we re watching the commodities and we re going to continue to adjust as necessary obviously we talked about we are going to have the headwinds and the first quarter next year when we get to the second quarter we believe that moderates and again we re watching it closely and we re going to be responsible as we re heading into into those pricing discussions with our customers john c pfeifer president and chief executive officer yes mig this is john i ll just add to that we have all time record backlogs in the company right now i mean all time in the company never had a backlog this strong and we feel really good about where we re headed we feel really good about what we re doing right now we ve had really tough supply chain challenges as everyone tries to ramp up quickly i don t think that s overly unusual but when you couple that with the freight challenges it becomes a little bit more unusual when we say that it s going to norm we believe we don t have perfect visibility when we believe it will normalize and second quarter which means the first quarter of calendar year 2022 that s coming from our very mature supply chain management team that have a lot of insight not just into our fast supply chain but our tier two and our tier three supply chain that s where that information is coming up to us from and we ve got really really good supply chain people who are able to manage a complex situation like this fairly well in terms of the demand i mean demand is good we provide a lot of value to our customers we re number one in our segments we will absolutely price responsibly that s all i can say mig gilbert baird analyst very helpful thank you operator thank you our next question comes from david raso with evercore isi please proceed with your question david raso evercore isi analyst hi thank you for your time i appreciate the fourth quarter comments about year over year costs right the materials and freight costs and the temp cost reductions but then the comment you made earlier in the call about supply chain won t deteriorate or improve for that matter the rest of 2021 i m just trying to square that up with for access sequentially you saw this most recent quarter revenues up about 185 million and ebit still went up 32 million right not great incrementals but still ebitda up on up rev the fourth quarter is implying revenues go up another 50 million but now ebit drops sequentially 8 million so i m just trying to square up the comment no deterioration from here because that only suggests it does get more challenging sequentially and then i can have a quick follow up after that if you don t mind michael e pack executive vice president and chief financial officer yes david this is mike i ll take it i think my comments in my prepared remarks really responding to the challenge we had in the quarter that was sort of new was the availability of parts and the ability then to produce and deliver the product so it s really commenting on the availability of parts and so we re assuming that doesn t in the fourth quarter we believe it s still going to be a challenge just more challenge than it was in our second quarter similar to what we saw at the back half of the third quarter from a you re correct from a supply chain perspective our assumption was always that the price cost dynamic was going to be more challenged in the fourth quarter and that s why as we talked about it and even on the last earnings call we saw about a 10 million headwind in in the third quarter from a price cost from a material escalation and that grows to about 35 million next quarter but that s really in alignment with what we saw last quarter david raso evercore isi analyst okay so the availability of components doesn t michael e pack executive vice president and chief financial officer correct david raso evercore isi analyst price cost fully material michael e pack executive vice president and chief financial officer correct yes david raso evercore isi analyst yes and with that increased visibility that you have the size of your backlog across all the businesses but specifically asking about access given that feedback from your mature supply chain management suggesting looking into second tier suppliers maybe things loosen up a little bit when we get into calendar first quarter i m curious operationally how is that impacting your strategy when it comes to locking in costs for next year i m just trying to think about that increased visibility might give you confidence to be a little stronger in your negotiations for price but how are you managing your cost that you re lining up your supply with that increased visibility michael e pack executive vice president and chief financial officer yes david we always have a just as we manage through the pandemic we have a robust playbook as we manage so it s really a combination in some cases we have locked we re talking to our suppliers so there s certain certainly visibility that we re gaining over time obviously underlying commodities have continued to ablate even over the course of the last quarter and so we ll continue to watch that but when we do have larger backlogs it does provide an opportunity for us to continue to work with our supply chain partners and in some cases lock in our material costs david raso evercore isi analyst okay so fair to say the increased visibility on the top line you have taken some of that visibility and locked in more of cost side of the equation as well than normal michael e pack executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that s fair to say david raso evercore isi analyst thank you for the time appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from jerry revich with goldman sachs please proceed with your question jerry revich goldman sachs analyst thanks good morning everyone i m wondering if you could just talk about your thoughts around pricing mechanism heading into 2022 and longer term over the past couple of years we ve had a lot of supply chain volatility steel volatility and any views on potentially setting up inflation index pricing mechanism so we re not looking at these types of price cost headwinds that we re talking about here with escalations this year how are you thinking about that as we head into this coming cycle michael e pack executive vice president and chief financial officer well yes i guess this is mike i can start maybe john will have a couple of comments too i think the bottom line is we saw significant material inflation back in 2018 and what we typically see is we re going to be disciplined and continue to adjust our prices but very difficult when you have a backlog to go back and reprice that and there s always debate around there s always a lag when you see the core raw material increase and when that reads through the supply chain so it s really the devils in the details so what we ve done is we watch it closely we adjust price when we see changes and as we saw in 2018 you have a bit of a headwind coming into on an inflationary environment we normalized and then as things moderate over time you tend to get a benefit we saw exactly that happen back in the first quarter of as we came out of the really the elevated steel environment in 2018 so we don t have reason to believe that that s different and we think that s again that s it works that s how we work with our customers and over time that s been effective john c pfeifer president and chief executive officer yes have to i don t our customers for the most part i never say anything absolutely they don t like the indexing because they have to forecast what their costs are going to be and so they re trying to rely on us to forecast what the costs are going to be as opposed to doing index type pricing jerry revich goldman sachs analyst okay and then separately the silver lining was really strong performance in fire emergency and commercial margins this quarter and you folks left the full year margins more or less unchanged i m wondering is that a function of now the supply chain headwinds and access where you re starting to see those same issues hitting your suppliers in those areas or is that just a healthy respect for all of the broader supply base michael e pack executive vice president and chief financial officer so from first of all on the commercial front recall we do have more price cost headwinds in that segment because there are higher users of steel so about there s about 10 million of headwind quarter three to quarter four for commercial from a commodities perspective again that will normalize as we ve talked about with access equipment with fire emergency i just say as you look at the implied incrementals to the fourth quarter we have a bit of a we have a higher mix of commercial or third party chassis fire apparatus that happened to be delivering in the fourth quarter versus aerials so there s a little bit of a year over year mix shift and a little bit of a mix shift from quarter third to quarter four really a timing factor and that will normalize over time jerry revich goldman sachs analyst okay thanks operator thank you our next question comes from ross gilardi with bank of america please proceed with your question ross gilardi bank of america analyst thank you good morning guys so how much demand are you seeing from the rental companies for electrified product is it primarily for smaller compact equipment versus curious what s happening with your larger booms and then just what s the likelihood of maybe even a second leg to this replacement cycle in three to five years that the rail company is propelled by the customers to carry more electrified fleet and therefore replace a lot of the ice fleet that they re taking on now prior to the end of its useful life john c pfeifer president and chief executive officer so we re ross we re seeing of the products that we have introduced as electric to date we are seeing strong demand stronger than we had expected or put into our business plans which of course is a great sign i think what we re going to see going forward is that continued increase step by step of demand for electric products and of course we re working on a lot as we speak in electrification not just in access but in every single segment that we have and you see it like the pierce full tariff first ever electric fire truck and it s actually been on hundreds and hundreds of live runs and performing extremely well i mean this is going on all over our company we in the access segment we think that it will increase in demand at faster rates in certain regions of the world than others but it s going to increase in demand in all regions so in europe for example it tends to be increasing faster the demand for electrified product tends to be increasing a little faster than it is in the u s but we are doing it and very happy with what we re seeing in the u s as well so what i can tell you is that the demand for these products is real ross gilardi bank of america analyst all right and then just on fire emergency i mean you ve got the severe drought out west you ve got heightened forest fire risk all over the country is this contributing to the order growth you re seeing if not why not but i would think that would be a pretty material driver of your business john c pfeifer president and chief executive officer well recall that we do wildland firefighting vehicles but recall that most of our product is municipal fire apparatus aerial cumbers that type of product so i would suggest that for the most part it is not the driving factor of market improvement in fire emergency for us but there are some ancillary benefits because we have a small product line that does address wildlife fires and there s maybe certain traditional aerials and pumpers that are close to regions that are impacted by wildland fires that is pushing up some demand but for the most part that s not the demand driver for our product our demand driver is the aged fleet municipal flying new technology on their trucks that kind of thing is what s pushing demand on ross gilardi bank of america analyst got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from philip bose with raymond james please proceed with your question philip bose raymond james analyst hey good morning everybody i have a bit of a longer term question but john i know you ve mentioned aftermarket expansion as a key driver for you over call it a multiyear period i was hoping you could maybe expand on that commentary a little bit maybe which segments do you see the most opportunity going forward and whether or not we should think about that growth as being more organic or inorganically driven given your merchant dere balance sheet john c pfeifer president and chief executive officer yes i will tell you that it s a focus across the entire enterprise number one in all of our businesses i think you ll see the biggest areas of focus in our more commercial oriented segments particularly our access segment our commercial specialty vehicles segment we have plans both organically to serve the market and grow the market for our product but we also have inorganic opportunities that we re looking at to drive an increased participation in parts of the aftermarket that we don t participate in today so it really is on both fronts we want to increase the percentage of sales that are aftermarket driven because we believe this is an area that s really fundamentally important to our customers the fleet owners and important to the end user of the product and we want to continue to make investments where it s ultimately going to support them better and it s healthy for our company it s very less cyclical revenue streams and a lot of positives that come from it but that s what i can tell you about it philip bose raymond james analyst got it and then just a quick follow up on the volterra fire truck curious if you could maybe expand a little bit on the feedback you ve gotten so far or maybe what other customers have said after the rollout or the announcement john c pfeifer president and chief executive officer yes the feedback has been phenomenal the truck has performed incredibly well as i mentioned in my opening comments hundreds of gallons of diesel fuel savings on one truck you can imagine as we continue to roll this out how much environmental benefit there is and there s a huge cost benefit for the fire departments as well the fire truck itself functions we ve spent decades perfecting the performance of an aerial or a pumper where it meets the needs of the firefighter where they can be really really productive on a site and they can be really safe on a site so what we did was when we designed this product our people at f e were we re brilliant with paying attention to the fire fighter themselves we didn t want to change the functionality of the product because they like the functionality of the product we wanted to change the propulsion which improves the performance of the vehicle improves the total cost of ownership of the vehicle and improves the environmental sustainability of the vehicle and that s what we did but the early returns are fantastic on this product they re really a great step forward for our peers business philip bose raymond james analyst thank you appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from ann duignan with jpmorgan please proceed with your question ann duignan jpmorgan analyst thank you most of my questions have been answered but i just wanted to take a step back on fire emergency and asked one of the earlier questions slightly differently as we look at the transition of the population from urban locations to more rural locations and we read about it every day i wonder if this has been the bigger driver of demand for fire trucks as some of these smaller communities all around the country are expanding and growing and then have to support larger populations and in that context could you just remind us what were the sales of fire trucks at the peak of the last cycle and is there a possibility that we could reach a higher peak mix i can just given the expansion we re seeing around the country michael e pack executive vice president and chief financial officer and just from a sizing perspective we were about this segment in total is about a billion segment so we re not vastly off of what our peak revenue was in the segment now if you look at prior peak total market size of fire apparatus and this really goes back before the great recession it was a market that was in the low 5 000 units per year it s really not never recovered from that level it s sort of hovered around the mid 4 500 unit range so just as we look going forward i think one of the big drivers number one is aged lease we need to continue to replace those our customers need to continue to upgrade their fleets for that average fleet age is up in the 14 15 years right now which is getting up there so that s going to continue to be a tailwind and of course the other piece of it is as you have expansion into other communities that s going to drive property tax base more properties that really is going to drive demand as well so ultimately there s some there are some tailwinds obviously it s great that municipality has been more resilient through the pandemic so we ll continue to watch as that demand continues to evolve of course municipalities do have some headwinds on the pension front and so on so there s some gives and takes with it but overall we like the outlook for that market john c pfeifer president and chief executive officer but ann this is john i will just say your initial comment about migration to suburban and or rural areas i think that that if that continues that trend that will certainly be beneficial to the f e to the fire emergency market i think right now it s a little too early to tell whether that has any impact at all on the current really healthy rates of orders and backlog i think it s probably does not yet but if it continues i think you re absolutely right i think it s probably very positive but we need to wait another year or so to really kind of see what s happening with that ann duignan jpmorgan analyst okay i leave it there thank you operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the floor back over to john pfeifer for any closing comments john c pfeifer president and chief executive officer hey thanks everyone for joining us we are delighted with the business performance and the trajectory of our business we welcome you to join us this september when we have our analyst day we re going to give you more detail a little bit more clarity on what we see a little bit longer term in our business we ll give you up close view of some exciting new products some of which we ve talked about today and so i

across the us of whom 217 were randomized 1 1 and received either standard of care alone or standard of care plus 2 intravenous infusions of remestemcel l at a dose of 2 million cells kg 3 5 days apart this was the same remestemcel l dosing regimen used in the earlier compassionate use program where 11 of 12 patients were younger than 65 and 75 successfully came off ventilatory support the trial was halted in december 2020 after the data safety monitoring board dsmb performed a third interim analysis on the trial s first 180 patients noting that the trial was not likely to meet the 30 day mortality reduction endpoint at the planned 300 patient enrolment the trial was powered to achieve a primary endpoint of 43 reduction in mortality at 30 days for treatment with remestemcel l on top of maximal care the dsmb recommended that the trial complete with the enrolled 222 patients and that all be followed up as planned at follow up through day 60 remestemcel l reduced overall mortality by 14 across the entire population of treated patients n 217 and by 46 in the pre specified population of patients under age 65 n 123 in an exploratory analysis through day 60 remestemcel l

included in filings we make with the securities and exchange commission from time to time including the section titled risk factors in our most recent forms 20 f and 6 k reporting our quarterly results these documents are available on the sec filings section of the investor relations section of our website at about non ifrs financial measures our reported results and financial targets include certain non ifrs financial measures including non ifrs gross profit non ifrs operating income non ifrs net income non ifrs net income per diluted share and free cash flow management believes that the use of these non ifrs financial measures provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance facilitates period to period comparisons of our results of operations and also facilitates comparisons with peer companies many of which use similar non ifrs or non gaap financial measures to supplement their ifrs or gaap results non ifrs results are presented for supplemental informational purposes only to aid in understanding our results of operations the non ifrs results should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with ifrs and may be different from non ifrs or non gaap measures used by other companies our non ifrs financial measures include non ifrs gross profit excludes expenses related to share based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets non ifrs operating income excludes expenses related to share based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets non ifrs net income and non ifrs net income per diluted share excludes expenses related to share based compensation amortization of acquired intangible assets non coupon impact related to 4 exchangeable senior notes and capped calls the related income tax effects on these items and a discrete tax impact resulting from a non recurring transaction free cash flow free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures which consists of purchases of property and equipment and payments of lease obligations our non ifrs financial measures reflect adjustments based on the items below share based compensation amortization of acquired intangible assets non coupon impact related to exchangeable senior notes and capped calls amortization of notes discount and issuance costs mark to fair value of the exchangeable senior notes exchange feature mark to fair value of the related capped call transactions net loss on settlements of exchangeable senior notes and capped call transactions the related income tax effects on these items and a discrete tax impact resulting from a non recurring transaction purchases of property and equipment and payments of lease obligations we exclude expenses related to share based compensation amortization of acquired intangible assets non coupon impact related to exchangeable senior notes and capped calls the related income tax effects on these items and a discrete tax impact resulting from a non recurring transaction from certain of our non ifrs financial measures as we believe this helps investors understand our operational performance in addition share based compensation expense can be difficult to predict and varies from period to period and company to company due to differing valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments as well as changes in stock price management believes that providing non ifrs financial measures that exclude share based compensation expense amortization of acquired intangible assets non coupon impact related to exchangeable senior notes and capped calls the related income tax effects on these items and a discrete tax impact resulting from a non recurring transaction allow for more meaningful comparisons between our results of operations from period to period management considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic opportunities including investing in our business making strategic acquisitions and strengthening our statement of financial position management uses non ifrs gross profit non ifrs operating income non ifrs net income non ifrs net income per diluted share and free cash flow as measures of operating performance because these financial measures do not include the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations for planning purposes including the preparation of our annual operating budget to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies in communications with our board of directors and investors concerning our financial performance the tables in this press release titled reconciliation of ifrs to non ifrs results and reconciliation of ifrs to non ifrs financial targets provide reconciliations of non ifrs financial measures to the most recent directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with ifrs we understand that although non ifrs gross profit non ifrs operating income non ifrs net income non ifrs net income per diluted share and free cash flow are frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluation of companies these measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results of operations

believes these non gaap financial measures provide investors with relevant period to period comparisons of core operations however they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap now i d like to turn the call over to michael michael d burger corporate thank you mike good morning welcome to our call demand for our products in the second quarter reflected a return to a seasonal growth following the typically soft first quarter on a geographic basis the asia pacific market and in particular china performed well while u s and europe markets continue to recover albeit at a slower pace with the second quarter improvement across our served markets we continue to believe the demand environment will improve throughout 2021 as our customers activities normalize taken together with our ongoing flow of new product introductions we believe year end demand levels will be similar to those experienced in the fourth quarter of 2019 that said we remain cautious as market uncertainties such as the continuing softness in commercial construction starts the prioritization of capacity expansion over quality control initiatives and the ongoing steps local governments take to combat the pandemic may adversely impact the ultimate slope and the timing of our recovery we remain focused on laying the foundation for expanding the breadth and depth of our product offerings while streamlining our operations to continue to capture the long term opportunities ahead as discussed in our prior calls faro is in the process of transitioning to a marketing led organization focus on understanding our customers problems and delivering hardware and software solutions to meet their needs as an example of these efforts an example of this effort could be found in our recently announced quantum max scanarm solution quantum max was conceived by identifying our customers need for both speed and accuracy as a result we have developed an advanced portable measurement solution which features three purpose built hot swappable laser line probes each of which offer distinct advantages for specific use cases the xr probe provides 30 better accuracy and resolution for high precision measurement tasks the xs increases scanning speeds by over 65 and the versatile xp offers a balance of the xr s resolution and the xs s speed unlike prior physical arm solutions the quantum max allows customers to swap laser heads on the plot creating a versatile tool which meets a wide spectrum of speed accuracy and resolution needs in a single solution this unique solution results in the productivity and value increase of over 30 compared to prior generation devices another critical component the scanarm solution was the launch of our latest version of cam2 a metrology software which greatly improves scanning with our new laser probes through the combination of our new arm probes and the latest software we believe we ve set a new standard in the industry from metrology grade measurement solutions while we continue to introduce new solutions throughout the year it s worth highlighting that between launching a workflow solution and generating meaningful revenue takes time that said we are very encouraged by our recent customer feedback in addition to our internal product development roadmaps we continue to expand the breadth of our offerings through acquisitions building off last year s ats acquisition which focused on high precision digital twin applications in the second quarter we expanded our capabilities with the acquisition of holobuilder a leading photogrammetry based 3d platform which delivers hardware agnostic image capture registration and viewing with an initial focus on construction management holobuilder s platform provides general contractors a solution to efficiently capture and virtually manage construction progress using off the shelf panoramic cameras holobuilder s saas platform adds a fast and easy reality capture photo documentation and remote access capability to faro s highly accurate 3d point cloud based laser scanning to create the industry s first end to end digital twin solution the combined solution will provide a comprehensive scanning and image management capabilities for the digital twin market aimed at robotic assembly simulation construction management facilities operations and management and incident pre planning in the public safety market ultimately these digital twin capabilities will be brought into our soon to be announced cloud based solution which we call faro sphere with this underlying subscription model representing faro s future long term software go to market shifting to operations two weeks ago we announced the signing of an agreement to outsource our manufacturing to sanmina corporation as the next step in our business transformation we plan to transition faro production from three manufacturing sites in lake mary florida exton pennsylvania and stuttgart germany to sanmina facility based in thailand following a rigorous selection process chose sanmina as our partner based upon their proven ability to deliver quality products on the required timelines together we are very confident in our ability to meet our customers demand throughout this transition process once complete our new operational model greatly simplifies operations reduces cost and allows our management team to focus on the development and sale of differentiated solutions to customers in our target markets allen will discuss the financial impact of these changes in the few minutes taken together these actions form the basis of our strategic transition namely developing a deep understanding of our customer workflows which allow us to further differentiate our capabilities in the marketplace while at the same time placing a solid operating structure in place to ensure incremental top line growth translates to greater operating leverage and higher shareholder value over the time finally we announced the election of two new members to our board of directors as previously disclosed the key element of enabling our successful transformation is ensuring that we maintain the right experience on our board to help guidance i am particularly pleased with the addition of moonhie chin and alex davern to the faro board each have demonstrated success in leading hardware and cloud based software businesses at markets that are closely aligned with our strategic direction i very much look forward to their contributions as they officially join us on october 1st with that i ll turn the call over to allen for an overview of our second quarter financial results allen muhich corporate thank you michael and good morning everyone second quarter revenue of 82 1 million grew 36 when compared to the second quarter of 2020 as a result of continuing market demand improvement compared to last year s market softness caused by the pandemic product revenue of 60 3 million was up 43 and service revenue of 21 8 million was up 19 bookings of 88 2 million grew 44 year over year and were slightly ahead of revenue in the quarter signaling a modest building of backlog gaap gross margin was 55 4 and non gaap gross margin was 55 7 for the second quarter of 2021 gross margin increased year over year and sequentially largely due to volume increases versus prior periods our second quarter material costs did not reflect inflationary pressures prevalent in today s market that said we do anticipate material cost headwinds to modestly impact gross margins in the near term gaap operating expenses were 46 1 million and included approximately 3 6 million in acquisition related intangible amortization and stock compensation expenses and 800 000 restructuring costs non gaap operating expense of 41 8 million was 4 1million higher than q2 of 2020 as we continue to increase our software investments and is a portion of the travel related expense savings realized during the pandemic began to return gaap operating loss was 700 000 for the second quarter of 2021 compared with an operating loss of 12 million for the second quarter of 2020 primarily due to lower volumes in the prior year period non gaap operating income was 3 9 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to an 8 1 million loss in the second quarter of 2020 adjusted ebitda was 6 5 million or approximately 8 of revenue our gaap net loss was 1 2 million or 0 06 per share non gaap net income was 2 2 million or 0 12 per share for the second quarter of 2021 compared to a non gaap net loss of 0 36 per share in q2 2020 we continue to maintain a strong capital structure with a cash balance of 133 million and no debt the second quarter decrease in cash was primarily a result of the acquisition of holobuilder for which we paid 34 million in cash with the addition of holobuilder and ongoing investments in our core software platform our quarterly non gaap operating expense is expected to increase to a mid 40 million run rate as a result to achieve our target model of 20 ebitda margins our quarterly revenue level has increased to 110 million versus the 100 million objective previously set given the long term opportunities within the digital twin market we believe these are the right investments to ensure future growth offsetting the spend over the mid term we recently announced our plans to consolidate and outsource our manufacturing despite transition to sanmina is expected to be completed over the next 12 months and result in approximately 12 million in annualized labor and material savings when complete we believe the expected savings will have a negligible impact on 2021 followed by steady improvement through 2022 with the full benefit to be realized in the first quarter of 2023 the company expects to incur a cash charge of approximately 6 million in the second half of 2021 primarily consisting of cash severance total pre tax charges of 15 million to 20 million are expected through the first half of 2022 when including the impact of facility and other asset write down with these charges the company expects it will fully realize the 75 million to 85 million in restructuring charges announced in february 2020 we re pleased in the continued end market demand improvements and the organic and inorganic progress we re making toward realizing our strategic vision of hardware software solutions that solve our customers real world problems in a cloud based environment with the addition of holobuilder our end to end solution for digital twin management positions us well to capitalize on this large and growing market we have line of sight to completing the transformation of our cost structure with our new manufacturing partner sanmina lastly we remain committed to the achievement of our financial success model which is a reminder to achieve 55 to 60 gross margin with 40 to 43 operating expense resulting in 20 adjusted ebitda that we expect will be realized with approximately 110 million in quarterly revenue we look forward to reporting our continued progress in the coming quarters this concludes our prepared remarks and at this time we d be pleased to take any of your questions questions and answers operator we ll take our first question from greg palm from craig hallum capital your line is open please go ahead greg palm craig hallum capital group llc analyst yeah thanks good morning everyone i guess just starting off with the orders it looks like orders outpaced revenue by a decent amount in the quarter so was there anything supply chain related or was that just simply orders received late in the quarter that weren t able to ship just kind of curious if you re seeing any kind of supply chain related logistics issues out there michael d burger corporate yeah we ve experienced some yeah the order rate was back end loaded for the quarter and so we ended up basically pushing some of the booking over into q3 it s hard to say if that was really supply chain related from a customer perspective but we didn t we ve seen some logistics issues throughout the quarter but it really didn t impact the end of quarter revenue it was more around when we actually receive the order greg palm craig hallum capital group llc analyst okay makes sense and allen i think you said something about elevated material costs i don t know if that was an impact at all in the june quarter but how should we be thinking about that impact going forward allen muhich corporate yeah greg good question not much of an impact in the second quarter we do expect to see some material increases in the third quarter that said we do have some opportunity to be able to pass those along to our customers and so as i indicated in our prepared remarks we would expect some modest impact to our gross margins here over the near term depending upon it ultimately how the length and duration and depth and changes of these material cost but again at this point in time we think it s relatively modest but maybe a little bit more toward the lower end of the range versus the middle of the range which is where we ve been operating greg palm craig hallum capital group llc analyst okay got it and then in terms of the kind of increasing opex some of the investments i think most of us understand what the opportunity is but maybe for those that don t can you just go in a little bit more detail on sort of the excitement and opportunity around digital twin because it certainly seems like a kind of a theme that lots and lots of companies are starting to talk about michael d burger corporate yeah i think digital twin is a manifestation of i think many of our customers desire to plan both facility changes or facility layouts or in some cases in public safety pre incident planning to be able to actually have a very accurate model in a virtual environment that allows you to plan and i think the better you plan the less waste and i think we all know in the construction space and frankly running factories one of the biggest issue you have is how do you minimize waste and digital twin is becoming a catch all if you will and digital twin means different things to different people but our digital twin is a physical representation of the space and the ability to take that space and is close to accurate as close to the truth as you can and then change it virtually and plan all in the context of reducing waste it seems that it is to your point a kind of a catch all but definitely it s a conversation we re having with a lot of customers a lot of customers that we didn t really anticipate having that conversation with greg palm craig hallum capital group llc analyst got it it s interesting and then just last one so the ebitda 20 run rate with the revenue increasing to 110 million to achieve that what would that number look like if you were to be able to capture all of the savings from the manufacturing outsourcing would that number be closer to the number that you ve been alluding to in the past just sort of curious how that will affect that number once those are those costs are fully realized michael d burger corporate yeah it s a very good question and i think that the timing and you picked up on the new ones right the timing difference between the expenses coming on with the holobuilder acquisition versus our ability to be able to realize the savings with our outsource manufacturing does cause over the next call it 12 to 18 months an adverse impact on our model i do think that there is a path toward getting to that 20 ebitda on the lower revenue number or at the higher revenue number over achieving the 20 but we re not ready to commit to that just yet greg palm craig hallum capital group llc analyst okay fair enough all right thanks for the help best of luck going forward michael d burger corporate thanks greg allen muhich corporate thanks greg operator our next question comes from james ricchiuti from needham company your line is open please go ahead james ricchiuti needham company analyst hi good morning michael d burger corporate good morning james james ricchiuti needham company analyst question is just about the seasonality that you re seeing you normally experience in this quarter i m wondering if there s anything that you ve seen in the first month and that may not be a fair question just given how back end loaded typically the quarters are but is there anything that you re seeing that you might be able to share with us that give us a little better sense to have the momentum might be entering q3 michael d burger corporate actually we ve started q3 pretty in typical fashion as we have probably most quarters we re typically back end loaded within the quarter and i think the concern that we all have around q3 is typically the vacation the broad based vacations that our customers are experiencing in europe which typically starts in august so the first part of the quarter is kind of as expected but again we re not really we traditionally see august kind of take a sideways step and that s borne out in our history q2 to q3 over the last several years so i think started off pretty normal and we re anxious to see how august stacks up james ricchiuti needham company analyst okay on the transition to sanmina allen maybe this question for you is there any reason why as this process really gets going you would not see some or be able to realize some sort of supply chain benefits just from some of their buying tower i know you were talking about seeing opportunities in 22 gradually over the course of the year but i m wondering how to think about just some of the supply chain benefits at what point they maybe perhaps take a more active role on that side of the business allen muhich corporate yeah it s a good question and again i think as we ve articulated the savings opportunity we have indicated that there is both a labor and a material component as everybody knows our manufacturing has been centered in a couple of locations in the u s and one in germany and the supply chains for those manufacturing are localized to those facilities so as we move more toward sanmina thailand based facility there is an opportunity absolutely to enhance the supply chain from a cost standpoint at the same time leverage sanmina s purchasing power so we do think that there is an opportunity for decreased material cost savings as time goes by and that s built into the numbers that we ve been talking about jim james ricchiuti needham company analyst okay but ahead of the move to thailand you really need to be there with them before you re really able to realize some of that buying the purchasing power that they have allen muhich corporate i think that s correct michael d burger corporate i would say from a cost perspective correct but sanmina has already begun to help us in some of the hard to source materials they ve helped us in advance of actually the announcement in anticipation thereof they have been a big help so we re excited about what we think they can do maybe not short term in terms of better pricing on materials but really access to materials james ricchiuti needham company analyst got it and then just a question on the initiatives you have underway to build out the recurring revenue on the software side are there similar deals out there to holobuilder that you see which areas actually hold the most interest per year michael d burger corporate i think we are having the ability to actually capture whatever the truth is and the truth is the actual measurement we there are technologies out there that we re looking at nothing that s burning a hole in our pocket at this juncture but there is a quite a few companies that are kind of getting into this space if you will from a software perspective or a algorithm perspective that speeds up either our processing or as in holobuilder s case adds a completely different technology that we didn t really have commercially so we re looking at all of those jim but again there is nothing burning a hole in our pocket right now james ricchiuti needham company analyst okay and sphere on track when should we think about this launching and how should we think about it looking out to next year michael d burger corporate q4 is our current schedule and i think as i ve said i think it will be a slow ramp from a revenue perspective as we sign up subscribers so i would expect very much to probably toward the end of 2022 where we can actually start pointing to i think meaningful revenue impact that said coincident with the launch of sphere we will begin to break out our recurring revenue for you guys so that we re talking about it and you can track us on it james ricchiuti needham company analyst okay good all right thanks a lot michael d burger corporate thanks jim allen muhich corporate thanks jim operator we will take our next question from andrew degasperi from berenberg capital your line is open please go ahead andrew degasperi berenberg capital markets llc analyst thanks good morning mike and allen michael d burger corporate good morning andrew allen muhich corporate good morning andrew degasperi berenberg capital markets llc analyst i had a quick one on holobuilder i know you said in the past when you announced the acquisition that was generating 4 million or so of revenue per year and it s growing on a compounded annual basis at 75 of 2019 just curious to know like with the integration should we expect that high level of growth to continue if not even accelerate as you potentially look at other use cases for that asset michael d burger corporate we expect the growth rate to continue on its current trajectory i don t think we re planning on talking about accelerating that at this point it s early days for us we ve had it under our belt here for just about six weeks so we re still learning from them we re very excited by what they offer and we re extremely excited by the feedback that we re getting from their customer base which we have some overlap but frankly they brought a different customer base to us so the feedback that we re getting is fantastic so we believe that we should be able to continue the growth rate that they ve already experienced andrew degasperi berenberg capital markets llc analyst that s helpful and i guess when it comes to the q4 revenue number i think that that s the quarter that you expect to actually reach back to what we consider a normalized rate is that still kind of that plan based on what you re seeing in the market or should has that changed at all would you think that the issues that you mentioned earlier eventually localized may impact that michael d burger corporate well i think we re optimistic i think we ve said publicly we re not really giving guidance but what we said is we would be disappointed if we weren t back at those levels i don t think things have fundamentally changed with perhaps the supply chain shortages and supply chain shortages may not necessarily affect our ability to ship product but more our customers ability for them to ship their products and therefore maybe damp in their appetite to buy capital that s our concern the supply chain situation is real and while i don t see it coming to an end in the next quarter or two our sales force is very optimistic about customer demand in general and as we said in our script our new products are really beginning to gain traction so everything has headed the right direction it s just it s been a crazy year so we re just we re just we re cautiously optimistic how is that andrew degasperi berenberg capital markets llc analyst that s helpful and then i guess the last one i have and just a follow up to jim s question in terms of the sanmina i guess transition to better supply chain like i said from a materials perspective than what you would have had with your own three sites michael d burger corporate absolutely and i think allen alluded to faro had not really integrated many of the supply chains that weren t attached to each of the factories each of our factories and as a result we weren t really even internally gaining any buying power if you will by consolidating our internal demand by transitioning to sanmina not only do we get their manufacturing expertise but we actually get to leverage their supply chain and as i mentioned to jim we ve already seen some benefit of that even prior to the announcement in helping us source some hard to get material so we re very confident that they ll be able to help us on the supply chain side in this environment however where supply is really tight you re really not talking about getting price reduction you re more talking about getting access to materials and that s where sanmina has helped us short term i think long term they should be able to help us with cost and the way our contracts are written they are very motivated to help us with cost it is a big part of the of their business model and that industries business model so we re very i think we re very fortunate to have sanmina and we re looking forward to a streamlined and probably healthier supply chain than we currently have andrew degasperi berenberg capital markets llc analyst great thank you michael d burger corporate you re welcome thank you operator we ll take our next question from rob mason from baird your line is open please go ahead rob mason baird analyst yes good morning michael d burger corporate good morning allen muhich corporate good morning rob mason baird analyst michael if you think about where your targets may reside for getting back to these 2019 levels by the fourth quarter i m just curious in terms of your sales force and its productivity level how much capacity does the existing sales force have beyond that level or do we need to consider adding more resources once you get get back to call it 100 million a quarter or type revenue level michael d burger corporate we don t believe that we need to add sales to get to the 100 million and we re feeling really good about our productivity metrics of our selling organization as we kind of come out of the covid situation i don t anticipate that we would need to add any dramatic resource much beyond i would say probably 130 million to 140 million a quarter so i think we ve got a lot of gas in the tank if you will with our current sales force it s the demand environment that has precluded us from getting to those levels i don t believe it s the number of sales people rob mason baird analyst okay just on that point i mean could you offer some perspective on how you re seeing the 3d metrology versus your aec markets perform as you came through the second quarter and into the third any distinctions either by geography or again between those two key markets that you d call out michael d burger corporate yeah we ve seen the automotive space recover a bit which is very encouraging 3d metrology in asia i think we ve been underserved in that market and so we ve seen a really nice gain if you will particularly in china in 3d led by 3d metrology i think north america other than automotive has been slower than we d hoped particularly in some of the smaller machine shops which provide a long tail in terms of the number of customers that we have so it looks like the big guys are buying again maybe not at the rates they were but they are buying again which is super encouraging in europe we ve seen 3d metrology bounce along we haven t seen a huge recovery yet and we re hopeful that we ll be a driver for q4 so summarizing 3d metrology in general has been slower than for example in 2019 but we re seeing nice signs of recovery rob mason baird analyst just within aec you had made a reference to commercial construction starts is that still maybe the trigger point for uptake on the aec product is the new starts comes at the front end michael d burger corporate we believe so many of our customers actually buy capital based on the projects that they are actually working on so they actually bill out or charge against the project some of the equipment cost that they buy from us and so as new project start there is an opportunity for us to actually add equipment but it s been relatively slow particularly in commercial we don t really participate as a company much on the residential side that s changing albeit it s relatively small so really the commercial starts is really kind of i think should be the bellwether for us rob mason baird analyst okay very good thank you michael d burger corporate hey congratulations on your new position rob mason baird analyst thank you operator it appears that we have no further questions at this time i will now turn the program back over to michael burger michael d burger corporate well we re excited we re very pleased with where we are in terms of momentum and we re making a lot of progress to our stated plans so we appreciate everyone s interest and look forward to giving you an update next quarter thank you operator duration 34 minutes call participants michael funari corporate michael d burger corporate allen muhich corporate greg palm craig

new york nyt news service chloe gordon a 32 year old filmmaker describes herself as a person who somewhat ironically engages with the work of novelist dan brown she has read all but one of the eight books brown has published under his name so when she stumbled upon an internet rumor that identified brown as the author of a tongue in cheek dating guide from 1995 called 187 men to avoid a survival guide for the romantically frustrated woman she immediately ordered it on amazon the 96 page novelty book originally published under the name danielle brown promised very short descriptions of men the author considered unsuitable romantic partners a book of red flags if you will men who think lamaze is a famous french car race for example men who decoupage men with pet rocks but when she opened her mail gordon realized that the wrong book had arrived heretics of dune a 1984 science fiction novel by frank herbert she forgot about it for a year or so and then went on amazon and ordered the book again this time she received elizabeth taylor s 1988 dieting memoir elizabeth takes off having struck out twice on amazon gordon tried ebay she paid a seller for the book and a few days later received a refund and an email explaining that the book did not exist in the seller s inventory she ordered a copy from a different seller this order too was canceled and refunded gordon who lives in california did not give up she ordered the book on abebooks a subsidiary of amazon once again she did not receive 187 men to avoid but this time the ghost light by fritz leiber she began to anticipate receiving wrong books on july 19 she filmed herself opening her most recent amazon package which turned out to be a copy of bill cosby s 1992 musings on youth childhood and posted it on twitter oh no she groans this is worse it s getting worse this breaks my brain every day gordon said by telephone on the afternoon her unsolicited copy of cosby s book arrived every book she received appeared to have the same bar code printed on its cover and most of the books back covers featured an additional stick on label from their resellers insistently identifying them as 187 men to avoid every label was patently untrue and why did the error appear to extend to every independent secondhand seller too i still to this day i have no proof that this book is real or exists gordon said information about the slim square shaped book is difficult to come by but both the original 1995 edition and a berkley trade reprint published in 2006 are listed in various places online the covers are almost identical a pigeon toed blond cartoon woman in a cherry red coat and floppy hat clutches herself protectively as she stands before a large assembly of suited men the 2006 reprint amends the cover text to read early humor from the author of the da vinci code and recasts the author as dan brown formerly writing as danielle brown data from npd bookscan which has tracked book sales data since the early 2000s shows that the 2006 edition sold about 1 200 copies gordon began to entertain conspiracy theories including about the possible existence of a person at some warehouse somewhere that s putting the wrong bar code on everything but what would be a warehouse employee s motivations for falsifying stock numbers of an obscure out of print dating humor book from 1995 there s not really a version of this that totally makes sense gordon said if i m using my dan brown brain it s obviously dan brown putting the bar codes on fake books so that no one ever sees this really embarrassing book that he wrote in the 90s proof of existence in 1995 the year 187 men to avoid was published brown was working as a high school english teacher at his alma mater phillips exeter academy in new hampshire and he had begun writing his first novel the thriller digital fortress his circumstances overlapped neatly with the author bio of 187 men to avoid danielle brown currently lives in new england teaching school writing books and avoiding men in lisa rogak s second unauthorized biography of brown dan brown the unauthorized biography a 2013 follow up to the man behind the da vinci code an unauthorized biography of dan brown published in 2005 rogak an exhaustive if often unsanctioned chronicler of celebrities lives wrote that brown had written 187 men to avoid with his future ex wife blythe brown according to rogak the couple who were not yet married at the time 187 men to avoid was published had found inspiration for the book in the ludicrous characters and dating and mating methods of the men and women they had witnessed while living in los angeles rogak s research also turned up a rare public acknowledgment from brown of 187 men to avoid given in an interview about his novel angels and demons which was published in 2000 the interview which was published on the book review cafe a defunct website includes this quotation from brown yes i did write a book before digital fortress it was a silly little humor book whose title will forever remain a secret the book i believe is now out of print rightly so brown s publisher said he was unavailable for comment for this article a publicist for brown said she was also unavailable for comment despite brown s wish for secrecy 187 men to avoid has been a detail on his wikipedia page since january 2006 also on artdaily zalika souley doyenne of african cinema dies at 74 it was added there by elonka dunin a cryptographer and management consultant dunin who has made tens of thousands of edits to wikipedia articles is an acquaintance of brown s in a phone interview she said she met him as a result of a 2003 contest advertised on danbrown com entrants who solved a series of puzzles incorporated into the book s dust jacket would be eligible to win a free trip for two to paris where much of the novel takes place two of the puzzles on the dust jacket related to kryptos a sculpture by artist jim sanborn that is at the headquarters of the cia in langley virginia the artwork incorporates four encoded messages one of which remains unsolved dunin is known as an expert on the sculpture which is famous among puzzle solving enthusiasts he wanted to chat with me about kryptos since he was going to be talking about it the next morning on good morning america dunin said dunin said she stayed in touch with brown after their conversation and later corresponded with him to confirm biographical information while expanding his wikipedia page her best guess is that she learned of the existence of 187 men to avoid from searching brown s name in a library catalog she often checks library of congress records for reference she said a search for dan brown in the library s online catalog turns up a hit for 187 men to avoid and categorizes it under the heading mate selection humor to err is human we can say then that 187 men to avoid a survival guide for the romantically frustrated woman is the work of dan brown and possibly to some degree blythe brown now his former wife but then his future wife the extent to which blythe brown was a collaborator on dan brown s books has been a matter of much litigation but the identity of the book s author does not itself explain why gordon received so many other books that are being sold online under its title the book gordon received from her first purchase attempt came from a company called zbk books an amazon reseller that operates out of three northern new jersey facilities reached by phone the owner of zbk books shirzad zarei was apologetic about the mix up he was also confident he could explain how it had happened the mystery he said was most likely set in motion the first time someone anywhere listed 187 men to avoid for resale online like the secrets of leonardo da vinci as imagined and explicated by brown this issue stemmed from a code hidden in plain sight the book s bar code bar codes help businesses track inventory and sales in the case of books the bar code is a graphical representation of a numerical sequence called an international standard book number or isbn different combinations of 13 digits that identify published books including alternate versions of themselves hardcover editions of the da vinci code have a different isbn than paperbacks for instance when a book is listed for online resale for the first time the data the seller enters about the title can become the default information generated for all future scans of its unique isbn if other sellers subsequently notice an error they can report the listing as incorrect the first person that tried to sell it used probably just entered some wrong information zarei said of 187 men to avoid because unaffiliated resellers are working from the same shared book data zarei said if one of us is making the error everyone is making it a glitch in the matrix while zarei was able to explain how the error had flourished like a weed in the online book reselling ecosystem he could not determine the basic question of its existence why had so many books been printed with what appeared to be the exact same bar code that s certainly not what we would call best practice said brian o leary the executive director of the book industry study group a publishing trade association although the books mailed to gordon were as unalike as members of the nightshade family close inspection turned up trace similarities all of the books were published between 1984 and 1995 all were published by g p putnam s sons or its paperback affiliate at the time berkley books the common lineage led o leary to speculate that the reused bar codes may have been the result of a production problem at the publisher level for instance o leary said when you re laying out a book and you put the cover together for the first time you may not know the isbn perhaps he said someone had inserted a dummy bar code and isbn so that say the publisher and art director could see what the finished product would look like if so it may have been the case that they sometimes forgot to later swap out the dummy elements for the real ones or perhaps they remembered but only halfway bar codes were still gaining popularity in the 1980s after all a representative for penguin random house said the publisher was unable to pinpoint any employees who felt they had the proper insight to answer questions about this instance of bar code confusion it s virtually impossible to know how many books have this particular bar code according to o leary in other words if gordon sticks to her current strategy there is no way to know how many online orders for 187 men to avoid she will have to place before she receives the correct item it s possible none of the sellers will ever possess this book again despite what their internal records show still she remains optimistic that she will acquire it eventually i have to stay positive she said i m going to get this book if i have to go to new hampshire and pry it out of dan brown s hands this article originally appeared in chloe gordon a 32 year old filmmaker describes herself as a person who somewhat ironically engages with the work of

print dating humor book from 1995 there s not really a version of this that totally makes sense gordon said if i m using my dan brown brain it s obviously dan brown putting the bar codes on fake books so that no one ever sees this really embarrassing book that he wrote in the 90s in 1995 the year 187 men to avoid was published brown was working as a high school english teacher at his alma mater phillips exeter academy in new hampshire and he had begun writing his first novel the thriller digital fortress his circumstances overlapped neatly with the author bio of 187 men to avoid danielle brown currently lives in new england teaching school writing books and avoiding men in lisa rogak s second unauthorized biography of brown dan brown the unauthorized biography a 2013 follow up to the man behind the da vinci code an unauthorized biography of dan brown published in 2005 rogak an exhaustive if often unsanctioned chronicler of celebrities lives wrote that brown had written 187 men to avoid with his future ex wife blythe brown according to rogak the couple who were not yet married at the time 187 men to avoid was published had found inspiration for the book in the ludicrous characters and dating and mating methods of the men and women they had witnessed while living in los angeles rogak s research also turned up a rare public acknowledgment from brown of 187 men to avoid given in an interview about his novel angels and demons which was published in 2000 the interview which was published on the book review cafe a defunct website includes this quotation from brown yes i did write a book before digital fortress it was a silly little humor book whose title will forever remain a secret the book i believe is now out of print rightly so brown s publisher said he was unavailable for comment for this article a publicist for brown said she was also unavailable for comment despite brown s wish for secrecy 187 men to avoid has been a detail on his wikipedia page since january 2006 it was added there by elonka dunin a cryptographer and management consultant dunin who has made tens of thousands of edits to wikipedia articles is an acquaintance of brown s in a phone interview she said she met him as a result of a 2003 contest advertised on danbrown com entrants who solved a series of puzzles incorporated into the book s dust jacket would be eligible to win a free trip for two to paris where much of the novel takes place two of the puzzles on the dust jacket related to kryptos a sculpture by artist jim sanborn that is at the headquarters of the cia in langley virginia the artwork incorporates four encoded messages one of which remains unsolved dunin is known as an expert on the sculpture which is famous among puzzle solving enthusiasts he wanted to chat with me about kryptos since he was going to be talking about it the next morning on good morning america dunin said dunin said she stayed in touch with brown after their conversation and later corresponded with him to confirm biographical information while expanding his wikipedia page her best guess is that she learned of the existence of 187 men to avoid from searching brown s name in a library catalog she often checks library of congress records for reference she said a search for dan brown in the library s online catalog turns up a hit for 187 men to avoid and categorizes it under the heading mate selection humor we can say then that 187 men to avoid a survival guide for the romantically frustrated woman is the work of dan brown and possibly to some degree blythe brown now his former wife but then his future wife the extent to which blythe brown was a collaborator on dan brown s books has been a matter of much litigation but the identity of the book s author does not itself explain why gordon received so many other books that are being sold online under its title the book gordon received from her first purchase attempt came from a company called zbk books an amazon reseller that operates out of three northern new jersey facilities reached by phone the owner of zbk books shirzad zarei was apologetic about the mix up he was also confident he could explain how it had happened the mystery he said was most likely set in motion the first time someone anywhere listed 187 men to avoid for resale online like the secrets of leonardo da vinci as imagined and explicated by brown this issue stemmed from a code hidden in plain sight the book s bar code bar codes help businesses track inventory and sales in the case of books the bar code is a graphical representation of a numerical sequence called an international standard book number or isbn different combinations of 13 digits that identify published books including alternate versions of themselves hardcover editions of the da vinci code have a different isbn than paperbacks for instance when a book is listed for online resale for the first time the data the seller enters about the title can become the default information generated for all future scans of its unique isbn if other sellers subsequently notice an error they can report the listing as incorrect the first person that tried to sell it used probably just entered some wrong information zarei said of 187 men to avoid because unaffiliated resellers are working from the same shared book data zarei said if one of us is making the error everyone is making it while zarei was able to explain how the error had flourished like a weed in the online book reselling ecosystem he could not determine the basic question of its existence why had so many books been printed with what appeared to be the exact same bar code that s certainly not what we would call best practice said brian o leary the executive director of the book industry study group a publishing trade association although the books mailed to gordon were as unalike as members of the nightshade family close inspection turned up trace similarities all of the books were published between 1984 and 1995 all were published by g p putnam s sons or its paperback affiliate at the time berkley books the common lineage led o leary to speculate that the reused bar codes may have been the result of a production problem at the publisher level for instance o leary said when you re laying out a book and you put the cover together for the first time you may not know the isbn perhaps he said someone had inserted a dummy bar code and isbn so that say the publisher and art director could see what the finished product would look like if so it may have been the case that they sometimes forgot to later swap out the dummy elements for the real ones or perhaps they remembered but only halfway bar codes were still gaining popularity in the 1980s after all a representative for penguin random house said the publisher was unable to pinpoint any employees who felt they had the proper insight to answer questions about this instance of bar code confusion it s virtually impossible to know how many books have this particular bar code according to o leary in other words if gordon sticks to her current strategy there is no way to know how many online orders for 187 men to avoid she will have to place before she receives the correct item it s possible none of the sellers will ever possess this book again despite what their internal records show still she remains optimistic that she will acquire it eventually i have to stay positive she said i m going to get this book if i have to go to new hampshire and pry it out of dan brown s hands this article originally

slides lastly relative to the ilim joint venture slide two provides context around the joint venture s financial information and statistical measures i will now turn the call over to mark sutton mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer thank you guillermo and good morning everyone we will begin our discussion on slide three international paper delivered solid earnings growth and strong cash generation in the second quarter we continue to see very strong demand for corrugated packaging and containerboard and solid demand for fluff pulp and in our papers business demand recovery accelerated in the second quarter across our key geographies we grew revenue by 15 as compared to the second quarter of last year with price realization accelerating in all of our business segments our mills and converting system performed well however we operated with extremely low containerboard inventory across our packaging network due to two facts the lingering effects of the winter storm in the first quarter and then our planned maintenance outages in the second quarter these operating conditions severely stressed along with severely stressed transportation environments adversely affected volume and operating costs in the second quarter input costs and freight were a significant headwind in just about every category i would call out the sharp rise in recovered fiber cost in north america and europe although it certainly had a significant cost impact it is another indication of the strong demand environment our ilim joint venture delivered outstanding performance with equity earnings of 101 million in the second quarter and a strong outlook as we move into the third quarter on capital allocation we re making significant progress strengthening our balance sheet in the second quarter we reduced debt by 796 million we also returned 258 million to our shareowners including 57 million of share repurchases during the second quarter we monetized our remaining stake in graphic packaging i m really pleased with the return on our investment we structured the transaction in 2018 maximized the value of the consumer packaging business for our shareholders looking ahead we re making excellent progress on the spinoff of our printing papers business which we expect to complete on october 1 across ip the team is doing an outstanding job managing complexity we remain diligent in applying covid 19 layers of protection for our employees and contractors and i really appreciate our team s commitment to execute well take care of each other and take care of our customers as we work together to build a better ip for our shareholders and really all of our stakeholders i m going to turn to slide four now which shows our second quarter results we delivered ebitda of 793 million and free cash flow of 633 million which brings our free cash flow generation to more than 1 billion for the first half of 2021 revenue increased by 750 million or 15 as compared to last year driven by higher average prices in our three businesses as well as volume growth in our packaging and paper businesses margins improved sequentially with price realization outpacing higher input and transportation costs we expect margins to expand meaningfully in the second half of the year as price realization outpaces rising input and transportation costs and importantly as we step down from our highest maintenance quarter of the year now i ll turn it over to tim who will cover our business performance as well as our third quarter outlook tim tim s nicholls senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you mark moving to the quarter over quarter earnings bridge on slide five second quarter operating earnings per share were 1 06 as compared to 0 76 in the first quarter price and mix improved by nearly 0 50 per share sequentially driven by very strong price realizations across all of our business segments volume was essentially flat versus last quarter demand for corrugated packaging is very strong and demand for fluff pulp is solid while demand for papers continues to recover in all key regions second quarter volume in our north american packaging business was constrained by severely low containerboard inventory and fluff pulp shipments were hampered by significant forward congestion our mills and converting system performed well operating costs were adversely impacted by a highly stressed supply chain environment for both our inbound materials and outbound shipments as well as the exceptionally low containerboard inventory conditions in our north america packaging system maintenance outage costs increased by 0 18 sequentially as we completed our highest maintenance outage quarter of the year on an absolute level maintenance costs were 250 million in the second quarter input costs were a significant headwind for most materials and energy costs remained elevated providing little relief following the winter storm occ represented about half of the sequential increase in input costs although some of the pressure in input costs could be transitory such as the impact of heavy rainfall on our wood cost in the gulf region the extremely tight transportation environment will continue to put pressure on all inbound materials every mode of transportation is tight and we expect them to remain tight as we move to the second half of the year corporate expenses benefited from favorable reserve adjustments our tax rate of 24 in the second quarter was sequentially lower primarily due to discrete period tax benefit and equity earnings improved substantially on very strong performance from ilim turning to the segments and starting with industrial packaging on slide six we continue to see strong demand across all channels including boxes sheets and containerboard as mark indicated we operated with extremely low containerboard inventory in the us system these conditions impacted volume and operating costs in the quarter we are working to replenish inventories following the winter storm and maintenance salvages as we manage through a tight transportation environment taking a look at our second quarter performance volume was sequentially flat strong demand in our north american box and containerboard channels offset lower seasonal demand in our emea business volume across our us channels grew by 10 as compared to last year which includes our us box system open market containerboard customers as well as our recent equity partnerships with strategic sheet feeders price and mix increased by about 110 million in the quarter we re making excellent progress on the realization of our barge increase our mills and converting systems performed well however operating costs were impacted by severely low containerboard inventories and stressed transportation environment with congestion across all modes maintenance outage costs increased sequentially as we completed the highest maintenance outage quarter of the year in our industrial packaging business we ve completed about 75 of our planned maintenance outages in the first half of the year income costs were a significant headwind in the quarter primarily driven by higher costs for occ chemicals and distribution about 10 million of the sequential increase in input costs occurred in our emea packaging business primarily for occ and energy taking a closer look at occ we consume about five million tons annually across our us mill system and spain we see the rise in occ cost as a reflection of the underlying strength in global demand for corrugated packaging we expect occ costs to rise further in the third quarter even as seasonal generation improves we expect continued us and export demand especially from india and southeast asia which were largely offsetting pre restriction occ exports to china turning to slide seven we re well positioned for strong earnings growth and margin expansion in our packaging business in the third and fourth quarter demand is strong across all of our channels we expect continued robust volume growth across our us channels and we are making excellent progress on the price realization of our margin increase our mills and box clients are positioned for strong second half performance following the impact of the winter storms and the significant maintenance outages in the second quarter replenishing our containerboard inventories will enable operational and supply chain efficiencies as we move through the second half of the year we do expect further input cost inflation in the third quarter with the substantial pressure on occ and transportation costs our teams are doing an admirable job managing costs in a tough environment we expect further opportunities to be more efficient as inventory in addition our commercial initiatives are outpacing cost pressure and position us for strong margin expansion in the second half of the year turning to global cellulose fibers on slide eight demand for fluff pulp is solid and the end use demand signal for absorbent hygiene products is healthy looking at our sequential earnings price and mix improved by 104 million in the second quarter with price realization accelerating across all regions and segments as expected volume was moderately lower due to significant us port congestion and frequent vessel schedule changes which delayed our shipments mill performance was strong however operating costs were impacted by the tight supply chain environment we expect these conditions to continue in the third quarter maintenance outage costs decreased as expected and input costs were moderately higher with lower wood cost in the mid atlantic region offset by higher chemical and energy costs turning to printing papers on slide nine our papers business delivered earnings of 76 million in the second quarter with continued strong cash generation our printing papers business carries strong momentum as we approach the spinoff on october one and then continues to recover in all of our key regions additionally our volume recovery is outpacing the industry through the strength of our global brands and commercial excellence looking at the second quarter performance price and mix improved by nearly 30 million with price realization across all regions fixed cost absorption improved with no economic downtime in our north american mill system however operating costs were impacted by the tight transportation environment we executed the heaviest maintenance outage quarter of the year as well and on input costs we experienced pressure on wood chemicals and freight as i said earlier we re on track to spin off the papers business on october 1 separation planning is progressing well and we expect to file the form 10 with details of the spinoff in the first half of august as you would expect there is significant complexity our teams are doing an outstanding job managing the business as we prepare for a successful separation looking at the ilim results on slide 10 the joint venture delivered equity earnings of 101 million in the second quarter with an ebitda margin of 47 driven by strong price realization for pulp and containerboard volume improved sequentially on strong demand for pulp and containerboard as well as more shipping days in the second quarter following the impact of the chinese new year in the prior quarter underlying demand is stable following inventory restructuring during the first half of 2021 shipping capacity is tight and supply chains to china are stretched third quarter volume is expected to decrease moderately as ilim executes the majority of its annual maintenance program so now we ll turn to the outlook for the third quarter on slide 12 as mark said earlier we expect meaningful earnings and margin expansion as we move through the third quarter looking at industrial packaging we expect price and mix to improve by 110 million on the continued realization of our march 2021 price increase volume in north america is expected to improve by 10 million while volume in europe is expected to decrease by 10 million operations and costs are expected to improve by 5 million with the north american system benefiting from a gradual recovery and containerboard inventory levels staying with industrial packaging maintenance outage expenses are expected to be down by 122 million input costs are expected to increase by 85 million with occ representing about 60 of the expected increase in global cellulose fibers we expect price and mix to increase by 60 million on realization of prior price movements volume is expected to increase by 10 million operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by 5 million on continued supply chain stress due to port congestion maintenance salaries expense is expected to decrease by 15 million and input costs are expected to increase by 10 million on higher wood and chemical costs in printing papers we expect price and mix to increase by 25 million volume is expected to increase by 5 million operations and costs are expected to be unchanged maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by 23 million and input costs are expected to increase by 10 million primarily due to higher wood cost and under the equity earnings you ll see the outlook for our ilim joint venture i want to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions in the quarter we re committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet we re comfortable taking our leverage below the target range of 2 5 to 2 8 times debt to ebitda on a moody s basis in the first quarter we in the second quarter we reduced debt by 796 million bringing our debt reduction to 904 million in the first half of 2021 returning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework in the second quarter we returned 258 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases share repurchases were 57 million which represented one million shares at an average price of 60 80 we have about 1 5 billion available under the company s share repurchase optimization at the end of the second quarter lastly in the second quarter we monetized our remaining stake in graphic packaging for about 400 million this brings our total cash proceeds on the investment to 1 3 billion before expected cash taxes of about 300 million in the second half of 2021 as a reminder we also have a tax receivable agreement with graphic packaging under which we expect to receive about 100 million in cash proceeds during the second half of 2021 with that i ll turn it back over to mark mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer tim thank you very much for all the detail as we look forward we re positioned for strong earnings and margin expansion in the second half of 2021 my confidence in making a statement stays on the following our commercial initiatives are driving revenue growth and our mill and converting systems will be gaining meaningful operational and supply chain efficiency as we replenish inventories although rising input costs will likely linger i m certain we can successfully navigate the environment given the strong demand backdrop our papers business carries strong momentum as we approach the october one spinoff our team is doing an outstanding job managing the business and taking care of our customers and i want to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their tireless efforts as we plan for a successful separation as we move through 2021 we had significant operating and nonoperating cash catalyst and we are laser focused on the capital allocation framework that tim just described all of our cash will flow through our framework with one objective maximizing value creation for our shareowners i m excited about the actions we re taking to build a better ip we re accelerating earnings growth and building a foundation for long term success and we re looking forward to sharing more about that with you in the months ahead with that we re ready to take your questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of george staphos from bank of america george staphos bank of america analyst hi everyone good morning thanks for the detail thanks for taking my question i guess my first question mark you and tim have talked about this in the past about running the cash flow generation that the company has both from an operating standpoint and nonoperating since you have so many transactions that have been occurring this year and will continue to occur this year through your framework what should we take away from that in terms of what tools that you have in your quiver may be more applicable now versus what might have been the case three and six months ago and tim what gives you comfort and why you think it s appropriate in your view for leverage to drop below your target range what are the things that you think make that a prudent strategy you can give us a couple of thoughts there and then i had a follow on tim s nicholls senior vice president and chief financial officer sure good morning george the way we re thinking about it is we are trying to maximize value we have a lot of cash coming in in a moment we do everything looks positive as we go forward but we recognize this is a cyclical business to some extent and so in relation to the balance sheet where we are trying to build strength reduce risk but also flexibility and optionality and so taking it down below the target range which is really a target range through a cycle sometimes we ll be below it and sometimes we ll not able to be a little bit above but we just view that coupled with our pension performance is derisking the company share repurchases and dividend is very important and so that is over time as we not necessarily quarter by quarter but over year by year we look to be returning substantial amounts of cash to shareholders and then everything else gets tested whether it s organic or small bolt on types of acquisitions gets tested against that george staphos bank of america analyst as a follow on would the accelerating performance that you are seeing into the second half be any way a guide or a compass point for you in terms of how you may further allocate capital especially to value return over the rest of the year into 22 or is it really not so much because you look at this on a longer term basis and what are the whys and why not on that and then my related question and i ll turn it over for everyone do you have any kind of view that you could share with how much cash sylvamo will need to operate on an ongoing basis thank you very much tim s nicholls senior vice president and chief financial officer yes just on the last we do and that will be the form 10 is going to be coming out here in short order and i think that will answer a lot of questions to your first part of your question i think we try to look at both we try to look at circumstances in the moment but we definitely have a long term view and we re thinking about how all to create value and what our value is over time so i hope we try to take both into account over time mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer and tim if i could and george just wrap up there was a lot of ground covered in the capital allocation questions that you asked and we do take a long term view and as i said last quarter one of the things we re really excited about is that we ve got ip positioned for the first time in really almost forever or definitely recent memory where our entire capital allocation lever set strong balance sheet ability to pay a strong dividend share repurchases at the right times and very importantly smart investments in our business as tim said organic or inorganic we have all of those levers available at the same time in our past history as all of you know is we ve had two or three or maybe two out of four sometimes only one out of four and that s what we really are excited about as we re going forward as we separate into two companies the new ip is going to have a capital allocation posture that we haven t had in a long time and that s very exciting for our shareholders it s very exciting for the company because we have options to grow the businesses that are growing to manage our return of cash all generating hopefully outstanding shareholder return george staphos bank of america analyst thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of gabe hajde from wells fargo securities gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst good morning mark and tim thanks for taking the question i guess not to belabor the point here but and i appreciate that there is somewhat of a wall of worry out there but i think one of your peers kind of talked about potentially a structurally higher level of demand for corrugated for various reasons whether it s e commerce or potential onshoring and manufacturing activity so i guess ask the question a little bit differently your balance sheet and pension probably have not been in as good a shape for two or three decades is there something that you see around the corner that gives you pause in terms of any of your businesses and it sounds like again you re pretty constructive near term outlook i ll stop there mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer no gabe i think we also view the corrugated packaging market as potentially having a bit of a reset through this last year and a half we listened to our customers on that i m not sure it s 8 every quarter quarter in quarter out like it was in the last quarter but definitely a step up from the low single digit growth rates and that s what we want to be positioned for when we talk about growing at a minimum with the market we mean over time and a reasonable assumption of growth on the us market and that s a number that i think is leaning toward the higher end just because of a couple of things the adoption of e commerce through the pandemic which is i think proven to be very sticky and valuable proposition that fiber based packaging presents to people in terms of its circularity renewable natural resources making energy in a carbon neutral biomass way and a high recycling rate is finally with all the talk about sustainability and climate and a number of other issues finally getting attention all the way down to the consumer level so we re very excited about the corrugated packaging outlook and we want to make sure we re there with the right asset base the right customer list the right technical capabilities to grow with to share in that growth gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst all right thank you mark and i guess switching gears are you guys prepared at all it s been call it eight months or so since you ve announced the 350 million to 400 million of cost reduction to provide maybe a little bit more detail either cadence of that of how we might expect it to flow through i m assuming maybe we ve seen a little bit here in the first half but and then maybe by segment what you expect to see or is that something you maybe prefer to wait to talk about tim s nicholls senior vice president and chief financial officer yes gabe we plan on starting that as we head toward the third quarter release and then for the end of the year to get an expectation about 2022 performance gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of anthony pettinari from citi anthony pettinari citi analyst good morning on industrial packaging the fba and af pa data would suggest that sort of industry inventories are kind of closer back to a normal or more of a normally historic level for july i m just wondering if it s possible to quantify or put a finer point on how far below you are sort of normal or comfortable levels of inventory and sort of where that was exiting the quarter and maybe as we re here at the end of july tim s nicholls senior vice president and chief financial officer yes it s i mean through the second quarter we saw the lowest inventory levels in our system that we ve probably ever experienced coming out of the second quarter into july we re able to start covering a little bit of that but look we re i mean the winter storm impact hit us hard 145 000 tons followed by an abnormally high outage quarter in the second quarter so it s going to take a little bit of time for us to recover that as we go through third quarter and probably into the fourth quarter to some extent so yes we were at our lowest levels we ve ever seen in the second quarter mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer anthony i think the other perspective on inventories and i ve seen a lot written by analysts on normal inventories and one just thing to remember the way we look at it normal inventories averages from the past tend to correlate with more normal supply chain environment so normal transportation velocity so forth and so on we are nowhere near any kind of normal supply chain performance by third party partners in the transportation world so our inventory view in ip for the next quarter and the quarter after that is also influenced and adjusted by what s happening in the transportation and supply chain network so i would expect that normal right now should be higher levels of inventory to perform the same with customers as we had when transportation velocity was much higher anthony pettinari citi analyst okay that s very helpful and point well taken and then just maybe following up on capital allocation in terms of you talked about the willingness to potentially go under the 2 5 to 2 8 range at what is i think a pretty positive part of the cycle as you look to the spin would you look at revisiting that 2 5 to 2 8 target range either up or down i mean you re going to have a more durable higher quality business with industrial packaging and pulp at the same time you have a publicly traded competitor in containerboard that s been operating closer to one turn or certainly below two turns so just wondering if you could talk about that range and maybe your willingness to revisit it over the long term tim s nicholls senior vice president and chief financial officer yes it s a great question anthony and certainly we none of this is static right so we want it to be understood and we want to be consistent and true to the framework as we talk about it but that doesn t bar us from reevaluating based on portfolio and other specifics on potential changes that we think are beneficial to our investors and stakeholders so nothing now but something that we will definitely look at over time mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer anthony i think the way you should probably think about how we make that decision together tim and his team and me is we try to look at the company at its optimal weighted average cost of capital along a portion of that is what credit rating we need to have that delivers and supports that so you re absolutely right we re going to be a different company going forward that analysis is something that we do continuously we ve aligned at the credit rating target we have based on the company we will continue to look at that and try to make sure that our roic is constructed in the most effective way to get the best solid high quality return we can for shareholders and definitely debt ratios and credit ratings are a part of that anthony pettinari citi analyst okay that s helpful i ll turn it over operator your next question comes from the line of mark weintraub from seaport research mark weintraub seaport research analyst thank you wanted first just to get maybe more color on the corrugated volumes i get solid up 3 9 industry though was up 8 2 you mentioned supply chain and other challenges you had did that actually suppress where your volumes otherwise would have been and if that was the case is that business that when your system is operating easily comes back or can you kind of give us some color on how to understand the volume situation mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer well mark i think the way to think about the i was looking at what we sort of put in our outlook in the first quarter call and we actually had stronger performance than we felt we were going to have but we didn t know like a lot of people didn t know the market was going to grow 8 we had the inability during the quarter in some cases to pick up incremental business we didn t lose any business with our core customer list that was coming into the quarter as business there may be some business that we didn t bid most of it is shorter term business so the answer is yes we have people still calling us today can you supply we need more boxes in some cases we can we just couldn t do it in the second quarter so i m not concerned about losing anything permanently we basically had a classic mismatch between the available capacity in our system and the demand in a 90 day period mark weintraub seaport research analyst and the when you say the available capacity is that because your capacity during these 90 days were constrained by unusual factors or basically you re just pretty much running full to your system mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer the two factors i mentioned mark in my opening comments we have more than one quarter of recovery from the winter storm 140 000 tons that just evaporated from our containerboard supply chain and on top of that we had our highest maintenance quarter in ipg in the last 10 years so if you just normalize what was above normal maintenance plus that winter storm that s a chunk of containerboard capacity that could not be converted into a box and that s coming back it s just going to take a little while to get it back so what we had available we had wide open but we had capacity offline for maintenance and we had the lingering effect of the 140 000 tons from the first quarter none of those are permanent all of those will be significantly improved as we navigate through the second half mark weintraub seaport research analyst got it and then just on pulp obviously great price mix showing in the quarter and you pointed to another i think it was 60 million or so for the third quarter does that pretty much reflect all of the benefit from the pricing that s already happened forgetting about what happens from here or the way your contracts set up is there meaningful additional lag that might come through based on what s happened previously with posted prices mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer so that s a complicated question because of the nature of some of these contracts by customer type by region but let me just kind of state restate what we talked about the last two quarters that a you could expect quarter quarter over quarter improvement in this business steady improvement in this business and we re seeing that but our strategy is to have the kind of margins in this business that reflect the value that fluff pulp provides for the end use customers so we re taking a very structured very measured approach to each market segment and to the agreements we currently have in those segments with individual customers and so as we implement this approach we would expect that there ll be some volume shifts and movement between segments and our goal is to have mix improvement better agreements with better economics that reflect the value of fluff pulp and that is a kind of customer by customer region of the world by region of the world and i would expect and we re making progress good progress on that that given the length of some of these agreements and the way they re structured we should expect to continue to see margins improve over the next several quarters so that s a long complicated answer to would we have any more price flow through it s not just about price flow through it s about restructuring these commercial agreements and getting the proper value for this product mark weintraub seaport research analyst appreciate the color thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mark wilde from bank of montreal mark wilde bank of montreal analyst good morning mark good morning tim mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer good morning mark wilde bank of montreal analyst i wondered mark or tim if you can just help us a little bit with kind of cadencing the pass through of the spring containerboard hike and then i don t think you said anything about this prospective early august hike so maybe if you could just give us some color around that as well just as we think about the next couple of quarters and into 2022 tim s nicholls senior vice president and chief financial officer hi mark it s tim so i think the increase from the fall as we talked about last quarter went through a record amount of time it was the fastest i ve ever seen the pace on the second one we were kind of expecting a normal historical ramp on it it seems to be going faster not as fast as the first but still faster than what we ve seen over time we ll see as august comes we ll see how that will play out but right now we see our fundamentals looking very strong we see strong demand and as mark talked about all of the complications with supply chain are really stretching inventory tighter than they would normally be so far through the first two price increase implementations we feel really good mark wilde bank of montreal analyst well so can you give us a sense tim of how much benefit from that spring hike you ve had in the second quarter and just order of magnitude what we might expect in the third and fourth quarters tim s nicholls senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i think if you look at the two of them combined we d be about 80 complete on implementation at this point mark wilde bank of montreal analyst okay all right and then any thoughts on sort of how august would roll in tim s nicholls senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i don t want to i mean that s forward looking and we feel very confident at the moment but i don t want to speak to forecasting price at this point mark wilde bank of montreal analyst okay all right that s fair mark i just want to as a follow up turn to the containerboard business from just a kind of a supply and demand standpoint does this continued strength in global containerboard demand is it all from your thinking at all about investing in either debottlenecking projects with existing mills or potentially the timing on that second conversion at riverdale and are you also doing anything to kind of gear up capacity on the converting side as e commerce continues to grow as a bigger and bigger percentage of the market mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer that s a great question mark and the answer is coming in just maybe in the middle of 2020 we were saying and i was saying that we feel really good about our containerboard capacity we have what we need the amount the type of grades when everything is running we have enough capacity but everything isn t run it every day with outages and of course events that you don t predict like that winter storm issue but yes we are looking continuously at debottlenecking we ve done a bunch of that in the last several years thankfully because we need that containerboard now we are looking at different options for adding containerboard into our system if it looks like this kind of demand level is going to be consistent remember we are structured maybe a little bit uniquely in the sense that we bring containerboard to market through three distinct channels our own box network open market in north america to companies that provide a certain service in the box market and have been long term partners of ours but we don t make the box and then our export so what you have seen and will continue to see is movement of containerboard within those three channels and obviously we have favored the us box market as much as we can but trying to continue over time not just in the second quarter of 2021 but over time get the highest possible margins in our business by participating in all three of those channels containerboard you re right is a high demand product all over the world both recycled and virgin we have obviously only export the virgin we sell the virgin version of it box capacity we ve been actively investing luckily with the acquisitions we did with that in the early part of the past period we had a lot of opportunities to fill out existing plants by adding single or double lines of box making equipment we ve built a few plants and we ve acquired a couple of partnerships but there s definitely opportunity for us to continue to invest in our converting network the other option with converting as you well know mark is when you know demand looks like it s going to be solid you can bring on more employees and actually fill out an extra shift in many plants and you ve got latent capacity turned into productive capacity you obviously want to do that when you re pretty sure and you first do it with overtime and then you do it with permanent employees that s a challenge right now given the labor market dynamics but we ve got several levers to pull to continue to invest in not only box capacity but the kinds of capability we have e commerce specific assets for example is something that we re also bringing to market mark wilde bank of montreal analyst okay that s helpful thanks mark i ll turn it over operator your next question comes from the line of mark connelly from stephens mark connelly stephens analyst thanks tim mentioned that white paper price makes maybe about 30 million but when i look at overall revenue per ton in this segment we ve got only a couple of bucks which implies that maybe overseas price mix was flat or even down can you talk about price mix across your system particularly outside the us on the white paper side mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer on white papers mark mark connelly stephens analyst yes tim s nicholls senior vice president and chief financial officer yes it s just a little bit muffled coming through so were you talking about looking forward mark mark connelly stephens analyst no i m curious what s happening in the system right now it looks like you got some gains in the us but you didn t really get much across the entire white paper business tim s nicholls senior vice president and chief financial officer yes well i mean all the regions we re seeing price increases or realization of price increases in some degree some of this in other regions started earlier in the year so russia was kind of on the forefront earlier in the year implementing a price increase brazil as well domestically so those are they re running their course and playing out where we still see traction is in north america and in some of the export markets as well mark connelly stephens analyst okay that s very helpful and mark just to switch gears completely i m curious what your position is on this packaging stewardship legislation that we re starting to see as states try to create incentives to reduce waste you pointed to the growth in e commerce which some of these states are pointing to as part of the problem but how do you we know af pa is against containerboards being included so how do you think about containerboard industry responsibility what should it be if the legislation should not apply to you mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer well i think if you look at the legislation in detail there s a federal view that s kind of in its nascent stage and there s a state by state view and we are actively working in the state by state legislatures the big issue and the big goal of this extended producer responsibility type legislation it was really targeted nonrecyclable or hard to recycle in many cases plastics in some cases that has led people to believe all of packaging should be included so the first thing is separating the facts of what corrugated packaging can do and actually corrugated packaging could be a solution to the problem because of the high recycling rates but that message has to get to policymakers and we work very hard on that i spend a fair amount of my personal time talking to people about that and in many cases it s a new learning mark for people at the local level that there is a completely different story on fiber based packaging that s made from the renewable resource and a high recycling rate in the 90 range versus many of the other substrate choices so i think that s the case we re making that is actually part of the solution not part of the problem but as usual in legislation sometimes it starts with a blanket all packaging needs to be managed in a different way and people need to be responsible for their packaging that they put out there when we have a system so for example we spend a lot of time and it s in there right now on the infrastructure work that commerce is working on in that bipartisan agreement they made yesterday a significant amount of investment in recycling networks in the country is part of that we ll see if it stays in there but that s the answer is in improving recycling rates for easy to recycle and reuse materials that s the value proposition for corrugated packaging not being included in the intent of some of that legislation mark connelly stephens analyst that s super helpful thank you operator your next question comes from the line of phil ng from jefferies phil ng jefferies analyst hey good morning everyone appreciating the winter storms was a big hit for you guys but tim or mark do you expect inventory getting back to a more manageable level for containerboard in 3q where you ll be able to better capitalize on the growth we re seeing and get operating costs back to a more normalized level i think in the past you ve always kind of targeted to grow faster than the market but any color on kind of getting back on track on that goal mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer philip we think it will be steady progress it won t be all solved in the third quarter we think we ll make steady progress through the second half of the year we have targeted to grow at or slightly above the market over time we were really hampered in our ability to do that in the last couple of quarters because of the issues you just mentioned but we will definitely have more options available for incremental growth as we go forward just based on the fact that we won t have so much of our system down for maintenance but it will take a slow steady progress month after month through the second half phil ng jefferies analyst so we should still expect you to lag the market a little bit in 3q and obviously continue mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer not necessarily part of what happens in 90 days that s a pretty short period of time part of what happens in the 90 day period is your segment exposure and what happens in the seasonality if you ve got more of this versus that and so i think you shouldn t i wouldn t automatically assume we ll lag the market but i think it will take us the next second half of the year to get to the point where we feel comfortable that our inventories are more sustainable i think the first thing we ll see is we won t miss any sales the second thing we ll see is our costs will come down phil ng jefferies analyst super helpful and then pulp prices appreciating its volatile nature it s commodity both softwood and fluff pulp prices really surged this year but the market appears to have softened up a bit what s your crystal ball saying in terms of pricing for fluff and softwood pulp globally and do you have a view in terms of how much inventory levels are in the channel it s tougher to gauge just given some of the logistical omens you guys are seeing in the market tim s nicholls senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean i wouldn t want to forecast price looking forward i talked about how we think about it at the moment what we believe we re seeing we re seeing a bit of a pullback in some of the markets but our view at the moment is that things are more stable and there s no and you have to look at not only the underlying demand levels but at the transportation difficulties which are really in effect extending supply chains at this point so you re right full commodity product but our view at the moment is this is a bit of a correction not a complete turn phil ng jefferies analyst okay super helpful guys operator your next question comes from the line of adam josephson from keybanc adam josephson keybanc analyst mark and tim good morning i hope you are well mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer we are adam josephson keybanc analyst mark one more on pulp and then i have a containerboard question just i appreciate your comments that you expect segment margins to improve over the next several quarters but when i look at the last 10 quarters it s been a pretty tough slog for the business and as phil just said prices in china have been coming down of late so i guess what gives you confidence just given what s happened over the past two to three years that this is a business in which you have a meaningful competitive advantage mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer well if you think about the remarks i made a couple of questions ago about what we re changing in the business versus the last 10 months or the last 10 quarters that s what gives me confidence that this is a very value creating material for our end use customers and we just haven t always extracted that proper value that gives us a value creating return and that s what we re working on i think the growth rate will stay solid as economies around the world improves so there s a growth component but we re going to run the business in a different way than it s been run before when we made the decision to invest in the business it changes the profile of this being a legitimate first rate business for our company versus in many cases a smaller sideline type of business and some of that s reflected in some of the way the commercial agreements have been made and we re working on changing that for the better adam josephson keybanc analyst i appreciate that mark and just one on box and i think you mentioned earlier in the call that long term you think the market could be at the high end of that 1 to 2 range that you were talking about i just want to make sure i understand it so let s say the market is up another 4 this year after 3 5 last year you re talking about kind of an 8 step change upward post pandemic in a market that had been growing at 1 per annum are you thinking that we re going to keep stay at these higher levels and grow on top of that or that there could be some correction as retail sales normalize and then we ll get back to some kind of growth trend mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer yes i mean it s hard to predict that with certainty obviously but we believe that part of what s happening is the role that fiber based packaging is playing in general commerce driven by a few segments has taken a step change up and so we think the base will be stronger it depends on a lot of things and number one the structure of the us economy and so if there is really action on some of the things that are being learned now around supply chains and global issues with supply chains and we do have more manufacturing that actually occurs in the us for certain components i think that will bode well for the business and how strong the consumer is going forward coming out of this i think you re looking at maybe what s going to be close to two years of pent up demand by consumers because of the things that happened during the pandemic and how that plays out in consumption will play a big role in what that growth rate is going to be i think the data we have this model we use i know others have models there s third parties that have models a correlation around gdp has been slightly less has been what s happened in the box market and we think that will still stand and it looks like we re poised to have a stronger consumption oriented gdp for at least as far as you can see right now adam josephson keybanc analyst thanks a lot mark operator your next question comes from the line of paul quinn from rbc capital paul quinn rbc capital analyst yes thanks very much just a question on pulp i understand you guys are making some operational improvements and i m just trying to balance that with the q3 guide here where you ve got ops and cost up 5 million so is there something on the cost side that s more than offsetting the operational improvement that you re seeing and then if you could give us sort of a scope as to what the big bogey is out there for three to five years out in terms of the things that you guys can control i e how much improvement do you expect that segment to have over that period of time mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer on the longer term part i ll ask tim to look for that cost offset part of your question but on the longer term we believe that the combination of how we operate so in the manufacturing sector and the kind the cost structure of our mill system and i ve said this before especially the part that was the legacy ip mill system which is mostly converted mills from other products versus what we acquired with weyerhaeuser which is mostly all built for purpose so they tend to have a better efficiency and lower cost we ve got opportunities to lower the cost primarily in the legacy ip manufacturing system coupled that with the commercial arrangements improvements that we re talking about and what we re doing now you put those two together we should hit the margin structure and have a solidly a solid business above the cost of capital with a slight growth potential so that s what we are working on and we see a path to that it will be a steady path quarter by quarter and that s where we re headed and the question on the cost offset tim tim s nicholls senior vice president and chief financial officer it s modest but it s really transportation i mean we re continuing to battle the transportation challenge mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer a big part of the transportation issue in this business paul is the export port congestion much more exposed to international ocean freight and the other businesses in the company paul quinn rbc capital analyst all right thanks very much that s helpful thanks a lot operator your next question comes from neel kumar from morgan stanley neel kumar morgan stanley analyst hi good morning you mentioned wood costs being higher sequentially partly because of the wet weather can you just give us a sense of the magnitude of inflation you re seeing there has it started to be more of a 3q issue or could it carry over to the fourth quarter as well tim s nicholls senior vice president and chief financial officer yes it s i mean it s really due to having access to the fiber and being able to get it out of the wood based on the rainfall that we ve had so we look at a very long lead time in terms of how we manage with inventories at mills and across basins and it s really been the gulf states that have been more heavily impacted but some of the southeastern mills as well so it will depend on the weather as we go through the rest of this quarter into the fourth but our inventories are in decent shape but they re a little on the low side and it s just going to cost more to get the wood out and get into the mills transportation is not helping either i mean we ve referenced inbound materials and whatnot and that s seemingly impacting everything neel kumar morgan stanley analyst all right that s helpful and then in terms of your maintenance outage expenses you re now forecasting 642 million for the full year i know it s early but i m just curious how you re thinking about 2022 maintenance do you expect it to step down year over year or generally remain near 2021 levels tim s nicholls senior vice president and chief financial officer well we re still working through that i mean i think a good way to look at it and the way i looked at it last year was an abnormally low year this year is a little bit of out of range high year when you put the two of them together it looks roughly in line i mean our outages can be anywhere from 500 to 500 million to a little bit less or maybe some years a little bit more pushing 550 million last year given all the uncertainty we pulled back and curtailed this year we re catching up on some of those outages from last year so we put the two together that s more normal next year we ll we have to finish our planning we always provide that as we near the end of the year and look into the coming year neel kumar morgan stanley analyst all right thank you operator okay our last question for today comes from the line of kyle white from deutsche bank kyle white deutsche bank analyst hey good morning thanks for taking the question i just wanted to talk about some of your end markets in corrugated packaging how is e commerce performing relative to your initial expectations at the start of the quarter any slowdowns there that you see how is the recovery in foodservice going just any details on the end markets that you can provide mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer i think on e commerce no disappointment still very very strong and then we re getting into the period of the year where you start to build for the year end demand increases as you move toward holiday season so still a very strong story we re continuing to invest in that segment foodservice continuing to improve i guess there s a question mark about what happens with the delta variant and covid and whether everything continues to open i think a big question mark or a big potential upside is as schools and events start to open foodservice related to those which obviously hasn t been opened during the summer is another potential upside if that in any way shape or form gets delayed then foodservice growth could slow a little bit the only segment that i think and it s kind of predictable that maybe saw some flattening was processed foods and i think it s directly related to the general opening of the economy and a little less stocking up of kind of the center of the grocery store if you will so good strong performance across the key segments and we believe listening to our customers and looking at order patterns that s continuing as we go into the third quarter kyle white deutsche bank analyst that s helpful and then focusing on transportation i know it s early but when you look to next year do you see any relief or kind of stabilization in transportation costs or do you anticipate kind of continued inflation headwinds and is there anything internally maybe that you can do to provide some relief against these costs mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer well internally the best thing we can do on the cost side is to have our system optimized with the right inventories and what that means is make a product in the right factory so that the transportation cost to the customer or in the case of our industrial packaging business our containerboard mill makes containerboard for box plants that are nearby not box plants that are all the way across the country so that s the number one thing on cost that we can do internally we don t have our own trucking company or anything like that it s about really optimizing our supply chain and any dramatic improvements we can make on cost to your first part of your question i don t know this for sure but looking at what the analysts that follow the transportation industry talk about is that there is a belief that labor and some of the impediments to truck capacity and the training that s required to bring on more employees and more assets in the rail industry will get better that people will want to return to those industries many of those companies laid off a lot of people you can t just bring people back in rail there s required training and other things same thing for truck and the belief is that that will get better so capacity should get better if the economy stays kind of red hot it s a good problem to have but then i think capacity will get absorbed pretty quickly so the jury now is that we think it s really disruptive right now velocity is really slow for a lot of reasons we think part of that at least on the human labor side will get better kyle white deutsche bank analyst got it thanks so much for the details mark s sutton chairman and chief executive officer thank you let me go ahead and wrap up just a couple of takeaways i would like to leave with investors first you heard today that we are really positive on the strong momentum we re building for the second half in both earnings and margin expansion we re absolutely laser focused on capital allocation and a balanced approach to that and we are in very good shape on all elements of our capital allocation framework and we re very excited about the prospects we have in front of us as we separate ip into two companies and we work on building a better ip going forward so thank you for your interest in international paper we look forward to talking with all of you next quarter operator duration 64 minutes call participants guillermo gutierrez vice president of investor relations mark s sutton chairman and chief executive

ll now turn the call over to liam for his remarks liam j kelly chairman president and chief executive officer thank you larry and good morning everyone it s a pleasure to speak with you today we are delighted with our second quarter performance which exceeded the outlook we provided on the first quarter earnings call reflecting the company s resilient base business and innovative growth drivers offset by varying degrees of covid 19 challenges on a global basis the majority of our global product families witnessed constant currency growth over the second quarter of 2019 as anticipated we witnessed improvements in underlying utilization trends for the product categories most impacted by the postponement of non emergent procedures most notably interventional urology interventional and surgical we are encouraged with urolift as momentum continues to build driving 26 constant currency revenue growth as compared to the first quarter of 2021 during the second quarter our americas asia and oem segments performed well with constant currency revenues growing over 2019 but emea is now back to 2019 revenue levels as we anticipated americas and asia continue to recover more quickly than emea although uncertainties with covid 19 remain we continue to anticipate that our revenue performance will improve as we move through the remainder of 2021 for the second quarter operating margin showed gains over 2020 and 2019 in comparable periods and was driven by gross margin and disciplined expense control our continued progress in margin expansion in 2021 has allowed us to increased directed investments toward growth drivers which is an important component of our long term strategy to enhance durable growth given the strength of the second quarter results we are maintaining our constant currency revenue guidance which now includes a 28 to 32 million sales headwind from the june 28 initial close of the respiratory products divestiture that was not included in our prior guidance based on our outlook for the second half of 2021 and our margin improvement in the second quarter we are increasing our 2021 earnings per share guidance to a range of 12 90 to 13 10 from a previous guidance of 12 65 to 12 85 we continue to execute our strategy to drive durable growth with investment in organic growth opportunities margin expansion and deployment of capital for m a turning now to a more detailed review of our second quarter results second quarter revenue was 713 5 million an increase of 21 year over year on a constant currency basis and 6 8 over the comparable period in 2019 the year over year increase was driven by contributions from interventional anesthesia surgical and interventional urology offset by unfavorable year over year comparisons due to higher demand for our vascular access and respiratory products in quarter two 2020 associated with covid 19 we are also pleased with our second quarter gross and operating margins with sequential improvements over q1 strong performance q2 adjusted an operating margins set new high watermarks for teleflex as a pure play medical device company an encouraging sign for our longer term profitability objectives second quarter adjusted earnings per share of 3 35 increased 73 6 and exceeded our internal expectations the earnings outperformance reflects the recovery in healthcare utilization during the second quarter coupled with improved volume modest price increases and prudent operating expense management overall i am very happy with our second quarter financial performance which demonstrate the importance of our diversified global product portfolio while also reflecting progress toward our longer term margin aspirations turning now to a deeper look at revenue results i will begin with a review of our reportable segment revenues and unless otherwise noted the growth rates i will refer to are on a constant currency basis americas revenues were 414 8 million in the second quarter which represents 31 8 growth year over year and 10 8 over the comparable period in 2019 growth was driven by a rebound in procedures following the disruption forward earlier in the year with particular strength in interventional urology surgical and interventional emea revenues at 157 1 million increased 8 4 year over year and was flat over 2019 levels emea benefited from a favorable covid related comparison as procedures improved year over year as countries across the region continued to open up turning to asia revenues were 80 6 million increasing 10 3 year over year and consistent with the performance seen in the first quarter of 2021 asia was up 1 7 as compared to 2019 importantly we saw solid double digit growth in china and high single digit growth in japan more than offsetting declines in southeast asia and lastly our oem business which accounts for roughly 9 of total sales increased 6 9 year over year to 61 0 million in the second quarter oem was up 6 as compared to the comparable period in 2019 following a 17 1 decline in the first quarter of 2021 business witnessed a rebound as customers stepped up orders on signs of increasing healthcare utilization we continue to expect a sequential improvement in growth through the second half of 2021 driven in part by incremental capacity let s now move to the conversion of our second quarter revenues by global product category consistent with my prior comments regarding our reportable segments commentary on global product category growth will also be on a constant currency basis as a reminder there were no meaningful differences in year over year selling days in the second quarter starting with vascular access second quarter revenues decreased by 2 1 to 167 7 million although we are facing difficult year over year comparisons in vascular access due to the higher demand experienced in quarter two 2020 associated with covid 19 the performance of our innovative products remained strong our peak portfolio performed well with full 30 growth year over year we continue to invest behind our differentiated peak portfolio and continue to expect share was also strong in the second quarter with growth of 15 5 year over year moving to interventional second quarter revenue was 112 1 million which rose 30 9 year over year the increase was due to a recovery in certain non emergent procedures on a year over year basis manta our unique large bore closure device grew 160 year over year which keeps us well positioned to reach 8 share in 2021 out of a 200 to 300 million market opportunity turning now to anesthesia second quarter revenue was 95 4 million up 38 8 year over year z medica contributed roughly 60 of the growth as the business continues to track to our 60 to 70 million revenue expectation for 2021 partly offset by lower sales of tracheostomy products excluding fx and the z medica acquisition underlying growth for anesthesia in the second quarter was approximately 16 year over year the integration of z medica is going very well and we are pleased with the progress we are making in our surgical business revenue was 98 2 million representing 39 growth year over year increase in revenues was driven by sales of our metal and polymer ligation clips and instruments as elective surgical procedures continue to recover for interventional urology second quarter revenue was 92 2 million an increase of 129 4 year over year and 35 6 over the second quarter of 2019 reflecting a move back toward more normalized growth we are encouraged by the business trends with physicians remaining engaged in the use of urolift in all care settings and patients increasingly seeking treatment for symptoms of bph our dtc momentum remains solid and we remain comfortable in our 30 plus revenue growth objective for urolift in 2021 and finally our other category which consists of our respiratory and urology care products declined by 9 9 to 86 9 million the decline reflects difficult comparisons from the prior year related to covid associated respiratory product demand in americas and emea that completes my comments on second quarter revenue performance turning to some clinical and commercial updates in the second quarter we trained 118 urologists and remain on track to achieve our target to train 450 to 500 urologists in 2021 we continue to execute on our 2021 dtc program for this year s campaign we are optimizing our network selection refreshing the ads and working in conjunction with social media campaigns to augment the overall impact given the positive awareness from the dtc campaign we have decided to make incremental investment in the second half of 2021 to tap into this under penetrated market we view dtc as a multi year for urolift in the us as we are still in the very early innings of market adoption and patient awareness indeed urolift is leading the way in minimally invasive treatment of bph and this is the first time in recent years that a bph brand is reaching patients directly in a meaningful way turning now to urolift 2 we are in a full rollout in the us which is consistent with our timing expectations we continue to anticipate that the vast majority of physician customers will be converted to urolift 2 by the end of 2022 paced by advantages in visualization reduced storage space and increased manufacturing capacity we remain positioned to generate significant margin expansion as the revenue base is fully converted regarding japan we remain on track reimbursement decision in 2021 and view the approximate 2 billion addressable market as an incremental growth driver that will be a positive catalyst for the foreseeable future our submission was not reviewed at the july mhlw meeting and we now expect a review in september with a launch in the 4th quarter of 2021 there is no change to our expectation for urolift revenues in japan to ramp up beginning in 2022 with modest contribution in 2021 on the us reimbursement front cms published its proposed physician fee schedule for calendar 2022 on july 13 the proposed reimbursement rate for urolift in the physician office setting were reduced by 19 to 21 year over year a couple of points i want to make first the proposed payment reductions to office based procedures would not go into effect until january 1 2022 and therefore do not impact our 2021 outlook second the proposed reductions were broad based across a range of office based procedures in a variety of surgical specialties and to not specific to urolift third we continue to view the strength of our clinical data including the lift pivotal trial and real world studies as a differentiator versus other bph treatment modalities and a driver of urolift adoption between our next steps teleflex will engage with key stakeholders during the public common period to reiterate the benefit of urolift for the treatment of bph we would hope that cms recognizes the importance of maintaining patient access to safe effective and less invasive procedures including urolift in lower cost settings such as the physician s office we anticipate the final rules will be published during the 4th quarter 2021 separately cms published the proposed outpatient prospective payment system rates on july 19 these rates cover up facility payments for urolift in the hospital outpatient and asc settings in this case the proposed payments for urolift increased by 3 approximately for 2022 versus 2021 investors familiar with teleflex will know that approximately 2 3 of urolift revenues are generated in the asc and outpatient settings turning to the next slide on a clinical update for urolift on july 9 the largest us medicare and commercial claims analysis a full bph procedures was presented at the european association of urology meeting the study which included reimbursement claims from 2015 to 2019 evaluated surgical retreatment and post operative complications incured by patients who underwent tarp greenlight laser resume and urolift procedures at 4 years after the index procedure surgical retreatment rates were comparable for urolift tarp and greenlight laser and highest resume also at 300 days post treatment overall complication rates were lowest after urolift while resume at the highest rates these statistically significant results demonstrate the efficacy of urolift as compared to other therapies for the treatment of bph in real world settings we will continue to bolster our body of clinical evidence which should help to sustain urolift as the leading minimally invasive procedure to treat bph and address a multi billion dollar global market opportunity now i will provide some background under respiratory divestiture consistent with our strategy to drive durable growth and disciplined portfolio review process we completed the initial phase of the divestiture of a significant portion of our respiratory products to medline industries on june 28 the transaction generated 286 million in cash 12 million in working capital not transfered to medline as noted previously the product lines that were divested generated 139 million in revenues in 2020 looking forward with the divestiture of the respiratory assets will improve our organic growth rate and margins over time and better positions us for internal resource allocation and a focus on our key growth drivers that completes my prepared remarks now i would like to turn the call over to tom for a more detailed review of our second quarter financial results tom thomas powell executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks liam and good morning everyone given the previous discussion of the company s revenue performance i ll begin at the gross profit line for the second quarter adjusted gross margin totaled 29 9 an increase of 100 basis points versus the prior year period the increase in gross margin was driven by product and regional mix benefits from cost improvement initiatives favorable impacts from pricing m a and foreign exchange partly offset by logistics and distribution expense second quarter adjusted operating margin was 28 2 for a 640 basis point year over year increase driven largely by the gross margin improvement as well as disciplined expense management and partially offset by investment in the business with our revenue base improving and operational efficiencies we delivered a more typical one to one drop through from gross margin to operating margin during the second quarter for the quarter net interest expense totaled 15 9 million an increase from 15 5 million in the prior year period as previously mentioned in the second quarter we issued a notice of redemption to holders of our outstanding 400 million principal amount of 4 and 7 eights senior notes due in 2026 the notes were redeemed on june 1 2021 and it was funded using borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and cash on hand our adjusted tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 14 4 as compared to 15 8 in the prior year period the year over year decrease in our adjusted tax rate is primarily due to geographic mix shift of profits and a larger benefit from stock based compensation as compared to the prior year period at the bottom line second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 73 6 to 3 35 included in this result is an estimated favorable impact from foreign exchange of approximately 0 16 turning now to select balance sheet and cash flow highlights for the first half of 2021 cash flow from operations totaled 265 million as compared to 134 million in the prior year period and represented a year over year increase of 131 million the increase was primarily attributable to favorable operating results lower contingent consideration payments and lower payroll and benefit related payments partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital and higher tax payments overall balance sheet remains in good shape at the end of the second quarter our cash balance was 361 8 million versus 275 9 million at the end of the 4th quarter of 2020 we paid down 5 million in debt during the second quarter a net leverage at quarter end was approximately 2 5 times post quarter close we made a 259 million payment against our revolving credit facility using funds primarily generated from the initial close of the respiratory business divestiture now moving onto 2021 guidance starting with revenue we are maintaining our constant currency revenue growth guidance for 2021 of between 8 50 to 9 75 year over year of note the strength in the second quarter sales results have allowed us to offset 28 to 32 million revenue headwind in the back half of the year associated with the respiratory divestiture which was not contemplated in our prior guidance as you contemplate your model adjustments note that the divested respiratory products are in our other revenue category please see the investor slide deck for historic revenues divested respiratory products key contributors to our thousand and 21 constant currency revenue growth outlook are expected to be interventional urology interventional surgical and anesthesia product offerings where interventional urology there is no change to our expectations for at least 30 growth in 2021 we continue to expect the acquisition of z medica to at 60 to 70 million in sales in 2021 turning to currency we expect foreign exchange rates will be a tailwind to reported revenue growth of approximately 2 as a result we continue to expect our as reported revenue to increase between 10 50 to 11 75 over 2020 and this would equate to 1 00 range of between 2 804 and 2 805 billion now for some commentary on our margin outlook we are increasing our adjusted gross margin guidance for 2021 to a range of between 59 25 and 59 75 representing a raised from the prior guidance of 100 basis points at the low end and 50 basis points at the high end we expect gross margin expansion to be driven primarily by a favorable mix of high margin products including interventional urology interventional access and surgical as well as from manufacturing productivity improvement programs and benefits from previously announced footprint restructuring programs partially offset by inflation there is no change to our expectation that the acquisition of z medica will add approximately 50 basis points of gross margin for 2021 for adjusted operating margin we are increasing our 2021 guidance to a range of between 26 75 and 27 50 representing a raise from the prior guidance of 75 basis points at the low end 50 basis points at the high end the increase in adjusted operating margin will largely come from the gross margin line and leverage partially offset by the expected increase in spending in the second half of 2021 as we progress toward a more normalized environment as well as incremental strategic investments in urolift and manta moving down to p l we now expect interest expense to be in the range of 60 to 62 million for 2021 versus our previous guidance of 61 to 63 million the decrease in interest expense largely reflects the reduction in debt funded by proceeds from the respiratory divestiture on taxes we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate will be in the range of 13 and 13 50 considering all of these elements we are raising our adjusted eps outlook for 2021 to a range of 12 90 to 13 10 that represents a 20 9 to 22 8 year over year increase we re pleased to be able to increase our earnings per share guidance by 0 25 while also covering the 0 10 to 0 15 of eps dilution from the respiratory divestiture that was not reflected in our prior outlook and that concludes my prepared remarks i would now like to turn the call back to liam for closing commentary liam liam j kelly chairman president and chief executive officer thank you tom in closing i would highlight our 3 key takeaways from the quarter first we delivered a strong second quarter with top and bottom line performance that outpaced our expectations laid out on the q1 call second we remain encouraged by our growth trajectory with the majority of our global product families posed in constant currency growth over the second quarter of 2019 third we maintained our revenue outlook and raise our adjusted margin and earnings per share guidance for 2021 despite headwinds associated with the respiratory divestiture that was not contemplated in our prior guidance in closing we feel good about our solid performance in the quarter and our future growth opportunities when considering the early third quarter close of the respiratory divestiture our leverage reached 2 3 times which places us in a positive position with respect to flexibility on our balance sheet we will continue meeting our commitments to patients clinicians communities and of course our shareholders that concludes my prepared remarks now i would like to turn the call back to the operator for q a questions and answers operator thank you and your first question comes from the line of matt taylor your line is open matt taylor ubs good morning thank you for taking the question so firstly i just wanted to ask you about the urolift trends that you re seeing if you could describe any trends during the quarter and then just talk about your confidence to reiterate the guidance for urolift through the year and any color on the cadence that we should expect for the rab for the year liam j kelly chairman president and chief executive officer all right not absolutely and thanks for the question now we are not going to get into inter quarter details on this quarter is larry outlined in opening comments what i will tell you that first of all we re really pleased with what we saw in urolift in q2 we are positively reaffirming our growth expectations at plus 30 for urolift and we are really pleased with the growth in the quarter of nearly 130 and sequentially quarter plus 26 investors familiar with urolift will recall that urolift grew around 30 days adjusted in q1 versus 2019 and in q2 that growth versus 2019 actually accelerated to around 36 and we continue to expect the total dollar revenues for urolift to continue to improve in q3 over q2 and again in q4 over q3 so a good positive message on urolift matt matt taylor ubs thanks liam and could you just comment on your overall thoughts on the reimbursement change and talk about your efforts there to get a different outcome in the final rule and what would happen i guess the worst case scenario and you do have these cuts in the office liam j kelly chairman president and chief executive officer so to be honest matt we re looking forward to engaging with cms to better understand what their objective was in making this broad based reductions to over 600 surgical procedures that are performed in the office setting it will be our goal is to demonstrate both the excellent clinical data that supports urolift and the healthcare economic data which is also very compelling i m sure they will be attentive to the potential unintended consequence of some procedures being moved to higher costs of care settings we believe that the timing of this change as it is being proposed may be is advise at a time when most government bodies are trying to promote procedures return post covid and they are promoting that return to lower cost settings where the patient also views that lower cost setting as being a less risk setting of contracting covid so our plan is to engage with the key stakeholders including other device industry trade groups physician associations and patient advocacy groups i think our strategy will depend on the final ruling math as to what decisions that we will take and moving forward and we believe that cms will listen given that there is such a broad comments going to land in regards to this particular ruling operator next question is from cecile with morgan stanley your line is open cecilia furlong morgan stanley analyst hi good morning and thank you for taking the questions i wanted to continue with urolift we re just curious could you talk about just user s trained on urolift during covid what you ve seen from recent contributions as well as any trends in your offsite of service and then also just what you re expecting from dtc contributions in the back half of this year liam j kelly chairman president and chief executive officer yeah so thanks cecile so regarding site of service you know about 30 of procedures have traditionally been done in the office with the remainder done outside of the office in the afc and the hospital as we went through covid which is the other part of your of your question we saw a slight increase in office procedures and as we come out to the other side of covid we see that normalizing again and getting back to that more normalized level with regard to the dtc we were really encouraged by the performance of dtc so much so that we ve actually increased the investment done in the back half of the year we had anticipated that we would have about 125 of the impressions in 2021 versus 2020 with this increased investment now we would think that would be a 150 plus the number of impressions that we re going to gain i was actually spent a week on the road with the sales team meeting urologists and i met over 20 urologists all and this is only anecdotal and i get that but all bar one neurologist was able to tell me that they ve had people turn up into their practice whether it d be a hospital afc or an office referring to the ad but they saw on television or hit them on facebook and asking the urologist about urolift based on that so that is very encouraging and we continue to see it as an excellent is the return on our on our investment and therefore we are spending additional dollars in the back half of the year cecilia furlong morgan stanley analyst great thank you and then just on gross margins as well there is second half could you comment on what is in is it urolift 2 conversion or oem contributions as well as geographic mix thank you liam j kelly chairman president and chief executive officer so i ll just touch on urolift and then i ll ask tom to comment so we anticipate the ul2 conversion being completed by the end of 2022 we re in full ramp now as we go toward the back end of the year i m pleased to confirm that we still anticipate that we will pick up full percentage points of margin from that conversion to the ul2 and and therefore that would add about 40 basis points of the total of teleflex so you ll begin to see some of the conversion as we go through the back end of the year cecile but you ll see the majority of come through in 2022 and tom might answer some of the cadence of gross margins to get online tom thomas powell executive vice president and chief financial officer sure well i think there is some question about oem and in other geographies so as we look at the oem business we had a soft first quarter with a nice recovery in the second quarter so we really saw improving trends there as customers began seeing improvements in procedures and began ordering again we expect that to continue through the balance of the year then in terms of the various geographies as we said all along our expectation was that the north american region would recover first for the americas of the cover first followed by asia and have made and that s still kind of playing out as expected so we expect all regions to continue to show improvement in the back half of the year relative to the first but perhaps the americas a little bit stronger than some of the others and then in terms of the overall gross margin i d say that overall we re really encouraged by what we ve seen in the first half of the year allowing us to take the guidance up at the at the upper end of the guidance range we re at 59 3 quarters which is slightly ahead of where we were for the first half of the year so we are really encouraged by what we re seeing and we re cautiously optimistic about about the back half operator and we have a question from shagun singh with wells fargo your line is open shagun singh chadha wells fargo securities analyst great thank you so much for taking the question i guess the first one is the turn of reimbursement could you talk about the potential of the office cost it does appear that just to may go into effect but it may be financed that over a 4 year period firstly that your expectation and secondly what impact do you expect this to have a procedures in the office setting and your ability to them to adoptable settings over time and then given much respect now they should be but to be it will be any afc setting i believe it s about 6 in addition to the cuts in the office setting what impact do you expect that to have on utilization in those settings and then i have a follow up liam j kelly chairman president and chief executive officer okay shagun and so we re really focused on what we can control right now so we are expecting that we ll spend a lot of time working with the key stakeholders in this comment period i don t want to start second guessing the results to be honest shagun because depending on the outcome of the final ruling that would depend on one strategy that would continue to work with cms some of our our industry bodies patient advocates organizations and obviously there are clinicians themselves putting through comments to cms in regards to this reimbursement with regard to the site of service i mean there is a certain amount of flexibility there for physicians and many of the urologists would have part of their workload would be in an office environment part in an afc and it s not uncommon for even part to be in a hospital so that does give the physician to certain amount of flexibility i believe that cms will be open to comment period and i believe that they will listen to what all of these individuals have to say with regard to this with regard to the afc and the hospital reimbursement i mean we re very encouraged by that overall is the 3 increase again this will come into effect on january of 2022 shagun so absolutely no impact on anybody until the end of the year and again it was broad based so there s 600 procedures that are impacted by this shagun and so you can imagine there s going to be a significant amount of comments during that comment period and you had a second question shagun i believe shagun singh chadha wells fargo securities analyst yes so thank you for that so just with respect to q3 at the second half of 2021 i was just wondering if you could talk us through the cadence it doesn t appear that q3 sales that could be below q2 levels eps is just modestly up so what are your thoughts on that consensus currently standards especially with respect to urolift i think last i checked consensus was looking for about 105 thank you liam j kelly chairman president and chief executive officer yeah so kind of playing out as we expected shagun the recovery has been led by the because and asia and europe are lagging so i ll start with overall teleflex so and this covid has not gone away and we re monitoring the situation very closely and i for what it s worth will add my voice of encouragement for people to please get vaccinated the key here is getting people vaccinated because the second there are third or fourth wave we re on now is not impacting those that are vaccinated and not impacting geographies where people i have vaccinated so we remain cautiously optimistic and we re very encouraged by the trends that we saw from q1 to q2 and we expect the stability of q2 to continue and that has given us the confidence to maintain our full year revenue guidance despite the respiratory divestiture headwind in any of the language that would be seen in the call up of between 28 and 32 million on the revenue and obviously a significant a call up on our eps as well so for overall teleflex what i expect is our growth to accelerate in the back half of the year versus the first half we grew 8 6 constant currency in the first half of the year if you take the midpoint of our revenue guidance range inclusive of the 4 6 divestiture headwind that would imply acceleration in the second half to 9 6 inclusive of that if you exclude the divestiture headwind it s about 11 2 in the back half versus the 8 6 so full year we have effectively has had raised our revenue guidance and our strong eps and this is the second quarter again as investors will know that we have raised both our revenue and eps with regard to urolift as i said a few moments ago i expect the absolute other values of urolift to increase in q3 versus q2 and again in q4 versus q3 in that regard so thank you for the questions shagun operator we have a question from matthew o brien with piper sandler your line is open matthew o brien piper sandler analyst good morning and you for taking my questions and i m going to stick on urolift as well for give all the questions here but liam there s a proposal for down roughly 20 in addition to of that you talked about if it ends up being down 10 in the final rule would you have to cut their price and by how much in that setting and then do you think clinicians will start to deploy last staples per case if that were the situation liam j kelly chairman president and chief executive officer so would have no impact on the number of staples matt because the 2 coal is one is for for staples and the other done is for all additional staples thereafter so it wouldn t and it s the cuts have been defined across the board on all of the different categories i think that we will assess what we will do once we get the final ruling obviously a 10 reduction is a lot less draconian than a 20 reduction but i would imagine that common sense will prevail if you look at what cms did in the prior ruling they added a covid impact of about 3 50 and speaking with the members of the key associations their expectation was that that would be removed and this ruling and nothing more than that so we ll see how it plays out but i don t see it having a significant impact or having to make all any changes to our overall pricing structure because we have strength in all care settings in the afc in the office in the hospital and in all of those areas so we probably have an advantage with that certain amount of flexibility matt that other companies don t matthew o brien piper sandler analyst got it very helpful and then the follow up is on i think competitive side of things i would just love to get your view on surgical robots for bph and the pros and cons of that is that an area that you think you need to eventually have a presence in liam j kelly chairman president and chief executive officer yeah there is one out there the pro separable about out there matt the it is getting some utilizations robots are seen as being somewhat easy right now but it s really treating tarp and what we hear in the feedback is it requires a secondary procedure because it doesn t u s he has actually use the jet of water and when you use water it doesn t because you don t have any heat to stop the bleeding so therefore it requires a second procedure by the surgeon to afterwards and stop the bleeding and in a recent podiums speech that was raised by a number of urologists and in their pivotal trial there were a number of patients that had to had blood transfusions where there were issues with excessive bleeding so i think it s i don t see it as really a treatment for bph are the technology that s going to impact on urolift and our clinical data is rock solid it s ours the minimally invasive procedure no catheter no sexual dysfunction and we have a large bowl of trained physicians that are rolling out urolift so we re aware of it matt but i don t see it as the need for us to get into robotics would be the direct answer to your question matthew o brien piper sandler analyst great thank you very much liam j kelly chairman president and chief executive officer thanks matt operator the next question is from mike your line is open michael stephen matson needham company yeah hi thanks for taking my questions i have another one on the urolift reimbursement so i think you said around 30 of the procedures were being done in the office setting so i guess what i was wondering is what was the growth in that setting i mean is that a bigger contributor to growth or has kind of been growing in line with the rest of the business liam j kelly chairman president and chief executive officer so thanks for the question mike there has been growing in line with the rest of the business during covid there was a little bit of a shift to more procedures to the office but that s the only impact that you could take into consideration but very much in line with our other sites of service in the business michael stephen matson needham company okay so it s not like the the reimbursement level was creating some significant incentive to do more procedures in that setting or something like that right liam j kelly chairman president and chief executive officer no the urolift was profitable in all sites of service and i said earlier that s an advantage that we have over almost every other treatment modality we have flexibility whereas others don t and again it s 30 of the procedures in approximately 70 of those of that 30 mike is medicare mitigate michael stephen matson needham company okay got it and then my second question which is be on pricing i don t know if you quantify the pricing benefit but i guess just stepping back in terms of pricing just given what s happening in the broader economy with inflation and things like that do you think it s getting any maybe any easier to get some pricing increases to their products liam j kelly chairman president and chief executive officer so mike i ve been doing this a long time and i can tell you i can count on no hands no fingers no toes the amount of times the customer call me up and ask me for a price increase and so it s a tough environment always looking for pricing but as i said on the last earnings call we got out ahead of this early we anticipated that there might be some movement in price momentum and we had about 20 basis points of positive pricing in q1 that actually accelerated in q2 we took some additional opportunities in q2 and we continue to view that very closely on the other side of the ledger on the inflation side we feel we have that very much under control within our in particular in our global supply chain any inflation that we saw it begin last year in transportation and that was already in our run rate and we saw some modest inflation in some of our resins but it was pretty it s been very manageable and we re going to get more than offset it with really positive pricing and building momentum in the quarter with that positive pricing michael stephen matson needham company okay great thanks liam j kelly chairman president and chief executive officer thanks mike operator anthony charles petrone jefferies llc research hi great thanks and i want to say congratulations to larry on the new role at the company couple of questions here one liam is just the overall procedure backlog sort of environment a lot of chatter on that this earnings season certainly hard to quantify but as you look across the portfolios is there any way to sort of view how much deferred procedure backlog is still out there and perhaps which segments with a benefit most into the back end of the year and i ll have one follow up liam j kelly chairman president and chief executive officer so anthony thank you for acknowledging larry we re happy to have them on the teleflex ship regarding the backlog it s hard for us to quantify in all transparency there has to be a backlog of procedures out there because for almost a year there were very few procedures done and i think that any backlog of procedures will be dependent on site of service and customer confidence in coming back so therefore again back to the cms decision that i mentioned this would not be i think the most appropriate time to make that change that they re talking about because patients themselves see an office or an afc environment is a much safer place to go and get a procedure done and it s a lower cost side of service for the person getting them but i would imagine that there has to be backlog in particular in our urolift business there has to be a backlog in our surgical business and that has to be a backlog on our interventional business it s hard for us to map out i don t think we ve seen much of it yet anthony come through the system because there just isn t that additional capacity in the half in they re probably going to do some of those more acute procedure as far as we re not baking it that in any significant backlog into our thinking in the back half of the year i can tell you anthony charles petrone jefferies llc research okay and then the follow up would be on on urolift in i m just going to sneak one in a month or so on urolift can you just level set on how many procedures active users are doing on a monthly basis and the average number of implants we re assuming it s still 4 5 implants and then that was a breakout just some color on it was that new center usage share gain or just kind of a rebound from backlog thanks again liam j kelly chairman president and chief executive officer yeah so i ll start with the urolift so the urolift the average still about 4 5 implants and as we recover out of covid were just around that that for procedures per average urologist with regard to manta e continue to see manta grow it had an outstanding quarter and the areas that we re seeing procedures come in is still predominantly in that tyler area about 80 of them were in tavr in that quarter consistent with q1 but 11 and evar and a modest 40 in that so we continue to train physicians we re penetrating more accounts and it is one of the areas anthony that we re going to put some investment in the back half of the year because we want to actually train more interventionalists and we see this is an as future catalysts for teleflex growth good solid sustainable growth for the company right teleflex and you should expect to see us put more feet on the street and doing more additional train and bring more docs on at a faster pace operator thank you next is from richard newitter from leerink partners your line is open richard s newitter svb leerink llc hi thanks for taking the questions i just had a couple of hit more here on urolift i know it s got a lot of attention but i think it s important first is on price what are your options liam the price differentiate by care setting if you had you just is there a way to use rebates where you keep pricing and one setting at one level and then if you needed to keep to keep the doctor whole should there be any cuts and then i have a follow up liam j kelly chairman president and chief executive officer yeah rich obviously we have this our pricing strategy once we get the final ruling but to answer your question yes we have flexibility based on site of service and based on the individual contracts that are in existence so that flexibility remains with us as you know we are not a price reducing company and i never have been and it is not our intention to be that it is our expectation that we will maintain our overall average selling price for all of our product categories but we do have a certain amount of flexibility to answer your question directly richard s newitter svb leerink llc that s helpful and then just maybe two quick ones here so on the third quarter commentary especially with respect to urolift feel free to answer total company as well i just if you look at the urolift ramp the consensus is that i think someone mentioned 103 1 04 million a sequential improvement off of 92 it leaves a wide range between the possibilities of where consensus is and what that could mean i think it will be helpful for investors to just give a sense relative to the consensus is it just right a little conservative little too aggressive for the ramp i think any color there would be helpful and then while i have you just on japan is there any japan contribution assumed in that 30 for the back half of the year what s definition of modest and how do we think about a year one kind of contribution case for japan when and if you get approval for reverse and thanks liam j kelly chairman president and chief executive officer so let me start and rich because i m not going to comment on consensus so on japan we modest means modest rich we have a very modest amount of dollars in the quarter 4 number for urolift it s a 2 billion down our market the only predicate we have for a ramp is what happened in the united states and think of japan is about a 3rd of the size of the united states market and what happened in the us in the very first year we did buy them we did 16 and then we had 50 and once you had built that base of 50 million then it accelerated to over 100 million then 200 and 300 so on so forth now japan has an advantage in that it s a single payer market so once we get reimbursement we can sell it all sites of service it is also the conservative market we ve already identified the 20 top key opinion leaders in order to start driving adoption and the way it works there it s quite higher once you get those key opinion leaders you get them training speaking on the podium then it will start to trickle down to the other urology practice we will start in the tertiary hospitals that the key thought leaders and build it out from there and we give a lot more detail on the size of the different markets in japan and other geographies that we re intending on the tagging once we get our investor day later in the year i will say that we will be in japan before any of our competitors will get there we re well ahead of the market in regards to that and we also believe will be in the china market well ahead of any of our following competitors so we have time to build a market make this a standard of care that s also an advantage compared to the us because as you know both competing technologies resume in urolift for in the market around the same time actually resume was probably there just a little bit before and back to the urolift rather than talking about the consensus i ll just reiterate what i said earlier rich we expect sequential improvement in absolute dollars in q3 over q2 and in q4 over q3 thank you operator matthew mishan keybanc good ok thank questions i m just a bigger picture question what is your sense of why cms can make these changes specifically to the physician office and then how many how feasible is it for 30 of the procedure that you re talking back to just switched from a physician office to an asc setting liam j kelly chairman president and chief executive officer so i think matt just don t ever forget that first of all urologists choosy of cares of the patient and they able to do the right thing by the patient and give the best procedures of that patient so i think the one thing to make no doubt is that urolift is a minimally invasive procedure instant relief no sexual dysfunction no side effects and the patient will not have to to where to catheter in the event that once they have the procedures so we made it an easy decision for the clinician to actually pick urolift over any of the technology and that s why we are the dominant player in the space with regards to shift site of service i don t think we re once we get the pie i m hopeful that once we get the final ruling that that may become a mute point as to shifting site of service where one area to another in that regard and i think that s the motivation behind cms is difficult for me to ascertain at this stage in all transparency and but we will engage with them and as we engage with them we will obviously listen to what they have to see and that s what i said earlier on we need to understand what their motivation because it is not clear to us at this stage what drove this change on 600 surgical procedures performed in an office matthew mishan keybanc fair enough and then for tom just on the margin profile that s an effectively from major change first half versus kind of what we were thinking are you managing costs effectively here is it mix or this is a structural improvement toward your previous long term targets on higher sales thomas powell executive vice president and chief financial officer so i would say as we think about the margin improvement in the guidance i think that s what you re asking is what s driving that is that yes we obviously are managing expenses and costs but i would say that really what we saw is very nice i would say manufacturing efficiency throughout the first half of the year with the expectation that will continue into the back half of the year we ve also seen a lot of the businesses recover from their covid kind of depressed levels and those businesses that recovered well are some of our higher margin brands so we saw our surgical our intervene interventional urology all move upwards in terms of their recovery and that helped drive the margin as well if you think about just kind of a first half second half we do expect in the second half of the year that there will be incremental expense associated with running the business as we continue to see our business and really the industry returns to more of a normalized state we expect our people to be out traveling more we expect to resume hiring etc and so we will see if some additional operating expenses in the second half of the year relative to the first half and we also have some investment as we mentioned we ve put some investment into the plan that s incremental to what we previously had in behind urolift as well as manta so i would say that overall we re really encouraged by gross margin and where that s going and then based on the success in the first half of the year at a fortunate the opportunity little more investment in the back half operator liam j

record quarter as the healthcare system continued its march toward normalcy we continue to see patient flows trending toward more traditional patterns and the momentum we saw in the first quarter occupancy has continued into the second in fact from the low point of our pandemic period census which we hit in december of 2020 our same store and transitioning operations have already improved by 52 percentage points we were particularly pleased that we achieved sequential growth in occupancies from the first to the second quarter which is especially impressive given that we always expect a seasonal decrease in occupancies in the summer months the solid results were achieved by our local leadership teams who have remained an absolutely integral part of the healthcare continuum during the pandemic these excellent results during what continues to be one of the largest global healthcare challenges in our history are what set ensign affiliates apart our operations have played a pivotal role in the preservation of the healthcare continuum despite the great challenges they have faced because they adjusted and adapted to meet the acute needs of their markets we are pleased to see that those efforts are being rewarded by their hospital managed care partners who have and continue to entrust our operations with the care of their patients while we are excited about our accomplishments for the quarter we know that we can do so much better in so many ways and we look forward to seeing our operations achieve even more as they continue to make evident the enormous potential within our portfolio as we return to and exceed pre covid levels we saw continued sequential improvement in occupancy over the first quarter with same store and transitioning occupancy improving by 170 basis points and 150 basis points respectively in addition our managed care census for the same for same store and transitioning portfolios increased by 33 9 and 27 9 from the prior year quarter respectively our record results in the quarter came from a multifaceted approach that included efforts to improve occupancies but also involved a renewed focus on operational fundamentals including operational expense management and improved cash collections we also continue to benefit from sequestration suspension and improved medicaid funding in certain states as the pent up demand for healthcare services in our markets has continued to increase our managed care skilled mix days and managed care average daily census improved again for an impressive fourth consecutive quarter also our combined same store and transitioning managed care revenues for the quarter were up sequentially for the fourth quarter in a row at the same time our skilled mix has remained higher than pre covid levels with a combined same store and transitioning skill mix of 31 5 during the second quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2020 which was 29 3 we re also very encouraged to see that some of our more mature markets like most of arizona and colorado have already returned to pre covid occupancy levels we expect the positive trend in occupancy to continue throughout the year subject to some seasonality as volumes and higher acute settings and managed care utilization continue to increase also we want to just briefly touch on the potential resurgence of covid in some of our markets we re pleased to report that so far we ve only seen a very minimal number of cases across our portfolio however we remain vigilant and despite the worrisome covid trends we remain confident that our local operators and their clinically focused teams will rise to any challenge ahead if the new variant of the covid virus persists we have the ability to rely on the many many lessons learned during the pandemic including infection control procedures and treatment protocol we also have many more tools at our disposal than we did when the pandemic first arrived on the scene including access to the vaccine and many forms of testing in addition we are grateful that the federal government has extended the state of emergency to october 18 2021 which keeps in place many of the regulatory and other forms of assistance helpful to patient care throughout our history staffing has been a challenge when the economy is performing well and unemployment is low so while this challenge is real it s something we have seen and managed through many different times before in addition these particular staffing challenges have some unique transitory factors that we do not anticipate to persist including child care issues created by school closures and temporary unemployment benefits that have had a substantial impact on the labor markets we ve also seen some of these pressures being lifted in states that have ended certain unemployment benefits like in arizona where our operator saw an almost immediate increase in the labor pool we fully expect that some of these temporary pressures will continue to improve in the meantime rather than taking a passive approach we are highly focused on ensuring that our culture and our overall experience is the best it can be our model encourages innovation in the face of challenges for example in one market we ve developed an in house nurse aide training program that s generated over 150 cnas in the last five months we ve also seen tremendous success in our nursing leadership development programs in fact over the course of the last few years our clinical leadership was able were able to train and promote 22 of our nurses to a director of nursing role we also continue to elevate our recruiting and have already seen success from these new efforts as we announced yesterday we increased our 2021 annual earnings guidance to 3 55 to 3 67 per diluted share up from the previous guidance of 3 54 to 3 66 per diluted share and affirmed our previous annual revenue guidance of 2 62 billion to 2 69 billion the midpoint of this 2021 earnings guidance represents an increase of over 15 from our 2020 results which were 103 higher than our 2019 results yesterday s increase comes from the strong results during the first half of the year continued positive trends in occupancy and the continuation of state funding our current health combined with our culture proven leadership strategy healthy balance sheet the enormous potential in our existing portfolio and the tremendous acquisition opportunities on the horizon gives us confidence that we are well positioned to not only rebound to our pre covid path but to accelerate our growth obviously our performance wouldn t be possible without the enormous sacrifice and ownership that we see from our local leaders caregivers and other frontline staff our confidence comes from our belief that we have the best and the brightest leaders and caregivers in post acute care we again express our love and appreciation for all of our amazing team members especially those on the frontlines for all that they re doing to serve their communities we honor them and are so grateful for them we certainly expect some challenges ahead but we re excited about the year ahead of us and look forward to showing our dedication to all those that have entrusted us with the care of their loved ones and with that i ll ask chad to give us an update on our recent investment activity chad chad a keetch chief investment officer executive vice president secretary thank you barry we made significant progress during the quarter in our effort to create a structure that will allow us to better demonstrate the growing value in our owned real estate as you are aware we took the first step in the fourth quarter of 2020 when we began reporting the results of our real estate portfolio as a new and independent reporting segment which is comprised of properties owned by us and leased to affiliated skilled nursing and senior living operations and 31 senior living operations that are leased to the pennant group each of these properties are subject to triple net long term leases and generated rental revenue of 16 million during the quarter of which 12 1 million was derived from ensign affiliated operations also for the second quarter of 2021 we reported 13 7 million in ffo which represents an increase of 10 5 over the prior year quarter of 12 4 million we hope that this extra disclosure will be helpful to our current and prospective investors who are familiar with our history of successfully incubating businesses as they evaluate this growing part of our business which we believe is a key differentiator in the market since our last call our engaged advisors have helped us begin to prepare a structure inside of ensign that highlights this value while not losing sight of our purpose driven mission and allows us to retain the ownership in this real estate we envision a structure that not only creates better visibility into the demonstrable value of our owned real estate but also will provide us with an efficient vehicle for future acquisitions of properties that could be operated by ensign affiliates or other third parties which we believe will give us a new pathway to growth with transactions that we would not have considered in the past and even though we do not anticipate doing a public spin off one of our priorities in designing this entity is to create a structure that will preserve the optionality to access both public and private markets in the future as we have done in other transformative transactions including two spin offs and other new ventures we are taking the necessary time to ensure that with the help of our experts and advisors that we re dotting all the i s and crossing all the t s in this important decision as we do so our focus is to implement strategies that will allow us to take advantage of our strengths to accelerate our growth and to enhance our purpose driven mission to transform post acute care we are very excited about the new opportunities embedded in this chapter of our growth story and we expect to make a more detailed announcement regarding this real estate strategy next quarter we re also excited about our recent acquisition activity during the quarter we ramped up our growth efforts with the addition of eight skilled nursing operations after a brief pause on our acquisition efforts during the early months of the pandemic our teams have shown their commitment to one of the things that drives our organization which is to consistently and methodically acquire not only in good times but even when it would be easier to shut down growth while waiting out the store the following skilled nursing operations were acquired during the quarter and since boulder canyon health and rehabilitation berthoud care and rehabilitation and south valley post acute rehabilitation all in colorado adding a total of 322 beds in that state we also included windsor rehabilitation and healthcare which added 108 beds in the state of texas and mira vista care center shoreline health and rehabilitation the oaks at lakewood and the oaks at timberline adding a total of 386 beds in the state of washington we are also pleased to be expanding our continued and growing relationship with caretrust and are happy to announce that in connection with this transaction in washington caretrust extended the our lease term by 10 years on the first to expire master lease pool we are grateful for the strengthening of our long standing partnership with caretrust and look forward to working closely with them in the future including a transaction that we hope to announce in the very near future with these latest additions we have added 17 properties to our organization since the pandemic began last year given our first priority is always to make sure our existing operations are strong we have been extra diligent to ensure that each new addition had the full support of the healthy market a proven leadership plan and a clear pathway to strong clinical and financial performance each of these new additions have been carefully selected and were acquired at attractive prices and terms we are very excited to watch these operations become solid contributors to their clusters as they follow proven ensign principles as we look ahead to the remainder of the year and into 2022 the pipeline for our typical turnaround opportunities remains strong that pipeline continues to be impacted however by the extension of certain covid related government programs that have and continue to help distressed operations we anticipate an increase in the number of opportunities once these programs wind down in the meantime we have a handful of deals that we expect to close yet this year and also expect additional opportunities to come our way this fall we have a lot of capacity to grow including from a leadership and capital perspective but we will always make sure to stay true to our principles of disciplined growth as we mentioned in our release yesterday we have over 340 million in available capital in addition we have 75 completely unlevered real estate assets we continue to work on unlocking some equity value in a handful of our owned and unlevered real estate assets through long term fixed rate hud financing we expect to close this process on four of those operations and hope to have an announcement on that in the next few weeks and with that i ll turn the call back over to barry barry barry port chief executive officer and director thanks chad before suzanne runs through the numbers we d like to share an example that demonstrates what dozens of our operations across the portfolio have done to adjust to the changing operating environment as we have stated in the past the true strength of our operating model comes from the talented driven and compassionate facility leaders who are constantly innovating and finding ways to be the provider of choice for the communities they serve as a result even mature same store operations within our portfolio have tremendous potential for organic growth for example bella vita health and rehabilitation center in glendale arizona was acquired in 2002 and has been a highly successful contributing part of the bandera portfolio for over a decade last year during the height of the covid pandemic bella vita received a contract to operate a 40 bed specialty unit which allowed the local acute hospitals to discharge active covid and covid recovering patients to preserve their ability to care for the most critically ill this and other efforts solidified bella vita s already strong relationship with local providers hospitals and continuum partners and resulted in record financial results in 2020 this year as covid cases have plummeted and the unit closed ceo tedd glazebrook and director of nursing jennifer clay adjusted their strategy to meet the changing needs of their community while improving fundamentals like culture and expense management as a cms rated 5 star operation they continued to invest in clinical training and requested increased audits from their clinical support resources they took their leadership team on field trips to other high performing cluster partner facilities in the phoenix area to learn and share best practices related to pdpm and billing and they scrubbed their contracts with vendors to ensure that their facility was receiving the best pricing and services recognizing the need to regrow census as the covid unit was closed the bella team met with local managed care organizations physicians and other referral sources and sought feedback on how to better serve the needs of the glendale community in response to the direct feedback they received the team then parlayed the feedback into enhanced behavioral health capabilities and a quicker and more seamless admissions process as a result in q2 bella vita grew occupancy by 14 to 97 skilled mix also skyrocketed from 28 to 50 for the quarter and as a result quarterly ebit improved 110 from the same quarter in 2020 all while maintaining medicare 5 star quality ratings and successfully completing deficiency free infection control surveys we hope that this example is helpful in illustrating all the different levers our local operators have to pull to quickly and responsibly adjust to the needs and the feedback of their healthcare partners with that i ll turn the time over to suzanne to provide more detail on the company s financial performance and our guidance and then we ll open it up for questions suzanne suzanne d snapper chief financial officer executive vice president thank you barry and good morning everyone detailed financials for the quarter are contained in the 10 q and press release filed yesterday some additional highlights for the quarter include gaap diluted earnings per share of 0 87 representing an increase of 19 over the prior year quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share was 0 89 an increase of 14 over the prior year quarter consolidated gaap revenues and adjusted revenues were both 638 5 million both increasing 9 over the prior year quarter gaap net income was 49 4 million an increase of 23 over the prior year quarter and adjusted net income was 50 9 million an increase of 18 over the prior year quarter other key metrics as of june 30 include cash and cash equivalents of 198 4 million cash flow from operations of 108 4 million and 340 million of availability on a revolving line of credit we continue to de lever our portfolio achieving lease adjusted net debt to ebitdar ratio of 2 2 times these improvements are attributable to growth in our ebitdar from same store transitioning and newly acquired operations as well as enhanced cash collections we own 95 assets 75 of which are unlevered with significant equity that provides us with even more liquidity in addition we continue to return all provider relief funds that we have received to date which as of june 2021 totaled over 153 million as we mentioned last quarter suspension of the 2 sequestration was extended through december 31 2021 the suspension have and will continue to have a positive impact on the revenue depending upon how the pandemic affects our medicare census last week the federal health emergency was extended for another 90 days to october 18 2021 with this extension the federal government will continue to provide various waivers and fmap funding however medicaid reimbursement and the timing of payments vary substantially by state currently we anticipate two of the states in which we operate to continue to have approved funding we are raising our 2021 annual earnings guidance to 3 55 to 3 67 per diluted share and maintain our annual revenue guidance of 2 62 billion to 2 69 billion the midpoint of this updated 2021 earnings guidance represents an increase of over 15 over our 2020 results our increased 2021 guidance is based on diluted weighted average common shares outstanding of approximately 57 8 million a tax rate of 25 inclusion of anticipated medicare and medicaid reimbursement rate increases net of provider tax the recovery of covid 19 pandemic with the primary exclusion coming from stock based compensation in addition other factors that could impact our quarterly performance include variations in reimbursement systems delays and changes in state budgets seasonality in occupancy and skilled mix the influence of general economy on our census and staffing the short term impact of our acquisition activities variation in insurance accruals surges in covid and other factors and with that i ll turn the call back over to barry barry barry port chief executive officer and director thanks suzanne we want to again thank you for joining us today and express our appreciation to our shareholders for their confidence and support we recognize the heroic efforts of our nurses therapists and other frontline care providers who have courageously faced this pandemic and provided life enriching care to our residents and their families we also are appreciative of our colleagues here at the service center who are working tirelessly to support our operations and enabling us to succeed in spite of the challenges that we faced thank you for making us better every day we ll now turn over to the q a portion of our call we ll be joined by spencer burton our chief operating officer latif can you please instruct the audience on the q a procedure questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of frank morgan of rbc capital markets your question please frank morgan rbc capital markets analyst good morning or good afternoon yes i guess maybe starting at a high level i m curious about any kind of update on the acquisition market opportunity i know you alluded to some federal dollars that may have kept delayed some of these acquisitions recurring but just curious kind of any thoughts on when the timing you think that might improve and the opportunities may or those might come to fruition and how much of that s driven by perhaps what comes out of the pdpm final rule i guess i did my first question chad a keetch chief investment officer executive vice president secretary yes thanks frank i think we re it s interesting because we re seeing a pretty steady flow of opportunities that most i would say are unrelated to kind of covid related items they re just sort of folks retiring and getting out of the business for various reasons and kind of the typical deal flow we still expect a bigger pipeline in the near future i would say now a lot of this depends on some of the things you mentioned including the pdpm final rule i think that just be yet another issue for a lot of these smaller and distressed operators i think we see usually there is an uptick kind of in the fourth quarter as folks are planning and wanting to get a deal done in the tax year those kinds of things so we do anticipate that and then really 2022 is probably where we re going to see most of that deal flow frank morgan rbc capital markets analyst got you and i know obviously you ve got the extension of the federal emergency through october and you mentioned i think a couple of states that have already approved got some approved funding increases there so are there any maybe color on the states that you have it and how meaningful are those states and then how would you handicap other states that might also apply for that funding suzanne d snapper chief financial officer executive vice president yes frank a great question i think we ve been talking about this every quarter since it started and really there s two states that have been strongest and for us our california and texas and those are the key states that we rereferenced obviously those are our two largest states and say it is a pretty meaningful portion of what we ve been seeing for fmap the last couple of quarters there are other states that we feel like there is a very strong possibility that they re going to get in and it s baked into kind of the higher end of the guidance as we go through things like arizona and some of the other states yes there is just a couple of other states that we do feel like there is an opportunity for us to get some additional funds just not the same magnitude as the california and the state of texas frank morgan rbc capital markets analyst got you and those california texas those are baked into your updated guidance suzanne d snapper chief financial officer executive vice president correct frank morgan rbc capital markets analyst got you okay maybe one last high level i m sorry go ahead suzanne d snapper chief financial officer executive vice president no that s correct frank morgan rbc capital markets analyst okay yes one last high level question you mentioned that you saw a fairly immediate impact in the labor pool in some of the states in markets where the unemployment extended benefit had ended maybe talk about those states and are there any states at the top of the list that you think might also be getting close to premature or on early basis dropping those extended benefits barry port chief executive officer and director i don t know that there are any others that we foresee dropping out before kind of the september timeframe i ll tell you one that we saw an immediate impact with and this is still very anecdotal because it was very recent as in the state of arizona it s been reported to us by several of our operators that they saw an almost immediate uptick in the number of applicants they see for positions in their operations and that s continued so we hope that s the case in states like texas we certainly need more folks in the labor pool a lot of those that have been impacted by the extended unemployment benefits are folks that we can use immediately so chad a keetch chief investment officer executive vice president secretary seven out of our states have had an early end to the unemployment benefit and we are seeing some gradual loosening but we think there s many factors at play some of them are just the efforts that we ve been making all year long there s schools going back into session there is a lot of play but it certainly isn t hurting to have that unemployment go away and get people motivated again to get back to work frank morgan rbc capital markets analyst got you and i think barry you in your prepared comments you talked about the expectations for continued improvement in occupancies just any color is that to be improved maybe some color around kind of how you see the skill mix developing as that occupancy continues to grow barry port chief executive officer and director yes i mean i think we saw the dip in skill mix that we expected to happen from the height of the pandemic back in december and that gradually kind of tapered down to a more normal number which is what we ve been seeing recently it s still higher than where we were last year which is good to see i think that s a mix we re really comfortable with and hope to stay at and we hope to just see our overall occupancy continue to climb we almost always by june and july we see occupancy start to dip and thankfully we hadn t seen that go into june and we still haven t seen that be the case so we re hopeful that our trend of improvement continues in spite of the summer months and continues to get stronger as the fall comes near frank morgan rbc capital markets analyst got you one last one maybe a chad question on this potential new structure that you re putting together maybe if you could just talk about would it have an effect on your balance sheet or your leverage level and just would it in any way change your ability to bring more turnaround assets onto the books and i ll hop off thanks chad a keetch chief investment officer executive vice president secretary yes no the transaction or structure itself won t have a material impact on our balance sheet we re not looking to do any sort of significant borrowings or anything like that in connection with what we re talking about that said we do think it will give us access to different forms of borrowings in the future we ll always be careful to make sure that we re watching our balance sheet and being very careful about that and obviously our leverage levels are really low which gives us a lot of that dry powder that we talked about so in terms of doing additional turnaround opportunities i think as i kind of mentioned in the script there are a lot of deals that we see that cross over state boundaries the states that were not in and other factors that might make it a deal that isn t one that we would want to operate and in many cases we find ourselves not participating in those processes and i think what we re thinking and hoping is it a structure like this would help us both potentially do those on our own and lease to third parties or partner with other real estate entities as well to find ways to do deals that in the past we wouldn t have done so we are excited about the additional pathway we think it will give us to grow frank morgan rbc capital markets analyst thank you thanks for the questions operator thank you our next question comes from tao qiu of stifel your line is open tao qiu stifel analyst hey good morning and thank you for taking my questions so the first question is too on investment the full washington state assets transition from five oaks to you was a pretty interesting transaction i think you mentioned that you expect another transaction with caretrust soon i assume you are getting more inbound calls from them was either because their existing operators are in distress or they re making a strategic decision to realign the portfolio any color on the opportunity set there and your criteria in terms of taking of these assets and also if you look at the pipeline today how much of that will be owned versus leased chad a keetch chief investment officer executive vice president secretary yes so i guess i ll start with your last part first i mean we have done quite a few lease deals over the last year and we still think that s a really attractive way for us to grow assuming the coverages are healthy and the lease yields all makes sense and we ll continue to do that in the future that said our real estate strategy is also important to us and the extent we have the opportunity to buy real estate especially for distressed assets that maybe don t have much in terms of coverage or sometimes no coverage at all that might be a little bit more difficult to structure a 30 year lease around those are the times when it makes a lot of sense for us to buy the assets and then obviously improve them to a point where they do produce coverages etc so that and i guess in terms of what we prefer i guess it s a combination of both and that s been our history and we ll continue to do it that way remaining true to the opportunity and staying opportunistic about it we don t start the year saying we re going to do x number of deals and this many leases and this many purchases we just approach each opportunity individually and evaluate those opportunities with respect to our recent activity with caretrust this was an opportunity that essentially the existing or the prior operator is really looking to exit the business and we actually have had a relationship with the prior operator and of course have long partnership with caretrust and so it was a really sort of win win situation for everybody the party exiting the business was able to hand their operation over to someone that they know well and trust very very much and handed us entrusted us with continuing what they started and then from both our point of view and caretrust s point of view we re able to just expand that relationship and continue to move forward in terms of the future deals i think we ll always look to be there for them when they have tenants like that that are looking to move on or maybe pair off certain states or other things like that and then of course new opportunities as well so really just appreciate the relationship we have with caretrust and all of our reit partners that understand us and our strategy to grow and we look forward to doing more and more with them in the future tao qiu stifel analyst got you so just a follow up on the real estate platform i think one of the opportunities you have mentioned in the past is that you could potentially take on assets that may not be operated by you how big is the opportunity there are you starting to build a pipeline today chad a keetch chief investment officer executive vice president secretary yes great question it is something on our minds and we are starting to think along that path how big the opportunity could be is it could be very significant but that said one of the reasons we re doing it the way we re doing it is we don t see ourselves as just a real estate company or just an operator we re both and so and with that our operations and our operational focus is our core of who we are and we re never going to lose that and with that i think we can use that point of view to really help potentially other operators that are in states we re not in we re currently in 13 states there is a lot of states that are very attractive but we just don t know much about and this pathway that we re talking about potentially could help us even get a look into new states and to look into other ways of doing things and we think we have a lot of knowledge and information that we can share at the same time and so i think it s something we re excited about i do think it will help accelerate our growth but we re going to stay true to who we are and how we grow and work it s not going to be something that dramatically changes our approach to acquisitions barry port chief executive officer and director and tao i d just add one small thing i agree with everything that chad has said we really like the industry that we re in we see enormous opportunity to transform post acute care and we know we can t necessarily do that all by ourselves and so strategically to expand our mission we hope to align with other great operators that we know are out there and that will take some time to vet and find and maybe even help develop over time but it s enormously important for us strategically to have a way to be able to align with other good operators or potentially future good contributors in our space tao qiu stifel analyst got you sounds good my second question is really about the volume trends i think in the last two weeks the public hospital operators have reported very strong patient volume and surgical volume this quarter i think that should be very positive refill to your census numbers near term but i think a few companies also commented that they saw demand got pulled forward into earlier quarters therefore expect volume to be trending softer through the end of the year in their guidance considering the fact that your guidance suggest a ramp up in the second half how should we think about the demand on the post acute side toward year end barry port chief executive officer and director yes it s a good question and really it s a really nuanced answer because every state is tremendously different and every hospital system is on kind of a different path even within similar markets our optimism is representative of the states that we operate in the geographies that we know well the trends that we see locally but also understanding that there we re kind of in uncharted territory somewhat as well and things can ebb and flow and they might but again seeing our strength through the summer months which is something fairly uncharacteristic in our space it gives us a lot of confidence about where we re headed at the moment tao qiu stifel analyst yes thanks for the color there just one more if i may the managed care patient days have seen very strong growth into the second half of last year and i think the census this quarter was also very robust so speaking of normalization to pre pandemic levels should we expect that you will be able to sustain kind of a higher managed care day mix given all the alignment you have made to commercial payers barry port chief executive officer and director we sure hope so i mean that s our focus and intent and we have a lot of good things going with our managed care partners and we continue to have very in depth discussions about how we can partner take on more risk look for opportunities to enhance services that we offer to their members and then even just providing direct feedback and data that shows our outcomes focused results that we achieve so that we can collaborate and continue to adjust so again we see we ve seen this kind of gradual trend over time with managed care we part of it is a function of returning to normalcy but we believe another piece of that is just our expanding relationships with our different partners so we expect that to continue tao qiu stifel analyst great that s all my questions thank you and congrats barry port chief executive officer and director thanks tao operator our next question comes from the line of scott fidel of stephens your question please scott fidel stephens analyst hi everyone just had a couple of quick ones here first one just wanted to ask on earnings seasonality that s embedded in the outlook for the balance of the year traditionally you tend to have 3q eps looks pretty consistent with the second quarter and then you have a bit of a pickup in the fourth quarter from the 3q numbers just interested just given all these different dynamics at play this year whether you still see that type of seasonality as realistic or anything that you just want to call out around 3q versus 4q anticipated earnings barry port chief executive officer and director yes your observation is absolutely spot on scott and that s our expectation is that third quarter is historically challenging similar to second quarter and so we expect the two although second quarter wasn t as challenging for us as we expected but we feel similarly about third quarter that we did about second quarter expect that to be somewhat comparable although we ll see and then fourth quarter is almost always a much stronger month for us and so we don t see much deviation from that historical cadence scott fidel stephens analyst okay and then just one question on a separate topic so it looks like the final fy 2020 case deferral has put it on beat so that could be dropping about pretty much any day right now so just would be helpful if you just want to remind us on some of the base case assumptions that you have for fy 2022 that you ve built in at this point in terms of rate and then just i guess sort of final thoughts heading into the final rule here up on the proposal that cms has had to recalibrate the pdpm model in any dialog that the industry has been having with cms you think that could make some traction around cms maybe recognizing at least more of a phased in approach to that when we get to the final rule and that s it for me thanks suzanne d snapper chief financial officer executive vice president thanks scott i ll try to take that in phases so that s a lot of different things right there and first and foremost right just a reminder april they dropped the preliminary rule i think the market basket average that they kind of put out there and that preliminary rule is 2 3 and the one unique thing that that preliminary rule had in it for us particularly is it held the value based purchasing component of the rate increase flat meaning everyone is kind of treated equally and for that aspect that actually takes that rate down so that will be lower than our market basket average if that kind of stays flat so and that s not outside the norm for us on average what we ve seen for these rates are between 1 and 3 increase we aren t reliant our process isn t reliant on that market basket increase really what we do is look at how to continue to drive acuity and ensure that our systems that we don t think are fully developed for pdpm in the first place continue to capture additional acuity and so those are the assumptions built into the guidance with regards to kind of overall strategy with regards to if there is going to be a phased in approach or not a phased in approach i mean i think what we continue to hear is that if anything happens which most have kind of stepped away from that right now that there would be some huge adjustment but if there was some adjustment that it would be phased in i think more people are saying that they do not expect to face an adjustment at this time scott fidel stephens analyst okay thank you operator thank you at this time i d like to turn the call over to ceo barry port for closing remarks sir barry port chief executive officer and director great thank you latif and we d like to thank everyone else for joining us today appreciate you being on the call and we are grateful

comments we ll open the line for your questions i ll now turn the call over to kevin fogarty kevin kevin m fogarty president and chief executive officer thank you gene and good morning everyone the positive momentum in global demand that we experienced earlier this year continued throughout the second quarter benefiting results for both our polymer and chemical segments while we incurred substantial costs for the planned statutory turnaround at our berre france site and although we faced continued inflation in raw material costs the impact of these factors was largely as we had anticipated as a result we are pleased with our financial results for the second quarter as they were in line with our internal expectations as reported in yesterday s earnings release adjusted ebitda for the second quarter of 2021 was 61 8 million while this was down 7 7 million compared to the second quarter of last year the decrease is attributable to three primary factors in our polymer segment that we believe are transitory in nature and that masks the underlying positive momentum underway in the quarter particularly in our chemicals segment that we believe is setting the stage for positive full year 2020 results specifically polymer segment sales volume was up 10 9 compared to the second quarter of 2020 driven by broad based demand growth across all regions for our specialty polymers business and higher sales into paving and roofing and adhesive applications within our performance products business in our chemical segment we saw a significant gain in sales volume which increased over 32 compared to the second quarter of last year during which time covid 19 had had a pronounced impact on demand while organic growth and favorable market dynamics provided for further expansion in unit margins as a leader in the pine chemical industry kraton remains focused on expanding innovation led growth and consistently encouraging adoption of truly sustainable pine chemical solutions to our customers to replace hydrocarbons for the benefit of all key stakeholders in terms of the specific factors accounting for the decline in consolidated adjusted ebitda versus the second quarter of 2020 during the quarter we successfully completed the significant statutory turnaround at our berre france site which occurs approximately every six years and as such in the second quarter we realized 16 9 million of costs associated with this turnaround excluding the turnaround costs alone adjusted ebitda would have been up 9 2 million or approximately 13 compared to the second quarter of 2020 in addition the raw material environment in the second quarter of this year was the inverse of what we experienced in the second quarter of 2020 so far this year we have seen significant inflation in raw material and transportation costs in contrast in the second quarter of last year butadiene declined to a historically low price level which had allowed for significant margin uplift while the inflationary pressures have continued into the third quarter i should note that based upon improved pricing we have achieved thus far in the third quarter and with continued price actions we expect to take we are anticipating margin expansion in the second half of the year now for those of you who have been following the company over the years you will appreciate that periodic raw material inflation is inevitable in our polymer segment we understand this and more importantly our commercial teams know how to correspondingly respond in the marketplace with pricing actions we have always maintained a critical element of our price right strategy has been to consistently pass along inflation in a manner that our customers can actually predict our behavior that is what market leaders do nevertheless while there is an inherent lag in price realization that can result in near term margin pressure i would again remind you that when the inflation turns to deflation our pricing discipline typically also allows us to expand margins for a period of time much like we did in 2017 finally with regard to polymer segment results as discussed in our second quarter earnings call last year we elected to leverage the extremely low butadiene prices through a strategic inventory build which also contributed to an adjusted ebitda margin of 26 4 given the benefit of favorable fixed cost absorption on quarterly segment profitability in terms of key strategic priorities debt reduction remains a focus area during the second quarter we reduced consolidated net debt by 11 5 million including 6 3 million of unfavorable impact from currency translation and as we have discussed previously through the seasonal working capital release associated with our paving and roofing business we historically generate the majority of our cash in the second half of the year therefore we expect meaningful debt reduction over the next two quarters atanas will provide more insight into our expectations for debt reduction and balance sheet metrics in his comments as evidence of our continued commitment to global to a global circular economy by driving a sustainability focused mindset throughout our company we are extremely pleased to be awarded a platinum level sustainability rating by ecovadis in recognition of our efforts to integrate sustainable principles in our business and management systems the platinum rating is the highest distinction in the ecovadis sustainability rating structure replaces kraton in the top 1 of the universe of approximately 75 000 companies evaluated in addition our circular plus family of performance enhancing products recently received critical guidance recognition from the association of plastic recyclers for our series c 2000 and c 3000 polymers for high density polyethylene bottles this recognition further highlights kraton s ongoing commitment to providing sustainable solutions in packaging design and our efforts to facilitate expansion of the broader circular economy lastly while we do not have specifics we can share at this time regarding our progression toward broader commercial opportunities for biaxam during the second quarter we continued our efforts in the pursuit of a section 3 approval from the u s environmental protection agency that we believe will provide for broader commercial applications for biaxam we continue to believe there are significant market application opportunities for our biaxam technology we re also very pleased to announce that jeff messer has recently joined kraton to lead our biaxam platform development jeff has substantial relevant experience in the antimicrobial space he will oversee and manage all activities associated with biaxam including evaluation development of potential market applications and oversight of the requisite regulatory processes i m now going to turn the call back to our executive vice president and chief financial officer atanas atanasov who will provide more specifics on our financial results for the second quarter of 2021 atanas atanas h atanasov executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you kevin and good morning everyone i ll begin my comments on slide five with a review of the second quarter 2021 financial highlights in light of the favorable market fundamentals and positive demand trends kevin referenced and taking into account the impact of specific factors that played during the quarter the bear turnaround inflationary pressures and tough comparisons against the second quarter of 2020 which benefited from lower raw material prices and the favorable fixed cost absorption associated with strategic inventory build we re very pleased with our results for both the second quarter of 2021 and for the first half of the year moreover we entered the third quarter well positioned to leverage positive market fundamentals and therefore we remain encouraged by our prospects for the second half of 2021 and the year as a whole during the second quarter of 2021 the rebound in global demand from the second quarter 2020 levels in which covid 19 was a factor combined with targeted market development actions led to a strong growth in sales volume chemical sales volume was up over 32 compared to the second quarter of 2020 and polymer sales volume was up almost 11 the increase in sales volume and higher average selling prices associated with higher average raw material costs were the primary drivers of the revenue increase versus the year ago quarter consolidated revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was 493 6 million up 137 9 million or 38 8 compared to the second quarter of 2020 consolidated adjusted ebitda for the second quarter was 61 8 million and while down 7 7 million compared to the second quarter of 2020 more than 100 of the decline is explained by costs associated with the turnaround at berre france excluding the 16 9 million of turnaround costs in the second quarter of 2021 adjusted ebitda would have been up 9 2 million or 13 2 as kevin noted the lower adjusted ebitda compared to the second quarter of 2020 also reflects inflation in raw material and transportation costs and less favorable absorption of fixed costs driven by turnaround activity which results in a challenging comparison to the second quarter of last year during which we d benefited from declining raw material costs and in which our strategic inventory build gave rise to favorable absorption of fixed costs chemical segment adjusted ebitda for the second quarter of 2021 was 35 5 million up 126 2 versus the year ago quarter reflecting higher sales volume in part associated with post covid 19 recovery and expanded yield margins in all product groups with these positive drivers partially offset by higher raw material and logistics costs polymer segment adjusted ebitda for the second quarter of 2021 was 26 3 million down 27 5 million compared to the second quarter of 2020 with the decrease principally reflecting costs associated with the bear turnaround and the impact of higher raw material and transportation and logistics costs and the change in fixed cost absorption between the two periods these pressures were partially offset by improved demand fundamentals and resulting in higher sales volume during the second quarter we reduced consolidated debt by 14 1 million and we reduced consolidated net debt by 11 5 million including the unfavorable 6 3 million effect of foreign currency i ll now move to a review of segment results starting with our polymer segment on page six second quarter 2021 revenue for the polymer segment was 278 4 million up 74 6 million compared to the year ago quarter the increase was driven by higher average selling prices implemented in response to inflation in raw materials and transportation and logistics costs and the 10 9 increase in sales volume specialty polymer sales volume was up 14 6 versus the second quarter of last year and this increase was driven by healthy demand recovery across all regions with particular strength in consumer durables and automotive applications in north america and europe sales volume for performance products was up 12 6 compared to q2 of 2020 principally due to higher sales in north america paving and roofing applications and higher sis sales into adhesives applications the polymer segment adjusted ebitda was 26 3 million in the second quarter of 2021 and this was down 27 5 million compared to the second quarter of 2020 again the components of the decrease include the 16 9 million of costs associated with the bear turnaround inflationary pressures on raw materials and transportation and logistics during the second quarter of 2021 compared to a deflationary raw material environment a year ago particularly if you bid a dine and the absence of fixed cost distortion favorability we had in the second quarter of 2020 associated with the strategic inventory build to leverage low butadiene prices which benefited our margins in the second half of 2020 in fact the second quarter 2021 draw on inventory during the bear turnaround led to less favorable absorption of fixed costs that we otherwise would have had in the second quarter and therefore the relative change in fixed cost absorption between the periods was magnified and the relative change between the two periods explains a significant portion of the period over period decline in adjusted ebitda these factors had a market impact on the quarterly profitability for the polymer segment and as a result the adjusted ebitda margin was 9 5 reflecting approximately 600 basis points reduction for costs associated with the bear turnaround similarly there was a corresponding decline in adjusted gross profit per ton which decreased from 1 040 per ton in the second quarter of 2020 to 615 per ton in the second quarter of 2021 of the 400 limited response to inflation in raw materials with the balance largely reflecting the relative change in fixed costs absorption between the two periods looking at the year to date results for the polymer segment revenue for the first six months of 2021 was 519 6 million up 75 4 million compared to the first half of 2020 the increase in revenue reflects the benefit of higher sales volumes and higher average selling prices implemented in response to higher raw material and transportation and logistics costs for the first half of 2021 polymer segment sales volume increased 8 3 compared to the first half of 2020 this growth was the result of a 19 4 increase in specialty polymer sales volume with growth across all regions but particularly into consumer durable applications in china and broader asia and automotive applications in north america and europe in addition sales volume for performance products increased 9 8 compared to the second quarter of 2020 on higher sales into paving and roofing applications in north america and europe and higher sales of sis associated with favorable global adhesives demand the polymer segment adjusted ebitda for the six months ended june 30 2021 was 63 8 million and this was down 41 2 million compared to the first half of 2020 of the decrease 10 3 million is attributable to the contribution from cariflex in the first half of 2020 prior to its divestiture and of the remaining 30 9 million decrease in adjusted ebitda 19 7 million is associated with costs of the statutory turnaround of our berre france site the 11 2 million balance of the decrease is attributable to the delta and fixed cost absorption between the two periods and the margin pressure associated with inflation in raw materials and transportation and logistics costs given the foregoing for the first half of 2021 the polymer segment adjusted ebitda margin was 12 3 with the cost of the turnaround of bear having a negative impact on adjusted ebitda margin of approximately 380 basis points in addition for the first half of 2021 polymer segment adjusted gross profit was 711 per ton down 345 per ton from the 1 056 per ton for the first half of 2020 of this decrease approximately 40 reflects the sale of cariflex and inflationary pressures approximately 35 relates to the turnaround of bear with the balance largely associated with the relative change in fixed cost absorption between the two periods primarily associated with the inventory build in the first half of 2020 versus a turnaround and inventory draw in the first half of 2021 turning to slide seven for a review of our chemical segment results our chemical segment results in 2021 continue to benefit from our diversified product portfolio and positive market dynamics which have resulted in a post covid 19 rebound in demand and favorable market trends providing for margin expansion across all product groups as we continue to execute strategic actions to innovate and develop new applications for our cto derivatives strong global adhesive demand has contributed to higher sales of tall oil rosin and rosin esters while strong demand for broader vegetable oil markets combined with our targeting of broader application solutions has benefited our sales of tall oil fatty assets and related upgrades the chemical segment revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was 215 2 million up 63 4 million compared to the second quarter of 2020 the increase reflects higher sales volume versus the second quarter of last year in which demand was adversely impacted by covid 19 and higher average sales prices associated with favorable market dynamics sales volume during the second quarter of 2021 was up 32 3 compared to the second quarter of 2020 performance chemicals sales volume was up 37 5 compared to the year ago quarter with higher global demand for all product groups including tofa tor and related upgrades sales volume for adhesives was up 17 4 driven by robust global demand fundamentals in adhesives markets including positive trends in e commerce and the sales volume for our tires business was up 108 compared to the second quarter of 2020 in which the number of customers had idle production capacity due to covid 19 the second quarter 2021 adjusted ebitda for the chemical segment was up 35 5 million up 19 8 million compared to the second quarter of 2020 the increase was attributable to higher sales volume and the expansion of unit margins despite higher raw material and logistics costs as a result for the second quarter of 2021 the adjusted ebitda margin for the chemical segment was 16 5 up 620 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year looking at the chemical segment results for the first half of 2021 the chemical segment revenue for the first half of 2021 was 411 3 million up 72 6 million compared to the first half of 2020 the increase was the result of higher sales volume and higher average sales prices associated with realization of price increases and favorable market fundamentals for the first half of 2021 chemical segment sales volume was up 15 1 versus the first half of 2020 sales volume for performance chemical was up 13 9 on strong demand on tofa and tofa derivatives and adhesive sales volume was up 14 driven by positive global adhesive demand sales volume for tires was up 48 2 compared to the first half of 2020 reflecting the rebound in post covid demand and increased sales into innovation based products the chemical segment adjusted ebitda for the first half of 2021 was 65 8 million up 23 4 million compared to the first half of 2020 factors of the increase include higher sales volume associated with the rebound in post covid demand and higher sales prices and unit margins associated with positive market fundamentals and strategic price actions partially offset by higher raw material and logistics costs as such the adjusted ebitda margin for the first half of 2021 was 16 up 350 basis points compared to the first half of 2020 turning to slide eight for a summary of consolidated results for the second quarter and first half of 2021 as already noted second quarter 2021 consolidated adjusted ebitda was 61 8 million given the impact of factors including turnaround costs and the impact of raw material inflation on margins the consolidated adjusted ebitda margin for the second quarter was 12 5 the costs associated with the bear turnaround occurring approximately every six years had a negative impact of 340 basis points on the adjusted ebitda margin for the first six months ended june 30 2021 consolidated adjusted ebitda was 129 5 million down 17 9 million versus the first six months of 2020 the adjusted ebitda margin for the first six months of 2021 was 13 9 this was down 490 basis points compared to the 18 8 for the first half of 2020 principally due to the impact of the bare turnaround costs the relative change in fixed cost absorption previously referenced and the impact of inflationary pressures all of which masked the 350 basis point improvement seen in the chemical segment margin in the first six months of this year compared to the first half of 2020 with the cost of the bear turnaround now behind us and as we anticipate unit margin improvement in the second half of the year associated with further realization of increases in selling prices we expect improvement in the consolidated adjusted ebitda margin in the second half of this year second quarter 2021 diluted earnings was 1 11 per share and this compares to a loss of 0 25 per share in the second quarter of 2020 adjusted diluted earnings were 0 32 per share in the second quarter of 2021 and this compares to 0 30 per share in the second quarter of 2020 for the first half of 2021 adjusted diluted earnings were 0 86 per share and this compares to 0 57 per share for the first half of 2020 turning to slide nine for the balance and liquidity highlights during the second quarter consolidated debt was reduced by 14 1 million and consolidated net debt was reduced by 11 5 million including the 6 3 million and favorable impact of currency as previously noted the majority of our cash generation typically occurs in the second half of the year as such we expect further debt reduction over the balance of 2021 and we therefore expect to achieve our target consolidated net debt leverage ratio of three turns or less by year end before i hand the call back over to kevin a few comments on guidance as outlined in yesterday s press release and based upon our expectations for both demand and margin improvement in the second half of the year we now expect adjusted ebitda for the full year 2021 to be in the range of 280 million to 300 million we also expect our sales of solid isoprene rubber to be heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter and as such we anticipate a fairly even distribution of second half 2020 adjusted ebitda between the third and fourth quarters i will now turn the call back to kevin kevin kevin m fogarty president and chief executive officer yeah thank you atanas as we ve done in past quarters on slide 10 we present our near term outlook by geography and end use application as noted in our earlier comments the global demand environment thus far in 2020 has been very favorable in our chemical segment we have seen a strong rebound in demand as well as improved margins both of which have been driven by fundamentals in the global vegetable oil markets which has been a positive for our tofa sales and in global adhesive markets which has led to higher sales of tor and rosin esters and improved pricing and margins compared with the first half of last year these factors have resulted improved financial results and higher profitability for the chemical segment despite higher raw material costs and other inflationary pressures as stated earlier kraton continues to promote the overall pine chemical industry recovery through expanding innovation led growth and consistently encouraging adoption of truly sustainable plant chemical solutions to our customers to replace hydrocarbons for the benefit of all key stakeholders in our polymer segment we continue to see solid demand trends across the breadth of the markets we serve reflective both of solid market backdrop and kraton s unique diversification and product offerings while the inflationary pressures have continued into the third quarter as stated earlier based upon improved pricing we have achieved thus far in the third quarter and with the continued price actions we expect to take we re anticipating margin expansion in the second half of the year once again let me state that we have always maintained a critical element of our price right strategy has been to consistently pass along inflation in a manner such that our customers can actually predict our behavior and while there is inherent lag in price realization that can result in near term margin pressure i would again remind you that when the inflation turns to deflation our pricing discipline typically allows us to expand margins for a period of time as a result of the foregoing we do expect unit margin improvement for both our polymer and chemical segments in the second half of the year and we continue to actively address inflation through price increases for the balance of the year we expect the favorable global demand trends to continue and therefore this top right chart on slide 10 for the first time is all green that said we of course remain mindful of the disruptive potential of covid 19 particularly in light of the unfortunate spread of the more contagious delta variant in terms of specific end markets we currently expect sales into adhesive and packaging consumer durable and general industrial applications remain positive and these three end users account for a significant portion of polymer and chemical segment sales specifically in terms of our adhesive business which accounts for 27 of ttm revenue for our chem segment and 21 of our ttm revenue for our poly segment e commerce continues to be a driving force in global adhesive markets supporting demand for labels tapes and other packaging products during the quarter we had higher sales of sis into adhesive applications and we continue to see favorable market adoption of our novel revolution family of rosin ester formulations which is being driven by underlying market demand as well as the customers growing preference for bio based and renewable options to replace hydrocarbon based materials furthermore we are now in the midst of the summer paving season and despite higher pricing for butadiene we are seeing good overall market demand in our north american and european markets although we have commented on the headwinds presented by inflation and transportation and logistical costs in terms of our paving and roofing business it has presented opportunities in 2021 as the higher cost of transportation for producers in asia to ship to the north american and european markets has resulted in lower export volumes into these key markets while weather always remains an unknown at this time we are anticipating a positive level of demand for the balance of the season and lastly despite the well known global chip shortage we continue to see favorable demand into automotive applications as well as in our tires business where sales are more linked to oem specifications and new vehicle sales lastly during the second quarter we saw higher levels of activity in oilfield markets which has changed our outlook from neutral to positive in summary we anticipate favorable trends in both volumes and margins across the breadth of our end markets exposures as we move into the second half of the year with a significant bear turnaround now behind us and therefore costs and completion timeline known and as we are now into the third quarter and better able to calibrate our full year expectations for the critical paving and roofing season we re in a better position to update our full year 2021 expectations for adjusted ebitda as noted in yesterday s earnings release and as atanas shared with you we now expect adjusted ebitda for the full year of 2021 to fall within a range of 280 million to 300 million and with those comments we re happy now to open the call up for questions operator questions and answers operator thank you sir our first question will come from the line of chris kapsch of loop capital markets please go ahead chris kapsch loop capital markets analyst good morning you mentioned you touched upon this in some of your formal comments about the adhesives end market but it seems like the demand for tor feeding that end market is notably strong especially considering that it seems the c5 tackifiers supply is still in surplus so just wondering is there s a shortage of chinese gum rosin that may be contributing can you just talk about the dynamics there what is driving the outsized volume growth for the rosin ester based tackifiers is it more market strength or is revolution starting to get beyond cannibalization and starting to take share kevin m fogarty president and chief executive officer yeah thanks chris look i don t think there s one answer i think there s a multitude of parts that go into that answer but certainly your point about gum is true that structural supply decrease or supply demand coming more in balance is favorable to us but i d also remind you that for kraton our focus continues to be innovation driving sustainability through the comments i made earlier about the positioning revolution in front of oem formulators such that they can appreciate the circular economy impacts of adopting revolution so yeah we re definitely seeing examples where customers have opted to switch from hydrocarbon to use revolution and we think there s more to come and that s exactly how we position it in the marketplace chris kapsch loop capital markets analyst and then my follow up question is more on the balance sheet and it s just extrapolating a little bit here based on your implied second half guidance if you think about next year and with some excess free cash flow your leverage could be approaching mid 2s or with some growth maybe in ebitda maybe even low 2 so suddenly you may have excess capital i m just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of deploying that excess capital are you inclined to implement a dividend or buybacks on the table what are some of the board s thinking on that thank you atanas h atanasov executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah this is atanas i think as we as we go into next year and face the reality of continuous improvement in our balance sheet and cash flow situation first of all we ve said that once we reduce debt to below three times one of the areas of focus that we will look at and we ll continue to look at is obviously organic growth and we have a number of projects and those as you can appreciate come in at highly accretive low multiples so that would be a priority for us obviously we continue to invest in our innovation and with respect to share repurchase that s something that we ll take to our board and would be a consideration operator thank you our next question would come from the line of john roberts of ubs your line is open please go ahead john roberts ubs analyst thanks and congratulations on the ecovadis platinum is there anything you can tell us about the strategic review that s been reported in press kevin m fogarty president and chief executive officer well i appreciate you re asking the question but at kraton we re not in a position to comment on any type of market speculation or rumors our focus continues to be on running the business and we re pretty proud of the results we ve achieved so far and optimistic as i just described in our comments about where our business is headed john roberts ubs analyst the comparisons with 2020 obviously are affected by the pandemic if we compared that second quarter 2019 in pre pandemic chemical tons are up 18 and polymers are up 5 in tons i think could you give us some granularity on where some of the product lines are on a volume basis versus pre pandemic levels kevin m fogarty president and chief executive officer well i think that you re comparing i think you said second quarter of 2019 so perhaps less covid impact as i look if i think back on 2019 though i mean i can still think about particularly in our polymer business we had a certainly a china impact that was very much mindful for all of us in terms of what was happening with geopolitical challenges it was also probably not the best paving season that we had in the last few years so we probably benefit now as you kind of compare that quarter versus this quarter but overall i mean look this continues to be evidence in our view that the innovations that we are bringing to market are paying off in terms of market positioning the reliability of our service offering to our customers is something that we don t take lightly and we take very seriously and we always want to be in a position to be the supplier of choice to our customers and then as i think about our chemical business specifically i think that the tofa sales diversification that we ve spoken to quite often continues to be a benefit for our portfolio of sales mix and of course most recently we can now add the biodiesel aspect into that sales mix so i think all these things are as a direct result of what we work on at kraton in order to position our business to succeed in good times as the backdrop of today s marketplace would indicate but also to make sure that when there s some challenging headwinds we do well as we can and that s kind of how you think about how we came out of this 2020 pandemic year positioning for our business future john roberts ubs analyst and i m thinking oilfield is probably still below second quarter 2019 i didn t know would any other areas be below second quarter 2019 or everything would be up versus that other than oilfield kevin m fogarty president and chief executive officer i don t know if i can answer this question specifically because i d have to go through each of the above segments but again i call you to that slide 10 right now and i can t remember a time when we ve had the market dynamic that we ve gotten all green on that stop light chart across each of our key market segments john roberts ubs analyst ok thank you operator at this time sir i don t see any further questions there is another follow up question from john roberts of ubs john roberts ubs analyst i guess the mic is still mine can you tell us where delta airline is on utilizing the existing emergency youth authorization for biaxam and do you expect any additional state level authorizations or the next thing will be the federal action kevin m fogarty president and chief executive officer yeah i can tell you that delta continues to position biaxam and used it in the facilities as expected so no change there but as we ve said all along while we re very proud of the section 18 with the three states involved of georgia minnesota and utah we think this is just in many ways a validation of the technology that we have to ensure that we can absolutely take back some into the marketplace with a full potential and that only comes from a section 3 full approval from the environmental protection agency and the good news is we continue to work toward that objective as i said in my comments and i don t think anything has changed in our view in terms of the market potential of this attractive antimicrobial and i have said in the past that i think that the markets that and there are several markets including public transportation delink and construction and healthcare but i think healthcare continues to present to us probably the strongest opportunity because of the challenges that that the industry faces overall and then secondly air filtration where there really is no offering today in terms of antimicrobial protection of the filtered air there s antimicrobial protection of the filter itself but not of the filtered air and those are the kind of target markets we ll be spending a lot of our time working on in the future john roberts ubs analyst and then secondly it sounded like there were some timing issues in isoprene what s going on there kevin m fogarty president and chief executive officer well i think there were some supply disruption issues with respect to isoprene that probably shouldn t surprise anybody given the way this year started in terms of the coal snap in the gulf region and it s been worked through time but i ll also say that asia demand has been really strong and that s where most of the isoprene in the world is consumed so those two things and what it means for kraton obviously is making sure that through our strategic raw material supply arrangements we re in a position even when those challenges and headwinds come up to kind of pull levers from other supply sources where we have relationships in order to continue to be able to produce the key polymers that our customers are looking for and they are in high demand these days so that s probably what it reflects as much as anything but we ve been through this before i ll just say it as i said in my prepared comments in terms of the challenges that tight raw material markets present and believe it or not if you re sitting in our shoes it s not all a challenge it s a lot of hard work but it s also a lot of opportunity and we view it as opportunity to really differentiate ourselves in the marketplace through our supply chain optimization efforts as well as the relationships we have with our strategic raw material suppliers john roberts ubs analyst ok thank you operator thank you our next question would come from chris kapsch of loop capital markets your line is open please go ahead chris kapsch loop capital markets analyst so the follow up question on the chemicals business and notwithstanding an updraft in the cost of cto feedstock you re in an advantaged position there with availability and in this quarter it seems you derivatized you ran more of that volume through your refining system versus say reselling the excess cto you have so i m just wondering if what was the governor of that decision that is more closer demand or more and then with that i assume come some unit cost benefit i m just wondering about the sustainability of that benefit as you look forward over the balance of the year and into next year kevin m fogarty president and chief executive officer sure chris so i mean we re always typically in a position where we re buying more cto than we consume that s a good practice for us good position for us always to be in as we sourced additional cto last year we then went to work on obviously finding new market outlets for the derivative products because it s in our interest to maximize the amount of material that we push through our refineries and i think that s bearing fruit this year and that s kind of what you re seeing in terms of more derivative sales versus cto direct sales chris kapsch loop capital markets analyst and i don t know any comment atanas on the sustainability of the unit cost benefit from that atanas h atanasov executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah i mean we re very much of the belief that those margins are sustainable and what you re seeing this quarter is and really year to date is becoming more and more representative of what our view is on a go forward basis chris kapsch loop capital markets analyst and then i just had a question about the raw materials more on the polymer side butadiene obviously has sort of doubled recently and there s disruption with some crackers down in the gulf coast and so forth but you don t seem to have you have not seemed to have any issues with availability at least regarding feeding your berre ohio plant so i m just wondering what the strategy has been there what is that and has that translated into an advantage for you guys thanks kevin m fogarty president and chief executive officer look i ll go back to the same comments the question before you was about with respect to security of supply we ve learned over time that security supply is also a function of diversity of supply and i think we ve always not pursued the short term solutions we ve always looked at things much more longer term in terms of our supply arrangements so that we can find ourselves in a position when there is a market disruption as you point out there is today we re in a much better position to continue to source raw materials that s not to say that that s not without effort and not posing some supply chain challenges for our team i don t want anybody in kraton to think that i don t see that because i do they re working tirelessly to ensure our supply chains remain as undisrupted as possible but nevertheless i think it reflects some very good planning on our part and the gulf coast is an interesting one and clearly most of the betadine comes out of the gulf coast but there s other butadiene sources in north america and that s where kraton has always tried to leverage that diversification operator and at this time i don t see any further questions on queue h gene shiels director of investor relations all right kirby well thank you very much we appreciate the interest of all of our listeners and participants this morning and i just wanted to briefly remind you there s a replay of the call that will start later on this morning and will be available through the middle of august and to access that replay you can dial 800 391 9846 and that concludes our prepared remarks thank you very much operator duration 47 minutes

executive officer of world fuel services corporation we have also been positioning ourselves to best serve the needs of our customers as they navigate the ongoing evolution of energy consumption for the second quarter our aviation segment generated gross profit of 87 4 million a decrease of 5 year over year principally driven by a reduction in our government related activity in afghanistan and lower average margins as a result of returning to a more normalized core business mix our marine segment generated gross profit of 22 7 million a decrease of 39 year over year principally attributable to lower profitability as compared to the second quarter of 2020 which benefited from volatility arising from the implementation of the imo 2020 regulations as well as competitive market conditions and limited price volatility our land segment generated gross profit of 73 8 million a decrease of 13 year over year principally related to the sale of the multiservice payment solutions business in september 2020 partially offset by increased demand in north america and world kinect our disciplined focus on cost and working capital management has positioned us well for growth which should enable us to drive increased returns to our shareholders said ira m birns executive vice president and chief financial officer the continued strength of our balance sheet and liquidity profile will enable us

transportation industries in particular which has continued into 2021 many of our customers in these industries especially commercial airlines have experienced a substantial decline in business activity arising from the various measures enacted by governments around the world to contain the spread of the virus while travel and economic activity has begun to improve in certain regions activity in many parts of the world continues to be negatively impacted by travel restrictions and lockdowns the ultimate global recovery from the pandemic will be dependent on among other things

to the covid crisis the housing market saw a sharp decline in transaction volume in q2 2020 given this challenge to year over year comparisons we believe it is also helpful to compare certain metrics against 2019 as a reminder realogy responded to this transaction volume declines in q2 2020 with significant temporary cost saving measures some of which continued into the third quarter of 2020 those temporary cost saving measures resulted in approximately 150 million of aggregate savings with approximately 100 million recognized in the second quarter of 2020 last the references made to july month to date in these remarks reflect data through july 22 2021 now i will turn the call over to our ceo and president ryan schneider ryan m schneider chief executive officer and president thank you alicia good morning everyone realogy delivered an outstanding second quarter the unmatched combination of our strategic progress innovation through technology and commanding position in the luxury market grew powerful financial results including significant market share gains we continue to invest substantially to drive future growth and are making great progress strengthening our balance sheet overall realogy is leading the industry delivering powerful results today and positioning our business for continued success in the future let me start by sharing our outstanding q2 results realogy delivered exceptional profitability with 310 million of operating ebitda up 135 million year over year and up almost 70 million versus 2019 realogy demonstrated great transaction volume growth up 85 year over year substantially above nars plus 53 realogy outperformed nar on both unit growth and price growth in both our brokerage and franchise businesses and excitingly more than half of our volume growth in the quarter was driven by unit growth both our brokerage and franchise businesses performed extremely well with brokerage outpacing franchise in part driven by a very solid new york city rebound realogy gained significant market share in the fourth quarter for the fourth quarter in a row ending june at 16 4 on a last 12 months basis and as alicia mentioned q2 of 2020 was a pretty unique quarter in the housing industry our q2 2021 volume was up and exciting 41 when you compare to q2 of 2019 and critically our balance sheet is in its best position ever as a public company as a result of our powerful operating performance disciplined cost management and opportunistic capital market actions we ended the quarter with a 2 5x net leverage ratio and over 850 million in cash our exceptionally strong cash flow and balance sheet position gives us strategic flexibility to invest for growth and we are deploying that flexibility in multiple investments that i will touch on later looking forward we are energized by the robust open and closed transaction volume already in our pipeline as we enter q3 so for example our closed transaction volume is starting off very strong july month to date is up 20 versus 2020 and up 30 versus 2019 our open transaction volume also looks great june was up 20 versus 2020 and up 40 versus 2019 and july month to date is up 4 versus 2020 and up 42 versus 2019 and finally the new york city market is improving with both q2 transaction volume and our recent open volume more than doubled 2020 and above the levels we saw in 2019 now remember given the housing surge and our market out performance in the back half of 2020 year over year comparisons in the back half of 2021 will be more difficult and one way we re seeing that is in our july numbers the increased volume is coming from price appreciation instead of unit growth given how strong unit growth was in july of 2020 but with that backdrop the fact that our july volume is ahead of last year is incredibly exciting now beyond the realogy specific numbers the biggest question we get is what are we seeing in the housing market and bluntly the biggest thing we re seeing is housing demand stay and elevate demand for home purchases is substantially outpacing supply houses across all price points are selling fast the percent of multiple offers and above listing price offers both remain high and frankly if there was more supply available we could sell now the public inventory number for june has actually started to trend up a bit the internal inventory numbers we track are similarly trending up and we have some early optimism that we are seeing green shoots of increased supply and finally while price appreciation has been large we believe that unlike 15 years ago the large price increases we re seeing today are not speculation they represent real demand for housing so having saved one of the most important topics for last let me update you on some of our exciting new growth vectors so first we remain extremely enthusiastic about realsure remember realsure is our joint venture with home partners of america that helps customers sell their existing home and or buy their next home backed by a guaranteed cash offer but those of you new to realsure is architected differently from traditional high buyers with greater focus on winning listings and supporting agents we continue to invest substantially in realsure because of our urging early result we really liked the results we re seeing realsure is a competitor advantage helping us win listings that we monetize in our traditional business and realsure appeals to customers because it s structured with a 45 day cash offer and it s paired with one of our great agents focused on selling their house to help our customers get top dollar and with this structure the joint venture is buying fewer homes than the public benchmarks and we really think we ve got a winner here now second our excitement is accelerating our operational progress we re now operating our scale in 21 markets versus 13 markets three months ago and we are now in the market with direct to consumer marketing for realsure to build realsure brand awareness and more importantly to acquire realsure customers and while our core realsure product in the market today is focused on sellers our vision is to expand the support buyers as part of the realsure value proposition now stepping back from this realsure product let me share two related topics for realogy and home partners of america as we ve been doing in our core business we remained very focused with hpa capturing broader transaction economics as part of the home buying and selling process and to that end realogy and hpa have started and are operating in already profitable title business named realtech to support our efforts together and finally home partners of america was acquired by blackstone earlier this month we re excited about this and what it means for our joint venture and we view it as about our confidence we look forward to continuing our work with hpa and shifting to another compelling growth area our luxury business grew substantially above our overall volume numbers in both the quarter and the past year with sotheby s international realty our number one performing brand and now the fifth largest brand in all of u s residential real estate our corporate owned brokerage business earned the number one real deal ranking in new york city for 2020 and our corporate franchise business expanded to seven new geography since we last spoke and finally if you look across sotheby s international realty corporate and coldwell banker we continue to lead the industry in 1 million plus transactions and within these businesses we ve been setting records for the number of 1 million plus and 10 million plus transactions in our portfolio and given our leadership position in luxury and our strategic optimism about the luxury market we are investing to grow our luxury brands domestically and internationally to provide unique and differentiated luxury technology and to expand our industry leading domestic and international luxury referral networks now finally we remain very focused investing in technology and product innovation we are very excited about our open architecture approach to technology which we believe is a competitive differentiator and we ve spoken to you before about some of the great products we developed internally and great products others have built that we are integrating into our open technology ecosystem one thing we haven t discussed lately is our data progress in particular how we re using our industry leading data scale and ai to generate powerful insights the wall street journal recently wrote about some of the various ai models we built and these and other data driven analytic tools remain a critical area we re investing in to help us run the company better and to provide data driven products with the goal to make our agents and brokers more productive so wrapping up i m incredibly excited about our outstanding second quarter financial results our sizable market share gains our continued strategic progress especially with tech and data innovation and our balance sheet execution we are passionate about the investments we are making to drive even more growth in the future and looking ahead we really liked the momentum from our q2 in july month to date results and obviously we like the strong demand for housing we re seeing we believe our future is bright and i will now turn the call over to charlotte charlotte simonelli executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you ryan good morning everyone realogy is firing on all cylinders we kicked off 2021 with impressive q1 results and this momentum has continued into q2 we executed well on our winning value proposition delivered 310 million in operating ebitda and once again drove market share gains we continue to improve our balance sheet with compelling free cash flow generation of 243 million and we achieved our lowest net leverage at 2 5 times we capitalized on our strong momentum and favorable market conditions to raise capital at a significantly lower cost with our exchangeable bond offering so let s touch more on these great q2 results second quarter revenue was 2 3 billion an increase of 1 billion versus 2020 operating ebitda in q2 set a record at 310 million an increase of 135 million versus 2020 operating ebitda growth was especially impressive as we lap approximately 100 million in temporary cost savings taken amid the pandemic in q2 last year we are effectively managing the bottom line and operating margins across our business and expanded margin at both rbg and rfg in spite of last year s temporary savings realogy brokerage group revenue was 1 8 billion up 858 million versus prior year driven by exceptional volume growth up 96 versus prior year rbg operating ebitda was 70 million an increase of 55 million versus prior year rbg continues to generate substantial operating ebitda of 187 million before the transfer of intercompany royalties and marketing fees paid to our franchise business we saw operating leverage as outstanding volume growth drove margin expansion year over year despite lapping sizable temporary cost savings we grew our owned brokerage agent base 4 year over year and retention remains strong our leading position in the luxury market and the ongoing new york city rebound truly positioned us well record setting transaction volume ongoing investment in recruiting and retention and agent mix drove commission splits up 212 basis points in the quarter additionally business mix drove commissions up 78 basis points due predominantly to the sale of our property management business and timing on our new development business overall we like the investments we are making in our agents which are driving impressive results and market share gains realogy franchise group revenue which includes leads and relocation was 347 million up 120 million versus prior year the franchise business delivered transaction volume growth up 80 versus prior year and net royalty per side of 418 up 94 versus prior year rfg operating ebitda was 224 million an increase of 99 million versus prior year as this business also continues to drive powerful operating leverage we love our franchise business its national scale strong and diverse brands and recurring royalty streams realogy title group revenue was 255 million up 95 million versus prior year driven by strengths in core title operations as increased purchase volumes offset slowing refinance units title operating ebitda was 55 million a decrease of 6 million versus prior year due primarily to the decline of 27 million in our mortgage jv excluding our mortgage jv operating ebitda was up 21 million year over year in title agency we ve benefited from growth across the portfolio and greater digital adoption we also saw sizable ebitda growth in our underwriter business which is up approximately 100 in the quarter as we continue to further grow and leverage the power of this fully scaled platform in the mortgage jv purchase volume remains strong with june our largest purchase unit and funding month on record we also remained focused on growing our portfolio of high quality loan officers however refi volumes slowed in the quarter and gain on sale margins declined with more competitive pricing industrywide in addition the mark to market adjustments on the mortgage loan pipeline consistent with the move in interest rates was negative in q2 2021 compared with a positive adjustment in q2 2020 which was a net negative 19 million impact year over year while refi volumes are still up considerably versus 2019 we do expect softer refi volumes to continue when compared to 2020 we remained focused on cost efficiency and are driving sustainable improvement in our fixed cost base despite elevated variable costs associated with higher volumes we are delivering on the 80 million and permanent cost savings we outlined for 2021 with 70 million or approximately 85 of this target already actioned and approximately 50 million realized year to date we exited the quarter with our strongest balance sheet and liquidity yet net leverage was 2 5 times and our senior secured leverage ratio was zero times as of june 30 our lowest level since going public in 2012 q2 free cash flow was 243 million up 196 million versus prior year and we continue to have a zero balance on our revolver we are effectively managing our debt portfolio and have made considerable headway over the past year taking a step back since the end of 2019 we took advantage of market conditions and refinanced over 1 billion across four debt transactions reduced net debt by approximately 600 million lowered our leverage ratio by over two turns and shifted more to unsecured debt while extending our maturities in april we used cash on hand to pay down 150 million of the term loan b facility and in june we issued 403 million of exchangeable note at a 0 25 coupon which gives us even further financial flexibility we exited q2 with 859 million in cash including statutory cash and net proceeds from the exchangeable notes and we expect to utilize this cash toward our priorities which are to invest in the business and pay down debt and i remain confident in our ability to satisfy our near term maturities in closing realogy again achieved outstanding financial results over the past year we have shown tremendous quality and consistency in our financial performance which is a direct result of our strategic execution disciplined investments and type cost management realogy s momentum is strong and i am extremely proud of what we have delivered both in the balance sheet and the p l and with that we are happy to take your questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of tommy mcjoynt with kbw tommy mcjoynt kbw analyst hey guys good morning thanks for taking my question so when you guys parse out the existing home sale data by price point we see the stronger trends really at the higher end of the price buckets so how sustainable do you think that is in the luxury spectrum and then do you sense that any of that is either kind of delayed transactions from prior periods or any pull forward from future periods ryan m schneider chief executive officer and president it s a great question look we haven t we don t really think there s much in the pull forward or delayed transactions bucket we ve been seeing the trend you re talking about now for basically a year a year ago there was probably a little bit of kind of one time stuff with the vacation home surge but we don t see that happening now look we ve got leadership in the luxury market like i talked about so we obviously that s one of the reasons we re benefiting here and we re really excited about it we don t see the trend for that segment can be in different than the rest of the market and frankly i do expect it to continue to outperform a bit because if you think about some of the things that are driving the higher consumer demand one of the bigger ones is obviously the more remote work kind of thing and bluntly that skews to the higher end of the labor market and so a lot more of the folks who are potential luxury buyers are going through the potential for change here in the market based off things like remote work and even some of their rotation into the suburbs from the cities so it s been a pretty consistent trend now for a year and i think it s got some legs to it and obviously we re very well positioned with our luxury leadership to benefit from it as you saw in our results tommy mcjoynt kbw analyst great thanks for that and switching over we ve seen some of your competitors announced partnerships or jvs with mortgage lenders suggesting that this kind of adjacent revenue opportunity is a focal point of the market can you just talk about the gra jv and what you can do to kind of drive attachment rates of growth and ultimately earnings contribution ryan m schneider chief executive officer and president well look i mean tommy the 126 million we made last year i think kind of speaks for itself so why don t we just start with that and look we ve been talking to you for about three years about our efforts to build a mortgage business and everybody in this industry either has or should have a mortgage business it s clearly an important thing and we built a business in three years with over 500 loan officers covering our brokerages offering i ve talked about our flash close technology that our jv uses that helps accelerate the growth in the business it helped us capture more of those economics and so but for us by the way you should know and this is where we differ from most of the competition it s not just mortgage right we re integrating with title and driving disproportionate results both in 2020 and 2021 we integrate with relocation and the lead generation side there and we re even starting to get some traction and integrating with our insurance business and so kind of the whole for us it s kind of greater than the sum of the parts so look we don t spend a lot of time on what others are doing because everybody in the business has a mortgage we spend our time building a great mortgage business and again i think the financials speak for themselves so i ll be more interested in your question when there s other people making 100 plus million in mortgage tommy mcjoynt kbw analyst makes sense thanks ryan operator your next question comes from the line of john campbell with stephens james hawley stephens analyst hey good morning this is james hawley stepping in for john campbell ryan m schneider chief executive officer and president hey james james hawley stephens analyst so i just wanted to touch on a couple of things here i was hoping that you could touch more on the housing outlook and tie in some more of the drivers from your strong luxury performance over 2q you ve had a record price appreciation and now in july the moratorium is coming to an end which could put some inflow of inventory into the market just wondering if you could talk more about the outlook there and what housing looks like from here as well as drivers for the luxury market ryan m schneider chief executive officer and president well let me start with the most important thing your question didn t talk about which is in q2 we had more unit growth gains than we had price appreciation and we have this in our numbers and our tables so you can look it up but we literally had more unit growth than price appreciation and obviously we made money on both but wow like the unit growth thing is a very powerful thing for q2 so when you talk about a lot of price appreciation in q2 please don t miss the unit growth and that was a big reason that we outperformed nar not just on price but on units and gain a bunch of market shares so we were pretty excited about that and then look i literally gave you our numbers up to like last friday right we re kind of up 20 versus last year and i think 30 versus 2019 so we think there s some good stuff in the pipeline here and again i ve had a belief that that the demand we re seeing out there for housing is real like people are rotating into the suburbs people are moving to the texas and floridas and arizonas of the world in greater ways remote work is changing kind of where people live and then look structurally you ve got the millennial generation hitting their prime years and bluntly rates are low incredibly low and so it looks to us like housing demand is still there and as i mentioned on the last question some of these trends like remote work helps the higher end of the market the most and we re well positioned to benefit there so we like what we re seeing we re seeing new york city come back into positive kind of territory that s a big market for us so we re pretty optimistic and i think the numbers speak for themselves the one thing i did call out in the script to your question is that because of how big units grew last year in july most of what we re seeing so far in july is price increase but we still liked the really high unit levels in july that we re seeing and to be even a little above last year s volume it feels pretty good so that s kind of what we re seeing and really the latest numbers we got i mean they re literally as of six days ago james hawley stephens analyst got you thank you that s helpful and then if i can squeeze one more in here quick ryan m schneider chief executive officer and president sure james hawley stephens analyst there s been a lot of noise on the legal side possibly on a regulatory side as well some of the people are questioning right now agent commission rates how do you frame up agent value add right now and the level of commissions paid are they justified today versus a decade ago ryan m schneider chief executive officer and president well look we talked we re always watching agent commission rates the value of agents we think is quite high and look we think it gets approved in the market more people have used agents in the last 12 months than in the year previous right customers are voting with their feet and the prices that people negotiate with their agents and if you ve sold the house you know it s a negotiation so the prices that people sell their house at with agents have stayed basically about flat and i think agents deliver real value and you can see that in whether it was some of the health and safety stuff over the past year whether it s in helping people buy a house in one of the pretty tight market in some parts of the country or just getting the best price for their house and so i m old enough to remember when it was predicted in the 90s that the internet would put agents out of business but i think agents deliver real value and they improve it with their customer relationships and so we re excited to do what we can to help agents add even more value to customers including some of the stuff we re doing to make the transaction easier for people with some of our technology and some of our virtual tools that are helping ease the transaction for everybody especially in kind of health and safety times james hawley stephens analyst got you thank you for the color appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of matthew bouley with barclays matthew bouley barclays analyst good morning everyone congrats on the results thanks for taking the questions it looks like your agent count is continuing to rise i m curious if you could speak to maybe how much of that kind of matches with sort of broader marketwide agent growth simply more people becoming real estate agents and i guess maybe the way to answer that is kind of focusing on the recruitment and retention of the high performing agents obviously that s what i m getting at sort of amid the strong market backdrop thank you ryan m schneider chief executive officer and president sure i ll take that one i guess let me take that one so look our retention is in a nice spot our retention kind of rose pretty consistently for over a year and is now for a couple of quarters have been hanging out pretty near some of our historical high points and so we like that and that feels good and that speaks to our value proposition it speaks to the opportunities and again when we talk about gaining market share it s our agents gaining market share and that s there s power to be with our brands especially on the luxury end that i talked about earlier in the call so the retention feels good and then on the recruiting side i think we re i don t think it s just the growth of the market at all i think we ve kind of been showing a consistent increase in an agent count kind of pretty steady kind of 2 3 4 kind of every single quarter and we recruit across the spectrum of agents we have a lot of success recruiting people kind of in the middle of the pack and making them into top quartile agents across our brands so we like our results we think that kind of 4 is consistent with kind of low single digits steady growth that we ve been doing and we re always shooting for more but it s kind of a consistent thing that s been happening here and we like it and there s obviously part of why we re having the growth results we have that are above the market matthew bouley barclays analyst got it really helpful color thank you for that ryan second one on commission splits i think you mentioned a couple mix issues that impacted that number in the quarter just curious if you could put any numbers around that number one and number two really just thinking about kind of the direction of commission splits in the second half sort of in this market backdrop that you mentioned where housing volumes might be decelerating a little bit just kind of broader thoughts on commission splits and that type of environment thank you charlotte simonelli executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so what we re seeing as we have been seeing is the agent mix so the higher producing agents which have higher splits normally are doing more of the transactions this has been going on for about a year now and so you marry that up with significantly high volume and you re going to get this increase in splits there s a slight impact from geography if you think of the markets that are really outperforming like florida and california there s a bit of geographic mix as well and so that s not different than what we have been seeing as far as it relates to the back half of the year we begin to start lapping this though so that s what s going to benefit us so we do expect there will still continue to be pressure on splits but as we start to lap some of the periods from last year where we re already seeing the agent mix and the high volumes it should abate a bit so that s probably the most i can share with you at this point matthew bouley barclays analyst very helpful well thank you charlotte and thank you ryan charlotte simonelli executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ryan mckeveny with zelman associates ryan mckeveny zelman associates analyst hey good morning ryan and charlotte great job on the quarter and thanks for taking the questions first question a bit of a two parter so to the prior question you were asked about the agent count continuing to rise obviously good to see i guess i m just curious if you could speak a bit more about the competitive environment we ve all kind of seen some movements over time between always being very competitive but at times it goes from very competitive to extremely competitive back to very competitive so i guess the first part of my question is just any recent changes you re seeing around the competitive dynamics that are playing into the agent recruitment retention somewhat relative to how you ve spoken about those dynamics in the past ryan m schneider chief executive officer and president no i wouldn t say there s been any changes i think it was kind of the pre rework i would say it was more than that extremely competitive and then post rework it s been a little more just very competitive but we re a big part of that competition we re aggressive we like that we re growing our agents we like that we re taking share and but it s tough out there and i don t think that it s always been tough in this industry to your point there have been times when it s wrapped up either ratcheted it up even more but it s pretty tough but it s been about the same right now as it has been for the last kind of 12 18 months kind of thing i would say and we keep having our steady growth we ve grown market share four quarters in a row we think some of that s the real success of our strategic initiatives some of that s the leading position we have in luxury so we like it but we watch the competitive stuff incredibly closely but again we re a big part of that and charlotte talked about some of the investments we re making in that area we like it even in the case if it places it helps it contributes to our higher commission costs we liked the investments we liked the financial returns and we look at a quarter like this hopefully it s pretty clear that everybody likes the financial returns ryan mckeveny zelman associates analyst absolutely makes sense thank you ryan so just digging in a little on the volume trends that you cited so for the open volume in june and july up 20 and up 4 year over year i believe are you able to specify i know it kind of qualitatively sounds like your suggesting units are down which should be expected given the year ago comps and prices asp is still up but can you are you able to specify the magnitude of kind of the unit declines that you re seeing relative to asp increases ryan m schneider chief executive officer and president yes so i mean look what i would say is june was units and price up and as i said in q2 our units were up more than price so you can kind of apply that rough heuristic onto the june numbers for the opens for july look i think for the july all the growth is price period like for july month to date what we ve seen is all the growth is price now units went up so much in 2020 remember we were running it like the low 5 million kind of units as a housing market and in the last 12 months units have been more like 6 million plus kind of thing so what we re seeing in july is the kind of unit type is in the same zip code at least of the unit kind of strength that we ve been seeing and then we re seeing some price appreciation but what we don t have is the unit growth that we ve been having as the whole sector transition from 5 plus million to 6 plus million unit sales so really you should think of july s volume increases that we ve seen so far is basically all price versus 2020 right versus 2019 the 42 that i gave you for july 2019 that s a strong mix of unit and price but so far in july what we ve seen is and to repeat myself units being similar or maybe even a little down in places to last july but we have been getting price appreciation and that is a change and i thought it was important enough to just bring it up and talk about it ryan mckeveny zelman associates analyst yes thanks ryan m schneider chief executive officer and president but again there was a pretty strong surge in july of 2020 so if we could run at the july 2020 unit level like that feels pretty good ryan mckeveny zelman associates analyst absolutely makes sense and if i can squeeze one more in just a high level one ryan m schneider chief executive officer and president sure ryan mckeveny zelman associates analyst so on the relocation business i guess i m just curious because you have somebody s unique view into this and i m not really even asking for your business specific but more of an industry dynamics so i guess do you see anything high level around like corporate decisions around work from home or returning to the office within the relocation business because i guess there s a lot of debate around just how exactly is the world of work going forward is there going to be this ongoing shift to work from home or now that vaccines are more widespread do people come back to the office so i m just kind of curious of your high level view on what you might be seeing given the relocation business you have and the relationships with many corporations ryan m schneider chief executive officer and president yes no look so first off a lot of the realogy stuff we do is global which does not lend itself to work from home the same way choosing between living in new jersey and florida it does but we are seeing things and when we talked about the reload business last with our board the number one kind of long term headwind for that industry is what you said right which is the how much of at least the domestic part of that business goes away because of more work from home and we are seeing it and part of the reason i sit here and tell you i think work from home is more here to stay thing maybe than the average person would say is because of some of what we hear from our clients there now we re seeing green shoots in that business in other ways especially the international side where doing work from home if your job is around the world doesn t really work the same way or you can t really stay in the u s if your job is in asia or something but and so we re seeing some green shoots on that side of the business but the headwind on that business in the u s from work from home is part of the reason i think the work from home thing has maybe more legs than the average person thinks so i am using that insight to form that point of view ryan but again in general that s a positive for realogy overall because that really enables or pushes people to live either in different houses or in different geographies and obviously we benefit when that happens as we ve been doing ryan mckeveny zelman associates analyst absolutely helpful as always thank you ryan ryan m schneider chief executive officer and president thank you ryan operator your next question comes from the line of justin ages with berenberg justin ages berenberg analyst thanks for taking the question i was just hoping to dig in a little bit on what your efforts have been around kind of boosting the attach rates for the title group and then a quick follow on after that please ryan m schneider chief executive officer and president sure look one of the things we ve been talking about and justin by the way welcome to coverage of the company justin ages berenberg analyst thank you ryan m schneider chief executive officer and president one of the things if you go back and read is we ve really focused a lot on doing something that s not at all new for real estate which is to capture more of the transaction economics from title from mortgage from insurance etc and you can see it in our financials right and some of that in mortgage for example it was just the market being hot but some of it is trying to do more in the efforts that you re talking about and so we ve got a variety of efforts going on some of them in the industry has been using for 20 plus years but the biggest place we ve been different justin is really focusing on digital tools to make the transaction easier and i told this story before but for example in 2018 we invested in a remote notarization company i think we were an anchor investor and we re like their anchor client and we and nobody used the thing and it wasn t even legal in most of the u s in terms of how the laws are written and then the pandemic hits and everybody changes their laws and everybody starts using it for health and safety and then all of our agents and customers realize hey this is a better experience this is a much more seamless virtual experience we can do and we start capturing more business and making more money as you can see in our p l so we re pretty focused on this stuff and even as i said in the call we and home partners of america just set up and i ve been running this our own kind of title business together called realtech to support the broader business we re doing together because we think it s just a really important thing to kind of capture as much of that as we can and so we re excited about what we ve done and we re going to stay very strategically focused on it and even in last quarter s call i called that out as one of the places we are making strategic investments we haven t changed those investments but there was less new news about it this quarter so i didn t put it on my investment list to share with you this quarter justin ages berenberg analyst sure thanks i appreciate the color and then kind of related to that can you talk about what you re seeing and why the average fee per closing unit in the group jumped up i mean i could have expected a little bit of growth but getting to 2 600 seems pretty outsized to me charlotte simonelli executive vice president and chief financial officer it s the balance between purchase and refinance so the vast majority of our units are purchase units and we have stronger economics on the purchase units so i think there s more disclosure in our presentation around that if you want we can follow up later too justin ages berenberg analyst all right i appreciate that thank you operator your next question comes from the line of matt gaudioso with compass point matt gaudioso compass point analyst hey good morning congrats on a strong quarter ryan m schneider chief executive officer and president thanks matt matt gaudioso compass point analyst maybe one thing charlotte just wondering so looking at capital allocation i know you reiterated your priorities there you closed the corner at over 150 million in cash on the balance sheet i was wondering if you can just maybe give a little bit more detail about some of the strategic investments and maybe help out with the magnitude of some of the strategic investments that you re making in the business whether that s on the real short side or i know you ve flagged investments on the luxury brokerage side as well thank you charlotte simonelli executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so first off we consistently have been investing in the business and we spend a lot both in capex and opex and so there s a base level of investment which you could say is anywhere between 100 million to 200 million a year so that s just an ongoing thing which is stuff that we ve been doing which is helping to drive the results that we re seeing and then separately ryan had mentioned these specific growth vectors and so those are you could consider some of those to be incremental to what we had been doing in the past i wouldn t say that they would absorb all of the cash that we have on the balance sheet which is why i tried to mention the debt pay down that we will continue to focus on and you ll expect to see more from us there but so think of the stuff that ryan has talked about is incremental to the baseline that we ve seen in the business if that s helpful matt gaudioso compass point analyst yes that is helpful thanks very much

if scarlett johansson s lawsuit against disney over the studio s dual release of black widow in theaters and on disney simultaneously hasn t caused enough fuss on its own the corporation has fired back a scathing response in which they branded the actress callous and even went to the unprecedented lengths of revealing just how much money the actress has made from the movie to make their point in the lawsuit filed today johansson made the claim that the release of the movie on disney breached her contract and caused a loss of theatrical revenue that she would have received if the movie had been released only in cinemas a spokes person for the walt disney company said there is no merit whatsoever to this filing the lawsuit is especially sad and distressing in its callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the covid 19 pandemic disney has fully complied with ms johansson s contract and furthermore the release of black widow on disney with premier access has significantly enhanced her ability to earn additional compensation on top of the 20m she has received to date the simultaneous release of black widow on disney premier access was the biggest disney release to use the day and date strategy although it was not alone in doing so with warner bros allowing many of their big films such as godzilla vs kong streaming on hbo max for a rental fee from the same date as the movie launched in cinemas the necessity to allow people to rent movies at home rather than being forced to go to the theater was born from a public trepidation over returning to the confines of a cinema screen while the covid pandemic continued to rage across the world the lawsuit claims that disney used the movie to build their streaming service subscriber numbers and give its stock price a boost coming out of the pandemic but it goes on to say that the company s move is at the expense of scarlett johansson whose compensation would largely be based on box office receipts it went on to say that the actress has been given a promise that the movie would be a theatrical release which has been broken in a statement johansson s lawyer john berlinski said it s no secret that disney is releasing films like black widow directly onto disney to increase subscribers and thereby boost the company s stock price and that it s hiding behind covid 19 as a pretext to do so but ignoring the contracts of the artists responsible for the success of its films in furtherance of this short sighted strategy violates their rights and we look forward to proving as much in court this will surely not be the last case where hollywood talent stands up to disney and makes it clear that whatever the company may pretend it has a legal obligation to honor its contracts with disney coming out fighting and going on record to disclose that actress 20 million paycheck so far a move that is usually unheard of in the secretive world of moviemaking it is clear that the house of mouse will not be taking this one lying down this news arrives via deadline

the following testimony was presented to the house foreign affairs subcommittee on the middle east north africa and global counterterrorism on july 29 2021 chairman deutsch ranking member wilson distinguished members of the subcommittee thank you for this opportunity to offer my thoughts on the unfolding economic and political crises in lebanon and their implications for u s policy the urgency of now lebanon is facing its most acute economic crisis since the famine crisis of world war i aggravated by the political stalemate the economic crisis is escalating rapidly it is the result of decades of corruption and mismanagement of public funds by a political class working in concert with financial and banking officials including the governor of the central bank of lebanon in a fall 2020 report the world bank described lebanon s economic depression as deliberate the economic crisis was compounded by multiple shocks throughout 2019 and 2020 including the october 2019 citizen uprising the onset of covid 19 in february 2020 and the august 2020 beirut port explosion today more than half of lebanon s population is living in poverty with the lebanese pound having lost more than 90 of its value lebanese have seen their wages decline in value sharply with a corresponding reduction in purchasing power while the cost of food has soared by 700 over the last two years according to an analysis by the american university of beirut s lebanon crisis observatory the prices of basic food items required by lebanese families increased by more than 50 in the first half of july alone the banking sector has collapsed with small depositors bearing the brunt of losses banks have imposed unofficial capital controls restricting depositors access to their savings breakdown in basic services the country is experiencing a multi sectoral breakdown in the delivery of basic services like water and power according to a recent unicef report more than four million people including one million refugees are at immediate risk of losing access to safe water in lebanon daily 20 hour long state electricity outages are commonplace people make up for the gaps in electricity supply by relying on private generator operators but even these have been forced to reduce their supplies as diesel stocks across the country are running dangerously low the private hospitals syndicate which includes the majority of hospitals in lebanon said last week that if diesel stocks were not replenished several hospitals might have to close their doors this impending health disaster is unfolding at a time when lebanon s covid 19 numbers are again on the rise with daily recorded cases exceeding levels not seen in weeks amid a worldwide concern about the highly contagious delta variant medicines including antibiotics are in short supply some patients are resorting to reducing their daily dose of medicine because they cannot obtain new supplies from pharmacies hospitals are cancelling procedures due to shortages of essential supplies like contrast solution laboratories are running out of kits needed for blood tests patients are delaying going to health facilities because they cannot afford care compounding these woes health care providers including doctors and nurses are leaving the country in search of better salaries abroad either in the gulf europe or the united states the loss of human capital not only in the medical field but also in the educational business and technological sectors will be hard to recover for decades to come impact on vulnerable groups and communities this escalating crisis is having an outsized impact on the vulnerable segments of society including women children and refugee communities women were at a substantial disadvantage even before the economic downturn and thus more vulnerable to the devastating effects of the economic crisis female unemployment is rising domestic violence reports doubled in 2020 and the number of women killed because of domestic violence is also increasing a growing number of women and girls can no longer afford access to sanitary products due to a 500 increase in their price forcing them to resort instead to newspapers toilet paper or old rags lebanon is host to 1 2 million syrian refugees in addition to hundreds of thousands of palestinian and iraqi refugees according to a survey released on july 1 by unicef over 30 of children are going to bed hungry and skipping meals 30 are not receiving the primary health care they need 40 of children are from families where no one has work and 77 are from families that do not receive any social assistance the same survey found 77 of lebanese households do not have enough food or enough money to buy food in syrian refugee households the figure reaches 99 up from 55 last year within the refugee community in lebanon women are the most food insecure and are more likely to not have legal residence or access to adequate shelter as a result families are forced to resort to negative coping measures fifteen per cent of families stopped their children s education altogether because they can no longer afford to pay school feels one in 10 children has been sent to work some families are marrying off their daughters as young as 13 or 14 years old the longer children are out of school the greater the possibility that they will experience violence exploitation or potential recruitment by extremist groups impact on security conditions the economic crisis is also impacting security conditions violent protests have already broken out in cities across the country security provision is starting to become fragmented and localized as people begin turning to local armed groups be they militias or gangs to provide security reminiscent of the conditions that were prevalent during the 1975 1990 civil war the economic crisis is impacting the lebanese security forces at a time when internal stability is increasingly threatened forces are being impacted operationally as they lack the means to perform their duties due to budget cuts the morale in the ranks of the lebanese armed forces laf is at an all time low earlier this year in a departure from a long standing tradition of military leaders not commenting publicly on politics laf commander gen joseph aoun warned that like the rest of the population soldiers are getting hungry and suffering as well increasingly there are reports of desertions in the laf ranks primarily due to the sharp decline in their salaries with many servicemen finding themselves unable to make ends meet a private s monthly salary is now worth less than 65 and that of a general in the army about 300 assuming an exchange rate of 20 000 lebanese lira political paralysis after nine months of trying to form a government lebanon s prime minister designate mr saad hariri stepped down on july 15 two time former prime minister mr najib mikati was tapped on monday to replace mr hariri it is not clear whether he will be able to reach a deal with the other political factions on a cabinet line up and more importantly on developing a plan to stop the economic decline the opposition street consisting of civil society groups that took part in the october 2019 protest movement wants a cabinet of independent and competent experts endowed with executive powers to enact economic reforms that are necessary to secure the assistance of the international community including the international monetary fund imf the world bank and key countries like the u s france the u k saudi arabia germany the united arab emirates uae and kuwait in developing an emergency funding package to put the country s economy on a recovery path these reforms are a necessary entry point to a long process of tackling decades old problems with systemic corruption in the public sector and holding political and security leaders accountable for their mismanagement of public affairs if the new prime minister designate succeeds in this task the u s along with other allies and partners in the eu and the arab region should be ready to work with him and the new cabinet on mobilizing the support of the international community for lebanon where is lebanon heading three dynamics are looming a drawn out economic crisis and political stalemate by unlocking the imf s special drawing rights sdr next month in the range of 900 million politicians believe they have bought themselves some time probably until the 2022 elections they are hoping this new source of international liquidity will provide a pathway to stem the economic decline at least temporarily without structural reforms however experts are concerned that these funds will simply provide a short term solution to a long term systemic problem and will most likely be subject to corruption political leaders opposition groups and civil society activists are preparing for the parliamentary and municipal elections scheduled for mid 2022 the elections might offer a pathway for a new slate of independent candidates to enter parliament and become a force for reform and change in the country a displacement crisis in the making as the economic conditions deteriorate more lebanese and syrian refugees currently residing in lebanon will seek refuge in europe while we don t have official data on attempts to smuggle migrants to the island of cyprus by boat reports suggest they are increasing in number cyprus and lebanon have been resorting to coercive measures to reverse this trend for example cyprus pushed back 200 migrants and refugees arriving from lebanon aboard boats without heeding their claims for asylum recently lebanon expelled syrian refugees including women and children who were caught in these attempts and pushed back to lebanon by cyprus according to lebanese and cypriot officials the two governments have increased their coordination in their fight against clandestine immigration with time incentives for seeking refuge in europe among lebanese and syrian refugees alike will increase as more operators join the smuggling network to make money the specter of violence increasingly protests that were organized in different parts of the country have turned violent as demonstrators blocked roads over the deteriorating economic conditions and widespread electricity outages and attacked government buildings and banks fistfights in supermarkets and at gas stations over supplies have sometimes turned into gunfights resulting in deaths lebanese officials from across the political spectrum have warned of an impending security breakdown including explosions and politically motivated assassinations mr lokman slim a long time outspoken critic of hizballah was assassinated last february in a hizballah controlled part of lebanon there is an ongoing investigation of the assassination but there is little expectation that it will identify mr slim s murderers one dynamic that is starting to unfold and is important to watch is people turning to local armed groups be it gangs and or militias to provide for their security impact on hizballah in his message to congress on july 20 on the continuation of the national emergency with respect to lebanon president joseph biden wrote iran s continuing arms transfer to hizballah which include increasingly sophisticated weapons systems serve to undermine lebanese sovereignty contribute to political and economic instability in the region and continue to constitute an usual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the united states adding to that hizballah has in the past made decisions about war and peace independent of the lebanese government dragging lebanon into wars not of its choosing including the 2006 war with israel and the syrian civil war the economic crisis has had a mixed impact on hizballah on one hand it has forced a large portion of lebanon s shia who are poor unskilled unemployed and do not have family members working abroad to help them financially to turn to hizballah for financial assistance thus strengthening its hold on the shia community in response to the economic crisis hizballah has rolled out a financial assistance and subsidy program targeting its supporters on the other hand this increase in demand on hizballah for financial assistance is coming at a time when its finances are under stress due to a number of factors u s sanctions on iran reduced the amount of funding tehran could direct toward hizballah u s sanctions relief if it were to take place in the future following a successful conclusion of the jcpoa negotiations in vienna will likely translate into tehran stepping up its financial support for hizballah u s sanctions on lebanese businessmen and business entities that either acted as fronts for hizballah s financial operations and or provided financial assistance to hizballah a reduction in financial support from hizballah supporters working in africa due to the covid 19 related global economic slowdown and fear of u s sanctions the lingering impact of hizballah s involvement in the war in syria both in terms of ongoing financial support to the families of fighters who died there and ongoing treatment of the wounded the political paralysis has increased tensions inside the hizballah led axis in lebanon forcing its leaders to devote more time and political capital to mediating among their allies often conflicting demands especially on the issue of government formation further deterioration of the economic conditions will be laid at hizballah s doorstep as the group is perceived as the defender of a corrupt status quo the image that hizballah spent years cultivating inside lebanon as a clean non corrupt and anti establishment political group is no more the 2020 killing of islamic revolutionary guard corps quds force commander qassem soleimani put an additional stressor on hizballah s resources as the group has been asked by tehran to play more of a regional coordinating role inside the iran funded militia network in the middle east hizballah s involvement in the syrian civil war has made it more cautious in taking on israel over the past years israel has regularly attacked hizballah targets in syria and lebanon to stop the transfer of advanced weapons from iran and syria to hizballah these strikes have at times killed senior hizballah and iranian officials yet hizballah has been restrained in its response to the attacks an alarming dynamic is hizballah s manufacturing of artillery rockets and precision guided missiles pgm in missile production plants in both lebanon and syria hizballah has amassed a large arsenal of surface to surface missiles and rockets with iran s help hizballah is continually improving the accuracy and range of its arsenal some of the hundreds of israeli attacks in the past years in syria are related to hizballah s pgm project in the event of another hizballah israel war neutralizing hizballah s rocket capabilities will present a significant challenge to the israeli military and will likely result in substantial damage in both israel and lebanon challenges and implications for u s policy help lebanon help itself lebanon matters to the united states however dysfunctional its democracy is lebanon remains one of the few arab countries in the middle east with relatively strong civil liberties a free media environment a vibrant civil society and multi confessional co existence through hezbollah iran threatens u s israel and our arab allies and partners interests while the rise of extremists group like al qaeda and isis has receded in lebanon thanks to strong sustained efforts by the laf these gains could erode quickly amid a deteriorating economic crisis that provides recruitment opportunities for extremist groups russia is increasingly eyeing lebanon as part of its expansionist strategy in the mediterranean region if we cede ground in lebanon iran and russia will quickly fill the vacuum working with its allies and partners in europe and the arab region the u s should mobilize humanitarian assistance to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis on people s lives but our decision to assist the lebanese to secure long term economic support to put the country on a sustainable recovery path will depend primarily on the decisions they make the multifaceted crisis lebanon faces today is the result of a decades long culture of systemic corruption and impunity unless measures are introduced to end corruption and hold officials accountable for their deliberate mismanagement of public funds and their criminal negligence as in the case of the august 2020 beirut port blast there will be no enduring solution to lebanon s political and economic challenges u s engagement in lebanon should focus on mitigating economic hardships as the needs of the general population have increased dramatically amid a deteriorating economic crisis the u s along with international partners should lead a direct humanitarian assistance effort to scale up existing programs that provide basic services to lebanese and refugee communities including reliable access to safe food and water as well as health care and education services local and international ngos and charities have stepped up to fill the vacuum left by the state however the dramatic decline in services and the worsening economic conditions are outpacing their capacities there needs to be short term and immediate aid in the form of cash handouts distribution of food and medicine and provision of medical care long term solutions also need to be put in place for vulnerable lebanese families and refugee groups that promote sustainable solutions focusing on self reliance and livelihood programs leading international engagement on lebanon working with france and saudi arabia the u s can lead international engagement on lebanon including a concerted diplomatic effort toward the formation of a cabinet of independent and competent technocrats that can embark on the difficult task of negotiations with international financial institutions such as the imf the world bank and country members of the 2018 cedre conference on the terms of a financing package that is conditional on significant reforms and austerity measures despite the severity of the economic crisis putting lebanon on a sustainable economic recovery path is not an impossible task with the right government in place and sustained attention and interest by the u s including congress and senior administration officials and countries like france the u k germany saudi arabia the uae and kuwait lebanon can recover from these multiple crises the international community will need to come up with a new compact for lebanon including an improved model for distributing aid one that bypasses lebanese jurisdiction and through which all international contributions are channeled this could take the form of an international authority that is staffed by independent lebanese specialists and answers to a board with an international majority approved by donor states there are mixed experiences with international compacts that condition aid on performance the millennium challenge corporation mcc has been quite effective in changing the cost benefit calculus of reform in partner countries by providing mechanisms for governments to communicate their achievements to their citizens donors and foreign investors thereby encouraging additional aid and investment assisting lebanese to end systemic corruption and promote accountability a first step in the long road to ending corruption and promoting accountability in lebanon is the establishment of an international fact finding commission to investigate the beirut port blast of august 2020 the united states and france should lead an international effort to establish such a commission close to a year on from the blast the lebanese government s investigation has yet to produce results the international fact finding commission would seek to explain the origins of the explosion and determine who was responsible for it this commission should have a limited timeframe to conduct its investigation and should comprise lebanese and international specialists and be led by a senior international figure last month 53 lebanese regional and international groups and individuals as well as 62 survivors and families of the victims signed a letter urging members states of the u n human rights council to establish an investigative mission into last year s blast maintaining security assistance to the laf the laf is today the only remaining national institution that enjoys the respect of a majority of lebanon for the most part it has behaved professionally in dealing with protesters u s support of the laf has been instrumental in the laf mitigating internal and external threats from non state actors and in strengthening border security with syria in addition to maintaining u s assistance in military hardware and training the laf needs supplementary support for soldiers families by engaging with allies and partners in europe and the middle east in mobilizing support for lebanon by demonstrating a sustained interest and commitment to support the lebanese people in this unprecedented economic crisis by making clear that a durable solution to lebanon s political and economic instability falls primarily on the decisions lebanese politicians and citizens make and by preventing a vacuum that russia and iran will fill we serve our own interests i thank congress and the subcommittee for focusing attention on u s interests in a stable and secure middle east including a peaceful and prosperous future for lebanon randa slim is the director of the conflict resolution and track ii dialogues program at the middle east institute the views expressed in this testimony are those of the author and

editor s note this story was originally published in revisited magazine issue 1 spring 2016 the railroad the iron horse the pioneers who would plow the land the merchants who would supply them with their needs and those who would help build towns didn t arrive in north platte at the same time but as the twin ribbons of steel were tied to the prairie they began to come together it was soon after nov 9 1866 the day north platte s first store peniston miller opened for business that the railroad made its way into what would eventually become north platte union pacific s chief engineer gen grenville m dodge began to lay out the site for the city on sections 32 and 33 township 14 range 30 and section 4 township 13 range 30 log houses and shacks began to spring up the population soon swelled to more than 2 000 people most of them railroad workers but many of them unwelcome camp followers gamblers frontier toughs and unprincipled women the tracks through north platte supported their first train on dec 3 1866 in june 1867 when the railroad had been completed to julesburg in colorado territory the construction gang moved there a considerable portion of the town went along packing up temporary buildings belongings and even the town s first newspaper only 20 houses and about 300 people remained but the same year which was also nebraska s first as a state the union pacific built machine shops a stone 20 stall roundhouse and a hotel the town began to grow this time on a more solid footing its future tied to something more permanent than construction gangs and followers by 1879 north platte had a population of 1 600 it was incorporated in 1873 and a municipal form of government was adopted in 1875 within a few years the city had a 20 000 courthouse and a 16 000 schoolhouse on april 7 1893 with the population at about 3 000 a prairie fire destroyed 35 houses in the city many farmhouses barns and a large amount of stock but the little town and the railroad kept growing together a single track and a spur or two met the early needs of both the town and the railroad as civilization and rich soil came together the railroad began to make improvements to better handle the increased traffic in carrying farmers products to market one of the first major improvements on the union pacific in north platte was made in 1906 when a change in alignment of the track was made at the east end of town it was done in anticipation of laying a double track over the bridge spanning the north platte river in 1910 a second main track was laid through the city making a double track main line in 1927 a bridge made up of 40 50 foot spans almost a half mile in length crossed the north platte river east of town in early days railroad stations were known as depots the first little depot in north platte served as the center of passenger traffic until nov 17 1915 when it and the adjacent hotel both built in 1869 were destroyed in one of the most spectacular fires to that point in north platte s history on march 15 1918 a new brick depot was dedicated it also housed offices and a restaurant that would be converted for the world war ii canteen a new 28 stall roundhouse was built in 1913 a powerhouse furnishing electricity for all terminal facilities was added as was a four conveyor coaling station a new machine shop was built in 1937 one of the new units of modern equipment was a 20 ton traveling crane that increased the scope of work done at the north platte shops that was also the year that the union pacific board of directors named a north platte native son william m jeffers as president of the railroad jeffers who began his work for the railroad as a call boy was the first u p president to come up through the ranks improvements continued as did the increase in the number of employees and the size of the local railroad payroll in 1948 union pacific located a huge retarder yard at north platte at a cost of 3 5 million five miles long

by matt egan cnn business wall street didn t exactly roll out the red carpet to welcome robinhood after its highly anticipated debut the fast growing trading company finished thursday at 34 82 down 8 from its initial public offering price robinhood failed to score the first day pop that new companies covet and that s despite robinhood pricing its ipo at 38 the low end of the expected range all of this suggests demand is somewhat lukewarm for robinhood a company that has revolutionized the way americans trade but has also been dogged by controversy only about a quarter of us ipos have dropped during their first day of trading excluding blank check companies according to professor jay ritter from the university of florida the average first day pop is 33 the robinhood ipo values the company at about 32 billion making it more valuable than major companies including nasdaq southwest airlines and kroger that s well above the 12 billion price tag robinhood scored in its most recent round of private funding the deal is a major milestone for a company that pioneered zero commission trading and is enjoying explosive growth it s humbling robinhood ceo vlad tenev told cnn s julia chatterley on thursday tenev an immigrant from bulgaria pointed to how he first arrived in new york city as a five year old in the early 90s and began his entrepreneurial career in new york as well now to be back here after six years since robinhood s launch it s really surreal tenev said the ipo is raising 2 1 billion and robinhood began trading on the nasdaq thursday under the ticker symbol hood robinhood s revenue surged by 245 last year to 959 million as its user growth and trading volume skyrocketed the business has been a juggernaut they ve got a great platform they can build off of said david weild former vice chairman of the nasdaq who is now the ceo of investment bank weild co it seems rich investors are paying a premium for robinhood s growth at the ipo price the deal values robinhood at about 21 times trailing revenue according to renaissance capital that compares a multiple of just five for charles schwab a rival that is expanding at a slower pace it seems rich unless the company can keep up this high growth said kathleen smith a principal at renaissance capital which manages the renaissance ipo etf robinhood completely disrupted the online brokerage industry by pioneering zero commission trading as the company lured new and existing investors to its platform rivals were forced to eliminate trading fees and join forces just to survive now robinhood is disrupting the ipo process the company is allowing its users to buy a chunk as much as one third of its ipo shares before they begin trading on the nasdaq normally only corporate insiders and powerful institutions can get access to these coveted shares new regulatory probes revealed robinhood s public debut was delayed by a series of controversies from record breaking settlements to massive outages that raise questions about the company s business model management team and ability to keep up with its explosive growth just this week robinhood disclosed that regulators are investigating the fact that ceo vlad tenev is not licensed with finra wall street s powerful self regulator robinhood has argued tenev is not required to be licensed because he s the ceo of the parent company not its broker dealer arm asked by cnn if he s tempted to take the finra exam just to shut everybody up tenev said robinhood doesn t think that s required at this point when asked if he d do it when square ceo jack dorsey gets registered with finra tenev said maybe the financial industry regulatory authority and the securities and exchange commission are also probing whether robinhood employees traded shares of gamestop amc and other meme stocks ahead of the trading platform s infamous trading restrictions in january last month finra slapped the brokerage with its biggest ever penalty and accused the company of harming millions of customers and giving investors false or misleading information finra cited in part options trading procedures at the heart of a recently settled lawsuit filed by the family of alex kearns a 20 year old robinhood trader who died by suicide last year robinhood neither admitted to nor denied the finra charges feed fish to sharks rep sean casten a democrat who represents the illinois town where the kearns family is from is concerned about the gamification of trading platforms like robinhood in an interview casten said robinhood has a huge economic incentive to lure as much dumb money as possible and then sell it to smart money its business model exists to feed fish to sharks said casten who introduced a bill this week that would require the government accountability office to study the impact of the gamification of online trading platforms asked if robinhood is mature enough to be a public company tenev pointed to improvements made in leadership customer support infrastructure and technology you can see how much the company has grown he told cnn weild the former nasdaq executive said robinhood s struggles may have only enhanced public awareness about the company something that ironically could help the company he likened the situation to challenges that faced america online during its rapid expansion in the 1990s all it did was increase their visibility and branding weild said these are not free apps but robinhood s struggles have also shined a bright light on the company s controversial business model known as payment for order flow like some other online brokerages robinhood makes most of its revenue by selling its retail order flow to high speed trading firms like citadel securities robinhood argues that this tactic benefits everyday investors because it has paved the way for no commission trading but others say it s really the high speed trading firms that are benefiting otherwise they wouldn t be paying robinhood for the order flow now the very business model that robinhood is so reliant on is in doubt the securities and exchange commission is reviewing payment for order flow sec chairman gary gensler warned in may that there are inherent conflicts of interest in this business model and expressed concern about the gamefied nature of trading apps these are not free apps they are just zero commission apps the cost is inside the order execution gensler told lawmakers if the sec bans payment for order flow it would deal a blow to robinhood and force the company to find new sources of revenue levered to the market boom robinhood faces competition from not only well established online brokerages but from upstarts like public com and invstr that market the fact that they do not sell retail order flow to high speed traders smith the renaissance capital executive said another risk is how closely linked robinhood s bottom line is to the fate of booming markets what if we get a negative market people could easily get turned off if they lose money smith said this company is so levered to equity and crypto markets a downturn would hurt robinhood more than a charles schwab the

audrey strauss u s attorney for the southern district of new york speaks at a news conference where securities fraud charges against nikola corp founder trevor milton were announced the founder and onetime executive chair of nikola corp was freed on 100 million bail thursday after pleading not guilty to charges that he lied about the electric and hydrogen powered truck startup duping novice investors including some financially struggling people looking for income during the pandemic trevor milton 39 of oakley utah resigned from nikola in september amid allegations of fraud at the time milton said he would defend himself against accusations that the company made false claims about its vehicles allegations that nikola rejects advertisement in an indictment unsealed in manhattan federal court milton was charged with securities and wire fraud after entering his plea at his arraignment milton put up two utah properties including one that a prosecutor said was recently appraised at 36 million to secure his bail magistrate judge sarah netburn ordered him not to contact investors unless he had an independent relationship with them marc mukasey one of martin s attorneys alerted the judge that some financial information in the court record would have to be revised including a statement that some milton bank accounts contained 50 million advertisement mukasey said it was a lot less than that as we understand it as he left the courthouse afterward milton declined to answer questions real estate nikola motor head trevor milton drops 32 5 million on 2 000 acre utah ranch a scenic utah estate spanning roughly 2 000 acres has sold to nikola motor co ceo trevor milton for 32 5 million placing it among the priciest residential sales in utah history his lawyers issued a statement saying justice was not served by the government s action today but it will be when mr milton is exonerated the statement called the case a new low in the government s efforts to criminalize lawful business conduct every executive in america should be horrified trevor milton is an entrepreneur who had a long term vision of helping the environment by cutting carbon emissions in the trucking industry mr milton has been wrongfully accused following a faulty and incomplete investigation in which the government ignored critical evidence and failed to interview important witnesses it added audrey strauss the u s attorney in manhattan said milton from november 2019 through september brazenly and repeatedly used social media and appearances and interviews on television podcasts and in print to make false and misleading claims about the status of nikola s trucks and technology advertisement she told a news conference that the charges were where the rubber meets the road the securities and exchange commission filed separate civil charges shares of nikola corp headquartered in phoenix tumbled 7 before the opening bell thursday at the close of trading they were down 15 to 12 03 milton s claims were aimed at retail investors lacking professional experience in the securities markets including people with no experience who began trading stocks during the covid 19 pandemic to replace or supplement lost income or to occupy time during the lockdown the indictment said some it said suffered hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses including the loss of retirement savings or funds they had borrowed to invest in nikola advertisement meanwhile milton was motivated to mislead investors to enrich himself and elevate his stature as an entrepreneur the indictment said noting that his holdings in nikola were valued at 8 5 billion at one point moving him closer to his dream of being listed among the world s 100 wealthiest people milton was described in the indictment as a serial entrepreneur from utah with no formal background in engineering when he started nikola in 2015 after nikola announced in march 2020 that its stock would be publicly listed milton became increasingly preoccupied with its stock price and keeping it high it said the indictment cited numerous public statements milton made as false and misleading including his claims that the company had early success at creating a fully functioning semitrailer truck prototype known as the nikola one milton knew the prototype was inoperable it said and was missing key parts including gears and motors advertisement last year a report from hindenburg research said nikola s success was an intricate fraud and based on an ocean of lies including a video showing a truck rolling downhill to give the impression it was cruising on a highway and stenciling the words hydrogen electric on the side of a vehicle that was actually powered by natural gas the video was included in the indictment along with milton s explanation that the truck did not drive under its own power because motors and gears were removed for safety reasons and his statements that he never deceived anyone milton also misled investors when he said nikola had engineered and built an electricity and hydrogen powered pickup truck known as the badger from the ground up using nikola s parts and technology when he knew that wasn t true the indictment said advertisement the indictment alleged he misled investors as well when he said nikola was producing hydrogen at a reduced cost when milton knew that in fact no hydrogen was being produced at all by nikola at any cost
