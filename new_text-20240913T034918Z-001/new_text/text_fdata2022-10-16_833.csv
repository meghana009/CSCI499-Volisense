almost 97 of industrial companies registered a negative effect of the covid 19 pandemic and to this day the manufacturing supply chain is still sputtering disrupting and adjusting to the newfound needs although agility has become the fundamental need of the supply chain it remains extremely difficult to stay responsive to market change here s the four biggest issues of manufacturing planning in 2022 and how to solve them 1 supply chain visibility the supply chain depends on separate yet interconnected processes to achieve a dynamic balance between supply and demand the success of an end to end strategy relies on both the upstream transactions to suppliers and the downstream proceedings with customers any weak link within the process can put the entire chain at risk limited visibility over the supply chain leaves companies with little to no room for action in the case of unforeseen events a supply chain disruption in the process only presents itself when it is too late to perform any remediating measure without proper supply chain visibility companies usually resort to costly special handling to meet demands this further exacerbates inventory costs and diminishes profit margins cloud solutions offer features that significantly improve visibility to these disruptions and open up opportunities to increase adaptability amid unforeseen scenarios by leveraging interconnected systems companies can monitor current inventory levels more easily with a forecast of incoming stock automating purchase orders to generate just in time ensures stock availability while decreasing the risk of surplus inventory as for orders in transit batch tracking features provide an outlook on adherence to schedules and accountability for product handling 2 offshoring issues globalization makes modern day companies dependent on international business transactions to meet high volume demand vulnerabilities in this highly complex system cause significant disruptions on a global scale we learned that the hard way with the pandemic and the tensions arising from the russian ukrainian war lockdowns due to the pandemic cause labor and spare part shortages for many manufacturers bringing their plants to a standstill when the spares finally arrive managers are under immense pressure to resume manufacturing and deliver the finished product as soon as humanly possible another major issue is the closure of international borders which obstructs the flow of goods in addition to raw materials and supplies shortage distributors and retailers face finished goods deficiency inventories are drying up as a result reshoring is becoming the focal point for infusing resilience into the supply chain more manufacturers are beginning to look for accessibility to their warehouses plants and suppliers and almost 83 of the manufacturers are likely to reshore companies need to take immediate action in looking for locally available alternatives for business continuity aside from stock security such investments open opportunities for better lead times and negotiable prices one positive side effect is that when you partner with local suppliers it is easier to avoid global economic and political issues well known automotive companies are already implementing a reshoring strategy the united states will become the home for a few of their new factories helping them avoid the aforementioned disruptions 3 increased pressure for sustainability one fifth of the carbon footprint comes from the manufacturing industry which consumes about 54 of the energy resources the chemical and plastic manufacturing supply chain alone contributes about 80 of the total emission the need to reduce this percentage has led to increased costs in the supply chain c suite executives across the manufacturing industry need to be careful with the choice of raw material sources the energy that powers their factories the packaging materials they use and the disposal of their production surplus digital transformation in manufacturing helps track these data points and implement the necessary control it enables manufacturers to design products with sustainability in mind make factories of the future use renewable energy across a plant source ethical materials make a supply chain that reduces wastes and addresses recycling more sophisticated systems may also be capable of sending alerts in case of excess consumption to take prompt and corrective actions with the rise of innovation and available technology sustainability no longer needs to be simply an outgoing cost instead it can deliver ways for resource optimization that contribute to longer term savings 4 lack of a strong collaboration network manufacturing planning must include interconnected teams across the value chain the unpredictability of supply and demand can easily skew negotiations towards a more established company instead it is in the best interest of all parties to take a more objective approach in evaluating costs and benefits throughout transactions for instance a smaller sized consumer might feel pressured to shell out higher rates for a sought after product however a more thoughtful and practical procurement schedule can open opportunities for longer term negotiations repeat transactions and improved prices by having relevant reliable and updated data teams can make data backed prompt decisions that empower them for the long haul following the previous scenario a facility will benefit greatly from looking into a broader horizon for their demands by tapping into features of current systems and employing data science technologies they can forecast requirements across internal functions and schedule upcoming work with higher precision on top of the increased capability to break silos within internal teams a collaborative network also expands its applications to external stakeholders with a strong foundation in streamlined internal systems companies can further improve efficiency by sharing forecasts and improving communications with partner vendors manufacturing giants rely on specialized suppliers to meet their end goals of delivering quality however establishing strong partnerships with external suppliers requires transparency and reliable data digital maturity that allows facilities to make informed decisions and accurate forecasts enables them to build relationships with key suppliers conclusion the manufacturing industry supply chain has always been complex and the covid 19 pandemic made it even more tangled high dependency on various functions along with the demands of today s customers is making it more difficult to stay afloat digital technology adoption at various stages and industry 4 0 help overcome these challenges from enhancing output quality to developing sustainable products digital transformation has become the go to solution for many manufacturers

register for free to read more of the latest local news it s easy and will only take a moment jeremy hunt said that liz truss s mini budget went too far too fast as the new chancellor effectively signalled the demise of the prime minister s economic vision political and economic circles spent saturday sizing up mr hunt after he used a series of broadcast interviews in the morning to suggest ms truss s immediate economic plan is now largely defunct with all eyes on whether he can restore the uk s financial credibility mr hunt suggested tax rises could form part of a painful fiscal package designed to restore market confidence in the uk the chancellor in a statement on saturday evening said that his vision would be growth underpinned by stability promising clear and robust plans he said we have to be honest with people and we are going to have to take some very difficult decisions both on spending and on tax to get debt falling but at the top of our minds when making these decisions will be how to protect and help struggling families businesses and people earlier governor of the bank of england andrew bailey said he spoke to mr hunt on friday after his appointment speaking in washington he said the pair had a meeting of minds on the issue of fiscal sustainability as he noted the fact the office of budget responsibility is now very much back in the picture but that came alongside a warning that inflationary pressures could lead to another hike in interest rates by bank officials in the near future mr hunt a former foreign secretary was parachuted into number 11 to replace kwasi kwarteng in a bid to restore order to ms truss s ailing administration he spent his first full day in office warning of difficult decisions to come as he suggested taxes could rise and budgets including health and defence are likely to be squeezed further in the coming months on friday after three weeks of turmoil on the financial markets in the wake of mr kwarteng s 43 billion mini budget tax giveaway ms truss sacked him and ditched her commitment to drop a planned rise in corporation tax from 19 to 25 writing in the sun newspaper ms truss admitted it had been a wrench to see my friend kwasi kwarteng leave the government it was a mistake to fly blind and to do these forecasts without giving people the confidence of the office of budget responsibility saying that the sums add up jeremy hunt mr hunt twice a tory leadership contender wasted no time in criticising the mini budget but endorsed the fundamentals of the push for growth he told sky news it was a mistake when we re going to be asking for difficult decisions across the board on tax and spending to cut the rate of tax paid by the very wealthiest it was a mistake to fly blind and to do these forecasts without giving people the confidence of the office of budget responsibility saying that the sums add up allies of mr hunt had likened his new role to that of the chief executive in government and on saturday mr hunt acknowledged that the prime minister has effectively handed control of public finances to him but he played down talk of him being a newly powerful figure in government stressing he and ms truss are a team he will meet her at chequers on sunday after holding talks with treasury officials on saturday prime minister liz truss during a press conference in the briefing room at downing street on friday pa mr hunt s comments were immediately taken as a sign that cuts to public spending and tax rises could soon be coming as he confirmed the medium term fiscal plan on october 31 will effectively be a proper budget spending will not rise by as much as people would like and all government departments are going to have to find more efficiencies than they were planning to he said and some taxes will not be cut as quickly as people want some taxes will go up so it s going to be difficult appearing to rule out an early election mr hunt also repeatedly insisted that voters now want stability and in 18 months will be able to judge ms truss at the ballot box but his comments may only add to the sense among some tory mps that ms truss is increasingly powerless in downing street with her party split about its next steps at a brief news conference in downing street on friday the prime minister dismissed calls for her resignation saying she is absolutely determined to see through what i have promised but it comes amid multiple reports of tory mps and conservative grandees plotting moves to force her from office even as cabinet ministers remained publicly loyal to the prime minister kwasi kwarteng was forced out as chancellor on friday pa to many observers it appears the end could be nigh for the prime minister after only a few weeks in the job sir geoffrey clifton brown told lbc on saturday it all hinges on how the markets receive the fiscal plan at the end of the month while he said he believes mr hunt can steady the ship he warned that if it doesn t manage to satisfy the markets and satisfy everybody else and the economy is still in chaos then i think we would be in a very difficult situation the damage has already been done and is very very hard to reverse you can t reverse out of a car crash sir keir starmer labour leader elsewhere there was speculation that including the ministry of defence in any round of spending cuts could spark a clash with defence secretary ben wallace a defence source said mr wallace will hold ms truss to the pledges made ms truss promised to increase defence spending to 3 of gdp by 2030 in the wake of the war in ukraine the promise of a new direction yet again also appeared to cause unrest among the party s free marketeers thatcherite tory mp john redwood offered an early warning to the new chancellor tweeting you cannot tax your way to higher growth if you tax too much you end up borrowing more as you have a worse slowdown labour leader sir keir starmer reached into his own party s factional disputes of yesteryear in a swipe at the grotesque chaos of the truss government in a speech in barnsley he referenced former party leader neil kinnock s famous 1985 attack on the left wing militant group in liverpool as he pointed to the grotesque chaos of a tory prime minister handing out redundancy notices to her own chancellor accusing ms truss of clinging on to power sir keir said there are no historical precedents for what they have done to our economy he also called for the fiscal statement to be brought forward telling the pa news agency the crisis we re facing at the moment is a crisis made in downing street and the damage has already been done and is very very hard to reverse you can t reverse out of a car crash

care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans

brought ms truss to power amid warnings of difficult decisions to come over the next two weeks mr hunt and ms truss will meet in her chequers residence on sunday as tax rises and spending cuts loom on the horizon the chancellor who spent saturday also meeting with treasury officials insisted that he and the prime minister were a team as he said that his priority was growth underpinned by stability the drive on growing the economy is right it means more people can get good jobs new businesses can thrive and we can secure world class public services but we went too far too fast he said earlier he told broadcasters spending will not rise by as much as people would like and all government departments are going to have to find more efficiencies than they were planning to and some taxes will not be cut as quickly as people want some taxes will go up so it s going to be difficult as mr hunt begins his job of putting together a fresh budget for october 31 one possible plan as reported in the sunday times would be to delay his predecessor s aim of reducing the basic rate of income tax by a year as part of a wider package designed to calm the financial markets earlier governor of the bank of england andrew bailey said he spoke to mr hunt on friday after his appointment as he warned that interest rates may have to be raised higher than initially expected to tackle inflation speaking from washington he said the pair had a meeting of minds on the issue of fiscal sustainability as he noted the fact the office of budget responsibility is now very much back in the picture us president joe biden also appeared to join in the criticism of ms truss s plan telling reporters i wasn t the only one that thought it was a mistake and calling the outcome predictable asked about her original economic strategy he added that while he disagreed with her plan it was up to the british people prime minister liz truss is clinging on to power after a disastrous few days daniel leal pa mr biden also dismissed concerns about the strength of the dollar the problem is the lack of economic growth and sound policy in other countries questions still hang over the government about whether it would be able to win enough support from a divided party for a series of painful decisions on tax and spending that have already prompted memories of the austerity era under david cameron and george osborne in a media blitz over the weekend both mr hunt and ms truss tried to win over their own party and voters to the new downing street regime after completing several interviews on saturday the new chancellor will later appear on bbc one s sunday with laura kuenssberg ms truss who used a piece in the sun newspaper to admit that sacking her friend and ideological soulmate mr kwarteng had been a wrench said we cannot pave the way to a low tax high growth economy without maintaining the confidence of the markets in our commitment to sound money mr hunt writing in the telegraph said that the government was changing course so far his appointment has failed to dampen speculation of an imminent coup against ms truss rishi sunak the defeated leadership contender and former chancellor as well as defence secretary ben wallace have been among the names flagged as potential replacements sir geoffrey clifton brown told lbc on saturday that for ms truss it all hinges on how the markets receive

manage to satisfy the markets and satisfy everybody else and the economy is still in chaos then i think we would be in a very difficult situation elsewhere there was speculation that including the ministry of defence in any round of spending cuts could spark a clash with mr wallace a defence source said he will hold ms truss to the pledges made ms truss promised to increase defence spending to 3 of gdp by 2030 in the wake of the war in ukraine the prime minister nonetheless still has her defenders within the party former culture minister nadine dorries a loyal follower of boris johnson

budget went too far too fast as the new chancellor effectively signalled the demise of the prime minister s economic vision political and economic circles spent saturday sizing up mr hunt after he used a series of broadcast interviews in the morning to suggest ms truss s immediate economic plan is now largely defunct with all eyes on whether he can restore the uk s financial credibility mr hunt suggested tax rises could form part of a painful fiscal package designed to restore market confidence in the uk the chancellor in a statement on saturday evening said that his vision would be growth underpinned by stability promising clear and robust plans he said we have to be honest with people and we are going to have to take some very difficult decisions both on spending and on tax to get debt falling but at the top of our minds when making these decisions will be how to protect and help struggling families businesses and people earlier governor of the bank of england andrew bailey said he spoke to mr hunt on friday after his appointment speaking in washington he said the pair had a meeting of minds on the issue of fiscal sustainability as he noted the fact the office of budget responsibility is now very much back in the picture but that came alongside a warning that inflationary pressures could lead to another hike in interest rates by bank officials in the near future mr hunt a former foreign secretary was parachuted into number 11 to replace kwasi kwarteng in a bid to restore order to ms truss s ailing administration he spent his first full day in office warning of difficult decisions to come as he suggested taxes could rise and budgets including health and defence are likely to be squeezed further in the coming months on friday after three weeks of turmoil on the financial markets in the wake of mr kwarteng s 43 billion mini budget tax giveaway ms truss sacked him and ditched her commitment to drop a planned rise in corporation tax from 19 to 25 writing in the sun newspaper ms truss admitted it had been a wrench to see my friend kwasi kwarteng leave the government mr hunt twice a tory leadership contender wasted no time in criticising the mini budget but endorsed the fundamentals of the push for growth he told sky news it was a mistake when we re going to be asking for difficult decisions across the board on tax and spending to cut the rate of tax paid by the very wealthiest it was a mistake to fly blind and to do these forecasts without giving people the confidence of the office of budget responsibility saying that the sums add up allies of mr hunt had likened his new role to that of the chief executive in government and on saturday mr hunt acknowledged that the prime minister has effectively handed control of public finances to him but he played down talk of him being a newly powerful figure in government stressing he and ms truss are a team he will meet her at chequers on sunday after holding talks with treasury officials on saturday mr hunt s comments were immediately taken as a sign that cuts to public spending and tax rises could soon be coming as he confirmed the medium term fiscal plan on october 31 will effectively be a proper budget spending will not rise by as much as people would like and all government departments are going to have to find more efficiencies than they were planning to he said and some taxes will not be cut as quickly as people want some taxes will go up so it s going to be difficult appearing to rule out an early election mr hunt also repeatedly insisted that voters now want stability and in 18 months will be able to judge ms truss at the ballot box but his comments may only add to the sense among some tory mps that ms truss is increasingly powerless in downing street with her party split about its next steps at a brief news conference in downing street on friday the prime minister dismissed calls for her resignation saying she is absolutely determined to see through what i have promised but it comes amid multiple reports of tory mps and conservative grandees plotting moves to force her from office even as cabinet ministers remained publicly loyal to the prime minister image getty to many observers it appears the end could be nigh for the prime minister after only a few weeks in the job sir geoffrey clifton brown told lbc on saturday it all hinges on how the markets receive the fiscal plan at the end of the month while he said he believes mr hunt can steady the ship he warned that if it doesn t manage to satisfy the markets and satisfy everybody else and the economy is still in chaos then i think we would be in a very difficult situation elsewhere there was speculation that including the ministry of defence in any round of spending cuts could spark a clash with defence secretary ben wallace a defence source said mr wallace will hold ms truss to the pledges made ms truss promised to increase defence spending to 3 of gdp by 2030 in the wake of the war in ukraine the promise of a new direction yet again also appeared to cause unrest among the party s free marketeers thatcherite tory mp john redwood offered an early warning to the new chancellor tweeting you cannot tax your way to higher growth if you tax too much you end up borrowing more as you have a worse slowdown labour leader sir keir starmer reached into his own party s factional disputes of yesteryear in a swipe at the grotesque chaos of the truss government in a speech in barnsley he referenced former party leader neil kinnock s famous 1985 attack on the left wing militant group in liverpool as he pointed to the grotesque chaos of a tory prime minister handing out redundancy notices to her own chancellor accusing ms truss of clinging on to power sir keir said there are no historical precedents for what they have done to our economy he also called for the fiscal statement to be brought forward telling the pa news agency the crisis we re facing at the moment is a crisis made in downing street and the damage has already been done and is very very hard to reverse you can t reverse out of a car crash for more stories from where you live visit inyourarea

introduction leaders from the major industrialized countries are scheduled to meet in detroit michigan on march 14 15 at the request of president clinton to discuss the causes of the persistently high levels of unemployment in their countries announcing the goals of the summit in europe this january president clinton declared that we simply must figure out how to create more jobs and how to reward people who work both harder and smarter in the workplace david r sands clinton announces plans for jobs summit the washington times january 11 1994 p b7 the president is right to focus on how to create more jobs in this country although he boasted during his state of the union address that 1 6 million jobs were created in 1993 job growth in fact is much weaker than normal this long after a recession since world war ii total employment growth has averaged 9 2 percent 33 months after a recession but since the bottom of the 1990 1991 recession total employment in the united states has climbed by just 2 5 percent daniel j mitchell the budget and the economy a first year assessment of the clinton presidency heritage foundation backgrounder update no 213 february 7 1994 p 2 president clinton would do well to ponder the anemic job growth in europe because european firms are encumbered with costly mandates and taxes on employment that have discouraged hiring and held back employment growth the president should recognize that his administration s policies are repeating the mistake of the europeans and contributing to slow growth of earnings and employment in the united states for example the administration has enacted the biggest tax increase in american history which will discourage new business investment and job creation by raising corporate and individual tax rates signed the mandated family and medical leave act which will raise labor costs and force employers to be far more selective about whom they hire since they are required to offer certain employees more time off proposed a massive overhaul of the health care system which would raise labor costs by mandating that employers cover workers according to lewin vhi one of the country s leading health care econometrics firms the clinton health plan would mean that among firms now providing health insurance 19 9 percent would see costs per employee rising 500 1 000 per year 51 6 percent would face cost increases per employee of 1 000 2 500 while another 15 2 percent would face costs per employee of more than 2 500 lewin vhi the financial impact of the health security act fairfax va lewin vhi 1993 proposed worker training and unemployment insurance reform that would cost between 3 billion and 9 billion per year david r sands hill republicans criticize clinton s jobless measure the washington times february 23 1994 p b8 considered a hike in the minimum wage from 4 25 to 4 75 an hour which would further increase the disincentive to hire teenage and poor inner city unemployed individuals moved ahead with an ambitious environmental regulatory agenda rangeing from global warming to new logging policies federal register pages a rough estimate of the overall amount of regulatory activity ran 60 950 for 1993 the highest level since the carter administration left office in 1980 these policies signal an apparent misunderstanding of the employment and job policies that led to the creation of over 20 million new jobs in the 1980s see daniel j mitchell tax rates fairness and economic growth lessons from the 1980s heritage foundation backgrounder no 860 october 15 1991 p 2 each of these new programs or proposed policies add to the three principal governmental barriers that discourage employers from creating new jobs taxes credit barriers and regulatory and mandated benefit burdens these barriers which have steadily increased over the past few years in the united states have discouraged business expansion and increased the cost of hiring new workers failure to reduce these barriers or worse still the imposition of new barriers means that america will become a slow growth economy president clinton should realize that high wages and mandated benefits are ruining the european economies and leading to high unemployment rates in fact several european countries and japan are now trying to lower their labor costs and dismantle their generous safety nets instead of continuing to add more burdens on employers president clinton should take the opportunity of the summit to advocate five simple principles of job creation principle 1 european style job training and employment policies have proven incapable of keeping unemployment low or raising the worker s overall standard of living principle 2 high tax rates on employers and capital is the quickest way to insure high unemployment principle 3 excessive financial and banking regulations which restrict the amount of capital firms can obtain greatly limit business and job expansion principle 4 increasing the regulatory burden and mandating numerous employee benefits is a recipe for job destruction principle 5 sustained job growth results from competitive efficient industries that are free of excessive government interference only by talking bluntly to the european allies and shunning solutions to the continuing problems of unemployment that will only slow wage growth can president clinton help the industrialized world to correct its economic ills adopting european style employment policies on the other hand will lead only to european style results understanding the five principles of job growth principle 1 european style job training and employment policies have proven incapable of keeping unemployment low or raising the worker s overall standard of living during his speech announcing the jobs summit president clinton declared we americans have a lot to learn from europe in matters of job training and apprenticeship of moving our people from school to work into good paying jobs sands clinton announces plans op cit undoubtedly americans have much to learn from the europeans but not about their employment policies the true effects of the european policies which the president and others glorify are best illustrated by the case of germany german workers enjoy roughly six weeks paid vacation each year the shortest work week of any major industrial nation high wages averaging 26 an hour and extensive health benefits mandated by the government but as ferdinand protzman of the new york times notes unfortunately no longer works instead the social contract that once made germany s economy a model of stability has helped erode the nation s competitiveness as it struggles to recover from the worst recession in postwar history ferdinand protzman rewriting the contract for germany s vaunted workers the new york times february 13 1994 p f5 like many of its european neighbors germany is struggling with what has come to be known as eurosclerosis which signifies a stagnant growth environment as the chart on the following page shows adherence to this model has brought the european union eu slow growth and high unemployment unemployment has averaged almost 10 percent over the past decade in the major european countries and is projected to average 12 1 percent in 1994 for the members of the eu at the end of last year approximately 32 million europeans were jobless which is roughly equivalent to the combined workforces of spain and sweden stella dawson global jobs summit delayed amid nafta battle the reuters european business report november 4 1993 overall the u s rate of employment growth has far outstripped europe observes c fred bergsten director of the institute of international economics the u s has kept labor costs down and created 40 million new jobs over the past 20 years in europe wages have risen about 60 percent during that span but only 2 or 3 million jobs have been created quoted in protzman op cit peter gumbel of the wall street journal maintains this eurosclerosis is caused by a tangle of labor regulations and rising costs for employers acts as a major disincentive to job creation and a powerful incentive to moving production elsewhere peter gumbel western europe finds that it s pricing itself out of the job market the wall street journal december 9 1993 p a1 not surprisingly perhaps some 30 percent of business surveyed recently by the german chamber of commerce say they are considering shifting production to a more hospitable business environment beside the european burdens on employers which discourage job expansion employment is also discouraged through extensive unemployment insurance programs explains david r henderson of the hoover institution a single 40 year old previously employed at the average production worker s wage would get benefits equal to 59 of previous earnings in france 58 in germany and 70 in the netherlands david r henderson eurosclerosis spreads to our shores the wall street journal october 14 1993 p a16 these benefits can be collected for many years as well hence although the broad safety net available to displaced workers seems compassionate on the surface it actually creates disincentives to full employment and a productive workforce absenteeism for example ran at 9 percent in western germany in 1992 8 2 percent in france and 12 1 percent in sweden by way of comparison the u s rate is only 3 percent protzman op cit also overrated is the german job training system which clinton and his labor secretary robert reich seek to emulate while the german educational system focuses on highly technical training for its future workers the u s system focuses on generalized training some academics such as lester thurow of mit argue that the german approach has created a superior workforce which enjoys a better standard of living but a recent comparison of the two systems by kenneth a couch of syracuse university disputes this belief couch concludes that an apprenticeship program by itself is unlikely to have widespread positive effects either on economic measures such as employment or indirectly related social problems kenneth a couch germans and job training education and us the american enterprise november december 1993 p 18 for example comparing german and american 24 to 33 year old high school graduates without further education couch found roughly the same percentage were employed with actually more americans than germans possessing manufacturing jobs more of the americans in the sample group were married and slightly more americans had children likewise from 1983 to 1988 couch found american workers outperformed their german counterparts overall america experienced average annual employment growth during the period of 2 4 percent versus germany s meager 0 4 percent and real gdp growth over the same period averaged 3 9 percent for america and 2 3 percent for germany other european countries have fared no better relative to america if american policymakers choose to move toward a more technical based educational system the german approach thus is not the obvious model to follow as couch notes emulating the german approach may in fact give us an educational system that will not perform better but will cost more than our current one ibid p 13 following the failed model european style job training and employment policies which have been implemented in america have met with failure public employment programs have proven to be net job destroyers since the amount of money required to create a public sector job is typically several times that of private sector job creation see edward l hudgins ph d why infrastructure spending won t jump start the economy heritage foundation memo to president elect clinton no 9 january 15 1993 a recent study of public transit investment by john semmens of the chandler arizona based laissez faire institute notes that for the 61 5 billion invested since 1965 only 800 000 jobs were created if that same amount of money had been invested by private business through a corporate tax cut 8 million jobs could have been created john semmens government investments yield poor results heartland institute a heartland perspective october 18 1993 p 2 likewise semmens found that 13 million to 20 million jobs would have been created if the 61 5 billion had instead been devoted to a capital gains tax cut or an expansion of individual retirement account investment in treasury bills or common stocks john semmens federal transit subsidies how government investment harms the economy the freeman february 1994 p 71 75 most important instead of producing the high wage well skilled jobs the current administration calls for so frequently public programs only provide low wage low skill temporary employment which often costs taxpayers dearly in the process further it cannot be argued that government sponsored employment training policies provide european citizens with greater purchasing power and a higher standard of living than americans purchasing power parity which is the most accurate measure of comparative consumer power shows that u s consumers have a clear advantage over foreign citizens see table on preceeding page following europe s poor example therefore likely will lead not only to lower growth and fewer jobs but also to a lower standard of living for american citizens the europeanization of the american labor market despite the failure of the european system to sustain employment and a higher standard of living america s federal labor market policy is being molded to resemble german french and other european models this europeanization of the american labor market policy threatens to undermine industrial competitiveness increase budgetary strains and lower the average worker s standard of living principle 2 high tax rates on employers and capital is the quickest way to insure high unemployment to hire additional workers employers need capital capital fuels job creation by allowing employers to invest in the various means of production including land equipment factories new technologies and labor capital can be acquired in one of two ways saving it from profits or borrowing it examining each method of capital accumulation indicates why u s employers are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain the fuel for job creation the current tax environment past recoveries show that the u s economy is performing below typical levels whereas employment in the previous post war recoveries averaged 9 2 percent 33 months after the end of the recession the current recovery has only seen approximately 2 5 percent growth over a similar period of time one factor that aided recoveries during the early 1960s and early 1980s was a reduction in tax rates unfortunately the most recent recession which followed the 1990 tax hikes has been followed by tax rate increases the clinton tax plan adopted by congress last year increased taxes on business and investment the corporate tax rate on business for example was raised from 34 percent to 36 percent likewise top individual rates moved up from 31 percent to as high as 42 5 percent this is important since approximately 80 percent of small businesses pay taxes under the personal income tax code the excessive taxation of capital gains also continues the capital gains tax on individuals currently stands at 28 percent up from 20 percent in 1986 as the chart on the following page shows before this rate jump new business incorporations had risen steadily throughout the 1980s after the increase start ups fell immediately and sharply the aggregate effect of these taxes is a huge barrier to job creation as capital shifts from the hands of investors to the government the effects of the tax barrier high taxes reduce investment in businesses and slow job growth by encouraging individuals and firms to seek alternative investments with a more profitable return on their dollar it should be no surprise that america s current savings and investment rates are lower than those required for robust long run economic growth this is due directly to the trade off investors face when contemplating increasing consumption versus saving or investing increasing consumption carries little penalty few taxes or other disincentives exist for immediate purchases but forgoing current consumption to invest assets represents an increasingly unattractive option if the rewards of profitability springing from investment are penalized with higher tax rates moreover earnings in the u s are still penalized twice through taxation first at the corporate level and then later at the individual level therefore if an investor had 10 000 to spend or invest spending currently would more than likely represent a more attractive choice than investing taxes raise the cost of capital for industrial equipment and machinery as the american council for capital formation accf reports recent research confirm that the volume of investment in equipment is a critical factor in the pace of economic growth and development nvestment in equipment is perhaps the single most important factor in economic growth and development mark bloomfield and margo thorning ph d the impact of president clinton s tax proposals on capital formation american council for capital formation testimony to the house ways and means committee march 16 1993 p 5 yet accf points out that despite the beneficial effects of the tax reducing economic recovery act of 1981 on such investment tax policy in the following years became heavily biased against such investment incentives the tax acts of 1982 and 1986 which raised taxes each resulted in an increase in the cost of capital for equipment as investors found such opportunities less attractive largely as a result of these high tax policies the total cost of capital for manufacturing equipment increased by 22 9 percent from 1981 to 1986 the most recent revisions of the tax code are likely to further discourage investment and thereby increase barriers to expansion and job creation hence the potential for long term job creation in the current tax environment is not encouraging since entrepreneurs are less able to entice investors to risk their money on new business ventures because taxes create disincentives to invest in businesses capital for future job creation is being produced at a lower rate principle 3 excessive financial and banking regulations which restrict the amount of capital firms can obtain greatly limit business and job expansion in recent years the term credit crunch has been coined to refer to how difficult it has been for many businesses to obtain loans one reason this crunch has occurred has been the sharp rise in banking regulation in recent years in addition to 10 7 billion in general regulatory compliance costs in 1992 bankers face costs from lost interest payments on reserves they are required hold at the federal reserve and deposit insurance premiums not included in the 10 7 billion figure are the potential costs from the fdic improvement act of 1991 which could push regulatory costs even higher the effects of the credit barrier how do these trends affect job creation this regulatory burden has had a restrictive effect on credit growth in recent years the american bankers association observes that over this same period more than 40 major federal regulations affecting bank operations were promulgated american bankers association the banking industry the key to jobs and economic growth february 1 1993 p 8 although estimates of the regulatory burden on banks are not available for previous recessionary periods there is no doubt that the number of regulatory restrictions and burdens the banking industry faces have increased significantly over the past 20 years declares the american bankers association hog tying the banking system with regulatory red tape means two things more expensive bank credit and less of it american bankers association cutting the red tape let banks get back to business november 1992 just as higher taxes restricted job creation by holding back entrepreneurs so too has the credit crunch without easy access to credit american firms are forced to postpone plans for job expansion a 1993 survey of small and mid size businesses by the arthur anderson enterprise group revealed that 38 percent of all businesses surveyed were unable to fulfill their capital needs perhaps more important 58 percent of businesses that were in their first three years of operation have been unable to fulfill their capital needs the same survey noted that due to the lack of capital 39 percent of the surveyed businesses were unable to expand operations and almost 20 percent of them reduced employment arthur anderson enterprise group survey of small and mid sized businesses trends for 1993 june 1993 p 11 limited access to capital has also made it more difficult for firms to purchase their own equipment forcing an increasing number of small businesses to lease equipment often at very high interest rates michael selz many small businesses are sold on leasing equipment the wall street journal october 27 1993 p b2 in response to this problem the clinton administration has called for new banking regulations governing how loans are made the administration hopes to boost the number of loans made through the small business administration to make sba more responsive to those industries with the potential for creating a higher number of jobs those involved in international trade and those producing critical technologies the national performance review creating a government that works better costs less september 7 1993 p 148 but this is unlikely to be a solution to the underlying problem of restricted credit growth the sba loan program accounts for only a small percent of capital for new firms and in any case tends to funnel dollars to favored businesses rather than the best investments clinton s new plan to reform banking regulation through agency consolidation will not help either monopolizing regulatory power in the hands of one agency will make it easier for heavy handed and manipulative policies to be implemented thereby raising the regulatory burdens faced by banks lawrence lindsey a member of the board of governors of the federal reserve system says monopoly regulation is a bad idea will greatly harm both the banking industry and the economy and lead to an unfortunate politicization of bank regulatory policy lawrence lindsey how to corrupt banking forbes january 31 1994 p 100 principle 4 increasing the regulatory burden and mandating numerous employee benefits is a recipe for job destruction the number of regulations and mandated benefit requirements that employers are forced to comply with has grown steadily in recent years estimates of the total cost that regulations impose on the economy

jobs would have existed without the regulations laffer and bord op cit p 6 regulation and mandated benefits take their toll indirectly when the government increases this burden on the private sector by promulgating new rules firms must adjust their behavior accordingly this adjustment process may require an increase in worker training paperwork requirements or even retooling regardless of the adjustment method costs will be incurred the costs of adjustment directly affect the firm s profits since a greater than expected amount of earnings will be exhausted in compliance measures in addition there may be extra costs associated with hiring new workers as a result firms will try to pass the costs of adjustment on to their consumers or if that is not possible due to competitive market conditions scale back future production investment or new hiring if the new compliance and adjustment costs are sufficiently high firms may scale back existing production and lay off workers

clean air act amendments of 1990 the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and the civil rights act of 1991 and the increases in the minimum wage in 1990 and 1991 the burdens on employers have ballooned the dramatic rise in the minimum wage alone from 3 35 in 1989 to 3 80 in 1990 and 4 25 in 1991 helped push teenage unemployment to the highest rate in a decade if the clinton administration proceeds with plans for a 50 cent hike in the minimum wage and the labor market adjusts as it has in the past there is likely to be an increase in the teenage unemployment rate of between 0 5 percent and 3 percent another burdensome employer mandate will be the employer trip reduction requirement of the clean air act starting this year this will require employers in nine metropolitan areas to reduce the number of employees driving to work although no employment loss estimates are available over 12 million employees will be covered by the act making it difficult to believe that some jobs

discourages job creation because many employers will not be able to absorb the high costs and lost output resulting from mandatory worker leave the policy will have the unintended consequence of encouraging struggling businesses not to hire individuals who might take advantage of the leave policy the sba has found the overall costs of this act to total as much as 1 2 billion eileen trzcinski and william t alpert leave policies in small business findings from the u s small business administration employee leave survey small business administration office of advocacy research summary number 99 march 1991 other employer mandates that currently burden the labor market include the health care requirements found in the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 cobra the prevailing wage requirements of the davis bacon act and workers and unemployment compensation payments these factors create added disincentives to job expansion since taking on an additional worker means steadily higher employer payroll burdens employment thresholds in recent years many legislators have come to realize that added regulation and mandates have a destructive effect on job growth particularly in the small business sector but instead of attempting to craft more sensible policies or deregulate where possible they tend to respond to small business concerns by adopting employment thresholds employment thresholds exempt smaller sized businesses from certain regulations for example the americans with disabilities act currently exempts all firms with fewer than 25 employees from the regulation this will be lowered to cover firms with fewer than 15 employees after july 26 1994 other examples include the family and medical leave act which exempts business with fewer than 50 employees and the plant closing law which exempts businesses below 100 employees these thresholds have the unfortunate side effect of discouraging employers near the threshold from hiring new employees pointing to the family and medical leave act ruth stafford president of the kiva container corporation says fifty is the magic number jeanne saddler small firms try to curb impact of leave law the wall street journal august 5 1993 p b1 her firm like many others plans to hold employment stable just under the 50 employee barrier using more temporary or part time workers this phenomenon is already being seen according to the bureau of labor statistics temporary employment grew by 20 percent in 1993 up from 6 percent in 1990 principle 5 sustained job growth results from competitive efficient industries that are free of excessive government interference steering america onto a path of greater job creation low unemployment and a higher standard of living will require a shift of current american economic policy the three primary governmental barriers to job expansion high taxes limited credit through irrational financial regulations and excessive regulations and added mandated benefits all must be corrected adopting the european system would be a mistake america should instead learn from history that where goods services labor and wages have been allowed to move or fluctuate freely prosperity entrepreneurship and high employment have been the result to put america back on the high employment high wage track president clinton should take several specific and immediate steps to ensure american industries remain strong and competitive step 1 lower tax rates on businesses and capital the effects of high tax rates on employers and capital are direct and damaging lowering both corporate tax rates and the capital gains tax rate while indexing it for inflation would provide an immediate and strong job stimulus by reducing the cost of hiring workers and unlocking the capital needed for business expansion step 2 reject all attempts to establish a european style employment policy especially expensive job training programs high wages sustained employment and increased business activity should be guiding goals of public policy mandating them should not costly and ineffective job training programs should be ruled out as job creating options americans need only look at the failure of european programs to understand why such an approach is a mistake such programs require massive amounts of public spending for the small number of jobs which are created step 3 cap federal spending this will aid job creation by increasing the amount of private savings available for business investment step 4 enact comprehensive regulatory reform the hidden tax of regulation and increased mandated benefits directly increase the cost of employing workers the president and congress should establish a federal regulatory budget and estimate the employment impact of regulations before they take effect the regulatory budget would place a limit on the total cost that is imposed on the economy each year by new federal regulations when the budget had been passed no new regulations could be imposed unless other rules were withdrawn step 5 adopt rational health care reform based upon consumer choice and not new employer mandates no new policy action threatens to do as much damage to the labor market in the immediate future as does employer based health care mandates while reform is needed it should not simply push the cost of comprehensive health coverage onto employers through expensive new payroll taxes accomplishing reform in this manner will result in the loss of millions of jobs see daniel j mitchell the economic and budget impact of the clinton health plan heritage foundation backgrounder no 974 january 13 1994 step 6 reform america s archaic financial and banking laws financial restrictions such as the mcfadden act of 1927 the bank holding act of 1956 and the glass steagall act of 1933 retard bank stability and expansion and therefore limit the credit opportunities they can offer to businesses eliminating these impediments to financial efficiency would allow businesses to take advantage of expansionary opportunities by borrowing needed capital step 7 overhaul antiquated antitrust laws america s outdated antitrust laws such as the sherman antitrust act of 1890 and the clayton antitrust act of 1914 make it difficult for firms to enter into joint production alliances that could raise industrial efficiency and create new job opportunities step 8 pass product liability reform and other tort reform legislation currently america s tort system saps private sector entrepreneurialism hinders product innovation and threatens the continuation of numerous businesses without reforms limiting punitive damages and streamlining costly court procedures an increasing number of jobs will be placed at risk step 9 continue to push for trade liberalization globally while eliminating domestic barriers to free trade while the job gains will result from the wise actions already taken of passing the north american free trade agreement nafta and general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt agreements further efforts should be made to expand free trade agreements while lowering the domestic barriers to imports step 10 encourage the use of privatization and contracting out whenever possible privatization and contracting out not only insure that services are delivered more efficiently for less money they also allow private firms to raise capital and re invest in more productive long term private sector jobs vice president gore s national performance review failed to tap such methods of real government reform see scott a hodge and adam d thierer the national performance review falling short of real government reform heritage foundation backgrounder no 962 october 7 1993 undertaking such measures would encourage increased private sector employment while demonstrating that the administration is serious about changing the way washington works conclusion the jobs summit affords president clinton the opportunity to outline the fundamental principles of job creation to the industrial nations of the world unfortunately many nations specifically in europe and more recently the united states have forgotten that low taxes easy access to credit rational regulations and vigorous exposure to competition are the foundation for a healthy job creating economy the most important lesson that president clinton can bring back from detroit is that government policies that increase the cost of hiring people mean that fewer people will be hired 1995 persimmon it inc

jeremy hunt said that liz truss s mini budget went too far too fast as the new chancellor effectively signalled the demise of the prime minister s economic vision political and economic circles spent saturday sizing up mr hunt after he used a series of broadcast interviews in the morning to suggest ms truss s immediate economic plan is now largely defunct with all eyes on whether he can restore the uk s financial credibility mr hunt suggested tax rises could form part of a painful fiscal package designed to restore market confidence in the uk the chancellor in a statement on saturday evening said that his vision would be growth underpinned by stability promising clear and robust plans he said we have to be honest with people and we are going to have to take some very difficult decisions both on spending and on tax to get debt falling but at the top of our minds when making these decisions will be how to protect and help struggling families businesses and people earlier governor of the bank of england andrew bailey said he spoke to mr hunt on friday after his appointment speaking in washington he said the pair had a meeting of minds on the issue of fiscal sustainability as he noted the fact the office of budget responsibility is now very much back in the picture but that came alongside a warning that inflationary pressures could lead to another hike in interest rates by bank officials in the near future mr hunt a former foreign secretary was parachuted into number 11 to replace kwasi kwarteng in a bid to restore order to ms truss s ailing administration he spent his first full day in office warning of difficult decisions to come as he suggested taxes could rise and budgets including health and defence are likely to be squeezed further in the coming months image pa on friday after three weeks of turmoil on the financial markets in the wake of mr kwarteng s 43 billion mini budget tax giveaway ms truss sacked him and ditched her commitment to drop a planned rise in corporation tax from 19 to 25 writing in the sun newspaper ms truss admitted it had been a wrench to see my friend kwasi kwarteng leave the government mr hunt twice a tory leadership contender wasted no time in criticising the mini budget but endorsed the fundamentals of the push for growth he told sky news it was a mistake when we re going to be asking for difficult decisions across the board on tax and spending to cut the rate of tax paid by the very wealthiest it was a mistake to fly blind and to do these forecasts without giving people the confidence of the office of budget responsibility saying that the sums add up allies of mr hunt had likened his new role to that of the chief executive in government and on saturday mr hunt acknowledged that the prime minister has effectively handed control of public finances to him but he played down talk of him being a newly powerful figure in government stressing he and ms truss are a team he will meet her at chequers on sunday after holding talks with treasury officials on saturday mr hunt s comments were immediately taken as a sign that cuts to public spending and tax rises could soon be coming as he confirmed the medium term fiscal plan on october 31 will effectively be a proper budget spending will not rise by as much as people would like and all government departments are going to have to find more efficiencies than they were planning to he said and some taxes will not be cut as quickly as people want some taxes will go up so it s going to be difficult appearing to rule out an early election mr hunt also repeatedly insisted that voters now want stability and in 18 months will be able to judge ms truss at the ballot box but his comments may only add to the sense among some tory mps that ms truss is increasingly powerless in downing street with her party split about its next steps at a brief news conference in downing street on friday the prime minister dismissed calls for her resignation saying she is absolutely determined to see through what i have promised but it comes amid multiple reports of tory mps and conservative grandees plotting moves to force her from office even as cabinet ministers remained publicly loyal to the prime minister image daniel leal wpa pool getty images to many observers it appears the end could be nigh for the prime minister after only a few weeks in the job sir geoffrey clifton brown told lbc on saturday it all hinges on how the markets receive the fiscal plan at the end of the month while he said he believes mr hunt can steady the ship he warned that if it doesn t manage to satisfy the markets and satisfy everybody else and the economy is still in chaos then i think we would be in a very difficult situation elsewhere there was speculation that including the ministry of defence in any round of spending cuts could spark a clash with defence secretary ben wallace a defence source said mr wallace will hold ms truss to the pledges made ms truss promised to increase defence spending to 3 of gdp by 2030 in the wake of the war in ukraine the promise of a new direction yet again also appeared to cause unrest among the party s free marketeers thatcherite tory mp john redwood offered an early warning to the new chancellor tweeting you cannot tax your way to higher growth if you tax too much you end up borrowing more as you have a worse slowdown labour leader sir keir starmer reached into his own party s factional disputes of yesteryear in a swipe at the grotesque chaos of the truss government in a speech in barnsley he referenced former party leader neil kinnock s famous 1985 attack on the left wing militant group in liverpool as he pointed to the grotesque chaos of a tory prime minister handing out redundancy notices to her own chancellor accusing ms truss of clinging on to power sir keir said there are no historical precedents for what they have done to our economy he also called for the fiscal statement to be brought forward telling the pa news agency the crisis we re facing at the moment is a crisis made in downing street and the damage has already been done and is very very hard to reverse you can

it can t get much gloomier surely not in the last few days we ve seen financial markets become nervous again as a result of the bank of england stating it will stop propping up bond prices even higher mortgage rates it seems are on the way as is a weaker pound and of course musical chairs at the top of government fears remain about the financial stability of some of the country s big pension schemes run on behalf of employees and retirees in the private sector heavily invested in bonds and we ve started to see what always happens when financial markets go into crisis mode big property funds invested in office buildings and industrial units shutting their doors because they don t have sufficient cash to pay investors who want out we could be heading back to the financial crash days of 2008 the jittery period just after the brexit vote of 2016 and lockdown in 2020 gloomy although the uk stock market has not crashed like it did in early 2020 a stiff correction cannot be ruled out in the coming weeks although the uk stock market has not crashed like it did in early 2020 a stiff correction cannot be ruled out in the coming weeks especially if liz truss and new chancellor jeremy hunt fail to convince the city that their policies for the economy low taxes high growth are built on prudent fiscal management the scrapping of the cut in corporation tax was confirmed on friday but hunt may need to do more to appease markets for households tough times are ahead that s for sure with recession possibly on the doorstep bills soaring ever higher and the threat of a sharp correction in house prices for long term investors those saving towards retirement through isas and pensions the outlook is at best uncertain future stock market corrections cannot be ruled out although uk equity prices have held up remarkably well this year against a welter of bad news for example the ftse all share is down 9 per cent compared to a 22 per cent drop in the value of the s p500 in the united states in sterling terms that is 7 per cent in recent days a number of financial organisations have tried to calm the nerves of investors for example the investor focused association of investment companies has produced research highlighting that while economic recessions are never good for equities any losses suffered short term are soon recovered within 11 months in the case of the covid induced recession of 2020 our data says aic director annabel brodie smith shows that investing isn t necessarily something to be feared as long as you have time on your side it s a point also made by chris rossbach managing partner of investment manager j stern co he runs the world stars global equity fund which invests in a concentrated portfolio of leading global companies with enduring competitive advantages the likes of amazon alphabet and drinks giant diageo although the fund has taken a battering this year its price fell to the end of last month by more than 15 per cent the long term performance numbers still look good over the past three and five years it has delivered investors positive returns of 20 and 57 per cent rossbach and his team have done some serious number crunching to look at how long it takes investors to make good serious short term market losses using a model called the return triangle created by german thinktank deutsches aktieninstitut it has studied the returns generated by the s p500 index over the period 2000 to the end of last year assuming an investor bought into the index on the first day of each calendar year it then calculates the annual compound return they would have received if they had sold at the end of the year and then every year end thereafter the returns in us dollar terms include dividends but not investment costs the results are reassuring emphasising that when an investor puts money into the market in a bad year patience pays any short term losses may take a while to be recouped but someone investing for the long term will eventually come up trumps take for example an investor who put money into the s p500 index at the beginning of 2000 just ahead of the dotcom market bubble bursting someone who sold out at the end of 2000 would have incurred an annual loss of 9 1 per cent if they had held on until the end of 2003 they would still have been in the red but their annual losses would have been down to 5 3 per cent by the end of 2006 they would have been in positive territory albeit a meagre annual return of 1 1 per cent if they had held on until the end of last year they would have walked away with an annual return of 7 5 per cent rossbach says the return triangle confirms the power of positive stock market periods for investors following years when losses have been recorded even if investors face headwinds he says even if they suffer a couple of years of poor stock market performance the chances are that they will make positive returns if they hold for at least five years fascinated by rossbach s work i asked him a few days ago to construct similar return triangles for the msci world index and ftse all share index with returns expressed in pounds the results are broadly similar namely that provided you invest for the long term ten years or more there is every likelihood that you are going to generate annual returns that beat any other financial asset taking the msci world index an investor who put money into the index at the beginning of 2000 would not have been generating positive annual returns until the end of 2009 but if they had held on until the end of last month they would have obtained annual returns averaging an attractive 6 5 per cent the equivalent annual return from the ftse all share index would have been less at 4 2 per cent but still big enough to make investing profitable in sterling terms the s p500 would have delivered 7 7 per cent in an inflationary environment equities are the only large liquid and accessible asset class which can generate significant returns says rossbach patience is rewarded time after time when it comes to investing it s a very wise message we may need to remind ourselves of in the coming weeks

jeremy hunt said that liz truss s mini budget went too far too fast as the new chancellor effectively signalled the demise of the prime minister s economic vision political and economic circles spent saturday sizing up mr hunt after he used a series of broadcast interviews in the morning to suggest ms truss s immediate economic plan is now largely defunct with all eyes on whether he can restore the uk s financial credibility mr hunt suggested tax rises could form part of a painful fiscal package designed to restore market confidence in the uk the chancellor in a statement on saturday evening said that his vision would be growth underpinned by stability promising clear and robust plans he said we have to be honest with people and we are going to have to take some very difficult decisions both on spending and on tax to get debt falling but at the top of our minds when making these decisions will be how to protect and help struggling families businesses and people earlier governor of the bank of england andrew bailey said he spoke to mr hunt on friday after his appointment speaking in washington he said the pair had a meeting of minds on the issue of fiscal sustainability as he noted the fact the office of budget responsibility is now very much back in the picture but that came alongside a warning that inflationary pressures could lead to another hike in interest rates by bank officials in the near future mr hunt a former foreign secretary was parachuted into number 11 to replace kwasi kwarteng in a bid to restore order to ms truss s ailing administration he spent his first full day in office warning of difficult decisions to come as he suggested taxes could rise and budgets including health and defence are likely to be squeezed further in the coming months image pa on friday after three weeks of turmoil on the financial markets in the wake of mr kwarteng s 43 billion mini budget tax giveaway ms truss sacked him and ditched her commitment to drop a planned rise in corporation tax from 19 to 25 writing in the sun newspaper ms truss admitted it had been a wrench to see my friend kwasi kwarteng leave the government mr hunt twice a tory leadership contender wasted no time in criticising the mini budget but endorsed the fundamentals of the push for growth he told sky news it was a mistake when we re going to be asking for difficult decisions across the board on tax and spending to cut the rate of tax paid by the very wealthiest it was a mistake to fly blind and to do these forecasts without giving people the confidence of the office of budget responsibility saying that the sums add up allies of mr hunt had likened his new role to that of the chief executive in government and on saturday mr hunt acknowledged that the prime minister has effectively handed control of public finances to him but he played down talk of him being a newly powerful figure in government stressing he and ms truss are a team he will meet her at chequers on sunday after holding talks with treasury officials on saturday mr hunt s comments were immediately taken as a sign that cuts to public spending and tax rises could soon be coming as he confirmed the medium term fiscal plan on october 31 will effectively be a proper budget spending will not rise by as much as people would like and all government departments are going to have to find more efficiencies than they were planning to he said and some taxes will not be cut as quickly as people want some taxes will go up so it s going to be difficult appearing to rule out an early election mr hunt also repeatedly insisted that voters now want stability and in 18 months will be able to judge ms truss at the ballot box but his comments may only add to the sense among some tory mps that ms truss is increasingly powerless in downing street with her party split about its next steps at a brief news conference in downing street on friday the prime minister dismissed calls for her resignation saying she is absolutely determined to see through what i have promised but it comes amid multiple reports of tory mps and conservative grandees plotting moves to force her from office even as cabinet ministers remained publicly loyal to the prime minister image daniel leal wpa pool getty images to many observers it appears the end could be nigh for the prime minister after only a few weeks in the job sir geoffrey clifton brown told lbc on saturday it all hinges on how the markets receive the fiscal plan at the end of the month while he said he believes mr hunt can steady the ship he warned that if it doesn t manage to satisfy the markets and satisfy everybody else and the economy is still in chaos then i think we would be in a very difficult situation elsewhere there was speculation that including the ministry of defence in any round of spending cuts could spark a clash with defence secretary ben wallace a defence source said mr wallace will hold ms truss to the pledges made ms truss promised to increase defence spending to 3 of gdp by 2030 in the wake of the war in ukraine the promise of a new direction yet again also appeared to cause unrest among the party s free marketeers thatcherite tory mp john redwood offered an early warning to the new chancellor tweeting you cannot tax your way to higher growth if you tax too much you end up borrowing more as you have a worse slowdown labour leader sir keir starmer reached into his own party s factional disputes of yesteryear in a swipe at the grotesque chaos of the truss government in a speech in barnsley he referenced former party leader neil kinnock s famous 1985 attack on the left wing militant group in liverpool as he pointed to the grotesque chaos of a tory prime minister handing out redundancy notices to her own chancellor accusing ms truss of clinging on to power sir keir said there are no historical precedents for what they have done to our economy he also called for the fiscal statement to be brought forward telling the pa news agency the crisis we re facing at the moment is a crisis made in downing street and the damage has already been done and is very very hard to reverse you can

joe biden also appeared to join in the criticism of ms truss s plan telling reporters i wasn t the only one that thought it was a mistake and calling the outcome predictable asked about her original economic strategy he added that while he disagreed with her plan it was up to the british people prime minister liz truss is clinging on to power after a disastrous few days daniel leal pa mr biden also dismissed concerns about the strength of the dollar the problem is the lack of economic growth and sound policy in other countries questions still hang over the government about whether it would be able to win enough support from a divided party for a series of painful decisions on tax and spending that have already prompted memories of the austerity era under david cameron and george osborne in a media blitz over the weekend both mr hunt and ms truss tried to win over their own party and voters to the new downing street regime after completing several interviews on saturday the new chancellor will later appear on bbc one s sunday with laura kuenssberg ms truss who used a piece in the sun newspaper to admit that sacking her friend and ideological soulmate mr kwarteng had been a wrench said we cannot pave the way to a low tax high growth economy without maintaining the confidence of the markets in our commitment to sound money mr hunt writing in the telegraph said that the government was changing course so far his appointment has failed to dampen speculation of an imminent coup against ms truss rishi sunak the defeated leadership contender and former chancellor as well as defence secretary ben wallace have been among the names flagged as potential replacements sir geoffrey clifton brown told lbc on saturday that for ms truss it all hinges on how the markets receive the fiscal plan at the end of the month jeremy hunt will meet with liz truss in chequers on sunday aaron chown pa while he said he believes mr hunt could steady the ship he warned that if it doesn t manage to satisfy the markets and satisfy everybody else and the economy is still in chaos then i think we would be in a very difficult situation elsewhere there was speculation that including the ministry of defence in any round of spending cuts could spark a clash with mr wallace a defence source said he will hold ms truss to the pledges made ms truss promised to increase defence spending to 3 of gdp by 2030 in the wake of the war in ukraine the prime minister nonetheless still has her defenders within the party former culture minister nadine dorries a loyal follower of boris johnson wrote in the daily express the sad truth is that those scheming to eject the prime minister from downing street are the same plotters who conspired to get rid of boris they will not rest until they have anointed their own chosen leader in power the labour party looking on as it enjoys a mammoth lead in the polls said that there were no historical precedents for the crisis the truss administration had plunged the country into in a speech in barnsley sir keir starmer referenced former party leader neil kinnock s famous 1985 attack on the left wing militant group in liverpool as he pointed to the grotesque chaos of a tory prime minister handing out redundancy notices to her own chancellor
