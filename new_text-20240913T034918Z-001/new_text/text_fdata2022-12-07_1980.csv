the most important objective for investors is to review portfolios and bring them in line with long term strategic allocation recommendations minneapolis dec 6 2022 prnewswire a u s recession may arrive mid 2023 based on historical economic markers and waning consumer financial power rbc wealth management suggests in its global insight 2023 outlook released tuesday an inverted yield curve on u s treasuries coupled with the arrival of tight money and inflation rates that have pushed real incomes below where they were a year ago are further indications a recession and accompanying global equity bear market may be on the horizon the most important objective for investors is to review portfolios and bring them in line with long term strategic allocation recommendations history has shown that the market rebounds well before a recession ends usually about three to five months before recessions are painful but they are relatively short in the context of long term investment horizons said kelly bogdanova vice president and portfolio analyst at rbc wealth management u s the economy and already successful businesses should adapt as they have in the past and it s wise for investors to keep that in mind when making big portfolio decisions u s equity market advance could have legs into 2023 even if the economy goes in to recession next year with history as a guide the equity market would likely begin a new bull market cycle before the recession ends according to the report moderating inflation data negative investor sentiment around october lows and the fact the s p 500 has almost always delivered strong positive returns for months following the u s midterm elections could mean a rally in equity prices over the next few weeks or months investors could see the equity market continue to rally into 2023 then give way to another period of falling share prices and subsequently tick back up later in the year despite the lingering and anticipated economic challenges the equity market has already absorbed significant blows including one of the fed s fastest and biggest tightening cycles in history bogdanova said it would also be rare for the s p 500 to deliver back to back negative return years and the corporate earnings outlook isn t as bad as in previous periods of economic stress going into 2023 investors should consider leaning more heavily toward quality and sustainable dividends and away from individual company risks small cap and midcap segments are attractive due to their valuation discounts and because they are likely to benefit as economic green shoots start to emerge according to the report within the large cap s p 500 the analysts continue to favor the energy sector next year tight energy commodity supplies will linger supporting prices and earnings to a greater degree than in typical periods of economic weakness u s fixed income focus on financial stability the federal reserve spent the past two years focused on boosting employment rates in the labor market and stabilizing pricing in the economy its next act will be to zero in on financial stability in 2023 the historically aggressive tightening campaign will likely necessitate a far more cautious approach from policymakers and a heightened focus on domestic and global financial vulnerabilities that may come as a result of higher interest rates particularly from the strength of the dollar this could mean the fed soon places the blunt tool of rate hikes back in the toolbox and employs more surgical macroprudential measures that help to ensure the soundness of and liquidity within the financial system said tom garretson fixed income senior portfolio strategist at rbc wealth management u s interest rates may peak in early 2023 on the heels of an anticipated 50 basis point hike at the federal reserve s december meeting this could mark the last of sharp hikes and rates could even drop modestly over the back half of 2023 in an attempt to mitigate the anticipated mid year economic slowdown yields across the fixed income landscape are expected to fall in 2023 the benchmark 10 year treasury yield could fall below 3 5 by the end of the year from levels close to 4 0 currently based on rbc capital markets forecast the window for fixed income investors to put money to work is open but it could close sooner than expected if yields continue to fade over the course of 2023 that could introduce heightened reinvestment risk for short maturity securities analysts continue to favor a strategy of locking in historically high yields in intermediate and longer dated bonds

meta employees were told that they should not discuss sensitive issues like abortion gun control pending legislation and vaccine efficacy at work fortune reported on these changes citing a leaked internal memo from lori goler head of people at meta techcrunch confirmed the report with a meta spokesperson as mark mentioned recently we need to make a number of cultural shifts to help us deliver against our priorities goler wrote in a company memo per fortune s report we re doing this to ensure that internal discussions remain respectful productive and allow us to focus this comes with the trade off that we ll no longer allow for every type of expression at work but we think this is the right thing to do for the long term health of our internal community meta took a similar stance in june when a draft supreme court opinion that would overturn roe v wade was leaked according to a document that the new york times obtained at the time meta said that discussing abortion openly at work has a heightened risk of creating a hostile work environment we deeply value expression open discussion and a company culture built on respect and inclusivity said kadia koroma a meta spokesperson in an email to techcrunch we ve updated our employee expectations to provide direction around what is appropriate for our people in the workplace so that we can reduce distractions while maintaining an environment that is respectful and inclusive and where people can do their best work meta employees who are required to discuss these topics to do their jobs are exempt from the policies these guidelines don t extend outside of the workplace as a company meta is in a period of financial tumult as its metaverse investments fail to pay off at the beginning of the year meta stock traded at around 330 a share now it s dropped by about 50 to 115 per share over the summer ceo mark zuckerberg told employees in an all hands call that he would ramp up expectations and set more aggressive goals realistically there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn t be here he told his team then last month meta cut 11 000 jobs amounting to 13 of its workforce these new mandates to avoid discussion about sensitive issues fall in line with zuckerberg s desire to increase intensity at work the changes are positioned as a way to keep employees focused by minimizing disruption goler s note says per fortune goler also addressed the way that meta takes positions on public policy we are often asked to sign on to advocacy letters on topics that are important but not directly connected to our work this can distract us from focusing on issues that are not central to our mission goler wrote so going forward as a company we will only make public statements on issues that are core to our business meaning they are required in order to provide our service coinbase took a similar approach in 2020 as ceo brian armstrong posted a culture memo stating that discussions of political issues and social causes were not allowed if employees didn t like it they could take severance and leave the policy was controversial for many tech workers especially those from underrepresented backgrounds current events have a palpable impact on their day to day lives and that includes work even jack dorsey former twitter ceo and bitcoin evangelist spoke out against coinbase s anti activism policy writing that crypto is direct activism against an unverifiable and exclusionary financial system which negatively affects so much of our society dorsey said that armstrong s stance leaves people behind at meta a company operating social media platforms that billions of people use every day it s hard to imagine that these banned topics won t inevitably come up
isabel wilkerson is a pulitzer prize winning writer and recipient of the national humanities medal she is the author of the adult bestsellers the warmth of other suns and caste in the latter wilkerson investigates the underlying divisions based on race and class throughout history and the ways in which those systems of oppression are perpetuated today we asked wilkerson and her editor beverly horowitz senior v p and publisher of random house children s books delacorte press to discuss the process of adapting caste for young readers and how high school is a microcosm of social hierarchies beverly horowitz it s been illuminating to work on our edition of caste isabel and it hit me that in some ways young people teenagers especially totally understand the caste system just by sitting in the cafeteria there is a high school caste system that is noticeable the minute you walk into a school i do feel that every kid on earth from the playground to school to beyond gets it even though they wouldn t call it a caste system can you help readers understand as complicated as it is what caste is isabel wilkerson in a broad sense caste is a universal form of human division that could be applied to many societies to many institutions and to many circumstances in which human beings find themselves it is the idea of hierarchy and dividing people up and attaching value to people within that hierarchy it s a desire to control to rank to dominate by attaching value to some and devaluing others in that system society or structure the young adults reading this book are the inheritors of that which we are now living with it will be up to succeeding generations to have to deal with this and that is why it s so urgent that we look very closely at what i d call this old house that we ve inherited that we protect this old house that we fix the things that are wrong with it so that it can stand for many many generations beyond horowitz there are so many important issues to highlight the history of caste in india the system used by the nazis in the holocaust and so many others but let s look at the section where you talk about immigrants coming to the united states people who had not been living in environments where there were people of color and did not know that they should hate or feel above anyone but when they got here somehow or other they got that message why does the caste system keep happening wilkerson when you enter a new society you want desperately to succeed you want to learn what the customs and the rules and the protocols are what s necessary for you to fit in what s necessary for you to thrive in that society and you enter it and you realize oh there s a hierarchy here and i don t want to be at the bottom i may not be at the top because i just arrived but i certainly don t want be at the bottom and people begin to learn the rules of who s been assigned to the bottom teenagers can identify with the need to belong if you re going to a new school you have to learn who s in and who s out and who are the popular people and who are the outsiders or the people who are free spirits there are all kinds of people when you enter high school because we re human there may be some ranking in all of that i think we are all accustomed to having to figure out how to find a place to belong no one wants to be on the bottom people are working very hard to be on top and in order to be on top there needs to be people underneath you and if you re feeling insecure and unsettled you might build your entire sense of worth on the idea that you are superior or could be seen as superior to those who are perceived as being underneath you you could be deeply invested in maintaining that sense of superiority much of it growing out of insecurity this exists on an everyday level but when you magnify that to a societal level you can see the damage that can be done especially when you have groups of people who then are born to inherited presumed superiority or inherited presumed inferiority and you can see the ways that this can build over the course of generations and in our country even centuries horowitz i m going to shift so that we can discuss your writing style your work is nonfiction researched with so many layers of accurate notes and is also so poetic and moving the people you interview become characters on the page i believe teens will really be absorbed with these stories can you share an interview that stayed with you we are a divided country in part because we inherited these artificial divisions that have become so embedded in our society wilkerson i write narrative nonfiction where you re pulling all these remnants and scraps of story together and weaving them into something that you hope will be art one of the stories that stands out to me was of a teenage african american boy in 1940s florida he was an only child and the pride and joy of his family he had a job as a stock boy which in the jim crow south was seen as moving up quite a bit because he was surrounded by people working in fields or in citrus groves for him to get a job in a store was a big deal the boy had a teenage white girl as a coworker and he developed a crush on her he wanted to do so well at his job that he sent christmas cards to everyone at the store including the girl he had a crush on inside her card he signed something along the lines of i like you so very much and i could view you as a sweetheart when she received it and because she was aware of what i would call a caste system the rules protocols and customs of what is acceptable and what s not acceptable she showed the card to her father he gathered some men because this boy had broken one of the cardinal rules of the jim crow south and of the caste system that developed in our country the girl s father and the men first got the boy s father from his job remember in a caste system such as this the people who are in the dominant caste have the license to do whatever they wish to those who are in the subordinated caste then they went to get the boy and they took both of them to a high bluff above a river they told this boy to jump restraining the father from doing anything to protect his son the father had to watch his only child being forced to jump to his death because of a breach of caste that of not crossing lines from one caste to another in terms of romantic expression that young man could have been alive today he might have been in his 80s but he could have been alive there was no one held to account because in that formal caste system there were no consequences for that kind of murder horowitz there are still horrific injustices happening in the world injustices that teenagers can recognize what was one of your goals of adapting caste into an edition for young adults wilkerson one of the goals of this book is to show how we are all diminished when we live in a caste system we may not recognize it particularly if we are born to the group that has the luxury of not having to think about this on a daily basis people may not be aware of the ways in which we re all harmed by it those who are the targets have to live with it every day and have to be vigilant in a way that is actually damaging to their health but those who are in the dominant group also experience consequences as a result of divisions that can breed fear and a sense of disconnect with one s fellow citizens we are a divided country in part because we inherited these artificial divisions that have become so embedded in our society that we just take them for granted we think that this is the way things are and always have to be because this is what we ve inherited i hope both editions of the book bring a recognition of what we re all losing as a result of these divisions and how we can find a way to transcend and overcome them so that we can be a fair society for every single one of us horowitz i thank you isabel for letting us work with you to bring caste to young adults caste adapted for young adults by isabel wilkerson delacorte 18 99 nov isbn 978 0 593 42794 1

kyiv moscow a drone strike hit a third russian airfield on tuesday one day after ukraine was accused of targeting two military bases deep into russian territory the latest attack was confirmed by officials in the southern russian city of kursk around 100 kilometers from the ukrainian border the regional governor said the strike had ignited an oil storage tank but there were no casualties images released by russian media showed black smoke rising from the airfield in the early morning hours of tuesday two strikes on monday hit the engels air base which hosts russia s fleet of giant strategic bombers and in ryazan where russian authorities said three service personnel died russian president vladimir putin convened a meeting of his security council on tuesday to discuss issues related to internal security according to kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov moscow says the strikes were conducted using soviet era drones kyiv has not directly claimed responsibility for the strikes but has celebrated them the new york times citing a senior ukrainian official said the drones involved in monday s attacks were launched from ukrainian territory and at least one of the strikes was made with the help of special forces close to the base in response russia s defense ministry claimed to have struck ukraine s military command system on monday with a massive high precision strike if russia assesses the incidents were deliberate attacks it will probably consider them as some of the most strategically significant failures of force protection since its invasion of ukraine the uk defense ministry said on tuesday ukraine s military intelligence chief kyrylo budanov has also said that moscow s military stocks are coming to an end though he added that the country has enough high precision missiles to conduct several more big air strikes on ukraine before it runs out meanwhile ukrainian officials have warned that emergency blackouts will once again take place in several regions on tuesday following the latest trikes at least four people were killed on monday as russian rockets hit several cities president volodymyr zelensky said in many regions there will have to be emergency blackouts we will be doing everything to restore stability ukraine s energy minister german galushchenko said power generators and substations in kyiv vinnytsia and odesa in the south had suffered the worst damage about half the region surrounding the ukrainian capital will remain without electricity for the coming days according to the kyiv regional governor ukraine s air force command claims to have shot down more than 60 of over 70 missiles launched by russia on monday the strikes targeted once again ukraine s energy infrastructure threatening to leave the country in the dark on one of the coldest days of the year so far air defenses shot down most of the rockets and energy workers have already started to restore electricity zelensky said moscow denies targeting ukrainian civilians but said their suffering would not end unless kyiv yielded to russia s demands on tuesday zelensky visited sloviansk in ukraine s eastern donbas region on armed forces day to salute his country s military from the bottom of his heart we always start by remembering our fallen heroes all those who gave their lives to ukraine he said according to video on social media unlike putin zelensky has visited the frontline many times since russia invaded ukraine on feb 24 sloviansk is also located 45 kilometers from bakhmut where intense fighting has been raging for several weeks in another development russian defense minister sergei shoigu has accused kyiv of nuclear terrorism saying that ukraine was continuing to shell the zaporizhzhia power plant moscow and kyiv have repeatedly blamed each other for shelling near the plant which has raised concerns of a possible nuclear catastrophe on tuesday shoigu said that ukraine had fired 33 large caliber shells at the plant in the last two weeks he claimed that most were intercepted by russian air defenses but added that some still hit objects that affect the safe operation of the nuclear power plant the minister said that russian forces were taking all measures to ensure the safety of the power plant in the face of kyiv s alleged attacks which moscow sees as nuclear terrorism ukraine denies targeting the facility which has been under the control of russian forces since the beginning of the invasion local ukrainian officials have said that russia shelled towns overnight near the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant leaving more than 9 000 homes without running water kyiv has also accused moscow of using the plant as a de facto weapons depot the united nations international atomic energy agency is pushing to create a security zone around the plant but the idea has yet to be implemented russian deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov said on tuesday there were positive dynamics in discussions with the iaea on the idea according to the tass state news agency also russia and ukraine reported on tuesday they had exchanged 60 prisoners of war in the latest of a series of such swaps russia s defense ministry said the 60 freed russian soldiers would be flown to moscow to receive medical care and psychological support ukraine s presidential chief of staff andriy yermak also hailed the returning ukrainians as heroes and said they included dozens who had held out in the city of mariupol including the besieged azovstal steelworks until russia forced its surrender in may we continue to return the defenders of mariupol in today s list of 60 there are 34 of them including 14 from azovstal yermak said some are wounded and will receive all the necessary help in ukraine he added some of those released had been held on russian territory and others in olenivka a prisoner of war camp in the russian occupied donetsk region of ukraine yermak said the two sides have exchanged hundreds of prisoners in a series of swaps over the past several months neither russia nor ukraine have released official figures on how many prisoners of war they have taken since the invasion began exactly nine months ago ukraine s president zelensky said last week that russia had freed 1 319 prisoners since march latvia meanwhile has revoked the license of russia s most prominent independent television channel dozhd tv rain the latvian broadcasting regulator on monday accused tv rain of supporting russia s military in ukraine and of being a threat to national security and public order the decision followed the unscripted comments by a presenter saying they hoped the station s efforts would help provide russian troops with basic equipment and amenities the journalist has since been fired and tv rain apologized to its viewers but the remarks led latvia s state security service to launch an investigation tv rain was forced to broadcast from latvia and other countries abroad in july after being kicked out of moscow following russia s invasion of ukraine the station was then banned by the kremlin entirely for spreading so called fake news about russia s army or its entities abroad but the

rally into next year says morgan stanley s slimmon don t be surprised if economic data coming out over the next week kicks off a rally into the end of the year and potentially 2023 according to andrew slimmon morgan stanley investment management s senior portfolio manager the key period of data releases begins friday with the producer price index followed by november s consumer price index and another likely rate hike from the federal reserve next week the last time those were released they all led to rallies in the stock market because we had better inflation prints he said like many investors slimmon expects a downturn ahead given the inverted yield curve but does not anticipate the big earnings collapse or downturn many people are predicting in the first quarter this is in part due to the fact that many consumers have beefed up savings in recent years given the proximity of the most recent recession the message of this year is that the economy has proven far more resilient

year cio says this year has been a rough one for investors with significant fixed income holdings but the end result is that bonds may now be more attractive than at any point last decade steve foresti the chief investment officer for asset allocation and research at wilshire said there is now fuel in the tank for high quality bonds after federal reserve rate hikes drove yields higher potentially making fixed income a more important part of portfolios this is in stark contrast to the low rate environment that followed the financial crisis and then again at the start of the pandemic when the fed cut rates to near zero especially for investors who reduced allocations i think this is an opportunity to revisit that decision and maybe slide back down on the risk curve a bit foresti said foresti added that the expected return for core bond holdings has doubled over the course of this year given high rates now and wilshire s expectation that inflation will decline going forward

summary the fed appears on track to decelerate the pace of its rate hikes but far from a rate cutting pivot in our opinion the trend remains negative but is beginning to show signs of reversing to an uptrend the crowd is in extreme pessimism but not low enough by historical standards to warrant a significant stock rally in our view content continues below advertisement tactical rules restrain the rally our three tactical rules don t fight the fed don t fight the trend and beware of the crowd at extremes have been challenged in the second half of 2022 by bear market rallies the tactical rules have warranted caution for the past 6 months as the fed raised rates and started to shrink its balance sheet and the trend became more negative given a still hawkish fed the falling trend and a crowd not at pessimistic extremes our tactical rules continue to suggest caution don t fight the fed deceleration does not mean a rate cutting pivot since march the fed has attempted to tighten financial conditions to fight inflation through rate increases and balance sheet reduction in the form of quantitative tightening qt the fed chose to front load rate hikes to avoid a repeat of the late 1970s and early 1980s when inflation appeared to peak only to rear its head and climb higher over the last six meetings the fed raised the fed funds target range from 0 to 0 25 to 3 75 to 4 this rapid pace consisted of an initial increase of 0 25 followed by a 0 50 increase and then four consecutive 0 75 increases recent economic data has shown inflation may be cooling causing the fed to contemplate slowing the pace of rate increases we agree with chairman powell that the effect of monetary policy works with a considerable lag and the impact has not been felt on the economy yet for this reason the fed indicated that it will be more data dependent and its next rate decision will come in mid december a day after november s cpi data is released therefore if headline cpi comes in at or below expectations the fed appears on track to slow the pace of its rate hikes a 0 50 rate hike is still large by historical standards so the fed will remain at odds with investors currently the fed funds futures market is showing a 75 probability of 0 50 rate hike at its december 14th meeting the european central bank ecb and the bank of england boe have also responded to high inflation by raising interest rates the ecb has raised its main refinancing rate from 0 in july to 2 in just three meetings the boe on the other hand was the first major central bank to raise interest rates in december 2021 but at a slower pace moving from 0 10 to 3 00 while both central banks are lagging the fed s course of action they both remain resolute to defeat inflation thus we do not regard the global central banks as being on the investor s side as decelerating the pace of rate hikes is far from a rate cutting pivot don t fight the trend trends need to stay above 200 day moving average the s p 500 s trend is currently falling at an annualized rate of 14 trading just below 4100 the s p 500 recently broke above its 200 day moving average meeting the first criteria for breaking out of an 11 month downtrend see chart next page left the s p 500 must remain above the 200 day moving average for the trend to turn positive over the next three months while we see rising odds of this happening right now we recognize that the stock market will applaud any signs of the fed becoming less restrictive internationally the trend of the all country world index ex us acwx is currently falling at an annualized rate of 22 much like the s p acwx has recently broken above its 200 day moving average and it too must remain above it for the trend to turn positive over the next three months see chart next page right while acwx s trend is improving it still faces some headwinds including the economies of the uk and eurozone which continue to deal with inflation pressures rising energy prices and the fallout from the ukrainian and russian war for now we would classify both trends as negative which suggests below average returns over the next three months in our view a decisive breach above the red line 200dma would be an early indication that the trend is improving in our view for now we believe the trends are not investors friends source refinitiv datastream riverfront data daily as of

purposes only past performance is no guarantee of future results beware of the crowd at extremes crowd is not at the outer limits of extreme pessimism we regard crowd sentiment as the contrary indicator of the three tactical rules over the last year the crowd has experienced highs and lows as investors attempted to handicap and navigate the evolving monetary policy landscape the chart below shows a measure of investor sentiment calculated by ned davis research when the line is high it shows extreme optimism and when it is low extreme pessimism this is our preferred way to measure investor psychology generally we believe sentiment is a contrarian indicator meaning we look for opportunities to buy when there is extreme pessimism and vice versa currently the crowd is pessimistic which has historically been a contrarian bullish signal however by historical standards sentiment is not depressed enough to warrant a significant stock rally there could be a window of opportunity over the coming months to add stocks as worst case scenarios get discounted into stock prices in our view in the meantime we are proceeding with caution copyright 2022 ned davis research inc further

compelling yields and real assets exposure are two primary reasons why investors allocate to midstream while midstream has significantly outperformed broader markets the space has not become expensive nor is considered overbought valuations are still discounted making now an ideal time to consider adding or reinstating a position in a fund offering exposure to the energy infrastructure sector when we think about the midstream or energy infrastructure space we re really talking about those companies that perform the shipping and handling function of the energy value chain these are companies that are providing services for a fee stacey morris head of energy research at vettafi said on december 6 during midstream mlps can the tailwinds continue into 2023 other segments of the energy value chain include upstream which comprises oil and gas producers and oilfield service companies and downstream which are the businesses that operate closer to the end user including refineries petrochemical businesses and gas stations midstream is the segment that connects the supply from upstream with the demand that s downstream the bread and butter of the midstream space has generally been pipelines but these companies are also involved in storing hydrocarbons storing even things like renewable fuels and renewable fuels feedstocks morris said these companies are also involved in processing natural gas and natural gas liquids ngls the midstream segment primarily makes money through fee based contracts which range in length from one to 25 years e g pipelines tend to have longer contracts whereas storage facilities tend to have shorter contracts this makes midstream less sensitive to and dependent upon commodity prices we don t necessarily need to see wti oil go to 100 or 120 for this space to work because we ve seen plenty examples this year of crude prices deteriorating but energy stocks and midstream and mlps still doing very well morris said with this set fee schedule midstream companies are also able to provide guidance for the year ahead something that isn t possible in other segments of the energy value chain that are more sensitive to commodity prices midstream is in the position to have better visibility to what free cash flow will look like something that won t change much based on oil prices morris added another benefit of the fee based business model is that contracts typically have annual adjustments for inflation that makes sense when you re talking about contracts that are 10 years or more in length morris said a number of liquids pipelines also follow the ferc index so the ferc sets an index every five years currently it s based on the producer price index for finished goods minus 21 so pipelines that follow this index are able to increase their rates every july 1 based on this formula july 1 of this year the increase was about 8 7 given that we saw pretty high inflation this year it ll probably mean that we ll see a pretty nice adjustment or next year as well on july 1 2023 this has led midstream to generally outperform broader markets in high inflation years since 2000 with the one exception being in 2008 when midstream modestly underperformed while oil has long been a focus for midstream future growth opportunities favor natural gas and ngls these opportunities include new build pipelines and expansions williams for example is developing the louisiana energy gateway to gather haynesville gas and take it to the gulf coast morris said then there are several examples of new pipeline expansions or new build pipelines coming out of the permian to move natural gas to the coast so whether it s kinder morgan mplx epd a number of household midstream names are working on solving the problem of getting extra natural gas production out of the permian into in markets 60 2 of the alerian mlp infrastructure index amzi and 70 5 of the alerian midstream energy select index amei by weighting is focused on transporting and processing natural gas and ngls investors can gain exposure to the amzi and amei indexes with the alerian mlp etf amlp and the alerian energy infrastructure etf enfr respectively the inflation reduction act also offers a raft of opportunities for the midstream sector when people think about the inflation reduction act i don t think midstream is probably at the top of mind you probably think about solar and wind morris said but there are benefits in the act for midstream midstream has been focused on things around renewable fuels carbon capture hydrogen and they ve announced a lot of significant partnerships in these different areas morris cited examples including enterprise products partners partnering with chevron on carbon capture as well as nustar and kinder morgan working with neste on renewable fuels how investors can access the midstream space ss c alps has two strategies that offer investors exposure to the energy infrastructure space the alerian mlp etf amlp which offers exposure to mlps that operate in the energy infrastructure space and the alerian energy infrastructure etf enfr which provides exposure to the energy infrastructure space but broadens the universe to include both c corps and mlps amlp is primarily used for income offering the potential for tax deferred income between 80 85 of amlp s distributions historically have been considered a tax deferred return of capital enfr is ric compliant meaning it caps mlp exposure at 25 the other 75 of the portfolio is u s and canadian energy infrastructure corporations enfr and other ric compliant etfs tend to be more focused on total return as opposed to income the underlying indexes of both funds have not seen a dividend cut since july 2021 with a bias toward growth notably neither fund comes

when russia invaded ukraine in february of this year the international community slapped a raft of sanctions on the invading nation they froze the assets of wealthy and powerful russian citizens and restricted their ability to travel they restricted the sale of russian raw materials and energy and worked to prevent russia from getting its hands on various kinds of defense and information technologies and they imposed financial sanctions on russian banks and curtailed russia s access to foreign capital and financial markets many corporations followed up on these government imposed sanctions with so calledself sanctioning whereby companies restricted or halted commercial relations with russia and russian firms the effect on paper appeared to be a set of measures that struck at the heart of russia s economy forecasts in the spring of this year predicted a drop in gdp of at least 7 8 and possibly as much as11 for 2022 prices were expected to rise by20 25 foreign direct investment by corporations was forecast to fall as much as25 28 t over the year but russia has not been brought to its knees far from it forecasters say russian gdp for 2022 will likely fall but only about3 3 3 4 inflation meanwhile will likely end the year at roughly12 bad but not close to as painful as predicted and foreign direct investment estimates say it will fall by a mere 1 meanwhile the war in ukrainegrinds on strong points so what went wrong a report from bruegel a brussels based economic think tank points to a number of flaws in the sanctions regime and several strong points in the russian defenses the most effective defense has been mounted by the central bank of russia which designed and executed the fortress russia policy aimed at protecting the russian financial system the system did take a big hit early on as sanctions on russia s central bank assets were much stronger than expected reducing its bank reserves by 40 however thanks to competent management the system recovered and the bank continues to hold large amounts of foreign currency as much as 300 billion for potential intervention in the currency and debt markets and even though russian banks lost access to the swift financial transfer system they still seem able to get the cash they need to operate as various other channels continue to enable russian banks to interact with the outside world in other words despite some big shocks the central bank has kept russia s financial system intact and prevented a collapse of the wider russian economy many of the sanctions were aimed at inhibiting parts of the russian economy s ability to do business russia s economy is less reliant on imports than most other large advanced economies and emerging markets the report notes but some sectors are highly exposed especially the manufacturing of transportation equipment chemicals food products and it services sanctions did a good job initially of restricting russian access to key imports such as parts for manufacturing still despite the initial shock russia pivoted quickly and began importing more goods from nations like china belarus and turkey which are not participating in the sanctions regime in short when it comes to imports of key materials russia has been shut out of a number of markets but it has since found new markets to meet many of its needs sanctions on russian exports have been even less successful many countries have stopped buying certain goods from russia but the flow of key commodities continues largely unabated and roaring inflation has only helped russia in this area bruegel estimates that rather than falling russia s export income has risen by more than 40 to roughly 120 billion year to date because of higher prices and is likely to stay that high through the end of the year the largest contribution to this comes from natural gas which is still in high demand throughout europe and which unlike coal oil and other petroleum products has not been sanctioned this shrinkage in imports and swelling of exports means that russia s trade balance looks extremely healthy the surplus for january september stood at 198 4 billion roughly 120 billion higher than for the same period in 2021 and more than double the previous record in 2008 bruegel reckons the rude health of russia s balance of payments will persist into 2023 as commodity prices are likely to remain high despite the eu embargo on crude oil and petroleum products and despite russia s decision to cut natural gas flows to europe bruegel estimates a surplus of around 100 billion in 2023 a substantial drop compared to 2022 but not too shabby for a sanctioned state russia s currency appears to be in equally good shape when sanctions were first imposed the ruble dropped from about 70 75 to the dollar to close to 140 to the dollar by april however the exchange rate had returned to below pre invasion levels today the ruble fluctuates at about 60 rubles to the dollar we have reported extensively on the reasons why the ruble has bounced back so impressively well and you can read that reporting here but the tldr is that capital controls combined with falling trading volumes and the dynamics of the current account have all helped prop the ruble up under the skin reading all of this you could be forgiven for thinking that the coalition of nations sanctioning russia are on a fool s errand and that russia is simply too big to fail bruegel contends that this is not so that the sanctions are hurting russia and that rosy statistics are concealing some serious damage to the russian economy the ruble s strength is a fine example of this to the casual observer the ruble has recovered and is in good health in fact the ruble is critically weak it has been propped up by capital controls that make it difficult to sell rubles and which force russian companies to buy the currency against their will or better judgment as bruegel puts it the current exchange rate is not a reflection of the value of the russian economy s fundamentals rather it is a testament to the fact that financial sanctions are isolating the ruble internationally russia s pivot to new markets for key imports was speedy and effective but it will not be enough to rescue some important parts of russia s economy bruegel says the self sanctioning by corporations wishing to distance themselves from russia has been particularly damaging in sectors including auto production and transportation the withdrawal of foreign car manufacturers and the shortage of inputs has hit passenger car production extremely hard with a 95 decline in may 2022 compared to the previous year air transportation has also collapsed following the cancellation of aircraft leases and maintenance contracts and the closure of several countries airspaces to russian planes exports of oil and gas look like a strong point but they are threatened in the medium to long term bruegel says canada the united states and australia have banned all imports of russian oil while the united kingdom has announced a phase down to zero by the end of the year the european union which has been highly dependent on russian oil imports in the past agreed at the end of may to stop seaborne imports of russian oil by year end by the start of 2023 more than 90 of russia s previous oil exports to the eu will be banned it s true that russia has found new markets for its oil but it is selling that oil at a significant discount and it will likely have to continue to do so if the most lucrative markets remain closed to it bruegel notes that there is one way the sanctions regime could be expanded to significantly undermine russian oil exports via insurance more than 90 of the world s oil tankers are insured by the international group of p i clubs a london based association of insurers the eu and the uk recently introduced a ban on insurance for ships carrying russian oil from the start of next year which would have jacked up insurance costs for russia and had a meaningful impact on exports the u s however diluted this measure and took the sting out of its tail when it comes to natural gas no sanctions have been imposed on russia instead bruegel says russia has weaponized its gas supply blackmailing european countries by progressively cutting exports to europe now down to around 20 of their 2021 levels this will hurt russia in the long run because roughly 60 of russia s gas exports go to the eu and uk russia will need to close a sizable portion of its gas export infrastructure including production sites at significant cost export revenues from gas will dry up and attempts to diversify export routes by building new liquified natural gas export capacity will be hindered by a lack of access to western technology redevelopment will take years in other words the sanctions have teeth but for russia to feel the bite coalition nations will need to sink those teeth in deeper and hang on for the long term bruegel says they need to find unity on effective measures such as the oil insurance ban mentioned above and to restrict oil and gas shipments further the combination of a large and likely persistent fall in russian imports and the permanent decoupling of european economies from russian energy supplies will have significant negative consequences for the russian economy in the medium to long run the report says russia may find ways to mitigate some sanctions related effects but the overall loss in economic activity will likely be permanent in the short term however russia s economy has not been inhibited to the point where it is finding it impossible to prosecute the war in ukraine given the ultimate aim of sanctions is to stop that war the eu and other coalition nations as bruegel puts it

generation 5g wireless communications and optical cable offerings said last month it intends to merge with blank check firm chavant capital acquisition corp nasdaq clay a special purpose acquisition company commonly known as a spac that raised about 80 million in mid 2021 the reverse merger is expected to be completed in the first half of next year mobix said it will trade the nasdaq stock exchange though a ticker symbol hasn t been announced mobix said it expects to have a pro forma equity value of 295 million with its stock priced at 10 per share it s a quick move to the public markets for mobix which was founded in 2020 and came out of stealth mode just last year the company said in september it had raised approximately 31 million in financing it has announced a handful of acquisitions including this year s buy of another irvine firm involved in the area s vital semiconductor sector optical cable tech firm cosemi technologies inc the mobix labs strategy since its founding is to pursue a twin track growth approach of organic growth and acquisitions fundraising plans in addition to adding the 80 million that chavant capital already raised to its balance sheet mobix plans to complete an additional 30 million private placement at the time it goes public in addition to getting a 100 million equity line of credit mobix is also working on seeking other financing in conjunction with its spac partner it said proceeds from those funding deals will be used for ongoing chipset development to capitalize on the large and rapidly expanding global demand for

when russia invaded ukraine in february of this year the international community slapped a raft of sanctions on the invading nation they froze the assets of wealthy and powerful russian citizens and restricted their ability to travel they restricted the sale of russian raw materials and energy and worked to prevent russia from getting its hands on various kinds of defense and information technologies and they imposed financial sanctions on russian banks and curtailed russia s access to foreign capital and financial markets many corporations followed up on these government imposed

in short when it comes to imports of key materials russia has been shut out of a number of markets but it has since found new markets to meet many of its needs sanctions on russian exports have been even less successful many countries have stopped buying certain goods from russia but the flow of key commodities continues largely unabated and roaring inflation has only helped russia in this area bruegel estimates that rather than falling russia s export income has risen by more than 40 to roughly 120 billion year to date because of higher prices and is likely to stay that high through the end of the year the largest contribution to this comes from natural gas which is still in high demand throughout europe and which unlike coal oil and other petroleum products has not been sanctioned this shrinkage in imports and swelling of exports means that russia s trade balance looks extremely healthy the surplus for january september stood at 198 4 billion roughly 120 billion higher than for the same period in 2021 and more than double the previous record in 2008 bruegel reckons the rude health of russia s balance of payments will persist into 2023 as commodity prices are likely to remain high despite the eu embargo on crude oil and petroleum products and despite russia s decision to cut natural gas flows to europe bruegel estimates a surplus of around 100 billion in 2023 a substantial drop compared to 2022 but not too shabby for a sanctioned state russia s currency appears to be in equally good shape when sanctions were first imposed the ruble dropped from about 70 75 to the dollar to close to 140 to the dollar by april however the exchange rate had returned to below pre invasion levels today the ruble fluctuates at about 60 rubles to the dollar we have reported extensively on the reasons why the ruble has bounced back so impressively well and you can read that reporting here but the tldr is that capital controls combined with falling trading volumes and the dynamics of the current account have all helped prop the ruble up under the skin reading all of this you could be forgiven for thinking that the coalition of nations sanctioning russia are on a fool s errand and that russia is simply too big to fail bruegel contends that this is not so that the sanctions are hurting russia and that rosy statistics are concealing some serious damage to the russian economy the ruble s strength is a fine example of this to the casual observer the ruble has recovered and is in good health in fact the ruble is critically weak it has been propped up by capital controls that make it difficult to sell rubles and which force russian companies to buy the currency against their will or better judgment as bruegel puts it the current exchange rate is not a reflection of the value of the russian economy s fundamentals rather it is a testament to the fact that financial sanctions are isolating the ruble internationally russia s pivot to new markets for key imports was speedy and effective but it will not be enough to rescue some important parts of russia s economy bruegel says the self sanctioning by corporations wishing to distance themselves from russia has been particularly damaging in sectors including auto production and transportation the withdrawal of foreign car manufacturers and the shortage of inputs has hit passenger car production extremely hard with a 95 decline in may 2022 compared to the previous year air transportation has also collapsed following the cancellation of aircraft leases and maintenance contracts and the closure of several countries airspaces to russian planes exports of oil and gas look like a strong point but they are threatened in the medium to long term bruegel says canada the united states and australia have banned all imports of russian oil while the united kingdom has announced a phase down to zero by the end of the year the european union which has been highly dependent on russian oil imports in the past agreed at the end of may to stop seaborne imports of russian oil by year end by the start of 2023 more than 90 of russia s previous oil exports to the eu will be banned it s true that russia has found new markets for its oil but it is selling that oil at a significant discount and it will likely have to continue to do so if the most lucrative markets remain closed to it bruegel notes that there is one way the sanctions regime could be expanded to significantly undermine russian oil exports via insurance more than 90 of the world s oil tankers are insured by the international group of p i clubs a london based association of insurers the eu and the uk recently introduced a ban on insurance for ships carrying russian oil from the start of next year which would have jacked up insurance costs for russia and had a meaningful impact on exports the u s however diluted this measure and took the sting out of its tail when it comes to natural gas no sanctions have been imposed on russia instead bruegel says russia has weaponized its gas supply blackmailing european countries by progressively cutting exports to europe now down to around 20 of their 2021 levels this will hurt russia in the long run because roughly 60 of russia s gas exports go to the eu and uk russia will need to close a sizable portion of its gas export infrastructure including production sites at significant cost export revenues from gas will dry up and attempts to diversify export routes by building new liquified natural gas export capacity will be hindered by a lack of access to western technology redevelopment will take years in other words the sanctions have teeth but for russia to feel the bite coalition nations will need to sink those teeth in deeper and hang on for the long term bruegel says they need to find unity on effective measures such as the oil insurance ban mentioned above and to restrict oil and gas shipments further the combination of a large and likely persistent fall in russian imports and the permanent decoupling of european economies from russian energy supplies will have significant negative consequences for the russian economy in the medium to long run the report says russia may find ways to mitigate some sanctions related effects but the overall loss in economic activity will likely be permanent in the short term however russia s economy has not been inhibited to the point where it is finding it impossible to prosecute the war in ukraine given the ultimate aim of sanctions is to stop that war the eu and other coalition nations as bruegel puts it

the most important objective for investors is to review portfolios and bring them in line with long term strategic allocation recommendations minneapolis dec 6 2022 prnewswire a u s recession may arrive mid 2023 based on historical economic markers and waning consumer financial power rbc wealth management suggests in its global insight 2023 outlook released tuesday an inverted yield curve on u s treasuries coupled with the arrival of tight money and inflation rates that have pushed real incomes below where they were a year ago are further indications a recession and accompanying global equity bear market may be on the horizon the most important objective for investors is to review portfolios and bring them in line with long term strategic allocation recommendations history has shown that the market rebounds well before a recession ends usually about three to five months before recessions are painful but they are relatively short in the context of long term investment horizons said kelly bogdanova vice president and portfolio analyst at rbc wealth management u s the economy and already successful businesses should adapt as they have in the past and it s wise for investors to keep that in mind when making big portfolio decisions u s equity market advance could have legs into 2023 even if the economy goes in to recession next year with history as a guide the equity market would likely begin a new bull market cycle before the recession ends according to the report moderating inflation data negative investor sentiment around october lows and the fact the s p 500 has almost always delivered strong positive returns for months following the u s midterm elections could mean a rally in equity prices over the next few weeks or months investors could see the equity market continue to rally into 2023 then give way to another period of falling share prices and subsequently tick back up later in the year despite the lingering and anticipated economic challenges the equity market has already absorbed significant blows including one of the fed s fastest and biggest tightening cycles in history bogdanova said it would also be rare for the s p 500 to deliver back to back negative return years and the corporate earnings outlook isn t as bad as in previous periods of economic stress going into 2023 investors should consider leaning more heavily toward quality and sustainable dividends and away from individual company risks small cap and midcap segments are attractive due to their valuation discounts and because they are likely to benefit as economic green shoots start to emerge according to the report within the large cap s p 500 the analysts continue to favor the energy sector next year tight energy commodity supplies will linger supporting prices and earnings to a greater degree than in typical periods of economic weakness u s fixed income focus on financial stability the federal reserve spent the past two years focused on boosting employment rates in the labor market and stabilizing pricing in the economy its next act will be to zero in on financial stability in 2023 the historically aggressive tightening campaign will likely necessitate a far more cautious approach from policymakers and a heightened focus on domestic and global financial vulnerabilities that may come as a result of higher interest rates particularly from the strength of the dollar this could mean the fed soon places the blunt tool of rate hikes back in the toolbox and employs more surgical macroprudential measures that help to ensure the soundness of and liquidity within the financial system said tom garretson fixed income senior portfolio strategist at rbc wealth management u s interest rates may peak in early 2023 on the heels of an anticipated 50 basis point hike at the federal reserve s december meeting this could mark the last of sharp hikes and rates could even drop modestly over the back half of 2023 in an attempt to mitigate the anticipated mid year economic slowdown yields across the fixed income landscape are expected to fall in 2023 the benchmark 10 year treasury yield could fall below 3 5 by the end of the year from levels close to 4 0 currently based on rbc capital markets forecast the window for fixed income investors to put money to work is open but it could close sooner than expected if yields continue to fade over the course of 2023 that could introduce heightened reinvestment risk for short maturity securities analysts continue to favor a strategy of locking in historically high yields in intermediate and longer dated bonds

in his podcast addressing the markets today louis navellier offered the following commentary if you wish to listen to this commentary please click here confusing crude oil crude oil prices have softened but many energy stocks remain resilient one of the problems is that the spread between wti and brent sweet crude has widened typically when wti and brent crude oil spreads are wide the refiners can make more money but the inventory of gasoline and distillates e g diesel heating oil jet fuel etc has risen in recent weeks so refiners may have to discount their refined products get the full walter schloss series in pdf get the entire 10 part series on walter schloss in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q3 2022 hedge fund letters conferences and more ironically the inventory of crude oil has fallen dramatically in recent weeks according to the energy information administration so crude oil markets remain confusing to many investors but it appears that demand has dropped but long term supply problems persist officially russia is refusing to sell crude oil to companies that are complying with the g7 price cap poland lithuania and estonia argued for a less restrictive price cap since they actually rely on russian crude oil but were overridden by the g7 the g7 price cap also includes a ban on shipping insuring or financing russian crude oil in the meantime there is a traffic jam of 19 crude oil tankers off of turkey s coast this week some of these oil tankers are waiting for confirmation that their insurance remains in place since russian crude oil cannot be insured above the 60 price cap other oil tankers are apparently part of the shadow fleet of reportedly over 100 oil tankers getting ready to sell russian crude oil to countries that are not complying with the g7 price cap a big wildcard in the energy patch is when will the biden administration will stop draining the strategic petroleum reserve spr by up to 1 million per barrels per day supply of predominately light sweet crude oil that europe likes to refine the spr is now at 1980 levels and the crude oil releases will have to be stopped soon which is expected to send crude oil prices soaring in the upcoming weeks important onshoring the commerce department on tuesday reported that the u s trade deficit rose 5 4 in october to 78 2 billion as exported declined 0 7 to 256 6 billion and imports rose 0 6 to 334 6 billion this means that the shrinking trade deficit in the past several months from energy exports has abruptly ceased so economists are revising their fourth quarter gdp estimates lower the institute of supply management ism recently announced that its manufacturing index declined to 49 in november down from 50 2 in october since any ism reading over 50 signals an expansion the u s manufacturing sector is now contracting after 30 straight month gains so the onshoring of semiconductor manufacturing is important to boost u s manufacturing relief rally on dovish fed the 10 year treasury bond yield is near 3 5 so when the federal open market committee fomc raises its key interest rates 0 5 on december 14th the fed will be near parity or neutral if the fomc statement mentions dovish words like parity or neutral the stock market could stage a massive relief rally but the fomc never fights market rates so i remain in the camp that december will be the fed s last key interest rate hike coffee beans the united states is by far the world s biggest producer of oil having produced around 16 6 million barrels of oil on average per day in 2021 saudi arabia and russia follow head to head in second and third place having produced around 11 and 10 9 million barrels of oil per day respectively the top three countries produced more oil than the bottom 7 countries in the top 10 combined source statista see the full story here
once an operator completes set up on a flexographic press for example it can run for as long as it s needed the problems arise at changeover when that press needs to be set up for a new job vendors brought a range of dies and other tooling that aim to change the way converters look at changeover from lightweight tooling to sleeves that last longer than before these products are designed to shorten what can be a lengthy process technology bottcher systems showcased a wide range of its products from print rollers to press blankets and plates promoting its range of elastomer covered sleeves for lightweight design and easy changeover bottcher systems highlighted the latest in its conventional printing blanket line the bottchertop impressa converters can use the blanket on coated and uncoated stock which bottcher says makes it great for stochastic fm or xm screened separations the company also showcased bottchertop 4800 a printing blanket designed to perform using any energy curable ink systems according to the company it s resistant to swelling that may occur when using polar solvents found in uv inks and washes efficiency was the theme at the carey color booth looking to provide converters with maximum efficiencies the company promoted its itr elastomer sleeve which is said to last longer than polymer plates or sleeves by up to two to four times and can be set up within registration in minutes also at carey color s booth was the kodak flexcel nx system which according to the company can allow the pre press department to compete for business that has been traditionally beyond what flexo has been capable of because of the products image reproduction high densities and print contrast bringing versions of its slitting machines to the show dienes featured the shear slitting machines saying that it can minimize the amount of downtime converters face having to check the knives and change them the intelligent control systems can alert operators when a knife is ready to be replaced impact converting systems solutions highlighted its range of flexible dies which are said to be much easier to mount and get within registration according to the company it can be used across all cylinder types magnetic or not regardless of materials also featured at its booth was its multi level cutting device which is said to lower the number of tools required on a press lowering the cost producing less waste between stations reducing setup time and ultimately improving efficiencies the company also promoted its die cutting modules that are designed and machined in house kocher beck showcased three of its die styles chrome 24 gluex range 3l laser long life according to david morris president and ceo of kocher beck the chrome is developed for long runs due to the high performance with minimal wear specifically designed for thermal transfer and direct thermal products also at the company s booth was the gapmaster em unit which was released less than a year ago the unit is electronically controlled allowing for finer increments of adjustments and can also store jobs for a quicker changeover we still provide the other gapmaster units but with the electronic version we ve given more control to the operator morris says it s a well proven system and the electronic system gives more visibility to the system and helps guide efficiency highlighting its load n lok elastomer sleeves luminite products corporation touted the simple changeover process saying that the sleeves can be mounted on any mandrel at a converter s plant and can decrease setup time the company also brought a range of its other elastomer print cylinders and sleeves the company spoke about its push for sustainability with the elastomer sleeves and covered cylinders saying that it decreases wasted materials and due to its long lasting nature reduces the amount of time sleeves need to change out rotometal brought print cylinder for both narrow and wide web systems highlighting its mca magnetic cylinders which are significantly lighter due to the aluminum body the company however wanted to ensure that the cylinder still maintains the strength and hardness of its other products we ve developed these magnetic cylinders to be upwards of 40 percent lighter said stephen bailey uk and ireland sales manager at rotometal it can be manually handled for easier changeover and it s better for the machine itself because it takes less power to drive it the company also highlighted its newly launched online shop which allows customers to purchase equipment directly from the company according to rotometal it is also looking to expand the shop to include equipment and machines from partners schobertechnologies showcased its rsm410mx digi varicut which the company says has a make ready time of minutes and reduces waste due to its efficient high speed programmable robotic automated stacking and counting system known as the spider according to the company

when russia invaded ukraine in february of this year the international community slapped a raft of sanctions on the invading nation they froze the assets of wealthy and powerful russian citizens and restricted their ability to travel they restricted the sale of russian raw materials and energy and worked to prevent russia from getting its hands on various kinds of defense and information technologies and they imposed financial sanctions on russian banks and curtailed russia s access to foreign capital and financial markets many corporations followed up on these government imposed sanctions with so calledself sanctioning whereby companies restricted or halted commercial relations with russia and russian firms the effect on paper appeared to be a set of measures that struck at the heart of russia s economy forecasts in the spring of this year predicted a drop in gdp of at least 7 8 and possibly as much as11 for 2022 prices were expected to rise by20 25 foreign direct investment by corporations was forecast to fall as much as25 28 t over the year but russia has not been brought to its knees far from it forecasters say russian gdp for 2022 will likely fall but only about3 3 3 4 inflation meanwhile will likely end the year at roughly12 bad but not close to as painful as predicted and foreign direct investment estimates say it will fall by a mere 1 meanwhile the war in ukrainegrinds on strong points so what went wrong a report from bruegel a brussels based economic think tank points to a number of flaws in the sanctions regime and several strong points in the russian defenses the most effective defense has been mounted by the central bank of russia which designed and executed the fortress russia policy aimed at protecting the russian financial system the system did take a big hit early on as sanctions on russia s central bank assets were much stronger than expected reducing its bank reserves by 40 however thanks to competent management the system recovered and the bank continues to hold large amounts of foreign currency as much as 300 billion for potential intervention in the currency and debt markets and even though russian banks lost access to the swift financial transfer system they still seem able to get the cash they need to operate as various other channels continue to enable russian banks to interact with the outside world in other words despite some big shocks the central bank has kept russia s financial system intact and prevented a collapse of the wider russian economy many of the sanctions were aimed at inhibiting parts of the russian economy s ability to do business russia s economy is less reliant on imports than most other large advanced economies and emerging markets the report notes but some sectors are highly exposed especially the manufacturing of transportation equipment chemicals food products and it services sanctions did a good job initially of restricting russian access to key imports such as parts for manufacturing still despite the initial shock russia pivoted quickly and began importing more goods from nations like china belarus and turkey which are not participating in the sanctions regime

when russia invaded ukraine in february of this year the international community slapped a raft of sanctions on the invading nation they froze the assets of wealthy and powerful russian citizens and restricted their ability to travel they restricted the sale of russian raw materials and energy and worked to prevent russia from getting its hands on various kinds of defense and information technologies and they imposed financial sanctions on russian banks and curtailed russia s access to foreign capital and financial markets many corporations followed up on these government imposed sanctions with so calledself sanctioning whereby companies restricted or halted commercial relations with russia and russian firms the effect on paper appeared to be a set of measures that struck at the heart of russia s economy forecasts in the spring of this year predicted a drop in gdp of at least 7 8 and possibly as much as11 for 2022 prices were expected to rise by20 25 foreign direct investment by corporations was forecast to fall as much as25 28 t over the year but russia has not been brought to its knees far from it forecasters say russian gdp for 2022 will likely fall but only about3 3 3 4 inflation meanwhile will likely end the year at roughly12 bad but not close to as painful as predicted and foreign direct investment estimates say it will fall by a mere 1 meanwhile the war in ukrainegrinds on strong points so what went wrong a report from bruegel a brussels based economic think tank points to a number of flaws in the sanctions regime and several strong points in the russian defenses the most effective defense has been mounted by the central bank of russia which designed and executed the fortress russia policy aimed at protecting the russian financial system the system did take a big hit early on as sanctions on russia s central bank assets were much stronger than expected reducing its bank reserves by 40 however thanks to competent management the system recovered and the bank continues to hold large amounts of foreign currency as much as 300 billion for potential intervention in the currency and debt markets and even though russian banks lost access to the swift financial transfer system they still seem able to get the cash they need to operate as various other channels continue to enable russian banks to interact with the outside world in other words despite some big shocks the central bank has kept russia s financial system intact and prevented a collapse of the wider russian economy many of the sanctions were aimed at inhibiting parts of the russian economy s ability to do business russia s economy is less reliant on imports than most other large advanced economies and emerging markets the report notes but some sectors are highly exposed especially the manufacturing of transportation equipment chemicals food products and it services sanctions did a good job initially of restricting russian access to key imports such as parts for manufacturing still despite the initial shock russia pivoted quickly and began importing more goods from nations like china belarus and turkey which are not participating in the sanctions regime in short when it comes to imports of key materials russia has been shut out of a number of markets but it has since found new markets to meet many of its needs sanctions on russian exports have been even less successful many countries have stopped buying certain goods from russia but the flow of key commodities continues largely unabated and roaring inflation has only helped russia in this area bruegel estimates that rather than falling russia s export income has risen by more than 40 to roughly 120 billion year to date because of higher prices and is likely to stay that high through the end of the year the largest contribution to this comes from natural gas which is still in high demand throughout europe and which unlike coal oil and other petroleum products has not been sanctioned this shrinkage in imports and swelling of exports means that russia s trade balance looks extremely healthy the surplus for january september stood at 198 4 billion roughly 120 billion higher than for the same period in 2021 and more than double the previous record in 2008 bruegel reckons the rude health of russia s balance of payments will persist into 2023 as commodity prices are likely to remain high despite the eu embargo on crude oil and petroleum products and despite russia s decision to cut natural gas flows to europe bruegel estimates a surplus of around 100 billion in 2023 a substantial drop compared to 2022 but not too shabby for a sanctioned state russia s currency appears to be in equally good shape when sanctions were first imposed the ruble dropped from about 70 75 to the dollar

agreed at the end of may to stop seaborne imports of russian oil by year end by the start of 2023 more than 90 of russia s previous oil exports to the eu will be banned it s true that russia has found new markets for its oil but it is selling that oil at a significant discount and it will likely have to continue to do so if the most lucrative markets remain closed to it bruegel notes that there is

bruegel says russia has weaponized its gas supply blackmailing european countries by progressively cutting exports to europe now down to around 20 of their 2021 levels this will hurt russia in the long run because roughly 60 of russia s gas exports go to the eu and uk russia will need to close a sizable portion of its gas export infrastructure including production sites at significant cost export revenues from gas will dry up and attempts to diversify export routes by building new liquified natural gas export capacity will be hindered by a lack of access to western technology

the white house is supporting a bill that would spend roughly 29 million to exclude more americans from white collar jobs and also reduce job creating investment in heartland states the administration supports house passage of gh r 36438 the equal acess to green cards for legal employment eagle act and its goal of allowing u s employers to focus on hiring immigrants on merit said a december 6 statement from the white house s office of management and budget the bill is likely to cost 29 million over the next five years according to a december 5 estimate by the congressional budget office cbo the bill is marketed as a reasonable aid for indian migrants who have been hired for u s jobs by fortune 500 companies and their pyramids of indian subcontractors but the cbo report noted that the impact goes far beyond aid for indians because it would allow foreign workers imported by u s companies to get renewable work permits regardless of the backlogged line for green cards the bill would allow beneficiaries of employment based petitions for immigrant visas who are living in the united states to apply to adjust status to lawful permanent resident even if an immigrant visa is not immediately available the biggest losers from the democrats bill are the swing voting college graduates who mostly voted democratic in the 2022 midterm elections but the bill has also sparked rare opposition from rep yvette clarke d ny who runs the immigration task force for the congressional black caucus she argued the bill would unfairly tilt the immigration system towards a subset of immigrants adding i cannot support efforts that would perpetuate the current inequities in our immigration system i believe we can do better and i believe we must do better the eagleact is simply not the reform we ve long hoped for nor is it the change to our immigration systems we ve long needed and that is precisely why i ve opposed it today yvette d clarke repyvetteclarke december 6 2022 the cbc has repeatedly tried to boost the award of green cards to african migrants but the eagle act would likely ensure the fortune 500 s indian workforce would dominate the distribution of green cards in turn the inflow of indians is expected to boost the political clout of ethnic indian groups at the expense of african american groups the eagle act is cosponsored by eight republicans and is also being pushed by republican sen kevin cramer r nd even though it would reduce investment in gop dominated areas and encourage more job investment in the c0astal states dominated by pro migration democrats the corporate giveaway bill is backed by rep tom emmer r mn he was elected party whip for the 2023 congress after running a partly successful 2022 election campaign in which donor opposition suppressed republican debate about the huge and growing pocketbook pain of migration on american families rep brian fitzpatrick r pa is another supporter of the outsourcing bill he is also cochairman of the establishment minded problem solvers caucus and is pushing a farmworker amnesty that helps agricultural investors rep don bacon r ne the coleader of the main street caucus is also a supporter of the giveaway to investors fortune 500 companies and foreign graduates rep john curtis r ut is under pressure from state republican leaders who expect many indian visa workers to settle in their state so boosting real estate investors and spurring retail sales the other supporters include rep larry bucshon r in rep bill johnson r oh rep pete stauber r mn and rep william timmons r sc most of whom face determined home district lobbying by indian citizens working as contract workers in jobs needed by u s graduates the eagle act would reduce job opportunities for american graduates living in interior states such as bucshon s indiana bacon s nebraska johnson s ohio and emmer s minnesota the reduction happens because the bill opens up a huge pipeline of cheap labor for fortune 500 companies based in california new york north carolina texas and washington without a steady inflow of cheap foreign labor the companies and their subcontractors would face rising economic pressure to open up new workplaces in lower rent inland cities such as columbus ohio or st cloud minnesota section 7 of the bill is an end run around the annual green card limit rep scott fitzgerald r wi told the committee on rules which sets the rules for each floor debate in the house adding it allows certain temporary visa holders to file an application for adjustment for status despite the fact that no green card is available to them the result is that many temporary visas will essentially become permanent because the alien visa holders will be able to live and work in the u s as if they had a green card of course this will further strangle the ability of americans to get good paying jobs in tech and other sectors the bill offers permanent work permits just two years after each foreign worker is approved for a green card this would mean that companies can recruit endless foreign workers for u s jobs at low wages in exchange for providing them with renewable u s work permits after just several years the dangled employment authorization permits are extremely valuable because they allow foreign workers to work in many u s jobs until they can receive their promised green cards the green cards can then be traded to get the deferred mega bonus of american citizenship for themselves their families grandchildren and all of their descendants there are no limits on the number of foreign workers who can be hired and then paid with the bill s renewable work permits these eligible workers could arrive via the uncapped h 2a visa for agricultural workers the uncapped l 1 visa for corporate transfers the uncapped h 1b visa for white collar workers the uncapped e 2 for franchise operators or the uncapped f 1 opt work permit program for foreign graduates of u s universities fair firmly opposes the eagle act h r 3648 says a statement from joe chatham the senior government relations manager at the federation for american immigration reform fair the statement says this bill undermines the fairness in our immigration system by creating a preference for workers from india and china at the expense of all other workers across the globe it also eliminates diversity in the workers who come to the u s permanently and in the end it would do nothing to reduce the line for employment based green cards but would instead create more competition for american workers while lining the pockets of big tech the work for work permits corporate giveaway is being hidden deep in the bill while democrats advocates and reporters tout the beneficial impact for the many indian contract workers who have created their own huge backlog for green cards for example the billionaire investors at fwd us tout the bill as help for foreign workers per country caps have created extensive backlogs that leave immigrants and their families waiting years to receive their green cards simply because of their country of origin this restricts their ability to work travel and contribute and creates significant challenges for their families it also makes the u s less attractive to global talent hindering our competitiveness congress should pass per country cap reform like the bipartisan eagle act to ensure fairness and begin reducing the green card backlogs the bill also includes language to protect families and address challenges brought on by the backlogs including allowing individuals to file for adjustment of status before a green card is available to them if they have waited two years or more for an available visa filing early to adjust would allow individuals to secure travel authorization and portable employment authorization so that they could change employers meanwhile democrats and business leaders are pushing the bill amid a wave of layoffs by fortune 500 companies that ensure rising unemployment and underemployment levels among american graduates for example the bill is being pushed by rep zoe lofgren d ca whose home district is seeing a huge wave of layoffs on december 6 the mercury news reported santa clara intel has revealed plans to chop hundreds of jobs in northern california an ominous new sign of widespread layoffs in the increasingly wobbly silicon valley tech industry official state filings show the latest layoff notices from intel meant that since oct 1 tech and biotech companies have unveiled job cut plans or carried out layoffs that affect well over 7 700 jobs in the bay area this news organization s review of warn notices filed with the edd shows even before the layoffs a 2021 study by the census bureau reported massive underemployment among u s graduates amid the replacement level inflow of visa workers the vast majority 62 of college educated workers who majored in a stem field were employed in non stem fields such as non stem management law education social work accounting or counseling in addition 10 of stem college graduates worked in stem related occupations such as health care the path to stem jobs for non stem majors was narrow only a few stem related majors 7 and non stem majors 6 ultimately ended up in stem occupations dice com collects data on technology workers salaries in january 2022 the site s owners showed that u s tech workers wages had dropped in value from 2009 to 2021 because inflation had exceeded their wage gains the pre inflation salaries in the tech sector rose from 78 845 in 2009 to 93 244 in 2018 and to 104 566 in 2021 but that shows a slight decline of 0 3 percent according to the inflation calculator offered by the bureau of labor statistics as tech salaries stalled tech investors gained trillions of dollars in extra value from escalating profits and stock prices the visa programs are all about forcing down americans wages said one american who has been forced out of work by ceos preference for cheaper indian workers investors saw this as an opportunity to drive down wages he added this workplace shift from professionals to foreign workers also allowed c suite executives to demote professionals workplace clout that demotion crippled many major companies such as intel boeing and theranos many polls show the public strongly opposes corporate labor migration into the jobs that americans need for middle class lives homes and families a wholescale gop surrender on the eagle act is unlikely because roughly one in six gop voters described immigration as their single top issue in 2022 but gop leaders in the senate may let the bill pass while they theatrically oppose the giveaway

when russia invaded ukraine in february of this year the international community slapped a raft of sanctions on the invading nation they froze the assets of wealthy and powerful russian citizens and restricted their ability to travel they restricted the sale of russian raw materials and energy and worked to prevent russia from getting its hands on various kinds of defense and information technologies and they imposed financial sanctions on russian banks and curtailed russia s access to foreign capital and financial markets many corporations followed up on these government imposed sanctions with so calledself sanctioning whereby companies restricted or halted commercial relations with russia and russian firms the effect on paper appeared to be a set of measures that struck at the heart of russia s economy forecasts in the spring of this year predicted a drop in gdp of at least 7 8 and possibly as much as11 for 2022 prices were expected to rise by20 25 foreign direct investment by corporations was forecast to fall as much as25 28 t over the year but russia has not been brought to its knees far from it forecasters say russian gdp for 2022 will likely fall but only about3 3 3 4 inflation meanwhile will likely end the year at roughly12 bad but not close to as painful as predicted and foreign direct investment estimates say it will fall by a mere 1 meanwhile the war in ukrainegrinds on strong points so what went wrong a report from bruegel a brussels based economic think tank points to a number of flaws in the sanctions regime and several strong points in the russian defenses the most effective defense has been mounted by the central bank of russia which designed and executed the fortress russia policy aimed at protecting the russian financial system the system did take a big hit early on as sanctions on russia s central bank assets were much stronger than expected reducing its bank reserves by 40 however thanks to competent management the system recovered and the bank continues to hold large amounts of foreign currency as much as 300 billion for potential intervention in the currency and debt markets and even though russian banks lost access to the swift financial transfer system they still seem able to get the cash they need to operate as various other channels continue to enable russian banks to interact with the outside world in other words despite some big shocks the central bank has kept russia s financial system intact and prevented a collapse of the wider russian economy many of the sanctions were aimed at inhibiting parts of the russian economy s ability to do business russia s economy is less reliant on imports than most other large advanced economies and emerging markets the report notes but some sectors are highly exposed especially the manufacturing of transportation equipment chemicals food products and it services sanctions did a good job initially of restricting russian access to key imports such as parts for manufacturing still despite the initial shock russia pivoted quickly and began importing more goods from nations like china belarus and turkey which are not participating in the sanctions regime in short when it comes to imports of key materials russia has been shut out of a number of markets but it has since found new markets to meet many of its needs sanctions on russian exports have been even less successful many countries have stopped buying certain goods from russia but the flow of key commodities continues largely unabated and roaring inflation has only helped russia in this area bruegel estimates that rather than falling russia s export income has risen by more than 40 to roughly 120 billion year to date because of higher prices and is likely to stay that high through the end of the year the largest contribution to this comes from natural gas which is still in high demand throughout europe and which unlike coal oil and other petroleum products has not been sanctioned this shrinkage in imports and swelling of exports means that russia s trade balance looks extremely healthy the surplus for january september stood at 198 4 billion roughly 120 billion higher than for the same period in 2021 and more than double the previous record in 2008 bruegel reckons the rude health of russia s balance of payments will persist into 2023 as commodity prices are likely to remain

slowing of the pace would ease some of the pressure even if the end goal was unchanged the rba would have liked to have hiked by 50 on both occasions it was discussed but settled on 25 anyway so why

ranting about mortgage rates thems were the days we ll get the gdp result today which doesn t seem to matter that much it s going to be a cracker up over 6 is the forecast but totally misleading as we ll be cycling the delta lockdowns in last year s september quarter the annual growth rate will be more like 2 enjoy it while it lasts wall street has tanked again this time without a reason our futures are down 37 this morning belt tightening and lay offs i noted yesterday the strong us services pmi was more of an excuse than a driver of wall street s fall on monday night given the s p500 rally had already ominously stalled at the downtrend line i also noted the s p had closed just below support at 4000 there was no specific reason for wall street to fall again last night other than the above unless something comes out of the blue before christmas putin s assassination would be a good one the end of chinese zero covid hasn t cut it then it looks like santa s not going to bother this year reminiscent of 2018 oil prices said it all last night down 4 the price cap on russian oil should be bullish for oil prices but the belief the us is headed for recession overrides you can read about it in an fnarena feature story today if you think there could be a recession and respond accordingly there will be a recession the new buzzwords on wall street are belt tightening and lay offs lay offs began in the beaten up tech sector but are now spreading across the general economy cost cutting and efficiency drives are being pursued even pepsico which posted a strong september quarter result and suggested it was yet to see any fall in demand for snacks and fizzy drinks has announced such measures just in case the banks are in on the act as well bank of america followed morgan stanley s lead last night and announced it would slow hiring bofa fell 4 3 leading all the big boys down one could argue that if the us falls into recession in 2023 it only has itself to blame you can t throw it all at the fed meta has been casting off excess employees for months now last night the eu warned it was set to clamp down further on the unauthorised harvesting of personal data by facebook instagram and whatsapp for the benefit of advertisers advertising is meta s bread and butter and apple s already knocked the wind out of social media advertising the stock fell 6 8 ensuring another tough day for the nasdaq although being down 70 from its august 2021 high we can hardly call meta big tech anymore further recession assumption evidence was apparent in the us bond market last night the us ten year yield was crunched last week when jerome powell confirmed the fed would now slow the pace and on the weak manufacturing pmi on monday night it shot up on the strong services pmi but last night fell back yet again down 9 points to 3 51 if there is any solace to be had the dow was down over 500 points at the low last night otherwise buckle up commodities spot metals minerals

the most important objective for investors is to review portfolios and bring them in line with long term strategic allocation recommendations minneapolis dec 6 2022 prnewswire a u s recession may arrive mid 2023 based on historical economic markers and waning consumer financial power rbc wealth management suggests in its global insight 2023 outlook released tuesday an inverted yield curve on u s treasuries coupled with the arrival of tight money and inflation rates that have pushed real incomes below where they were a year ago are further indications a recession and accompanying global equity bear market may be on the horizon the most important objective for investors is to review portfolios and bring them in line with long term strategic allocation recommendations history has shown that the market rebounds well before a recession ends usually about three to five months before recessions are painful but they are relatively short in the context of long term investment horizons said kelly bogdanova vice president and portfolio analyst at rbc wealth management u s the economy and already successful businesses should adapt as they have in the past and it s wise for investors to keep that in mind when making big portfolio decisions u s equity market advance could have legs into 2023 even if the economy goes in to recession next year with history as a guide the equity market would likely begin a new bull market cycle before the recession ends according to the report moderating inflation data negative investor sentiment around october lows and the fact the s p 500 has almost always delivered strong positive returns for months following the u s midterm elections could mean a rally in equity prices over the next few weeks or months investors could see the equity market continue to rally into 2023 then give way to another period of falling share prices and subsequently tick back up later in the year despite the lingering and anticipated economic challenges the equity market has already absorbed significant blows including one of the fed s fastest and biggest tightening cycles in history bogdanova said it would also be rare for the s p 500 to deliver back to back negative return years and the corporate earnings outlook isn t as bad as in previous periods of economic stress going into 2023 investors should consider leaning more heavily toward quality and sustainable dividends and away from individual company risks small cap and midcap segments are attractive due to their valuation discounts and because they are likely to benefit as economic green shoots start to emerge according to the report within the large cap s p 500 the analysts continue to favor the energy sector next year tight energy commodity supplies will linger supporting prices and earnings to a greater degree than in typical periods of economic weakness u s fixed income focus on financial stability the federal reserve spent the past two years focused on boosting employment rates in the labor market and stabilizing pricing in the economy its next act will be to zero in on financial stability in 2023 the historically aggressive tightening campaign will likely necessitate a far more cautious approach from policymakers and a heightened focus on domestic and global financial vulnerabilities that may come as a result of higher interest rates particularly from the strength of the dollar this could mean the fed soon places the blunt tool of rate hikes back in the toolbox and employs more surgical macroprudential measures that help to ensure the soundness of and liquidity within the financial system said tom garretson fixed income senior portfolio strategist at rbc wealth management u s interest rates may peak in early 2023 on the heels of an anticipated 50 basis point hike at the federal reserve s december meeting this could mark the last of sharp hikes and rates could even drop modestly over the back half of 2023 in an attempt to mitigate the anticipated mid year economic slowdown yields across the fixed income landscape are expected to fall in 2023 the benchmark 10 year treasury yield could fall below 3 5 by the end of the year from levels close to 4 0 currently based on rbc capital markets forecast the window for fixed income investors to put money to work is open but it could close sooner than expected if yields continue to fade over the course of 2023 that could introduce heightened reinvestment risk for short maturity securities analysts continue to favor a strategy of locking in historically high yields in intermediate and longer dated bonds

there are a few reasons as a real estate professional to care about the estimated 20 of greenhouse gas emissions created by residential housing in the united states roughly equivalent to the entire output of japan first it almost certainly will affect you personally scientists continue to warn that very few places will be safe from the longer term effects of climate change which has already exacerbated dangerous heat waves and extreme weather events but secondly regarding your business energy efficiency has become an extremely important element for homeowners and homebuyers who may or may not be concerned about the climate but are definitely starting to recognize the value of energy saving improvements and maybe more importantly a huge portion of the nation s housing stock just became eligible for a massive influx of government funding that can help make these improvements happen that s a real game changer said carlos martin project director at harvard s joint center for housing studies speaking at a lecture last week about the opportunities and challenges ahead for energy efficient housing martin described both a long term trend toward various energy conscious housing as well as a huge short term opportunity created by recent legislation that has the power to really change the market this is a decade of transformation particularly market transformation martin continued because all of the policy programs that are ahead of us are for two bills passed over the last year or so the infrastructure investment and jobs act sometimes known as the bif and the so called inflation reduction act ira passed late this summer provide some significant money for energy efficiency in housing both together are only a fraction of the 150 billion for housing that president joe biden s failed build back better bill would have provided something martin lamented this is a good chunk of change it s going to get us moving the ball forward for equity in energy transformation but it s only going to take us part of the way there he said exactly how many homes or families will be able to take advantage of these programs the exact number is hard to predict but the number of people who are eligible for either tax credits rebates or subsidies numbers in the tens of millions more than half a million energy efficient new constructions could be incentivized as well according to an analysis from sustainability focused nonprofit rocky mountain institute that martin cited a large portion of these programs including much of the ira rebate and credit programs launch at the beginning of 2023 including energy audits which martin said was a great first step for homeowners the types of upgrades range from electrification upgrades to major performance based retrofits to new appliances other monies from the bif could also directly or indirectly upgrade homes and neighborhoods all over the country martin said that nearly 51 million households will be eligible for tax credits and about 39 million can qualify for wap or the weatherization assistance program which focuses on energy efficiency upgrades for low income homeowners about 25 million will have access to up front rebates exactly when this money is available and what projects it can be used for is complicated much of it is targeted toward low and middle income households from people living below the federal poverty rate to families making 120 of area median income red tape promises to present barriers as states implement new programs or process an influx of applicants with many potential buyers or owners unaware of where to start or if they qualify another bottleneck is labor with martin noting that the actual work required to deliver all these upgrades will still fall on the same people and businesses that have strained to keep up with demand as skilled trades are struggling to find workers ultimately these jobs fall on the same occupations and the same establishments that have traditionally filled these roles we re talking about your local remodeler your hvac repair person your window repair person your roofer he explained there are programs in the recent federal legislation to train and employ new workers who are capable of doing this work but the fruits of that will not materialize for four to five years according to martin during the pandemic it took between 30 and 50 weeks to deliver materials for a roofing or hvac project according to martin and even appliances might languish in transit for six months or more that means the decade of transformation might in fact take the better part of a decade but the good news is the longer term movement toward more energy efficient homes and amenities has proved powerful in 1995 27 billion was spent on energy efficiency improvements while in 2021 that number was 111 billion though the proportion of remodeling projects focused on energy related upgrades remained roughly the same in florida over 70 of new homes are all electric driven by local policies as well as advances in technology martin said even relatively simple amenities like digitized air conditioning or smart thermostats are growing in adoption as is their power in cutting down energy consumption martin said even some harvard professors he has spoken to aren t using these technologies in a lot of cases educating consumers can make a huge difference in their choices according to martin many of them will need help understanding the technology the opportunities and the value in these things and connecting with the local vendors that can make it happen martin specifically talked about the little things cooking for instance where the perception remains that gas is somehow better even as newer electric stoves outpace natural gas in power and efficiency there has to be a cultural change associated with this and that s true across all the interventions that we re speaking about martin said

faced a 91 percent tax rate on income in the top tax bracket that top rate had been hovering around 90 percent for the previous two decades in the 1950s a republican president dwight d eisenhower made no move to knock it down the rich felt those taxes the high life struggled consider what happened to one fabled emblem of that era s excess the nation s first ever penthouse marjorie merriweather post an heiress who had become america s richest woman had that penthouse built atop a new fifth avenue luxury tower in 1925 the top federal tax rate then in effect as builders were putting the finishing touches on post s spectacular three floor 54 room residence was just 25 percent the post clan held on to that penthouse for the next 15 years and then decided to move on the american people by that time had decided to move on as well from bargain basement tax rates on high incomes in 1940 the federal tax rate on income over 200 000 started at 66 percent by 1944 the top tax rate on all income over 200 000 about 3 4 million in today s dollars had jumped to 94 percent post s fabulous penthouse would find no new takers in this new high tax era the penthouse went vacant all through the 1940s in the 1950s with the nation s top tax rate still above 90 percent the luxury tower s owners threw in the towel and broke up the former post palace into six separate units america s rich most observers figured were adjusting to living lives significantly less rich but the political winds were changing in 1963 president john kennedy himself the product of one of america s grandest fortunes asked congress to drop the nation s top tax rate down to 65 percent congress would mostly oblige and that top tax rate would sink to 70 percent in 1965 in the 1980s ronald reagan and his friends on capitol hill would shove that rate down even further first to 50 and then to 28 percent this top tax rate then inched up to 31 percent in 1991 and has been bouncing around in the 30s ever since the current top bracket rate 37 percent report by james steele what has this nosedive in tax rates on the rich meant for average americans nothing good concludes veteran tax analyst james steele in a just published report from the center for public integrity and bloomberg tax over recent decades says steele congress after congress has cut taxes on the richest people and corporations billions of dollars that would otherwise have gone to the federal till for spending that could help the rest of the public get ahead donate today to cn s 2022 winter fund drive steele s new study acknowledges upfront that a variety of factors have contributed to the deeply unequal united states we have today everything from deregulation and a weakened labor movement to the shrinking of our national safety net but taxes he emphasizes have been a principal engine of worsening economic inequality simply because the wealthy thanks to their success in congress now have more money to buy stocks invest in real estate build mega yachts blast off into space and make campaign contributions to politicians so the cycle isn t interrupted steele s report adds all sorts of eye opening detail to a don t tax the rich story tax analysts have been tracking for years now consider his take on the tax treatment of dividend income a concern few average income americans have on their radar screens dividend income in the decades before the start of the 21st century faced the same tax rates as wages and salaries in 2003 the bush white house and congress gifted the nation s rich a new arrangement and chopped the tax rate on most dividends down to 15 percent in 2019 steele points out this neat little gift saved taxpayers who were making making 1 million or more some 16 2 billion the equivalent of the federal income taxes paid by everyone earning 50 000 or less in california idaho iowa kansas minnesota nebraska new hampshire oklahoma pennsylvania south dakota west virginia and wisconsin combined the corporations rich people run have fared equally nicely under america s now decades old don t tax the rich regime major u s companies steele s analysis notes took particularly good advantage of the tax breaks lawmakers bestowed upon them in the 2004 american jobs creation act the tax breaks resulting from this legislation benefited only 4 percent of america s businesses mostly giants like hewlett packard pfizer and merck and did little more than enrich corporate shareholders and executives these executives and shareholders so enjoyed how the 2004 american jobs creation act played out that that they went out and convinced congress to do it all over again with the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the convincing came easy one reason corporations observes steele annually spend more than 85 percent of the total reported expenses associated with lobbying congress trade unions account for less than 2 percent how unequal a nation have dynamics like these created a just released report from the congressional budget office helpfully paints a revealing picture this new cbo study on the distribution of american income adds up all the changes in household income means tested transfers and federal taxes between 1979 and 2019 between those two years the cbo data show household income after transfers and taxes and after adjusting for inflation grew on average by 97 percent among households in the nation s most affluent 81st to 99th percentiles in other words america s affluent but not super rich households saw their after tax incomes about double in the four decades after 1979 households in the top 1 percent have fared considerably better wealthy americans in the 99th to 99 9th percentiles the bottom 90 percent of the top 1 percent have watched their after tax incomes nearly triple rising 193 percent within the rest of our super rich the top 0 1 percent we see even more striking leaps households in the bottom 90 percent of this top 0 1 percent have had their inflation adjusted after tax incomes shoot up a stunning 367 percent and what about those households at the tippy top of our nation s income distribution between 1979 and 2019 average after tax

u s reps bill huizenga r mi and andy barr r ky on dec 2 introduced legislation that would limit the securities and exchange commission s sec ability to establish more disclosure requirements on public companies including for climate related risks the mandatory materiality requirement act of 2022 h r 9408 which rep huizenga sponsored and rep barr cosponsored also would apply to additional disclosure requirements laid out in the sec s proposed public company climate disclosure rule the bill is identical to s 5005 introduced on sept 29 by u s sen mike rounds r sd such an expansion would not only damage our economy it would negatively impact small businesses and make it more difficult for investors to retire with financial security rep huizenga said i am proud to be an original cosponsor of the mandatory materiality requirement act in the house to ensure that the sec is sticking to its statutory mandate and commend representative huizenga and senator rounds for helping to lead the charge against woke climate policy in our financial markets and institutions rep barr said the bill addresses an sec march proposal that would require public companies to disclose myriad climate related information in their registration statements and periodic reports including the oversight and governance of climate related risks by the company s board and management and how any identified climate related risks have affected or are likely to affect the company s strategy business model and outlook among other requirements the sec s proposal has broad support from institutional investors and asset managers but rep huizenga calls it part of the sec s heavy handed regulatory approach nowhere is this more evident than the sec s clear desire to massively expand disclosure requirements the congressman said the sec has a long established history of using the materiality standard when proposing new disclosure requirements and it should continue to do so specifically the measure would amend both the securities act of 1933 and the securities exchange act of 1934 by inserting statutory language into both acts to require that when imposing a disclosure obligation the sec must determine that there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor of the issuer would consider the information disclosed to the commission under the requirement to be important with respect to an investment decision regarding the issuer according to the bill s text the materiality standard is the investor driven backbone of our capital markets said rep barr immaterial reporting requirements like those outlined in the climate related disclosure proposed rule place an undue burden on companies and small business discriminatorily choke off energy companies access to capital and threaten american energy security the bill added rep huizenga would codify this standard into law and prohibit the sec from expanding beyond securities law and the authority granted to it by congress
when russia invaded ukraine in february of this year the international community slapped a raft of sanctions on the invading nation they froze the assets of wealthy and powerful russian citizens and restricted their ability to travel they restricted the sale of russian raw materials and energy and worked to prevent russia from getting its hands on various kinds of defense and information technologies and they imposed financial sanctions on russian banks and curtailed russia s access to foreign capital and financial markets many corporations followed up on these government imposed sanctions with so calledself sanctioning whereby companies restricted or halted commercial relations with russia and russian firms the effect on paper appeared to be a set of measures that struck at the heart of russia s economy forecasts in the spring of this year predicted a drop in gdp of at least 7 8 and possibly as much as11 for 2022 prices were expected to rise by20 25 foreign direct investment by corporations was forecast to fall as much as25 28 t over the year but russia has not been brought to its knees far from it forecasters say russian gdp for 2022 will likely fall but only about3 3 3 4 inflation meanwhile will likely end the year at roughly12 bad but not close to as painful as predicted and foreign direct investment estimates say it will fall by a mere 1 meanwhile the war in ukrainegrinds on strong points so what went wrong a report from bruegel a brussels based economic think tank points to a number of flaws in the sanctions regime and several strong points in the russian defenses the most effective defense has been mounted by the central bank of russia which designed and executed the fortress russia policy aimed at protecting the russian financial system the system did take a big hit early on as sanctions on russia s central bank assets were much stronger than expected reducing its bank reserves by 40 however thanks to competent management the system recovered and the bank continues to hold large amounts of foreign currency as much as 300 billion for potential intervention in the currency and debt markets and even though russian banks lost access to the swift financial transfer system they still seem able to get the cash they need to operate as various other channels continue to enable russian banks to interact with the outside world in other words despite some big shocks the central bank has kept russia s financial system intact and prevented a collapse of the wider russian economy many of the sanctions were aimed at inhibiting parts of the russian economy s ability to do business russia s economy is less reliant on imports than most other large advanced economies and emerging markets the report notes but some sectors are highly exposed especially the manufacturing of transportation equipment chemicals food products and it services sanctions did a good job initially of restricting russian access to key imports such as parts for manufacturing still despite the initial shock russia pivoted quickly and began importing more goods from nations like china belarus and turkey which are not participating in the sanctions regime in short when it comes to imports of key materials russia has been shut out of a number of markets but it has since found new markets to meet many of its needs sanctions on russian exports have been even less successful many countries have stopped buying certain goods from russia but the flow of key commodities continues largely unabated and roaring inflation has only helped russia in this area bruegel estimates that rather than falling russia s export income has risen by more than 40 to roughly 120 billion year to date because of higher prices and is likely to stay that high through the end of the year the largest contribution to this comes from natural gas which is still in high demand throughout europe and which unlike coal oil and other petroleum products has not been sanctioned this shrinkage in imports and swelling of exports means that russia s trade balance looks extremely healthy the surplus for january september stood at 198 4 billion roughly 120 billion higher than for the same period in 2021 and more than double the previous record in 2008 bruegel reckons the rude health of russia s balance of payments will persist into 2023 as commodity prices are likely to remain high despite the eu embargo on crude oil and petroleum products and despite russia s decision to cut natural gas flows to europe bruegel estimates a surplus of around 100 billion in 2023 a substantial drop compared to 2022 but not too shabby for a sanctioned state russia s currency appears to be in equally good shape when sanctions were first imposed the ruble dropped from about 70 75 to the dollar to close to 140 to the dollar by april however the exchange rate had returned to below pre invasion levels today the ruble fluctuates at about 60 rubles to the dollar we have reported extensively on the reasons why the ruble has bounced back so impressively well and you can read that reporting here but the tldr is that capital controls combined with falling trading volumes and the dynamics of the current account have all helped prop the ruble up under the skin reading all of this you could be forgiven for thinking that the coalition of nations sanctioning russia are on a fool s errand and that russia is simply too big to fail bruegel contends that this is not so that the sanctions are hurting russia and that rosy statistics are concealing some serious damage to the russian economy the ruble s strength is a fine example of this to the casual observer the ruble has recovered and is in good health in fact the ruble is critically weak it has been propped up by capital controls that make it difficult to sell rubles and which force russian companies to buy the currency against their will or better judgment as bruegel puts it the current exchange rate is not a reflection of the value of the russian economy s fundamentals rather it is a testament to the fact that financial sanctions are isolating the ruble internationally russia s pivot to new markets for key imports was speedy and effective but it will not be enough to rescue some important parts of russia s economy bruegel says the self sanctioning by corporations wishing to distance themselves from russia has been particularly damaging in sectors including auto production and transportation the withdrawal of foreign car manufacturers and the shortage of inputs has hit passenger car production extremely hard with a 95 decline in may 2022 compared to the previous year air transportation has also collapsed following the cancellation of aircraft leases and maintenance contracts and the closure of several countries airspaces to russian planes exports of oil and gas look like a strong point but they are threatened in the medium to long term bruegel says canada the united states and australia have banned all imports of russian oil while the united kingdom has announced a phase down to zero by the end of the year the european union which has been highly dependent on russian oil imports in the past agreed at the end of may to stop seaborne imports of russian oil by year end by the start of 2023 more than 90 of russia s previous oil exports to the eu will be banned it s true that russia has found new markets for its oil but it is selling that oil at a significant discount and it will likely have to continue to do so if the most lucrative markets remain closed to it bruegel notes that there is one way the sanctions regime could be expanded to significantly undermine russian oil exports via insurance more than 90 of the world s oil tankers are insured by the international group of p i clubs a london based association of insurers the eu and the uk recently introduced a ban on insurance for ships carrying russian oil from the start of next year which would have jacked up insurance costs for russia and had a meaningful impact on exports the u s however diluted this measure and took the sting out of its tail when it comes to natural gas no sanctions have been imposed on russia instead bruegel says russia has weaponized its gas supply blackmailing european countries by progressively cutting exports to europe now down to around 20 of their 2021 levels this will hurt russia in the long run because roughly 60 of russia s gas exports go to the eu and uk russia will need to close a sizable portion of its gas export infrastructure including production sites at significant cost export revenues from gas will dry up and attempts to diversify export routes by building new liquified natural gas export capacity will be hindered by a lack of access to western technology redevelopment will take years in other words the sanctions have teeth but for russia to feel the bite coalition nations will need to sink those teeth in deeper and hang on for the long term bruegel says they need to find unity on effective measures such as the oil insurance ban mentioned above and to restrict oil and gas shipments further the combination of a large and likely persistent fall in russian imports and the permanent decoupling of european economies from russian energy supplies will have significant negative consequences for the russian economy in the medium to long run the report says russia may find ways to mitigate some sanctions related effects but the overall loss in economic activity will likely be permanent in the short term however russia s economy has not been inhibited to the point where it is finding it impossible to prosecute the war in ukraine given the ultimate aim of sanctions is to stop that war the eu and other coalition nations as bruegel puts it

federal government debt has nearly doubled since president barack obama took office recent progress toward reducing the annual budget deficit is welcome yet federal debt is still projected to increase 50 percent over the next decade and then rise rapidly thereafter under existing policies as federal debt has soared so have concerns about america s future used properly debt can safely finance private and government investment in productive capital to support economic growth but too much debt can ruin a family a business or a nation recent and projected growth in u s government debt poses a serious hazard to the nation at a minimum high levels of government debt mean substantial government resources must go toward servicing debt to pay interest further theory indicates and a growing body of research suggests a consistent relationship between high levels of government debt relative to the size of the economy and abnormally high interest rates consistent with lower levels of domestic investment this relationship appears to be currently suspended due to extraordinary efforts in monetary policy and extraordinary events in the global economy but the traditional relationship between debt and investment and interest rates will almost certainly resume as these efforts and events subside traditional interest rate and investment effects from high levels of government debt provide at least corroborating support for another body of research suggesting a negative causal relationship between high government debt ratios and low rates of economic growth the clear implication is that the recent surge in and the current trajectory of federal debt pose a substantial threat to the economy and to federal finances the president and congress should take every opportunity to enact reforms to the main drivers of federal budget deficits namely social security medicare and medicaid spending so these programs better serve their intended beneficiaries at a cost that is affordable today and tomorrow this is not a new call to action but a call for urgency as the ill consequences from rising debt may well soon unfold the consequences of obama s debt based fiscal policies president obama s high debt policies will not only bequeath enormous financial burdens to future generations of taxpayers in the form of high levels of interest expense projected by the congressional budget office to approach a trillion dollars annually by 2023 but these policies will also significantly reduce personal incomes with which to pay these bills it gets worse current and projected increases in government debt cutting into future economic growth rates also mean slower future growth of government revenues even as future interest expense rises as taxpayers are called upon to service all this debt growth in government revenues will slow leaving less available for other priorities such as national security and economic security education and innovation driving research further while both the administration and the congressional budget office forecast interest rates eventually returning to more normal levels as the economy returns to full employment the forecasts appear to ignore the interest rate consequences of the recent and projected substantial increases in the ratio of u s government debt to the size of the economy the higher interest rates the literature suggests are likely to follow from a high debt ratio are curiously missing from the government s economic forecasts meaning the government s projected future annual interest expense is likely substantially understated even greater interest expenses and even slower economic growth and consequent slower government revenue growth is a deeply troubling combination slower economic growth higher interest expense fewer resources for other priorities these are the legacies of president obama s debt based fiscal policies and of his and congress s refusal to deal with long standing fiscal and programmatic flaws in social security medicare and medicaid yet there are well vetted bipartisan solutions to reduce the future burden of these programs materially buying time for more thorough reforms to ensure they achieve their policy objectives at affordable cost president obama and congress need to cut spending across the budget to reduce current deficits and they need to embark on a sustained program of reforms to ensure that the nation s entitlement programs are effective and sustainable the rise in u s government debt for much of the post war period the ratio of u s government debt to the size of the economy averaged about 36 percent while a lower debt ratio would have been preferable if brought about by spending restraint and a stronger economy by international standards u s fiscal policy was reasonably prudent for long periods under president obama the debt ratio has shot up to exceed 75 percent in 2013 if this were an aberration if the debt ratio were expected to return quickly to historical levels in the coming years the recent rise in the debt ratio would be a mostly passing concern rather than returning to previous levels under current policy the debt ratio is projected to rise steadily from around 2019 onward as the full weight of unaffordable entitlement programs falls on the american taxpayer and the american worker the simple fact is that america is on the verge of becoming a country in decline economically stagnant and permanently debt bound under current policy the debt ratio is projected to rise steadily from around 2019 onward as the full weight of unaffordable entitlement programs falls on the american taxpayer and the american worker rising debt rising interest rates the theory a general consensus exists on how but not necessarily the extent to which interest rates are normally affected by budget deficits and their resulting changes in the ratio of government debt to the size of the economy in short at moderate debt ratio levels modest increases in the debt ratio can produce very modest increases in interest rates more relevant to recent u s experience rapid increases in the debt ratio or substantial increases over an extended period can produce substantial increases in interest rates before turning to empirical results it is worthwhile to consider the mechanisms by which large budget deficits and rising debt ratios may push interest rates upward more relevant to recent u s experience rapid increases in the debt ratio or substantial increases over an extended period can produce substantial increases in interest rates the two classic means by which interest rates respond to increasing government debt are inflation and crowding out the inflation argument follows from observing the strong incentive of highly indebted governments to push up inflation and thereby reduce the price level adjusted value of their outstanding debt in simplest terms debt is issued at one price level if government devalues the currency by half for example the value of outstanding debt in current dollar terms is cut in half debt purchasers build their inflation expectations into the prices they are willing to offer they may also include an extra interest rate premium as compensation for the possibility inflation may substantially exceed their expectations aware of the incentive facing high debt countries debt holders may then raise their inflation risk premium even before the onset of higher inflation the more debt issued the greater the risk the government will give in to the inflation surprise temptation and thus the greater the risk premium rapid inflation is then an effective means of reducing a nation s practical debt burden only if the rise in inflation is unexpected of course if and when inflation accelerates interest rates will then increase further in recent years central banks have been both largely independent of national fiscal authorities and credibly opposed to high inflation thus neutralizing this inflation surprise concern however if global bond buyers ever lost confidence in a central bank s independence its resolve regarding price stability or its ability to contain inflation then interest rates would likely jump substantially and very quickly the second traditional explanation for a debt to interest rates relationship crowding out observes how government debt competes with private borrowers for national saving government borrowing subtracts from domestic saving available to private borrowers who must then bid up the price of their borrowing which of course is the interest rate they pay the trouble with the simple conventional crowding out argument is it implicitly and incorrectly presumes the u s economy effectively operates in isolation closed to foreign trade and foreign supplies of saving to the contrary when the federal government runs a budget deficit the united states is able to import saving from abroad as needed thereby leaving domestic investment and interest rates largely unaffected and inoculating domestic investment and therefore economic growth heavy government borrowing inflicts substantial if less obvious harm on americans even if interest rates hold steady and private investment is unaffected as foreign saving is imported to offset government dis saving and thereby sustain domestic private investment more of the income earned from domestic production must compensate foreign investors leaving less domestic income available for americans the ability to import savings from abroad is economically beneficial on balance but not cost free the international demand for government debt as a portfolio choice the availability of foreign savings may initially blunt the effects of government borrowing on interest rates but the foreign appetite for any nation s debt is not unlimited citizens of one nation typically desire to hold the debt and other assets from another country if only as a matter of prudent portfolio diversification wise investors typically diversify their holdings among domestic assets and the same process holds true for purchasing foreign assets whether bonds equities or land this portfolio effect is limited to an extent by the home country bias displayed by investors in most countries and foreign demand is also often limited by the peculiarities of the issuing nation for example everything else held equal the international demand for holding the debt of a small emerging market country is likely to be more than proportionally less than the demand for holding the debt of a large industrial nation likewise the international demand for the debt of countries with bad economic policies will be less than the demand for debt in countries employing sound policies from the perspective of foreign demand for its debt the u s benefits extraordinarily from its position in the global economy with the largest economy backed by a tradition of respect for the rule of law extraordinarily deep and diverse financial markets and a history of low inflation and relatively pro growth economic policies foreign demand for u s debt is plentiful the united states also enjoys the extraordinary benefits of providing the world s primary reserve currency for international commerce further increasing the demand for u s dollar assets such as federal debt these factors and more come into play in determining the appetite of foreign savers for u s debt and this appetite is clearly robust but at some point as the debt ratio rises resistance will appear the appetite slaked and u s interest rates will begin to rise just as though the conventional crowding out effect were in full force rising debt rising interest rates the developing consensus the relationship between interest rates and government debt issuance is not a simple one it depends on the country the circumstances in credit markets around the world the country s economic policies and of course the amount of debt outstanding relative to the size of the economy yet for all these complexities one abiding factor stands out when debt gets high enough or rises fast enough markets notice and interest rates rise as david greenlaw james hamilton peter hooper and frederic mishkin observed earlier this year interest rate problems can arrive quickly and dramatically once the debt loads and current account deficits get sufficiently high despite its rising debt and confusing political mechanics the united states is still regarded as a relatively safe bet by credit market participants for now for all the complexities of interest rates and government debt issuance one abiding factor stands out when debt gets high enough or rises fast enough markets notice and interest rates rise early in the 2000s researchers published three studies marking something of a point of departure for empirical analysis of the effects of fiscal policy on interest rates as one paper noted in describing the difficulties he effects of fiscal policy on interest rates have proven difficult to pin down statistically the issues include the appropriate definition of deficits and debt whether deficits or debt should be the variable of interest the difficulty of distinguishing expected and unexpected changes and the potential endogeneity of many of the key explanatory variables the importance of these three studies was first that they took different approaches to estimating the relationship second rather than attempting to estimate the relationship between interest rates and current deficits or debt ratios these studies examined the effects of expected future deficits and debt levels on a forward looking measure of long term interest rates in effect aligning expected future fiscal policy with market based future interest rate effects third despite their different approaches the three studies produced similar results in 2003 thomas laubach considered the effects of projected fiscal policies on longer horizon interest rates this approach offers an advantage in that many factors affect interest rates especially in the short run so isolating the near term effects of fiscal policy can be difficult often however these near term effects are also transitory examples of temporary fiscal events include automatic fiscal policy stabilizers operating in a recession or a temporary surge of spending as occurred after the terrorist attacks of 9 11 resulting in a surge in homeland security spending levels of government debt expected to prevail several years into the future are presumably unlikely to be significantly affected by such transitory fiscal events using official government forecasts of budget deficits and debt and taking advantage of information embedded in the interest rate yield curve laubach examined whether a consistent relationship exists between government forecasts of future debt levels relative to gross domestic product gdp and future interest rates the analysis revealed a statistically significant relationship a one percentage point increase in the projected deficit to gdp ratio would be expected to raise long term interest rates by between 24 and 40 basis points and a one percentage point increase in the debt to gdp ratio would be expected to raise future interest rates by about four or five basis points to put this latter result into the current context the debt to gdp ratio for the united states from 2000 to 2009 averaged just under 38 percent and is projected to average nearly 73 percent from 2013 to 2023 laubach s results thus suggest long term interest rates will be between 1 4 percentage points and 1 8 percentage points higher than they would otherwise be because of the recent run up in publicly held debt in 2004 eric engen and r glenn hubbard examined a number of possible relationships between interest rates and government debt once again relying on congressional budget office cbo projections of deficits and debt they found an increase in the projected deficit equal to one percentage point of gdp raises long term interest rates by between 18 and 28 basis points they also found that a one percentage point increase in the debt to gdp ratio increased long term interest rates by between 2 8 and 3 3 basis points the work of william gale and peter orszag completes the trio of studies gale and orszag reported a statistically significant relationship between an increase in government debt of 1 percent of gdp sustained for five years and a rise in the real long term interest rate by nearly five basis points gale and orszag found a substantial 25 to 35 basis point effect arising from an increase in the projected unified budget deficit of 1 percent of gdp what do these results mean for future interest rates under president obama s fiscal policies in january of 2007 the cbo projected the federal government would run an annual surplus of about 1 percent of gdp over the five year period from 2013 to 2017 in may 2013 the cbo projected the government will run a deficit averaging 3 8 percent of gdp over those same years applying the gale and orszag results to the total 4 8 percentage point swing in the average projected deficit implies that if the economy were today at full employment long term interest rates would be between 1 2 percentage points and 1 7 percentage points higher as a result of president obama s projected budget deficits using different techniques and approaches three studies produced similar results this congruence does not guarantee the results are correct nor if correct that they will hold for the future as they did in the past nor that future research will not refine the results and bring additional elements into the analysis nevertheless the similarity in results across the three studies is noteworthy and assuring prospects for higher u s interest rates the ratio of publicly held federal government debt to gdp varied between 23 9 percent and 49 3 percent from 1960 through 2008 averaging about 36 3 percent by 2012 in president obama s first term that ratio had shot up to 72 5 percent while a higher interest rate on u s treasury securities would be expected from such an increase in the debt ratio under normal circumstances the initially relatively low debt ratio and the fact that the united states consistently runs sizable trade deficits may mitigate the extent of the increase greenlaw hamilton hooper and mishkin explored these issues in detail they constructed a data set using annual data on 20 advanced countries covering the period from 2000 to 2011 examining multiple countries simultaneously yields a far more robust data set but also implicitly imposes an assumption that national interest rates respond similarly across countries to a given change in their debt ratios years ago this assumption would cause concern as global financial markets were much less integrated and the prominence of the u s economy was unique in the global economy in 2013 financial markets are generally more integrated while the u s economy remains unique in size and consequence but less so and so any loss of u s focus may be a small price to pay for such an improvement in the scope of data a second important aspect of the study conducted by greenlaw and his co authors is that they explicitly included the possibility that a nation s current account deficit could influence the domestic interest rate as discussed above the ability of a country to import modest amounts of savings from abroad should normally blunt domestic interest rate effects from budget deficits and rising debt it is also true however that as the need for foreign savings to fund domestic budget deficits increases beyond a certain point foreign buyers of domestic government bonds are likely to raise their interest rate demands more quickly than would domestic buyers further foreign bond buyers are also likely to be more sensitive to changing economic and fiscal circumstances than are domestic purchasers of domestic government debt and so may require even higher interest rates than would domestic savers if domestic creditworthiness deteriorated suddenly in a simple linear relationship between debt and interest rates the authors found results very similar to those of the three studies described above if publicly held debt increases by 1 percent of gdp borrowing costs would increase by about 4 5 basis points if the country was running a balance in its international trade accounts but if the country was running an average current account deficit equal to 2 5 percent of gdp domestic interest rates would increase by 23 basis points for every point of increase in the debt to gdp ratio the essential result was reported as equation 1 interest rate t 0 045 debt gdp t 1 2 30 0 184 current account deficit gdp t 5 16 r2 0 69 these results raise the question as to why the current account plays such a significant role perhaps foreign investors already hold their desired portfolios of domestic assets and thus inducing prospective foreign bond buyers to finance an increase in domestic government debt requires a relatively large increase in interest rates alternatively perhaps foreign bond buyers observing an increase in domestic debt and the current account tend to worry more about the country s economy from a macroeconomic perspective and so demand a higher interest rate greenlaw and his co authors then examined the possibility of nonlinear relationships or tipping points between debt and interest rates the results of this second formulation turn out to have substantially greater predictive power than the simple relationship the results from the search for tipping points suggest a fairly complex relationship among the debt ratio the current account and domestic interest rates in a clear indication of a nonlinear relationship the results now display an insignificant relationship between the debt ratio and interest rates but a strong relationship between the square of the debt share and interest rates equation 2 interest rate t 0 0029 debt gdp t 1 0 30 0 245 current account deficit gdp t 4 29 0 000203 debt gdp t 1 2 4 81 0 00793 current account deficit gdp t 2 2 98 0 0063 debt gdp t 1 current account deficit gdp t 10 18 r2 0 82 to explore the richness of these results suppose the normal interest rate on 10 year treasury bonds would be 4 5 percent in the absence of federal government debt consistent with a market expectation of 2 percent inflation and a 2 5 percent real inflation adjusted rate of interest case 1 a country runs a balance in its trade accounts and its debt ratio is about the u s pre 2008 average of 40 percent roughly the modern historical u s average in this case domestic interest rates are estimated to be elevated by over 40 basis points to more than 4 9 percent or approximately the rate typically shown in long term forecasts this interest rate effect is also the same order of magnitude but slightly larger in absolute terms than the simple formulation result noted above case 2 a country runs a balance in its trade accounts but the initial debt ratio is 75 percent roughly the current u s average in this case domestic interest rates are estimated to be elevated by nearly 140 basis points to nearly 5 9 percent in short the recent increase in the u s debt ratio would be expected to increase interest rates by one full percentage point if one ignores the current account effect case 3 a country runs a current account deficit of 2 5 percent of gdp and an initial debt ratio of 40 percent in this case domestic interest rates are estimated to be elevated by over 50 basis points to more than 5 percent comparing this result with case 1 demonstrates that the effect of running a substantial current account deficit is to increase the interest rate effect of government borrowing this suggests the portfolio effect discussed above is in operation case 4 a country runs a current account deficit of 2 5 percent of gdp and an initial debt ratio of 75 percent in this case domestic interest rates are estimated to be elevated by nearly two full percentage points to 6 5 percent this case brings out the most negative effects of the interactions of the debt ratio and the current account if the country is importing substantial savings from abroad and has a relatively high debt ratio the effect on interest rates is about four times greater than would be the case with a lower more traditional u s debt ratio in summary the ability to borrow from abroad at moderate levels of debt likely reduces borrowing costs as expected but the advantages of being able to borrow abroad rapidly dissipate as foreign bond buyers respond more quickly by demanding higher interest rates as either the debt share or the current account deficit increases in light of these results the implications of the recent jump in u s government debt levels are particularly worrisome in 2008 federal debt as a share of gdp stood at 40 5 percent while the previous five year average ratio of the current account deficit to gdp stood at 5 4 percent equation 2 suggests that under normal market circumstances the u s government interest rate would then be nearly 80 basis points higher than it would be otherwise for example if the normal average interest rate on a 10 year treasury bond was 4 5 percent in the absence of government debt the normal rate in 2008 would have been 5 3 percent by 2012 the debt share had jumped to 72 5 percent while the current account deficit value had fallen to 3 6 percent in combination these factors would be expected to drive up the interest rate on the 10 year treasury bond by an additional 140 basis points so instead of a hypothetical zero debt interest rate of 4 5 percent or a 2008 interest rate of 5 3 percent the interest rate on the 10 year treasury bond would be expected to reach 6 7 percent as greenlaw and his co authors are careful to observe results such as these should not be used with the expectation of making precise forecasts this is perhaps especially true when extrapolating results to the united states from a data set containing countries large and small even so the analysis captures a clear feature of the data that problems can arrive quickly and dramatically once debt loads and current account deficits get sufficiently high the authors also note their results imply that a country can quickly move from the group without problems to the group that faces insurmountable problems if its debt rises significantly above 80 of gdp the ability to borrow from abroad at moderate levels of debt likely reduces borrowing costs as expected but the advantages of being able to borrow abroad rapidly dissipate as foreign bond buyers respond more quickly by demanding higher interest rates as either the debt share or the current account deficit increases a growing body of evidence suggests a rather common sense result small deficits and small increases in debt have similarly small effects on interest rates while large deficits and larger jumps in debt have especially large effects on interest rates and these results may be magnified if a country runs a sizable current account deficit rising debt and slowing economies the traditional crowding out argument is that rising government debt subtracts from the pool of savings available for private investment thus slowing the growth in labor productivity and wages higher interest rates associated with higher debt ratios are the market price signals confirming the crowding out mechanism is at work as noted above this simple argument may be weakened when a nation can import savings from abroad at least until the point that foreign investors demand for a nation s debt is essentially satisfied a growing body of evidence supports this conjecture as described by the heritage foundation s salim furth from whom this discussion substantially draws manmohan kumar and jaejoon woo found that high debt advanced economies grew an average 1 3 percentage points slower than low debt countries below 30 percent of gdp stephen cecchetti madhusudan mohanty and fabrizio zampolli used a different methodology and found that public debt in 18 advanced countries nearly doubled as a share of gdp over the past three decades they also found that this would have about the same deleterious effects on economic growth as kumar and woo suggest unfortunately the message of the relationship between relatively high debt ratios and slower economic growth has been clouded by revelations of substantial methodological flaws in perhaps the best known modern work in this area growth in a time of debt by carmen reinhart and kenneth rogoff subsequent work by reinhart and rogoff corrected the flaws and reaffirmed the fundamental conclusion regarding the dangers of excessive debt as noted by furth in the end all of corrections and critiques show that countries with debt above 90 percent of gdp grow on average 2 0 percent less per year than low debt countries and 1 0 percent less per year than countries with debt levels between 60 percent and 90 percent of gdp the facts are that the u s government debt ratio has risen dramatically in recent years is projected to remain highly elevated in the near term and is then projected to grow rapidly beginning late in the decade simple reason suggests why this increase in debt would constrain policymakers choices in terms of allocating future resources and theory suggests why it would be expected to increase interest rates substantially and why this increase in interest rates would likely put a severe damper on prospects for economic growth the empirical evidence strongly supports these latter conjectures the recent run up in government debt is likely to push real inflation adjusted interest rates far above historical experience once credit and financial markets fully recover the overall economy should likewise recover toward full employment in the years ahead and then grow at a moderate pace thereafter consistent with growth in the labor supply and advances in technology the upshot of the literature on debt interest rates and economic growth is that future economic growth is likely to be hampered markedly by recent and projected increases in government debt the upshot of the literature on debt interest rates and economic growth is that future economic growth is likely to be hampered by recent and projected increases in government debt if the effects of high debt are so dire why are interest rates so low the literature accords with basic theory in suggesting a high and rapidly rising debt ratio should increase interest rates and weaken the economy yet interest rates remain near historic lows and the economy while disappointing is growing is this time truly different or are other factors in play delaying the inevitable one explanation for the u s experience may be that the expected relationship between government debt and interest rates truly has broken down perhaps government debt and national saving no longer matter to domestic investment levels and interest rates far more likely the traditional relationship has been temporarily superseded by other forces the federal reserve has embarked on a most extraordinary policy of purchasing 85 billion a month in long term government and agency bonds with the specific intent of pushing down long term interest rates perhaps the fed is having a substantial effect sufficient to push down long term interest rates sufficient even to thwart the upward interest rate pressures from rising debt another explanation could be the persistent high level of uncertainty in global financial markets arising first from the financial crisis late in the last decade and now continuing through the travails of the euro bloc these developments have heightened the safe haven aspect of certain countries such as the united states and germany which despite low returns and their own economic troubles nevertheless lure vast sums of foreign capital from riskier locales thus pushing down u s and german interest rates while far from ideal the u s is perhaps nevertheless benefitting from being the least dirty shirt in the laundry if this safe haven theory or the federal reserve based theory applies it means the traditional debt to interest rate effect has not been negated but only temporarily suspended it also means interest rates will rise substantially when and as the safe haven and federal revenue effects dissipate and then will continue to rise substantially as the traditional debt to interest rate effect takes hold in light of the substantial increase in the u s debt share a nation at risk a clock ticking the u s economy is recovering from the great global recession but president obama s massive deficits soaring debt and tepid support for reforms to render america s entitlement programs affordable pose a grave economic threat the threat is not theoretical it is not suppositional the threat is real and must be faced squarely and soon the simple fact is that under current policy america is on the verge of becoming a country in decline economically stagnant and permanently debt bound economic forecasts beyond the next few quarters whether by government or private forecasters tend to show the economy moving toward normal levels of production and employment over some reasonable period with interest rates likewise returning to normal levels however recent history both in the u s and abroad underscores how quickly events can turn when market psychology is upended rather than increasing steadily interest rates are more likely to surge in stages hammering the economy anew each time nor is the future likely to unfold undisturbed in addition to geopolitical tensions europe has yet to resolve its internal monetary contradictions surrounding the euro while european leaders have masterfully danced from crisis to crisis they have yet to settle on policies rendering the euro a viable currency or their economies strong viable competitors internationally at home perhaps the federal reserve has badly misjudged as it aggressively pursues its policy of quantitative easing through extraordinary measures and will have to raise interest rates quickly to prevent inflation or perhaps the recent extended period of high unemployment has degraded worker skills in ways only now implied or perhaps business investment in new facilities or research and development has been inadequate to sustain normal growth rates the point is not that any or all of these possibilities are likely but that they and others may transpire and thanks to the rapid increase in u s government debt the federal government is poorly positioned to respond and the u s economy is poorly positioned to overcome their effects the current period of low interest rates despite rising debt is beguiling policymakers and the nation alike about the risks stemming from america s irresponsible fiscal policy lulling them into complacency not merely the calm before the storm economic conditions brought about by developments abroad and monetary policy at home have effectively anesthetized financial markets against the effects of u s fiscal profligacy the anesthesia however will prove temporary interest rates will almost certainly rise past the normal levels now forecast the economy will suffer all largely due to the budget deficits now being incurred and to the inaction so far to address the even greater entitlement driven deficits in the years immediately ahead america s decline is far from inevitable there is still time for a substantial and effective course correction congress working with president obama can begin to right the ship quickly with six well vetted bipartisan proposals starting the process of reforming social security and medicare so they better serve their constituencies today while remaining affordable tomorrow enacting all six proposals however would still leave the task only partly completed to finish the job congress and the president will need a more comprehensive approach such as is laid out in the heritage foundation s saving the american dream plan there is still time but not much to ensure america s prosperity for the next generation is norman

would not only oppose the defense bill itself if manchin s provisions are put in they will also oppose the rule that allows the bill that comes to the floor since republicans almost never vote for rules put forward by democrats even if they support the underlying bill the maneuver may only require a few defectors to succeed house armed services chairman adam smith d wash told the hill on tuesday that he doesn t think the policies which are aimed at speeding up the approval process for energy projects have the votes to succeed it does not appear to me that there s the votes to sustain that smith told the hill if it was up to me at this point it would not be in but it s not up to me but it seems to me like there s not the support for it but he said it s up to leadership to decide whether to include them and that a final decision hadn t yet been made congressional progressive caucus chair pramila jayapal d wash indicated she believes the progressive effort would be enough to kill the permitting reform s chances in the ndaa typically republicans don t vote for the rule some of them might but i can t imagine there would be enough to counter the number of progressives that

mike lillis and ellen mitchell california gov gavin newsom d on monday evening unveiled a proposal that would penalize oil companies for excessive profits in the golden state newsom introduced the price gouging penalty alongside state sen nancy skinner d in a move they said would deter excessive price increases and keep money in californians pockets california s price gouging penalty is simple either big oil reins in the profits and prices or they ll pay a penalty newsom said in a statement how we got here the proposal comes as california s legislature kicks off a special session initiated by the governor to address the issue of price gouging california which also has among the highest gas taxes in the country saw prices hit a record high of 6 44 per gallon in mid june according to aaa prices at the pump on tuesday were about 4 72 per gallon significantly higher than the national average of 3 38 no one can deny that california s gas prices were outrageously high compared to other states and those high prices hurt california consumers and businesses skinner said in a statement if approved by state lawmakers the proposal would make it illegal for companies to charge excessive prices and excessive refiner margins would be punishable by a civil penalty from the california energy commission so what does that mean the definition of excessive including the maximum margin and penalty amounts would be determined through the legislative process according to the proposal any penalties collected would go to a price gouging penalty fund that would be redistributed to californians the proposal also aims to improve transparency and oversight of the oil industry by the state and expand the abilities of the california energy commission and the california department of

accelerated the transition and will contribute to it increasing nearly twofold in the next five years between now and 2027 the iea projects global renewable energy capacity will increase by about 2 400 gigawatts equivalent to china s current capacity although nations were already trending toward renewable adoption the expected growth is 30 percent above what the iea was projecting a year ago what changed the invasion of ukraine is set to be a particular accelerant for the transition in europe the capacity added in european nations from 2022 to 2027 will be double that of the expansion in the previous five years according to the iea elsewhere the three top carbon emitters china the u s and india are also set to drive expansion of renewables more than was projected a year ago in china s

valuable than all banks listed on the ngx combined the share spike which is also largely driven by mtn nigeria s impressive nine months ended september 30 2022 mtn s share price has risen 51 38 per cent in the last year while airtel valued at over n5 trillion is also more valuable than all the financial services firms mtn nigeria is more significant as the company s financials represent income generated from nigeria alone excluding other african countries apart from fundamentals nigerian banks also have billions in outstanding trading shares with much higher liquidity when compared to telecommunication companies for example zenith bank with about 31 396 493 786 outstanding shares compared to mtn nigeria s 20 354 513 050 as of the end of november 30 2022 has a market capitalisation

november capital market analyst mr rotimi fakeyejo explained that one per cent gain or decline in airtel africa dangote cement and mtn nigeria tend to impart on capital market movement in a day he added that the fundamentals of both companies attracted foreign investors in taking position on his part the vice president of highcap securities mr david adnori explained that foreign investors participation in the trading of dangote cement mtn nigeria and airtel africa stocks drive price appreciation he added that impressive corporate earnings and dividend pay out to shareholders contributed to these companies price appreciation according to him the three companies are the largest companies by market capitalisation on the ngx if these companies record one per cent gain it will affect the direction of the stock market the financial results of these companies have been impressive despite foreign and domestic challenges despite reporting high operating cost the likes of mtn and airtel africa have maintained robust fundamentals we have seen dangote cement dropping in nine months ended september 30 2022 profit before tax over operating expenses influenced by inflation however dangote cement remains one of the top three companies on the exchange in terms of market capitalisation also ceo of wyoming capital and partners mr tajudeen olayinka said investors reacted towards low prices of some fundamental stocks on the exchange according to him prices had become too low to resist and this happened because of prolonged repricing of securities across markets and instruments pushing down stock prices below the levels they should ordinarily be it also demonstrates improved earning capacities of some listed companies as they continue to adjust to the variability of costs and cost pressures in the short run in order to stay afloat another factor is the usual positioning and repositioning for year end rally by investors as some companies begin to show strong earnings prospects ahead of full year results
when russia invaded ukraine in february of this year the international community slapped a raft of sanctions on the invading nation they froze the assets of wealthy and powerful russian citizens and restricted their ability to travel they restricted the sale of russian raw materials and energy and worked to prevent russia from getting its hands on various kinds of defense and information technologies and they imposed financial sanctions on russian banks and curtailed russia s access to foreign capital and financial markets many corporations followed up on these government imposed sanctions with so calledself sanctioning whereby companies restricted or halted commercial relations with russia and russian firms the effect on paper appeared to be a set of measures that struck at the heart of russia s economy forecasts in the spring of this year predicted a drop in gdp of at least 7 8 and possibly as much as11 for 2022 prices were expected to rise by20 25 foreign direct investment by corporations was forecast to fall as much as25 28 t over the year but russia has not been brought to its knees far from it forecasters say russian gdp for 2022 will likely fall but only about3 3 3 4 inflation meanwhile will likely end the year at roughly12 bad but not close to as painful as predicted and foreign direct investment estimates say it will fall by a mere 1 meanwhile the war in ukrainegrinds on strong points so what went wrong a report from bruegel a brussels based economic think tank points to a number of flaws in the sanctions regime and several strong points in the russian defenses the most effective defense has been mounted by the central bank of russia which designed and executed the fortress russia policy aimed at protecting the russian financial system the system did take a big hit early on as sanctions on russia s central bank assets were much stronger than expected reducing its bank reserves by 40 however thanks to competent management the system recovered and the bank continues to hold large amounts of foreign currency as much as 300 billion for potential intervention in the currency and debt markets and even though russian banks lost access to the swift financial transfer system they still seem able to get the cash they need to operate as various other channels continue to enable russian banks to interact with the outside world in other words despite some big shocks the central bank has kept russia s financial system intact and prevented a collapse of the wider russian economy many of the sanctions were aimed at inhibiting parts of the russian economy s ability to do business russia s economy is less reliant on imports than most other large advanced economies and emerging markets the report notes but some sectors are highly exposed especially the manufacturing of transportation equipment chemicals food products and it services sanctions did a good job initially of restricting russian access to key imports such as parts for manufacturing still despite the initial shock russia pivoted quickly and began importing more goods from nations like china belarus and turkey which are not participating in the sanctions regime in short when it comes to imports of key materials russia has been shut out of a number of markets but it has since found new markets to meet many of its needs sanctions on russian exports have been even less successful many countries have stopped buying certain goods from russia but the flow of key commodities continues largely unabated and roaring inflation has only helped russia in this area bruegel estimates that rather than falling russia s export income has risen by more than 40 to roughly 120 billion year to date because of higher prices and is likely to stay that high through the end of the year the largest contribution to this comes from natural gas which is still in high demand throughout europe and which unlike coal oil and other petroleum products has not been sanctioned this shrinkage in imports and swelling of exports means that russia s trade balance looks extremely healthy the surplus for january september stood at 198 4 billion roughly 120 billion higher than for the same period in 2021 and more than double the previous record in 2008 bruegel reckons the rude health of russia s balance of payments will persist into 2023 as commodity prices are likely to remain high despite the eu embargo on crude oil and petroleum products and despite russia s decision to cut natural gas flows to europe bruegel estimates a surplus of around 100 billion in 2023 a substantial drop compared to 2022 but not too shabby for a sanctioned state russia s currency appears to be in equally good shape when sanctions were first imposed the ruble dropped from about 70 75 to the dollar to close to 140 to the dollar by april however the exchange rate had returned to below pre invasion levels today the ruble fluctuates at about 60 rubles to the dollar we have reported extensively on the reasons why the ruble has bounced back so impressively well and you can read that reporting here but the tldr is that capital controls combined with falling trading volumes and the dynamics of the current account have all helped prop the ruble up under the skin reading all of this you could be forgiven for thinking that the coalition of nations sanctioning russia are on a fool s errand and that russia is simply too big to fail bruegel contends that this is not so that the sanctions are hurting russia and that rosy statistics are concealing some serious damage to the russian economy the ruble s strength is a fine example of this to the casual observer the ruble has recovered and is in good health in fact the ruble is critically weak it has been propped up by capital controls that make it difficult to sell rubles and which force russian companies to buy the currency against their will or better judgment as bruegel puts it the current exchange rate is not a reflection of the value of the russian economy s fundamentals rather it is a testament to the fact that financial sanctions are isolating the ruble internationally russia s pivot to new markets for key imports was speedy and effective but it will not be enough to rescue some important parts of russia s economy bruegel says the self sanctioning by corporations wishing to distance themselves from russia has been particularly damaging in sectors including auto production and transportation the withdrawal of foreign car manufacturers and the shortage of inputs has hit passenger car production extremely hard with a 95 decline in may 2022 compared to the previous year air transportation has also collapsed following the cancellation of aircraft leases and maintenance contracts and the closure of several countries airspaces to russian planes exports of oil and gas look like a strong point but they are threatened in the medium to long term bruegel says canada the united states and australia have banned all imports of russian oil while the united kingdom has announced a phase down to zero by the end of the year the european union which has been highly dependent on russian oil imports in the past agreed at the end of may to stop seaborne imports of russian oil by year end by the start of 2023 more than 90 of russia s previous oil exports to the eu will be banned it s true that russia has found new markets for its oil but it is selling that oil at a significant discount and it will likely have to continue to do so if the most lucrative markets remain closed to it bruegel notes that there is one way the sanctions regime could be expanded to significantly undermine russian oil exports via insurance more than 90 of the world s oil tankers are insured by the international group of p i clubs a london based association of insurers the eu and the uk recently introduced a ban on insurance for ships carrying russian oil from the start of next year which would have jacked up insurance costs for russia and had a meaningful impact on exports the u s however diluted this measure and took the sting out of its tail when it comes to natural gas no sanctions have been imposed on russia instead bruegel says russia has weaponized its gas supply blackmailing european countries by progressively cutting exports to europe now down to around 20 of their 2021 levels this will hurt russia in the long run because roughly 60 of russia s gas exports go to the eu and uk russia will need to close a sizable portion of its gas export infrastructure including production sites at significant cost export revenues from gas will dry up and attempts to diversify export routes by building new liquified natural gas export capacity will be hindered by a lack of access to western technology redevelopment will take years in other words the sanctions have teeth but for russia to feel the bite coalition nations will need to sink those teeth in deeper and hang on for the long term bruegel says they need to find unity on effective measures such as the oil insurance ban mentioned above and to restrict oil and gas shipments further the combination of a large and likely persistent fall in russian imports and the permanent decoupling of european economies from russian energy supplies will have significant negative consequences for the russian economy in the medium to long run the report says russia may find ways to mitigate some sanctions related effects but the overall loss in economic activity will likely be permanent in the short term however russia s economy has not been inhibited to the point where it is finding it impossible to prosecute the war in ukraine given the ultimate aim of sanctions is to stop that war the eu and other coalition nations as bruegel puts it

when russia invaded ukraine in february of this year the international community slapped a raft of sanctions on the invading nation they froze the assets of wealthy and powerful russian citizens and restricted their ability to travel they restricted the sale of russian raw materials and energy and worked to prevent russia from getting its hands on various kinds of defense and information technologies and they imposed financial sanctions on russian banks and curtailed russia s access to foreign capital and financial markets many corporations followed up on these government imposed sanctions with so calledself sanctioning whereby companies restricted or halted commercial relations with russia and russian firms the effect on paper appeared to be a set of measures that struck at the heart of russia s economy forecasts in the spring of this year predicted a drop in gdp of at least 7 8 and possibly as much as11 for 2022 prices were expected to rise by20 25 foreign direct investment by corporations was forecast to fall as much as25 28 t over the year but russia has not been brought to its knees far from it forecasters say russian gdp for 2022 will likely fall but only about3 3 3 4 inflation meanwhile will likely end the year at roughly12 bad but not close to as painful as predicted and foreign direct investment estimates say it will fall by a mere 1 meanwhile the war in ukrainegrinds on strong points so what went wrong a report from bruegel a brussels based economic think tank points to a number of flaws in the sanctions regime and several strong points in the russian defenses the most effective defense has been mounted by the central bank of russia which designed and executed the fortress russia policy aimed at protecting the russian financial system the system did take a big hit early on as sanctions on russia s central bank assets were much stronger than expected reducing its bank reserves by 40 however thanks to competent management the system recovered and the bank continues to hold large amounts of foreign currency as much as 300 billion for potential intervention in the currency and debt markets and even though russian banks lost access to the swift financial transfer system they still seem able to get the cash they need to operate as various other channels continue to enable russian banks to interact with the outside world in other words despite some big shocks the central bank has kept russia s financial system intact and prevented a collapse of the wider russian economy many of the sanctions were aimed at inhibiting parts of the russian economy s ability to do business russia s economy is less reliant on imports than most other large advanced economies and emerging markets the report notes but some sectors are highly exposed especially the manufacturing of transportation equipment chemicals food products and it services sanctions did a good job initially of restricting russian access to key imports such as parts for manufacturing still despite the initial shock russia pivoted quickly and began importing more goods from nations like china belarus and turkey which are not participating in the sanctions regime in short when it comes to imports of key materials russia has been shut out of a number of markets but it has since found new markets to meet many of its needs sanctions on russian exports have been even less successful many countries have stopped buying certain goods from russia but the flow of key commodities continues largely unabated and roaring inflation has only helped russia in this area bruegel estimates that rather than falling russia s export income has risen by more than 40 to roughly 120 billion year to date because of higher prices and is likely to stay that high through the end of the year the largest contribution to this comes from natural gas which is still in high demand throughout europe and which unlike coal oil and other petroleum products has not been sanctioned this shrinkage in imports and swelling of exports means that russia s trade balance looks extremely healthy the surplus for january september stood at 198 4 billion roughly 120 billion higher than for the same period in 2021 and more than double the previous record in 2008 bruegel reckons the rude health of russia s balance of payments will persist into 2023 as commodity prices are likely to remain high despite the eu embargo on crude oil and petroleum products and despite russia s decision to cut natural gas flows to europe bruegel estimates a surplus of around 100 billion in 2023 a substantial drop compared to 2022 but not too shabby for a sanctioned state russia s currency appears to be in equally good shape when sanctions were first imposed the ruble dropped from about 70 75 to the dollar to close to 140 to the dollar by april however the exchange rate had returned to below pre invasion levels today the ruble fluctuates at about 60 rubles to the dollar we have reported extensively on the reasons why the ruble has bounced back so impressively well and you can read that reporting here but the tldr is that capital controls combined with falling trading volumes and the dynamics of the current account have all helped prop the ruble up under the skin reading all of this you could be forgiven for thinking that the coalition of nations sanctioning russia are on a fool s errand and that russia is simply too big to fail bruegel contends that this is not so that the sanctions are hurting russia and that rosy statistics are concealing some serious damage to the russian economy the ruble s strength is a fine example of this to the casual observer the ruble has recovered and is in good health in fact the ruble is critically weak it has been propped up by capital controls that make it difficult to sell rubles and which force russian companies to buy the currency against their will or better judgment as bruegel puts it the current exchange rate is not a reflection of the value of the russian economy s fundamentals rather it is a testament to the fact that financial sanctions are isolating the ruble internationally russia s pivot to new markets for key imports was speedy and effective but it will not be enough to rescue some important parts of russia s economy bruegel says the self sanctioning by corporations wishing to distance themselves from russia has been particularly damaging in sectors including auto production and transportation the withdrawal of foreign car manufacturers and the shortage of inputs has hit passenger car production extremely hard with a 95 decline in may 2022 compared to the previous year air transportation has also collapsed following the cancellation of aircraft leases and maintenance contracts and the closure of several countries airspaces to russian planes exports of oil and gas look like a strong point but they are threatened in the medium to long term bruegel says canada the united states and australia have banned all imports of russian oil while the united kingdom has announced a phase down to zero by the end of the year the european union which has been highly dependent on russian oil imports in the past agreed at the end of may to stop seaborne imports of russian oil by year end by the start of 2023 more than 90 of russia s previous oil exports to the eu will be banned it s true that russia has found new markets for its oil but it is selling that oil at a significant discount and it will likely have to continue to do so if the most lucrative markets remain closed to it bruegel notes that there is one way the sanctions regime could be expanded to significantly undermine russian oil exports via insurance more than 90 of the world s oil tankers are insured by the international group of p i clubs a london based association of insurers the eu and the uk recently introduced a ban on insurance for ships carrying russian oil from the start of next year which would have jacked up insurance costs
