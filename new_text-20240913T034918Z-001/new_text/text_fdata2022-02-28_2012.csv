dan fine columnist thirty years ago in moscow the soviet union crumbled and everyone watched on cnn one question was still undecided this was what would happen to the near abroad russians who were now separated from russia in independent republics president boris yeltsin promised that they would have the russian republic or federation to look after their interests language and culture president vladimir putin said nothing about this but rather denounced the communist soviet union as having abandoned russia ukraine s existence was part of that end of the soviet union which putin declares was a grave mistake i was in moscow pursuing a lease to the second largest copper deposit in the world and at the celebration of the birth of the russian federation as the prime power in the cis or community of independent states the ruling ukraine communist party vanished as a remnant of the soviet union a young missile commander at my side over vodka on the roof of a state skyscraper the tallest building pointed to the west and told me no russian would ever look in that direction and see nato so russia is in ukraine in a special military operation that seeks to correct that mistake in which the near abroad are no longer near nor abroad but in russia but is there more as most of the tv media proclaim is there in the sanctions of the united states a deterrent against more or a roll back of russia president joe biden s sanctions failed to mount the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication swift against russia because the swift board opposed it swift is a belgian entity that executes fiscal transactions between banks around the world if swift had been included as a sanction russia s financial participation in the world would have been eliminated this no doubt would allow china to create a chinese russian swift which would compete with the original swift as a north atlantic entity this fulfills the long term china russia alliance s basic strategic objective eliminate the united states as a single world rule making power president biden will be out of office when russia and china are making international rules his sanctions will work only for poland as the front line of nato however will ukraine resist as a people or will it be something similar to kazakhstan this will be a test of slavic blood against slavic blood another weakness in the new u s sanctions is in oil through opec russia by lowering its export quota the impact of the sanctions in oil and natural gas is primarily in the financial markets in commodities permian basin wti is sustained at high prices until a new supply source appears and dissolves the speculation on supply shortage this source is iran with the united states aggressively pushing for a second nuclear treaty for which it will end export sanctions against iran within 16 months iranian oil will begin to challenge the permian basin production and return wti crude to a high 50 dollar price range and china with the historic connection of russia will have deepened a present day special relation to iran having assured its survival against u s sanctions against the exports of its oil dr daniel fine is an independent analyst and a contributor to the farmington daily times coverage of events affecting state national and world oil markets
the leak of 30 000 bank accounts belonging to credit suisse has revealed the enormous wealth of dictators criminals officials and business tycoons involved in torture drug trafficking money laundering corruption and other serious crimes it confirms the financial parasitism fraud and illegality that permeates the ruling elite in every capitalist country the revelations cover only a small proportion of the bank s 1 5 million private clients and includes personal shared and corporate bank accounts worth 108 billion nearly 200 accounts are worth more than 108 million with a dozen or more worth billions some were opened in the 1940s but more than two thirds were opened after 2000 many have since closed the investigation known as suisse secrets began with a leak by an anonymous whistleblower to the german newspaper s√ºddeutsche zeitung and was coordinated with the organized crime and corruption reporting project occrp it involved analyses by 160 journalists from media organisations around the world including the guardian le monde ndr the miami herald and the new york times suisse secrets shows that the bank allowed people to open accounts even after they had been convicted of serious crimes and failed to investigate or even ask about the source of many other clients wealth it alleges that the bank knowingly managed hundreds of millions of dollars for suspected war criminals corrupt autocrats and drug dealers credit suisse denied this saying it strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank s purported business practices the world s best known banks are little more than machines for laundering the ill gotten gains of the filthy rich and protecting their owners from tax demands or accountability so they can salt their loot away for future use they are accomplices to the rampant criminality of a parasitic ruling class that plunders and exploits the world s inhabitants to the tune of trillions of dollars a year while dodging taxes variously estimated at between 400 billion and 800 billion a year on their income and wealth according to the guardian the bank s clients included a human trafficker in the philippines the former chair of the hong kong stock exchange who was jailed for bribery a billionaire who ordered the murder of his lebanese pop star girlfriend executives who helped themselves to the revenues of venezuela s state owned oil company an italian accused of laundering funds for the infamous ndrangheta criminal group corrupt politicians and their families around the world including in egypt and ukraine and a vatican owned investment company currently involved in a criminal tribunal over an allegedly fraudulent 350 million investment in a london property others include the sons of an azerbaijani strongman who deposited millions of laundered dollars from shell companies and key figures from central asia s elites including oligarchs who made their wealth from natural resource extraction ministers and other top officials some of whom have been convicted of massive corruption as well as the children of two former presidents kazakhstan s nursultan nazarbayev and uzbekistan s islam karimov people named in the investigation include helen rivilla a lawyer convicted in 1992 for helping to launder money for former philippine dictator ferdinand marcos and his wife imelda who creamed off 10 billion during the decades of his presidency king abdullah of jordan had six swiss accounts including one that held more than 224 million in 2015 while his wife queen rania held more than 40 million in an account in 2013 all of which were closed in 2015 and 2016 saad kheir who headed jordan s intelligence agency from 2000 to 2005 that worked with the us on covert operations and counterterrorism operations interrogating terrorism suspects he opened an account in 2003 that would hold 21 6 million before his death in 2009 close relatives of omar suleiman the long time head of egyptian dictator hosni mubarak s intelligence services that served as the cia s regional bureau opened a joint account in 2003 that mushroomed to 52 million suleiman died in 2012 but the account wasn t closed until 2016 mubarak s sons gamal and alaa held six accounts including a joint account that ballooned to about 196 million in 2003 while their fathers in law and other businessmen linked to the mubarak family had accounts worth millions of dollars pavlo lazarenko the thoroughly corrupt prime minister of ukraine between 1997 and 1998 is believed by transparency international to have siphoned off 200 million from the public purse demonstrating that ukrainian politicians were no less corrupt than their russian counterparts one of his accounts was later valued at almost 8 million in 2000 lazarenko pleaded guilty to money laundering in switzerland and was sentenced in 2006 to nine years in the us for bribery and corruption stephan sederholm a swedish computer technician was allowed to open an account in 2008 that was closed in 2013 after he was sentenced for life for human trafficking in the philippines in 2011 eduard seidel a german who headed siemens s operations in nigeria and was convicted of industrial scale bribery of corrupt politicians in 2008 his accounts were left open for several years with one holding 54 million after he had left siemens credit suisse has long been known for providing services for the sons of nigeria s brutal dictator sani abacha believed to have looted as much as 5 billion from the country in just six years credit suisse switzerland s second largest bank manages more than 1 6 trillion in assets and employs almost 50 000 staff including 3 500 relationship managers who recruit and serve the super rich across the world its employees are rewarded with bonuses linked to how much net new money they bring in the largest accounts are kept so secret that only a few senior executives know who owns them the occrp investigation confirms that the bank s activities are shielded by the country s notorious banking secrecy laws that have long made switzerland a safe haven for kleptocrats illicit wealth article 47 of the swiss banking laws effectively silences insiders or journalists trying to expose criminality to the extent that the swiss media group tamedia was unable to take part in the credit suisse investigation for fear of criminal prosecution the bank has been beset by numerous scandals a leaked 2017 report by finma the swiss financial regulator revealed a culture where senior managers were prepared to whitewash and turn a blind eye to compliance failures when a star banker defrauded lucrative clients the bank was involved in the collapse of greensill capital the supply chain finance corporation and the us hedge fund archegos capital in 2019 eight bank staff pleaded guilty to charges of money laundering and defrauding us and uk investors in loans to mozambique resulting in 475 million fines for the bank and 200 million in debt forgiveness to mozambique the bank is currently facing trial in switzerland s federal criminal court over enabling bulgarian cocaine smugglers to launder 146 million suisse secrets follows numerous other scandals in the wider banking sector including the 2008 09 crash precipitated by the criminality of leading financial institutions for which no top executives were ever sanctioned it comes after a chain of international consortium of investigative journalists icij expos√©s the luxleaks in 2014 panama papers in 2016 the paradise papers in 2017 and the pandora papers in 2021 these revealed the colossal extent of tax evasion and money laundering services provided by the world s most well known financial services companies lawyers registration agents and lobbyists via secretive trusts and off shore tax havens reports of financial criminality have become so routine that a day later suisse secrets was old news they demonstrate that it is impossible to clean out the augean filth of the global political economic and financial system like the icij s previous expos√©s the leaked accounts belong to the bank s international clients mostly in the middle and low income countries rather than in the us and europe us president joe biden has said he is committed to fighting corruption as a core national security interest which is another way of saying that allegations of corruption will be used like fighting terror to justify political and economic intervention around the world particularly in central asia in pursuit of washington s imperialist interests switzerland too is in the frame with demands from three of the largest groups in the european parliament and from the us seeking to bolster the position of new york as the world s premier financial centre for switzerland to be placed on the list of high risk countries for money laundering and financial crime the author of the suisse secrets investigation the occrp a consortium of ngos media organisations and journalists operating in eastern europe the caucasus central asia and central america is funded by among others the united states agency for international development the us

nearly half of biden s 500m free covid tests still unclaimed file youngstown city health department worker faith terreri grabs two at home covid 19 test kits to be handed out during a distribution event dec 30 2021 in youngstown ohio nearly half the 500 million free covid 19 tests the biden administration recently made available to americans still have not been claimed as virus cases plummet and people feel less urgency to test ap photo david dermer file washington ap nearly half of the 500 million free covid 19 tests the biden administration recently made available to the public still have not been claimed as virus cases plummet and people feel less urgency to test wild demand swings have been a subplot in the pandemic from vaccines to hand sanitizer along with tests on the first day of the white house test giveaway in january covidtests gov received over 45 million orders now officials say fewer than 100 000 orders a day are coming in for the packages of four free rapid tests per household delivered by the u s postal service still the white house sees the program as a step toward a deeper yet more elastic testing infrastructure that will accommodate demand surges and remain on standby when cases wane we totally intend to sustain this market dr tom inglesby testing adviser to the covid 19 response team told the associated press we know the market is volatile and will come up and down with surges in variants the white house says americans have placed 68 million orders for packages of tests which leaves about 46 of the stock of tests still available to be ordered testing will become more important with mask requirements now easing say some independent experts if infection control is still our priority testing is central said dr leana wen a former baltimore health commissioner and commentator on the pandemic four tests per household for one family will only last you one time there should be enough tests for families to test twice a week inglesby maintains that the pieces are falling into place to accommodate that private insurers are now required to cover eight free rapid tests per person per month medicare coverage will start in the spring the administration has also been making free at home tests available through libraries clinics and other community venues capacity for the more accurate pcr tests performed by labs has been built up the white house recently put out a request to industry for ideas on how to sustain and expand domestic testing for the rest of this year wen says people still need a guide for when to test and how often right now it is still unclear she said president joe biden s pivot to testing came under duress as the omicron variant gained force just before christmas tests were frustratingly hard to come by and expensive the white house is sensitive to criticism that help may have come too late there is no question some people found out they were positive from taking one of these tests and were able to keep other people from getting infected said tim manning supply coordinator for the covid 19 response team around mid december with omicron projections grimmer by the day white house officials began discussing how to make free tests available for anyone who wanted one but if the government started siphoning up tests on the market that would just make the shortage worse a critical thing to us was that anything we did had to be done in a way did not create a shortage at retail to the general public manning said the white house enlisted the pentagon and parts of the health and human services department that had worked on the trump administration s vaccine development effort to distribute vaccines logistics experts scoured the globe for available tests the postal service was designated to take the orders and deliver them that part proved to be a good call said hana schank an expert on government technology projects with the new america think tank the postal service already had a database of every address in the land and the means to deliver at the federal level the only people who have a database connected to a fulfillment engine would be the post office she said the project took less than a month to get ready manning said we said this is not online retail he said this is emergency response so we have go to as fast as possible to make sure it wasn t just the tech savvy who would end up getting free tests the administration targeted a share of deliveries to people in low income areas the white house worked with service organizations to get the word out we prioritized the processing of orders to the highest social vulnerability zip codes in the country testing adviser inglesby said one of the service groups was the national association of community health workers whose members help people navigate the health care system executive director denise smith said the group was able to use its website to link more than 630 000 people to covidtests gov overall about 20 to 25 of the tests have gone to people in distressed areas officials said now that demand is way down it s unclear what will happen to the white house giveaway program allowing repeat orders is one possibility smith says groups like hers should get any surplus we know where the people are she said although the program is still in its infancy analyst lindsey dawson of the kaiser family foundation believes its legacy may lie in familiarizing more people with testing it may get someone comfortable with utilizing the tests thinking about how they might use testing in their lives she said savita sharaf a retiree from the maryland suburbs outside the nation s capital said she ordered her free tests around the middle of january and got them in early february she s tried to conserve them for added peace of mind in the stores she couldn t find tests for less than 25 i m so relieved because i can immediately test myself sharaf said if we had a high vaccination rate it

additionally the u s and european allies have also taken action against russia s central bank effectively freezing the country s foreign reserves the sanctions in financial markets had some investors and traders looking for potential disruptions outside of russian markets some russian banks being removed from swift energy transactions exempt and the freezing of the russian central bank s access to its foreign currency reserves held in the west clearly increases economic tail risk said dennis debusschere of 22v research however debusschere pointed out that russia can still sell oil and said there could be loop holes in russia s frozen assets which might limit the disaster in markets for a few days meanwhile russian military vehicles entered ukraine s second largest city kharkiv with reports of fighting taking place and residents being warned to stay in shelters russian president vladimir putin put his country s nuclear deterrence forces on high alert sunday amid a growing global backlash against the invasion monday marks the final day of trading for february and even with a strong rally at the end of last week the three major u s averages all fell more than 3 for the month the dow was the worst performer falling 3 5 for its worst month since november stocks particularly the tech heavy nasdaq were already in a downturn before the invasion of ukraine the conflict comes on top of our base case which is that we were already potentially headed for a bear market due to valuations rising rates and inflation and the lack of a fed put said phillip toews ceo of toews asset management now is not a great outlook for the markets despite some short term rallies like we saw last week toews added on the commodities front u s west texas intermediate wti crude futures rose about 5 to around 95 91 per barrel on monday the april brent crude futures contract rose more than 3 to 101 10 per barrel natural gas futures dipped slightly oil stocks were mixed despite the rise in commodities prices the london traded shares of bp and shell fell sharply after the companies announced they would sever ties with russian energy firms occidental petroleum s stock surged nearly 13 solar energy stocks jumped with enphase energy rising more than 8 as the conflict made some policymakers more worried about the reliance on fossil fuels russia closed its stock exchange on monday but

now that russian president vladimir putin has launched a full scale invasion of ukraine we must consider the economic and financial consequences of this massive historic development the ukraine war is not just another minor globally inconsequential conflict of the kind seen in recent decades this is a major escalation of cold war ii in which four powers china russia iran and north korea are increasingly challenging the long global dominance of the united states and the western led international order that it created after world war ii the risk now is that markets and political analysts will underestimate the implications of this global regime shift by the close of the market on february 24 the day of the invasion us stock markets had risen in the hope that the war would slow down rate hikes by the us federal reserve yet in terms of the broader economy a global stagflationary recession is now highly likely analysts are asking themselves if the fed and other major central banks can achieve a soft landing from this crisis and its fallout don t count on it the war in ukraine will trigger a massive negative supply shock to the global economy reducing growth and further increasing inflation at a time when inflation expectations are already becoming unanchored the short term financial market impact of the war is already foreseeable in the face of a massive risk off stagflationary shock global equities may move from the current correction range 10 into bear market territory 20 or more safe government bond yields will fall for a while and then rise after inflation becomes unmoored oil and natural gas prices will spike further to well above 100 per barrel as will many other commodity prices as both russia and ukraine are major exporters of raw materials and food safe haven currencies such as the swiss franc will strengthen and gold prices will rise further the economic and financial fallout from the war and the resulting stagflationary shock will of course be largest in russia and ukraine followed by the european union owing to its heavy dependence on russian gas but the us will suffer too because world energy markets are so deeply integrated a spike in global oil prices represented by the brent benchmark will strongly affect us crude oil west texas intermediate prices yes the us is now a minor net energy exporter however the macro distribution of the shock will be negative while a small cohort of energy firms will reap higher profits households and businesses will experience a massive price shock leading them to reduce spending given these dynamics even an otherwise strong us economy will suffer a sharp slowdown tilting toward a stagflationary growth recession tighter financial conditions and the resulting effects on business consumer and investor confidence will exacerbate the negative macro consequences of russia s invasion both in the us and globally likewise the coming sanctions against russia however large or limited they turn out to be and however necessary they are for future deterrence inevitably will hurt not only russia but also the us the west and emerging markets moreover one cannot rule out the possibility that russia will respond to new western sanctions with its own countermeasure namely sharply reducing oil production in order to drive up global oil prices even more such a move would yield a net benefit for russia so long as the additional increase in oil prices is larger than the loss of oil exports putin knows that he can inflict asymmetrical damage on western economies and markets because he has spent the better part of the last decade building up a war chest and creating a financial shield against additional economic sanctions a deep stagflationary shock is a nightmare scenario for central banks which will be damned if they react and damned if they don t in an environment of rising inflation where central banks are already behind the curve slower policy tightening could accelerate the de anchoring of inflation expectations further exacerbating stagflation but if central banks remain hawkish or become more hawkish the looming recession will become more severe although central banks should confront the return of inflation aggressively they most likely will try to fudge it as they did in the 1970s they will argue that the problem is temporary and that monetary policy cannot affect or undo an exogenous negative supply shock when the moment of truth comes they will probably blink opting for slower monetary tightening to avoid triggering an even more severe recession this will further de anchor inflation expectations politicians meanwhile will try to dampen the negative supply shock in the us policymakers will try to mitigate the rise in gasoline prices by drawing down its strategic petroleum reserves and by nudging saudi arabia to increase oil production but these measures will have only a limited effect because widespread fears of further price spikes will result in global energy hoarding nor can western leaders rely on fiscal policy to counter the growth dampening effects of the stagflationary shock for one thing the us and many other advanced economies are running out of fiscal ammunition having pulled out all the stops in response to the covid 19 pandemic more to the point a fiscal demand stimulus is the wrong policy response to a stagflationary supply shock though it may reduce the negative growth impact of the shock it will add to inflationary pressure and if leaders rely on both monetary and fiscal policy in responding to the shock the stagflationary consequences will become even more severe owing to the heightened effect on inflation expectations it is tempting to think that the russia ukraine conflict will have only a minor and temporary economic and financial impact after all russia represents merely 3 of the global economy and ukraine much less putin s war will strike a massive blow to global confidence at a time when the fragile recovery was already entering a period of uncertainty and rising inflationary pressures the knock on effects from the ukraine crisis will be anything but transitory project syndicate nouriel

the biden administration in extraordinary and rapid cooperation with allies over a period of three days has doubled down on its vow to impose severe sanctions against russia for its military aggression against ukraine on feb 26 2022 the u s and europe agreed to cut off some russian banks from the swift messaging system which is used to make trillions of dollars worth of transactions every day an option so devastating it has been called the nuclear option of sanctioning they also vowed to prevent russia from accessing some of its foreign reserves making it harder to offset the effects of the sanctions two days earlier the white house announced a multifaceted sanctions package that cuts off russia s major banks and companies from western financing and imposed direct financial costs on many of russian president vladimir putin s top allies it also restricted russia s access to semiconductor products and the technologies it needs to sustain its industrial sector and military capabilities western governments also sought to punish putin personally in separate sanctions targeting his personal assets held abroad as experts on the effectiveness of sanctions we believe the combination of these measures comprise an unprecedented global attack on a national economy in this case russia s the negative impact of which will increase by the hour powerful new sanctions in their feb 24 sanctions package the u s its european allies and other supportive countries froze the assets of russia s largest banks and several of the country s richest and most powerful oligarchs and imposed other financial sanctions on them these measures cover nearly 80 of all russian financial assets which the u s treasury department called the core infrastructure of the russian financial system blocking sberbank vtb bank and other russian banks from accessing credit and currency markets and impeding the ability of state owned and private entities to raise capital by imposing steep costs on these financial firms as well as on putin s main allies such as aleksandr bortnikov head of russia s federal security service and his son denis bortnikov who chairs vtb s board the sanctions should undermine the investment and development that drives the russian economy the sanctions also include export controls that prohibit companies and countries from exporting technological equipment to russia with components that use u s built or u s designed microchips since the u s continues to dominate in making the kinds of high end semiconductors necessary for advanced technologies this provides important leverage the export controls target russia s defense aerospace and maritime sectors and will cut off russia s access to vital technology which will likely lead to the atrophy of key sectors of its industrial base while russia imports most of its semiconductors from china these are the type of low end chips used to run washing machines for example not to operate a guided missile russia relies on u s semiconductor components for many of its most important technological applications similar export controls on semiconductor products are being imposed by many others including europe japan and taiwan massive bank runs and after intense pressure from ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy and others the u s and european union agreed on feb 26 to cut off some russian banks from swift which stands for the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication and connects thousands of financial institutions around the world this is especially notable because some countries in particular germany and italy had previously been opposed to this step when iran was first cut off from swift in 2012 it lost half of its oil export revenues and 30 of its foreign trade the u s and allies also announced on feb 26 that they would block the russian central bank s access to some of its over us 600 billion in foreign currency reserves elina ribakova deputy chief economist for the institute of international finance said this measure would have a dramatic effect on russia s economy and banking system and lead to massive bank runs a selloff of rubles and possibly a full on collapse of russia s financial system altogether these sanctions if sustained should have a devastating effect on russia s economy as well as curtail its strategic capabilities by hurting the powerful energy sector and military industrial companies which are bulwarks of putin s regime what makes sanctions stick and sting we ve studied the effectiveness of past sanctions both in terms of their economic impact and whether they attain their political objectives we ve found two conditions are necessary for sanctions to be effective at least when it comes to their economic impact they must be multilateral meaning they involve a broad coalition of governments and they must be implemented by countries that have extensive commercial relations with the targeted regime furthermore the countries with deep ties to the target must accept the risks and costs that result from their actions that s why the participation of a growing number of like minded nations including the u k germany france and other european states that have a much higher volume of trade with russia than does the united states is so crucial in making these sanctions succeed this unity and collective economic clout explain why the russian stock market went into a nose dive and the ruble fell to a record low against the dollar after russia launched its invasion and the new sanctions emerged as a result russia s billionaires lost an estimated 71 billion on feb 24 and standard poor s and fitch ratings slashed the country s credit rating to junk status because the sanctions are multilateral in design and being implemented in close coordination with allies in europe japan australia and other countries around the world our research suggests they will have a significant impact on russia previous estimates have suggested aggressive sanctions like the ones being unleashed now could shrink russia s annual gross domestic product by 3 to 5 or more bearing the costs of imposing sanctions discussions are continuing and pressure may build to take other more severe measures in response to the russian assault especially if its military is deemed to be guilty of committing war crimes other measures on the table include more direct product based sanctions of oil natural gas and aluminum but they also would have more immediate negative consequences for europe another test of endurance for the economic battle with russia in this case the impact of the very strong sanctions levied is hurting russia now and will increase substantially in the coming months as long as the countries imposing the sanctions as well as the companies and citizens who will also bear some of the costs are willing to accept them they will likely succeed in punishing putin for his aggression against ukraine this article has been updated to include new swift and central bank sanctions
the current rush by the west to send weapons to ukraine is in stark contrast to years of hesitancy that often had as much to do with domestic u s and allied politics and concerns about their own relations with moscow than with an assessment of the russian threat to ukraine russia s launch last week of a full scale invasion with land air and sea attacks on ukrainian cities and military installations has been met with what u s officials have described as a surprisingly robust defense officials in kyiv the capital of ukraine claim they have destroyed hundreds of russian vehicles including an entire column of t 72 tanks in the northeast ukrainian town of glukhov near the russian border ukraine has pleaded for more help including additional javelin antitank weapons and stinger antiaircraft missiles the kremlin has gone beyond all bounds and crossed all the red lines ukrainian defense minister oleksii reznikov beseeched congress last week on youtube it is not going to stop if we will not stop it president biden has authorized nearly 1 billion in military assistance over the past year for ukraine including 350 million in weapons such as antitank and antiaircraft missiles last week and 200 million in drawdowns from u s arms stocks approved in december the new package includes more javelins although stingers are likely to wait until a further tranche defense officials said advertisement germany in a major break from its post world war ii aversion to involvement in overseas military entanglements said saturday that it would send 1 000 antitank weapons and 500 stinger missiles to ukraine and released other countries from export restrictions on german manufactured weapons that release allowed the netherlands to pledge german made antitank and air defense rockets france and the united kingdom are sending military assistance as are smaller nato members including belgium the czech republic and slovakia neutral sweden said sunday that it would suspend its long held doctrine of not sending weapons to countries engaged in conflict to ship defensive equipment and other supplies to ukraine and finland said it is considering doing the same how the united states and other allies will keep up the shipments has already bumped up against the harsh reality that deliveries through ukraine s now contested airspace are virtually impossible without getting directly drawn into the conflict said a senior u s defense official one of several who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss military planning advertisement u s defense secretary lloyd austin told house lawmakers late thursday evening that the administration was looking for ways to deliver arms and is considering training ukrainian forces in another country said rep john garamendi d calif and two other congressional officials reznikov in his video tried to provide an answer you may deliver it to poland he told potential donors from there we will transport them across the land meanwhile as ukrainians prepare to face down tanks in the streets of kyiv with molotov cocktails assembled in their basements and rifles being distributed to every able bodied civilian there has been no shortage of revisionist history and finger pointing in washington while the biden administration has moved quickly since russian troops began massing on the border in december its response was sluggish to earlier russian deployments in april before the russians finally moved into ukraine in force on thursday republican lawmakers and pundits accused biden of appeasement in trying to secure a diplomatic solution to the crisis russia would never have dared to invade several charged if biden hadn t shown weakness by withdrawing u s forces from afghanistan former president donald trump calling russian president vladimir putin a genius has said it never would have happened under his watch u s interest and involvement in ukraine has long been a subset of its relations with russia that reality became even more apparent in 2014 when russia seized crimea and established control over breakaway regions of southeastern ukraine in the chaos that followed the resignation and flight to moscow of pro russian president viktor yanukovych advertisement ukrainian forces fought a series of battles against russian backed separatist rebels in an effort to regain seized territory but while the west had sanctioned russia and refused to recognize the crimean annexation then president petro poroshenko s request for u s military assistance ranging from f 16 jets and javelins to helmets and blankets gave then president barack obama pause at the time there was a high sensitivity in the white house to avoiding a conflict that could lead to direct confrontation with russia some senior obama aides initially advocated taking a breather before deciding to arm the ukrainian military which only weeks before had been fighting pro democracy protesters in the streets and was believed to be highly corrupt share this article share obama became more convinced that providing high end armaments to a far off conflict was folly when barely a month after poroshenko s june 7 inauguration a malaysian airliner was shot down by a surface to air missile over separatist territory in eastern ukraine killing all 298 people aboard western intelligence believed the weapon had been provided to the separatists by russia advertisement if the same thing had happened with u s provided weapons to ukraine government forces obama said at the time according to aides the united states would have gotten the blame after a year of internal debate obama declined to provide lethal aid overruling most of his national security team still the united states committed more than 600 million in security assistance to ukraine between 2014 and 2016 including body armor night vision goggles vehicles and training but obama s refusal to provide lethal weaponry had by that point become a republican talking point leading then sen john mccain r ariz to charge in 2015 that the ukrainians are being slaughtered and we re sending blankets and meals four years later trump would echo that charge claiming that while his administration had sent antitank busters to ukraine obama had provided only pillows and sheets advertisement but trump had his own problems with ukraine very little of which had to do with protecting it from russia trump first approved the sale of 47 million worth of 210 javelin missiles and 37 launchers to ukraine in december 2017 delivered in april the following year they were not deployed to the front lines of the still simmering separatist war under the terms of the sale they were kept boxed in a military storage facility far from the front lines where they were to serve symbolically as a strategic deterrent to russia in the summer of 2019 trump froze an additional 400 million in congressionally approved security assistance to ukraine an action that later became a centerpiece in his first impeachment based in large part on a july 25 telephone call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky that year in which zelensky expressed interest in buying more javelins trump deflected the request and instead asked zelensky for the favor of digging up dirt against then democratic presidential candidate joe biden and the ukrainian business dealings of biden s son hunter trump released the frozen aid when his action along with a transcript of the call with zelensky became public advertisement recent days have brought increasing unity on all sides of the political spectrum to help ukraine but that has not prevented a partisan rehash of the past eight years i don t think we left ukraine defenseless said evelyn farkas who served as deputy assistance secretary of defense for russia and ukraine from 2012 to 2015 could we have done more yes could everybody have done more yes but nobody foresaw what we see today

ukraine and russian representatives to meet according to the ukrainian defense ministry fxstreet forecast poll modestly favors the canadian dollar the usd cad rode the ukrainian risk aversion wave on

81 markets and the ukraine the rapid recovery of global markets reflected the judgment on friday that the russia invasion whatever its political outcome would not cause great dislocation in the global economy that opinion had been fostered by the unwillingness of the us and its allies to deny russia access to the swift international payments system or the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication which facilitates financial transactions and bank funds transfers worldwide without swift the russian government and financial institutions would be isolated from most international business transactions including payments from oil exports germany and hungary which had been blocking the move to cut moscow s swift access decided over the weekend to remove selected russian banks from the system though the details and timing are not determined european and american sanctions have not targeted the russian energy industry such an effort would be extremely costly to russia which earns 40 of its revenue from energy resources germany gets about one third of its oil and natural gas from russia which makes a cut off nearly impossible sanctions on russian energy firms would send global oil prices and consumer prices sky high russian president validimir putin wants to avoid a drawn out struggle for ukraine or an occupation and would undoubtedly prefer a compliant but national government in kyiv the ukrainian defense ministry said on sunday that representatives of the two countries have agreed to meet on the ukraine belarus border with no conditions meanwhile the russian

to the swift system seems designed to pressure moscow to negotiate europe and the us are in a political and economic quandary the most effective weapon against russia oil would exact enormous damage on their own economies and come at a very high domestic political cost with russian president vladimir putin having taken the enormous invasion gamble it is hard to see him stopping short of the prime goal of taking kyiv and forcing a government on ukraine ukraine will remain the market focus with oil the barometer of risk sanctions on russia s energy industry is one obvious source of economic instability negotiations of any type between russia and ukraine will tend to restore market equanimity since once a cease fire is begun a resumption of hostilities will be seen as unlikely usd cad outlook the rush to dollar safety that was the first market response to the russian invasion has reversed without an escalation of the conflict it should not return president putin s reported alert to russia s nuclear forces is probably more psychological than an actual tactical event but its impact on markets is unpredictable nonetheless wars are unpredictable the us dollar and assets are the panic destination of choice though a good portion of thursday s run to the greenback was from surprise further developments in the war are far less likely to provide a shock of that scale absent that motivation the potential for higher oil prices as the ukrainian conflict drags on should give the canadian dollar an advantage fed chair jerome powell testifies in the house on wednesday and the senate on thursday he will be questioned on the risks of the ukrainian conflict to the us and global economies several regional fed presidents have expressed their confidence that the bank will be able to execute its rate policy markets can expect the same opinion from mr powell with the necessary caveates for unexpected developments in ukraine the us employment report for february on friday

neal thompson is a journalist and author most recently of the new the first kennedys the humble roots of an american dynasty liquor shop operated by patrick j kennedy on washington street near boston s north end it is likely that funds from mother bridget kennedy s east boston shop financed p j kennedy s purchase of his share of the family s first licensed liquor enterprise photo boston city archives given the number of words devoted to the story of the kennedy family it s easy to think primarily about jfk in the white house the assassinations of jfk and rfk and the numerous other tragedies that have followed other members of america s extended royal family yet largely overlooked beneath the tales of wealth power style and the premature deaths of the twentieth century kennedys are the lesser known stories of the poor immigrant kennedys who came to america in the mid 1800s fleeing the collapse of their famine ravaged homeland in particular history has given short shrift to the dramatic and inspirational story of jfk s widowed great grandmother bridget murphy kennedy the tenacious matriarch of the clan a widow and single mother raising four kids alone facing long odds in a hostile anti irish climate partly to blame is a strong male dominant bias in a family whose men clearly had complicated and imperfect relationships with women when jfk visited his great grandparents home turf in 1963 for example he gave a shoutout to patrick the barrel maker but not bridget the grocer her remarkable ascent from maid to hairdresser to business owner began less than ten years after her husband patrick died at 35 of consumption as tuberculosis was then known it began at the tail end of the civil war as she donned her white shopkeeper s frock and walked the aisles of her unnamed street level east boston shop tallying her stock making notes in a ledger book on what was running low what needed restocking what was collecting dust over here were the teas coffees sugar and flour beside the scale used to weigh beans rice and spices scooped from barrels and bins over there butter cheese eggs and rashers perhaps some mackerel pickled salmon cod standing at attention on shelves bottles of relish vinegar honey and molasses beside the sperm and whale oil the soaps and candles at the counter tins of hard candies baskets of biscuits and bread arrayed out front crates of fruits and vegetables and on a good day maybe the exotic bananas and pine apples bostonians loved squeezed in or scattered elsewhere were the assorted dry goods toiletries ribbons buttons stationery hosiery and handkerchiefs that filled so many similar all purpose neighborhood establishments giving them their generic names variety shop notions shop these immigrant run mini marts these mom and pop sundry shops these convenience stores and bodegas the striving toe in the door outlets and emporiums of every working class community before and since and behind the counter the good stuff cigars and snuff cider and ale whiskey and brandy like many irish grocers bridget almost certainly sold a bit of liquor or beer the grocery groggery combo having proved to be more profitable and customer friendly than selling produce and staples alone with sickness lurking in the water some customers felt that pasteurized beer was a safer alternative and it was cheaper than milk as one grocer said of his liquor sales a man would hardly have dared to go into business without it said another liquor is food in boston business directory listings her shop would in time be listed simply as b kennedy or shop by kennedy run by the widow kennedy her store was initially located on maverick square two blocks from her apartment alongside the river of pedestrians and carriage traffic flowing steadily to and from the ferries and the shipping docks later she d move the shop to a first floor space on border street and would live with her kids in the apartments above the shop wasn t much just a narrow room off border street displaying goods in boxes and barrels out front atop crates and tables throughout the crowded aisles inside but after nearly twenty years of working for others she d created a place of her own where she was boss a grocer an entrepreneur it had been a dream of hers and patrick s one they d briefly realized with the short lived grocery shop they d opened a year before his death in 1858 now she was bringing it back to life and by choosing to sell some booze fifty cents for a quart of bourbon her shop would become a casual communal spot for local gossip and grog a place for immigrants to buy from someone who spoke with the lilting familiar brogue of family and friends left behind as families settled into an era of post war peace boston s economy revived putting a few more dollars in people s pockets no more rationing to support the war effort time to get back to normal it was a propitious time for a scrappy immigrant to become an american business owner for bridget it was the start of a whole new life a chance to finally paddle her own canoe like other risk takers operating a thousand similarly eager little immigrant businesses saloons salons billiard halls butcher shops and bowling alleys she was striving for independence acceptance and a slightly better future for her four kids her boldness reflected a changing city in which irish women and men were on a spirited ascent bridget s business coincided with the modest beginnings of a period in which the irish became more fully integrated into city life for the first twenty years after the famine the irish had been boston s unwelcome guests they held the lowliest jobs they were sick and poor dirty and desperate made to feel lucky that the city even allowed them to live there they huddled together and slowly found their place at the bottom and mortified boston had grudgingly adapted the postwar irish were different their ranks now included military veterans ex generals and celebrated heroes no longer charity cases they began holding their own as business owners lawyers and even landlords from the late 1860s into the 70s they found their way into city institutions making inroads into the police force and fire department and in time the polls politically they had no direct voice no irish person had served on the city s eight man board of aldermen and only one had served on the forty eight man common council that would soon change and dramatically so with bridget s son p j helping lead the way but not quite yet though the democratic party preferred by the irish was out of favor stained by its stance on slavery and though the party of lincoln would dominate city elections for years to come irish politicians would make their mark on boston soon enough the postwar years also saw irish women begin to make their mark outside the home women had served in empowering new roles during the war running relief agencies working in field hospitals organizing donation drives they worked at factories and on the assembly lines at arsenals producing ammunition and other mat√©riel for the war effort some continued to work as nurses after the war some became teachers and in time irish american women would dominate that profession in many us cities others would work as labor activists civil rights advocates suffragists and journalists old school boston wasn t especially happy about the rise of an irish middle class nor the swelling chorus of women agitating for the right to vote harvard trained protestant elites still dominated the city the brahmins as oliver wendell holmes had dubbed them in 1860 in an article for the three year old atlantic monthly magazine he named them after a high ranking class of hindu priests and teachers in india these men and their fathers their names stamped all over boston adams appleton cabot quincy lowell lodge peabody winthrop had overseen one of the nation s most ethnically and culturally homogeneous cities but as boston absorbed more immigrants not just irish catholics but newcomers from other parts of europe and beyond many founders families had moved out to the suburbs or their country estates and with slavery now abolished more black families took up residence in boston albeit slowly with other postwar demographic shifts boston found itself in the swell of a midlife crisis the city s status as a leader in american politics thought culture and literature was fading it was no longer in holmes s term the hub of the solar system once considered the athens of america boston was looking more like america s

neal thompson is a journalist and author most recently of the new the first kennedys the humble roots of an american dynasty liquor shop operated by patrick j kennedy on washington street near boston s north end it is likely that funds from mother bridget kennedy s east boston shop financed p j kennedy s purchase of his share of the family s first licensed liquor enterprise photo boston city archives given the number of words devoted to the story of the kennedy family it s easy to think primarily about jfk in the white house the assassinations of jfk and rfk and the numerous other tragedies that have followed other members of america s extended royal family yet largely overlooked beneath the tales of wealth power style and the premature deaths of the twentieth century kennedys are the lesser known stories of the poor immigrant kennedys who came to america in the mid 1800s fleeing the collapse of their famine ravaged homeland in particular history has given short shrift to the dramatic and inspirational story of jfk s widowed great grandmother bridget murphy kennedy the tenacious matriarch of the clan a widow and single mother raising four kids alone facing long odds in a hostile anti irish climate partly to blame is a strong male dominant bias in a family whose men clearly had complicated and imperfect relationships with women when jfk visited his great grandparents home turf in 1963 for example he gave a shoutout to patrick the barrel maker but not bridget the grocer her remarkable ascent from maid to hairdresser to business owner began less than ten years after her husband patrick died at 35 of consumption as tuberculosis was then known it began at the tail end of the civil war as she donned her white shopkeeper s frock and walked the aisles of her unnamed street level east boston shop tallying her stock making notes in a ledger book on what was running low what needed restocking what was collecting dust over here were the teas coffees sugar and flour beside the scale used to weigh beans rice and spices scooped from barrels and bins over there butter cheese eggs and rashers perhaps some mackerel pickled salmon cod standing at attention on shelves bottles of relish vinegar honey and molasses beside the sperm and whale oil the soaps and candles at the counter tins of hard candies baskets of biscuits and bread arrayed out front crates of fruits and vegetables and on a good day maybe the exotic bananas and pine apples bostonians loved squeezed in or scattered elsewhere were the assorted dry goods toiletries ribbons buttons stationery hosiery and handkerchiefs that filled so many similar all purpose neighborhood establishments giving them their generic names variety shop notions shop these immigrant run mini marts these mom and pop sundry shops these convenience stores and bodegas the striving toe in the door outlets and emporiums of every working class community before and since and behind the counter the good stuff cigars and snuff cider and ale whiskey and brandy like many irish grocers bridget almost certainly sold a bit of liquor or beer the grocery groggery combo having proved to be more profitable and customer friendly than selling produce and staples alone with sickness lurking in the water some customers felt that pasteurized beer was a safer alternative and it was cheaper than milk as one grocer said of his liquor sales a man would hardly have dared to go into business without it said another liquor is food in boston business directory listings her shop would in time be listed simply as b kennedy or shop by kennedy run by the widow kennedy her store was initially located on maverick square two blocks from her apartment alongside the river of pedestrians and carriage traffic flowing steadily to and from the ferries and the shipping docks later she d move the shop to a first floor space on border street and would live with her kids in the apartments above the shop wasn t much just a narrow room off border street displaying goods in boxes and barrels out front atop crates and tables throughout the crowded aisles inside but after nearly twenty years of working for others she d created a place of her own where she was boss a grocer an entrepreneur it had been a dream of hers and patrick s one they d briefly realized with the short lived grocery shop they d opened a year before his death in 1858 now she was bringing it back to life and by choosing to sell some booze fifty cents for a quart of bourbon her shop would become a casual communal spot for local gossip and grog a place for immigrants to buy from someone who spoke with the lilting familiar brogue of family and friends left behind as families settled into an era of post war peace boston s economy revived putting a few more dollars in people s pockets no more rationing to support the war effort time to get back to normal it was a propitious time for a scrappy immigrant to become an american business owner for bridget it was the start of a whole new life a chance to finally paddle her own canoe like other risk takers operating a thousand similarly eager little immigrant businesses saloons salons billiard halls butcher shops and bowling alleys she was striving for independence acceptance and a slightly better future for her four kids her boldness reflected a changing city in which irish women and men were on a spirited ascent bridget s business coincided with the modest beginnings of a period in which the irish became more fully integrated into city life for the first twenty years after the famine the irish had been boston s unwelcome guests they held the lowliest jobs they were sick and poor dirty and desperate made to feel lucky that the city even allowed them to live there they huddled together and slowly found their place at the bottom and mortified boston had grudgingly adapted the postwar irish were different their ranks now included military veterans ex generals and celebrated heroes no longer charity cases they began holding their own as business owners lawyers and even landlords from the late 1860s into the 70s they found their way into city institutions making inroads into the police force and fire department and in time the polls politically they had no direct voice no irish person had served on the city s eight man board of aldermen and only one had served on the forty eight man common council that would soon change and dramatically so with bridget s son p j helping lead the way but not quite yet though the democratic party preferred by the irish was out of favor stained by its stance on slavery and though the party of lincoln would dominate city elections for years to come irish politicians would make their mark on boston soon enough the postwar years also saw irish women begin to make their mark outside the home women had served in empowering new roles during the war running relief agencies working in field hospitals organizing donation drives they worked at factories and on the assembly lines at arsenals producing ammunition and other mat√©riel for the war effort some continued to work as nurses after the war some became teachers and in time irish american women would dominate that profession in many us cities others would work as labor activists civil rights advocates suffragists and journalists old school boston wasn t especially happy about the rise of an irish middle class nor the swelling chorus of women agitating for the right to vote harvard trained protestant elites still dominated the city the brahmins as oliver wendell holmes had dubbed them in 1860 in an article for the three year old atlantic monthly magazine he named them after a high ranking class of hindu priests and teachers in india these men and their fathers their names stamped all over boston adams appleton cabot quincy lowell lodge peabody winthrop had overseen one of the nation s most ethnically and culturally homogeneous cities but as boston absorbed more immigrants not just irish catholics but newcomers from other parts of europe and beyond many founders families had moved out to the suburbs or their country estates and with slavery now abolished more black families took up residence in boston albeit slowly with other postwar demographic shifts boston found itself in the swell of a midlife crisis the city s status as a leader in american politics thought culture and literature was fading it was no longer in holmes s term the hub of the solar system once considered the athens of america boston was looking more like america s

menafn globenewswire nasdaq london feb 28 2022 globe newswire salvadorian president nayib bukele on sunday said he will send congress a proposal to grant citizenship to foreigners who invest in the central american country another step in the populist leader s plan to bolster the country s economy by attracting non traditional capital i m sending 52 legal reforms to congress to remove red tape reduce bureaucracy create tax incentives citizenship in exchange for investments new securities laws stability contracts etc bukele said on twitter since september el salvador has attracted increasing international interest when it passed a law that made the cryptocurrency bitcoin legal tender like the new package of el salvador reforms that law was first proposed by bukele if the new citizenship legal reform is passed el salvador would become one of the few countries to offer a citizenship by investment programme joining several other small countries mainly in the caribbean according to the world s leading government advisory and marketing firm cs global partners cbi programmes usually require a vetted applicant to make a minimum monetary contribution to a government fund or purchase real estate in the country to obtain citizenship greater crypto freedom with cbi an increasing number of crypto investors and tech entrepreneurs have started looking to second citizenship as a means of achieving greater freedom says micha emmett the ceo of cs global partners she added that this growing demographic has combined assets like cryptocurrency with additional citizenships to unlock financial autonomy and wealth diversity as crypto gained more traction in the last few years we ve started seeing an increase in interest for second citizenship from the tech community this demographic technologically is already global so it makes sense that they want their assets to reflect this mindset she said a second citizenship offers a level of safety and security that investors can rely on during political or economic turmoil the onset of the covid 19 pandemic has particularly triggered families to obtain second citizenship to better protect themselves and their financial assets whilst increasing their global mobility the dual island nation of st kitts and nevis has been a popular destination amongst the wealthy mainly because of its cbi programme this initiative provides a trusted route to second citizenship once an applicant invests in the nation established in 1984 st kitts and nevis programme is internationally recognised as a platinum standard brand despite being the smallest sovereign state in the western hemisphere st kitts and nevis is one of the most technologically advanced nations in the region regarding its crypto friendly approach to banking the islands recently passed a bill simplifying the trade of virtual assets and are also currently running a digital currency pilot programme known as dcash st kitts and nevis also does not impose income inheritance or capital gains tax allowing citizens to breathe a little freer as they focus on the investments that matter to them more countries are considering the cbi route el salvador is not the only country tossing with the idea of citizenship by investment to boost its economy just last month pakistan s information minister fawad chaudhry said that the government would offer pakistani nationality to foreign investors particularly as a way to recruit heavy investments from the wealthy individuals of neighbouring china and pakistan jamaica s government is also being pushed to consider adopting a citizenship by investment programme with the funds gained through the process used for various development projects julian dixon ceo and broker at jamaica sotheby s international realty made the call in october 2021 she said funds gained from the project should be used to invest in the country s infrastructure real estate job creation and business development for a number of countries especially in the caribbean there is no denying that cbi programmes offer a much needed injection of foreign direct investment often in a way that can make a significant developmental difference these funds are channelled into reducing international aid and debt developing the tourism sector job growth as foreigners often employ locals when expanding offices or constructing properties and sustainability initiatives cs global partner s emmett commented dixon particularly pointed out that st kitts and nevis which pioneered the citizenship by investment programme close to four decades ago and has invested upwards of us 300 million from the programme in modernising its infrastructure she said jamaica could do the same a trusted product st kitts and nevis offers a trusted product that has been acclaimed globally by independent studies like the annual cbi index published by the financial times pwm magazine with an influx of citizenship programmes on the market st kitts and nevis continues to be a powerhouse within the industry with one of the longest standing programmes in operation those who become citizens gain a wealth of benefits including increased global mobility to financial centres in asia europe and africa alternative business prospects and the ability to pass citizenship down thus establishing a future legacy for one s family additionally st kitts and nevis does not impose any personal income gift or inheritance tax and has a currency pegged to the us dollar making it a financially lucrative destination for savvy investors the country s cbi unit which processes all economic citizenship applications usually issues approvals or denials within a period of three months there are no interviews language education or business requirements travel to the island is not obligatory and no minimum residence stays apply either before or after citizenship is obtained due diligence procedures remain among the industry s most robust and the nation is strengthening them by focusing on enhancing fingerprinting and biometrics for those looking to hedge against future risks combining the dual island nation s crypto friendly policies and second citizenship provides investors with the ultimate insurance policy during times of unpredictability st kitts and nevis remains the best destination for securing your future with a thriving financial services sector and a growing crypto hub

washington ap nearly half of the 500 million free covid 19 tests the biden administration recently made available to the publicstill have not been claimed as virus cases plummet and people feel less urgency to test wild demand swings have been a subplot in the pandemic from vaccines to hand sanitizer along with tests on the first day of the white house test giveaway in january covidtests gov received over 45 million orders now officials say fewer than 100 000 orders a day are coming in for the packages of four free rapid tests per household delivered by the u s postal service still the white house sees the program as a step toward a deeper yet more elastic testing infrastructure that will accommodate demand surges and remain on standby when cases wane we totally intend to sustain this market dr tom inglesby testing adviser to the covid 19 response team told the associated press we know the market is volatile and will come up and down with surges in variants the white house says americans have placed 68 million orders for packages of tests which leaves about 46 of the stock of tests still available to be ordered testing will become more important with mask requirements now easing say some independent experts if infection control is still our priority testing is central said dr leana wen a former baltimore health commissioner and commentator on the pandemic four tests per household for one family will only last you one time there should be enough tests for families to test twice a week inglesby maintains that the pieces are falling into place to accommodate that private insurers are now required to cover eight free rapid tests per person per month medicare coverage will start in the spring the administration has also been making free at home tests available through libraries clinics and other community venues capacity for the more accurate pcr tests performed by labs has been built up the white house recently put out a request to industry for ideas on how to sustain and expand domestic testing for the rest of this year wen says people still need a guide for when to test and how often right now it is still unclear she said president joe biden s pivot to testing came under duress as the omicron variant gained force just before christmas tests were frustratingly hard to come by and expensive the white house is sensitive to criticism that help may have come too late there is no question some people found out they were positive from taking one of these tests and were able to keep other people from getting infected said tim manning supply coordinator for the covid 19 response team around mid december with omicron projections grimmer by the day white house officials began discussing how to make free tests available for anyone who wanted one but if the government started siphoning up tests on the market that would just make the shortage worse a critical thing to us was that anything we did had to be done in a way did not create a shortage at retail to the general public manning said the white house enlisted the pentagon and parts of the health and human services department that had worked on the trump administration s vaccine development effort to distribute vaccines logistics experts scoured the globe for available tests the postal service was designated to take the orders and deliver them that part proved to be a good call said hana schank an expert on government technology projects with the new america think tank the postal service already had a database of every address in the land and the means to deliver

2020 reuters maxim shemetov file photo by allison lampert and david shepardson reuters european nations and canada moved on sunday to shut down their airspace to russian aircraft an unprecedented step aimed at pressuring president vladimir putin to end his invasion of ukraine the biggest attack on a european state since world war two aeroflot said it would cancel all flights to european destinations after eu foreign policy chief josep borrell said the european union had decided to close its airspace to russian traffic the united states is mulling similar action but has yet to make a final decision according to us officials the us government said citizens should consider leaving russia immediately on commercial flights citing an increasing number of airlines canceling flights as countries closed their airspace to russia the ban on russian jets comes as the airline industry continues to grapple with the fallout from the covid 19 pandemic that is still undermining global demand for travel germany spain and france joined britain the nordics and the baltic states in declaring bans on russian use of their airspace a major escalation in a tactic by mostly nato allies to wage economic war against putin in retaliation for the invasion the west led by the united states also unveiled sweeping new financial sanctions on russia which has called its assault on ukraine a special operation to capture neo nazis who putin says threaten russia s security a charge kyiv and western governments say is baseless propaganda russia is now widely expected to retaliate further against the air blockades and other sanctions it has already responded to the earliest european airspace bans with its own edicts barring airlines from britain bulgaria and poland without access to russia s airways experts say carriers will have to divert flights south while also avoiding areas of tension in the middle east a reciprocal airspace ban by russia and the united states would cause longer flight times for us carriers and could require crew changes on east coast routes to asia said us based analyst robert mann of rw mann company inc it could make certain flights too costly to operate for us carriers it would just add a lot of expense he said will washington follow france is shutting down its airspace to all russian aircraft and airlines from this evening on french transport minister jean baptiste djebbari said in a twitter nyse post an announcement echoed across continental europe air france klm said it is suspending flights to and from russia as well as the overflight of russian airspace until further notice as of sunday earlier germany s transport ministry said it would close its airspace to russian planes and airlines for three months from sunday with the exception of humanitarian aid flights the closure of european airspace to russian airlines and vice versa had immediate impacts on global aviation air france said it was temporarily suspending flights to and from china korea and japan while it studies flight plan options to avoid russian airspace in compliance with french and international authorities directives finnair said a russian retaliation on finland s airspace ban would prolong flight times so much that it would not be viable to operate its asian flights if us airlines were barred from russian airspace it would lengthen some international flights and some would likely be forced to refuel in anchorage industry sources told reuters the flights that could be impacted include us flights to india china japan and korea the sources said the white house national security council declined to comment on whether the united states will close its skies to russia and referred questions to the federal aviation administration which did not immediately comment swiss international air lines a unit of germany s lufthansa canada also said it had shut its airspace to russian aircraft effective immediately a spokesperson for canada s transport minister said there are no direct flights between russia and canada but several russian flights a day pass through canadian airspace the aviation sanctions also spell disruption for logistics companies and the mainly ireland based aircraft leasing industry us based united parcel service inc nyse and fedex corp nyse two of the world s largest logistics companies have said they are halting deliveries to destinations in russia it was unclear whether both firms continue to use russian airspace as part of their general operations neither responded immediately to requests for comment airfinance journal reported eu based lessors would be given until march 28 to wind down deals with russian airlines a setback for the industry after russian carriers were seen as more reliable performers on jet rental agreements than many global carriers during the pandemic russian companies have 980 passenger jets in service of which 777 are leased according to analytics firm cirium of these two thirds or 515 jets with an estimated market value of about 10 billion are rented from foreign firms
nearly half of the 500 million free covid 19 tests the biden administration recently made available to the public still have not been claimed as virus cases plummet and people feel less urgency to test wild demand swings have been a subplot in the pandemic from vaccines to hand sanitizer along with tests on the first day of the white house test giveaway in january covidtests gov received over 45 million orders now officials say fewer than 100 000 orders a day are coming in for the packages of four free rapid tests per household delivered by the u s postal service still the white house sees the program as a step toward a deeper yet more elastic testing infrastructure that will accommodate demand surges and remain on standby when cases wane we totally intend to sustain this market dr tom inglesby testing adviser to the covid 19 response team told the associated press we know the market is volatile and will come up and down with surges in variants the white house says americans have placed 68 million orders for packages of tests which leaves about 46 of the stock of tests still available to be ordered testing will become more important with mask requirements now easing say some independent experts if infection control is still our priority testing is central said dr leana wen a former baltimore health commissioner and commentator on the pandemic four tests per household for one family will only last you one time there should be enough tests for families to test twice a week inglesby maintains that the pieces are falling into place to accommodate that in this photo

to cover eight free rapid tests per person per month medicare coverage will start in the spring the administration has also been making free at home tests available through libraries clinics and other community venues capacity for the more accurate pcr tests performed by labs has been built up the white house recently put out a request to industry for ideas on how to sustain and expand domestic testing for the rest of this year wen says people still need a guide for when to test and how often right now it is still unclear she said related is omicron leading us closer to herd immunity against covid 19 experts weigh in president joe biden s pivot to testing came under duress as the omicron variant gained force just before christmas tests were frustratingly hard to come by and expensive the white house is sensitive to criticism that help may have come too late there is no question some people found out they were positive from taking one of these tests and were able to keep other people from getting infected said tim manning supply coordinator for the covid 19 response team around mid december with omicron projections grimmer by the day white house officials began discussing how to make free tests available for anyone who wanted one but if the government started siphoning up tests on the market that would just make the shortage worse a critical thing to us was that anything we did had to be done in a way did not create a shortage at retail to the general public manning said the white house enlisted the pentagon and parts of the health and human services department that had worked on the trump administration s vaccine development effort to distribute vaccines logistics experts scoured the globe for available tests the postal service was designated to take the orders and deliver them that part proved to be a good call said hana schank an expert on government technology projects with the new america think tank the postal service already had a database of every address in the land and the means to deliver at the federal level the only people who have a database connected to a fulfillment engine would be the post office she said the project took less than a month to

a number of years truss told sky news russia have strong forces and we know the ukrainians are brave they are determined to stand up for their sovereignty and territorial integrity and they are determined to fight she said the minister said that intelligence showed that ukrainian forces were continuing to resist russian advances and that there had not been significant changes overnight but she warned russian president vladimir putin could deploy more deadly weapons this could well be the beginning the end for putin and i fear that he is determined to use the most unsavoury means in this war i fear this conflict could be very very bloody we do need to be prepared for russia to seek to use even worse weapons she added however putin should be aware the international criminal court is already looking at what is happening in ukraine and there will be serious consequences for him personally she told sky news britain has provided ukraine with lethal defence weapons and applied sanctions to kremlin linked tycoons and businesses the foreign minister said that britian would continue to supply defence weapons but cautioned that the sanctions will take time to become effective and that they could only work through their hit list of oligarchs as fast as the legal process would allow them to we ve already had letters to the foreign office from lawyers threatening us so we have to make sure the cases are properly prepared and that we have the right evidence before we sanction these individuals she told the sunday times that is why we re taking it step by step but we are working through that hit list and we will continue to sanction new oligarchs every few weeks british prime minister boris johnson spoke to ukraine president volodymyr zelensky late saturday with the

a tweet we request an urgent decision ordering russia to cease military activity now and expect trials to start next week the icj which is based in the netherlands capital the hague does not have a mandate to bring criminal charges against individual russian leaders behind the four day old invasion but it is the world s top court for resolving legal complaints between states over alleged breaches of international law it is the supreme judicial institution of the united nations the russian head of delegation at a major un climate conference apologised for his country s invasion of ukraine on sunday which he said lacked justification according to several sources who heard him speak at the virtual meeting let me present an apology on behalf of all russians not able to prevent this conflict anisimov said at the closing plenary of the virtual 195 nation forum according to three sources who heard him speak the united states and european nations agreed saturday to impose the most potentially crippling financial penalties yet on russia over its unrelenting invasion of ukraine going after the central bank reserves that underpin the russian economy and severing some russian banks from a vital global financial network putin embarked on a path aiming to destroy ukraine but what he is also doing in fact is destroying the future of his own country eu commission president ursula von der leyen said the us and european allies announced the moves in a joint statement as part of a new round of financial sanctions meant to hold russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for putin the central bank restrictions target access to the more than 600 billion in reserves that the kremlin has at its disposal and are meant to block russia s ability to support the ruble as it plunges in value amid tightening western sanctions the ruble and russia s stock market both declined sharply immediately after russia launched military action in ukraine on thursday the ruble recovered slightly but is still down more than 6 percent from before putin s announcement trading at nearly 84 rubles to the dollar us officials said saturday s steps were framed to send the ruble into free fall and promote soaring inflation in the russian economy canada is joining many european countries in closing its airspace to all russian aircraft as the west

nearly half of the 500 million free covid 19 tests the biden administration recently made available to the public still have not been claimed as virus cases plummet and people feel less urgency to test wild demand swings have been a subplot in the pandemic from vaccines to hand sanitizer along with tests on the first day of the white house test giveaway in january covidtests gov received over 45 million orders now officials say fewer than 100 000 orders a day are coming in for the packages of four free rapid tests per household delivered by the u s postal service still the white house sees the program as a step toward a deeper yet more elastic testing infrastructure that will accommodate demand surges and remain on standby when cases wane we totally intend to sustain this market dr tom inglesby testing adviser to the covid 19 response team told the associated press we know the market is volatile and will come up and down with surges in variants the white house says americans have placed 68 million orders for packages of tests which leaves about 46 of the stock of tests still available to be ordered testing will become more important with mask requirements now easing say some independent experts if infection control is still our priority testing is central said dr leana wen a former baltimore health commissioner and commentator on the pandemic four tests per household for one family will only last you one time there should be enough tests for families to test twice a week inglesby maintains that the pieces are falling into place to accommodate that in this photo illustration the abbott s at home covid 19 rapid test kits are seen on display in orlando photo illustration by paul hennessy sopa images lightrocket via getty images private insurers are now required to cover eight free rapid tests per person per month medicare coverage will start in the spring the administration has also been making free at home tests available through libraries clinics and other community venues capacity for the more accurate pcr tests performed by labs has been built up the white house recently put out a request to industry for ideas on how to sustain and expand domestic testing for the rest of this year wen says people still need a guide for when to test and how often right now it is still unclear she said related is omicron leading us closer to herd immunity against covid 19 experts weigh in president joe biden s pivot to testing came under duress as the omicron variant gained force just before christmas tests were frustratingly hard to come by and expensive the white house is sensitive to criticism that help may have come too late there is no question some people found out they were positive from taking one of these tests and were able to keep other people from getting infected said tim manning supply coordinator for the covid 19 response team around mid december with omicron projections grimmer by the day white house officials began discussing how to make free tests available for anyone who wanted one but if the government started siphoning up tests on the market that would just make the shortage worse a critical thing to us was that anything we did had to be done in a way did not create a shortage at retail to the general public manning said the white house enlisted the pentagon and parts of the health and human services department that had worked on the trump administration s vaccine development effort to distribute vaccines logistics experts scoured the globe for available tests the postal service was designated to take the orders and deliver them that part proved to be a good call said hana schank an expert on government technology projects with the new america think tank the postal service already had a database of every address in the land and the means to deliver at the federal level the only people who have a database connected to a fulfillment engine would be the post office she said the project took less than a month to get ready manning said we said this is not online retail he said this is emergency response so we have go to as fast as possible to make sure it wasn t just the tech savvy who would end up getting free tests the administration targeted a share of deliveries to people in low income areas the white house worked with service organizations to get the word out we prioritized the processing of orders to the highest social vulnerability zip codes in the country testing adviser inglesby said one of the service groups was the national association of community health workers whose members help people navigate the health care system executive director denise smith said the group was able to use its website to link more than 630 000 people to covidtests gov overall about 20 to 25 of the tests have gone to people in distressed areas officials said now that demand is way down it s unclear what will happen to the white house giveaway program allowing repeat orders is one possibility smith says groups like hers should get any surplus we know where the people are she said although the program is still in its infancy analyst lindsey dawson of the kaiser family foundation believes its legacy may lie in familiarizing more people with testing it may get someone comfortable with utilizing the tests thinking about how they might use testing in their lives she said savita sharaf a retiree from the maryland suburbs outside the nation s capital said she ordered her free tests around the middle of january and got them in early february she s tried to conserve them for added peace of mind in the stores she couldn t find tests for less than 25 i m so relieved because i can immediately test myself sharaf said if we had a high vaccination rate it would be a little easier to say let up on this program but i feel we have to watch for the next month or two to see what happens

clarke was forced to mow down about half of the 2020 crop later he sold what was left at a nearby flower stand with proceeds going to charity when the fields reopened for business last year clarke instituted a new online only ticketing system that was so successful that it becomes a permanent fixture this year in past years visitors tended to clump up at midday which made for crowding in the fields and long lines for wagon rides through timed entry ticketing visitors expanded into the usually slower morning and late afternoon hours allowing for less crowding and more visitors overall

the biden administration in extraordinary and rapid cooperation with allies over a period of three days has doubled down on its vow to impose severe sanctions against russia for its military aggression against ukraine on feb 26 2022 the u s and europe agreed to cut off some russian banks from the swift messaging system which is used to make trillions of dollars worth of transactions every day an option so devastating it has been called the nuclear option of sanctioning they also vowed to prevent russia from accessing some of its foreign reserves making it harder to offset the effects of the sanctions two days earlier the white house announced a multifaceted sanctions package that cuts off russia s major banks and companies from western financing and imposed direct financial costs on many of russian president vladimir putin s top allies it also restricted russia s access to semiconductor products and the technologies it needs to sustain its industrial sector and military capabilities western governments also sought to punish putin personally in separate sanctions targeting his personal assets held abroad as experts on the effectiveness of sanctions we believe the combination of these measures comprise an unprecedented global attack on a national economy in this case russia s the negative impact of which will increase by the hour powerful new sanctions in their feb 24 sanctions package the u s its european allies and other supportive countries froze the assets of russia s largest banks and several of the country s richest and most powerful oligarchs and imposed other financial sanctions on them these measures cover nearly 80 of all russian financial assets which the u s treasury department called the core infrastructure of the russian financial system blocking sberbank vtb bank and other russian banks from accessing credit and currency markets and impeding the ability of state owned and private entities to raise capital by imposing steep costs on these financial firms as well as on putin s main allies such as aleksandr bortnikov head of russia s federal security service and his son denis bortnikov who chairs vtb s board the sanctions should undermine the investment and development that drives the russian economy the sanctions also include export controls that prohibit companies and countries from exporting technological equipment to russia with components that use u s built or u s designed microchips since the u s continues to dominate in making the kinds of high end semiconductors necessary for advanced technologies this provides important leverage the export controls target russia s defense aerospace and maritime sectors and will cut off russia s access to vital technology which will likely lead to the atrophy of key sectors of its industrial base while russia imports most of its semiconductors from china these are the type of low end chips used to run washing machines for example not to operate a guided missile russia relies on u s semiconductor components for many of its most important technological applications similar export controls on semiconductor products are being imposed by many others including europe japan and taiwan massive bank runs and after intense pressure from ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy and others the u s and european union agreed on feb 26 to cut off some russian banks from swift which stands for the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication and connects thousands of financial institutions around the world this is especially notable because some countries in particular germany and italy had previously been opposed to this step when iran was first cut off from swift in 2012 it lost half of its oil export revenues and 30 of its foreign trade the u s and allies also announced on feb 26 that they would block the russian central bank s access to some of its over us 600 billion in foreign currency reserves elina ribakova deputy chief economist for the institute of international finance said this measure would have a dramatic effect on russia s economy and banking system and lead to massive bank runs a selloff of rubles and possibly a full on collapse of russia s financial system altogether these sanctions if sustained should have a devastating effect on russia s economy as well as curtail its strategic capabilities by hurting the powerful energy sector and military industrial companies which are bulwarks of putin s regime what makes sanctions stick and sting we ve studied the effectiveness of past sanctions both in terms of their economic impact and whether they attain their political objectives we ve found two conditions are necessary for sanctions to be effective at least when it comes to their economic impact they must be multilateral meaning they involve a broad coalition of governments and they must be implemented by countries that have extensive commercial relations with the targeted regime furthermore the countries with deep ties to the target must accept the risks and costs that result from their actions that s why the participation of a growing number of like minded nations including the u k germany france and other european states that have a much higher volume of trade with russia than does the united states is so crucial in making these sanctions succeed this unity and collective economic clout explain why the russian stock market went into a nose dive and the ruble fell to a record low against the dollar after russia launched its invasion and the new sanctions emerged as a result russia s billionaires lost an estimated 71 billion on feb 24 and standard poor s and fitch ratings slashed the country s credit rating to junk status because the sanctions are multilateral in design and being implemented in close coordination with allies in europe japan australia and other countries around the world our research suggests they will have a significant impact on russia previous estimates have suggested aggressive sanctions like the ones being unleashed now could shrink russia s annual gross domestic product by 3 to 5 or more bearing the costs of imposing sanctions discussions are continuing and pressure may build to take other more severe measures in response to the russian assault especially if its military is deemed to be guilty of committing war crimes other measures on the table include more direct product based sanctions of oil natural gas and aluminum but they also would have more immediate negative consequences for europe another test of endurance for the economic battle with russia in this case the impact of the very strong sanctions levied is hurting russia now and will increase substantially in the coming months as long as the countries imposing the sanctions as well as the companies and citizens who will also bear some of the costs are willing to accept them they will likely succeed in punishing putin for his aggression against ukraine this article has been updated to include new swift and central bank sanctions
author francesco pomponi menafn the conversation more than half of the world s 7 8 billion people live in cities and urban areas by 2050 an additional 2 5 billion will be living there as that figure continues to climb and ever more people flock to metropolitan areas in the hope of a better life the big question is how do we fit everyone in it is the job of city developers and urban planners to figure out how to build or adapt urban environments to accommodate the living and working needs of this rapidly expanding population there is a popular belief that taller more densely packed skyscrapers are the way forward because they optimise the use of space and house more people per square metre and limit urban sprawl but given the global commitments to emissions reduction targets and mitigating climate change is this the most sustainable solution from a carbon reduction perspective our recent study which examined whether building denser and taller is the right path to sustainability busts this myth we found that densely built low rise environments are more space and carbon efficient while high rise buildings have a drastically higher carbon impact impact on the environment we assessed the whole life cycle of carbon emissions meaning both operational and embodied carbon of different buildings and urban environments operational carbon is generated while a building is in service embodied carbon is all the hidden behind the scenes carbon produced during the extraction production transport and manufacture of raw materials used to construct a building plus any produced during maintenance refurbishment demolition or replacement this aspect is often overlooked especially in building design where operational efficiency is always to the fore the argument for cutting carbon at the design stage has been made by numerous researchers and it is gaining traction with leading international organisations such as the world green building council but it s still something that is largely disregarded mainly because embodied impact assessment is voluntary and there is no legislation concerning its inclusion but it must be advocated for if we are to reach our 2050 emissions targets at a global scale the construction sector is responsible for a significant impact on the environment as is clear from the graph below the largest contribution comes from its consumption of energy and resources which boils down to the design stage the part of the process that no one is looking at construction sector s contribution to environmental impacts edinburgh napier university now that new buildings have to be more energy efficient and the energy grid is being decarbonised this hidden embodied energy varies from 11 33 for projects such as passive house designs a building standard that uses non mechanical heating and cooling design techniques to lower energy use to 74 100 for near zero energy builds high performance buildings where the low amount of energy required comes mostly from renewable sources given the focus on driving down the energy impact of day to day operations the proportional share of embodied energy consumption has been driven up so as energy demand becomes lower when the building is in use the materials and activities required to build it in first place produce proportionally more impacts across the building s lifespan for example low and near zero energy buildings are made by improving insulation and using more materials and additional technologies which greatly increases the hidden energy impact and carbon cost moving to a smaller scale the embodied carbon share across construction materials shows that minerals have the largest proportion by far at 45 the graph below shows the breakdown of materials where concrete dominates in terms of hidden carbon contribution this is important because skyscrapers rely heavily on concrete as a structural material so the type of materials we use how much we use and how we use them is crucial the carbon contribution of different minerals used in construction edinburgh napier university author provided how we can fix it we developed four different urban scenarios shown in the graph below based on data from real buildings high density high rise hdhr which are tall and close together low density high rise ldhr which are tall but more spread out high density low rise hdlr which are low and close together and low density low rise ldlr which are low level and more spaced out to do this we split the building stock into five main categories non domestic low rise ndlr non domestic high rise ndhr domestic low rise dlr domestic high rise dhr and terraced house we gathered numerous data including height number of storeys building footprint the land area the building physically occupies facade material and neighbouring constraints this includes the number and area of blocks and green spaces within one square kilometre average street width and average distance between buildings four urban scenarios analysed in the study edinburgh napier university author provided these parameters were all fed into a computer model to analyse the data looking at the following 1 how whole life cycle carbon changed based on the buildings and the number of people accommodated within an area of 1km¬≤ 2 how whole life cycle carbon changed due to an increasing population based on four fixed population sizes 20 30 40 and 50 thousand people and the land use required to accommodate them under the four different urban scenarios our findings show that high density low rise cities such as paris are more environmentally friendly than high density high rise cities such as new york looking at the fixed population scenarios when moving from a high density low rise to a high density high rise urban environment the average increase in whole life cycle carbon emissions is 142 new york s densely packed skyscrapers sean pavone shutterstock equating this to the potential savings per person based on the fixed population size building high density low rise offers a saving of 365 tonnes of co‚ÇÇ equivalent per person compared with high density high rise it s time for urban planners to start embedding this new understanding of the whole carbon life cycle of a building balancing the impact of urban density and height while accommodating expanding populations to achieve urban sustainability the world will need more parises and fewer manhattans

ukrainian chorus dumka of new york performs on saturday night live will heath tns this weekend saturday night live faced two questions of significantly different orders of magnitude would the show try to find topical humor in the russian invasion of ukraine and of far less importance to the global order but still a noteworthy matter within the snl realm how would it address the return of john mulaney to answer the first question the show avoided an opening comedy sketch altogether and instead began with a performance by ukrainian chorus dumka of new york which sang the hymn prayer for ukraine at the conclusion of the performance cast members kate mckinnon and cecily strong took the stage behind an arrangement of candles that were shown to spell kyiv advertisement article continues below this ad the opening recalled other rare but consequential moments when snl has opted for a more contemplative start to the show as in its first episode after the sept 11 terrorist attacks and a 2012 broadcast that followed the sandy hook school shooting then in his opening monologue mulaney addressed what he acknowledged has been a very complicated year for him mulaney making his fifth appearance as a host has long been seen as an snl success story a former writer and sometime weekend update panelist who became a popular stand up and a star of unexpectedly tender comedy projects like john mulaney the sack lunch bunch advertisement article continues below this ad his past visits to the show promised new installments in signature franchises like the diner lobster bodega bathroom series of musical sketches mulaney had also been a faithful friend on and off the show to pete davidson while davidson was working to preserve his sobriety and improve his mental health but in december 2020 it was reported that mulaney had entered a rehabilitation facility for drug and alcohol abuse as mulaney later explained in a 2021 interview with seth meyers he had first entered rehab in september 2020 exited that october hosted a halloween episode of snl relapsed and returned to rehab after meyers and other friends organized an intervention for him in that time mulaney divorced his wife artist anna marie tendler and began dating actress olivia munn he and munn have a son malcolm who was born in november at the start of his monologue this weekend mulaney said with obvious sarcasm that it is wonderful to be in a place that s always emphasized sobriety and mental health advertisement article continues below this ad he shared the story of his intervention which he said was presented to him as a dinner at a friend s apartment but whose true purpose he knew the moment he entered do you know how bad of a drug problem you have to have if when you open a door and see people gathered your first thought is this is probably an intervention about my drug problem mulaney said there s no other reason people would be behind a door mulaney described the experience of contacting his former drug dealer to tell him he was deleting and blocking him from his phone but before he could do so mulaney said the dealer texted him back to say i only bought drugs to sell to you because i was worried about you and i didn t want you to get worse stuff off the street speaking to the dealer mulaney said this is a weird time to ask but are you a drug dealer he said no i m a painter we talked about this ladies and gentlemen i have no idea how i know this person advertisement article continues below this ad mulaney also talked about being a father to his 12 week old son whose favorite brand of pacifiers was recently recalled even so mulaney said his son continues to eye a bowl full of those pacifiers with a look that seems to say i want to use those but i can t because they could kill me he paused and added welcome to my world homey rite of passage of the week it was mulaney s fifth stint as an snl host which meant it was time for another visit to the show s fabled five timers club it also meant that snl could finally make good on its obligation to paul rudd who crossed that threshold when he hosted the show last december in a curtailed episode that was missing a musical guest and most of the cast because of concerns about covid 19 this time both mulaney and rudd received their welcomes and a single jacket to share between them from other veteran hosts that included steve martin candice bergen tina fey and elliott gould as well as conan o brien who has only hosted once but said he was dropping by to sign up for peacock advertisement article continues below this ad weekend update jokes of the week over at the weekend update desk anchors colin jost and michael che continued to riff on the worldwide fallout from russia s invasion of ukraine jost began this week russia began their invasion of ukraine president putin launched the attack with support from allies like belarus and tucker carlson many analysts were surprised putin went through with the invasion even though it was obviously going to be a colossal mistake but he couldn t back down after all that buildup kind of like how nbc still had to go through with airing the winter olympics experts on russian politics are saying that economic sanctions in the west will not deter putin because his money is in nontraditional assets that are difficult to trace ugh so on top of everything else awful about putin he s also into crypto advertisement article continues below this ad che continued after the invasion of ukraine the russian stock market fell by 30 to negative 90 this is a tough subject to make jokes about i mean in my lifetime i ve seen footage of attacks like this on other countries but never a white one i don t know very much about this whole situation but i have a very close friend who s russian and i asked her what she thought about it and she said michael you no pay me to talk baby i am very impressed by all the ukrainian citizens signing up to defend their country even the famous ones imagine that here if you ever read on the news michael che has joined an american war we have just lost that war musical tradition of the week if you let out a little sigh of relief the moment you saw mulaney operating a subway newsstand at the start of this segment then you probably recognized it as the latest entry in his long running series of musical

the level and durability of revenue growth being exhibited by the three hyperscalers underscores the incredible competitive advantages and insatiable underlying demand for their services according to andrew macken portfolio manager at montaka global investments he says cloud computing is at an inflection point because of the use of artificial intelligence the scale of demand for cloud services caused by the internet of things and the explosion in data analytics accounting rules are the problem his core argument which is summarised in a paper published on montaka s website is that the hyperscalers are seriously undervalued because the market has yet to come to grips with the scale of their growth potential one of the reasons why we think that these businesses are undervalued is because of the way research and development is expensed under accounting rules he tells chanticleer if you re spending us30 billion each year on r d which is roughly what they re doing that reduces your profits today by us30 billion and therefore inflates your perceived earnings multiple advertisement but these r d expenses they re not really expenses because it is not like money that you have to spend to generate this year s revenue they are long term investments that will generate a return actually history has shown that the return on investments from r d for the hyperscalers has been much higher than they even expected macken says the accounting rules disguise the true earnings power of the businesses and therefore their earnings multiples are overstated the stocks trade at the following pe multiples amazon 63 times microsoft 30 times and alphabet 23 times according to s p global market intelligence the businesses look more expensive today than they actually are macken says another reason montaka which is partly owned by magellan co founder chris mackay has built significant positions in alphabet amazon and microsoft is because of the impact of artificial intelligence advertisement macken s ai discussion paper says they have all developed machine learning models tailored for specific scenario based business services including personalisation fraud detection cognitive search intelligent document processing media intelligence and customer intelligence they have important natural advantages in training these models because they have privileged internal datasets that is large and relevant datasets their core businesses have grown over the last two decades and that are near impossible to recreate the paper says they also have access to low cost large scale internal compute and access to the world s best engineering talent most of these ml models are essentially given away any customer can essentially take an ml model off the shelf and relatively easily and cheaply adapt and customise it to their own needs using their own internal datasets the quid pro quo is the customer must use the hyperscaler s compute and storage services the world is at an inflection point macken says the world is at an inflection point where the number of connected devices will explode the internet of things requires the hyperscalers to build services at the edge of networks because it makes no sense to send data back to a centralised data centre advertisement this means machine learning models which were initially trained in the centralised cloud will increasingly be moved to edge devices or an edge server for localised application and ongoing retraining of the localised machine learning this explains why hyperscalers are partnering with mobile networks while increasing their demand for data centre assets macken says another reason why the hyperscalers are heading for increased growth in revenue is because of the rise in the number of applications being developed that require cloud computing support in the five years to 2023 about 500 million ai software applications will be developed and that is about equal to the number of applications developed over the past 40 years he says advertisement finally macken says the market appears to be underestimating the total addressable market for cloud computing he says the expected 2030 aggregate american hyperscaler revenues of about us600 billion is about half the total addressable cloud market of about us1 2 trillion he says these forecasts are based on moving the current on premise it workloads to the cloud it does not include the new workloads that will be created by new ai applications it appears highly plausible that hyperscaler revenue expectations are far too low in the context of the scale of the ai based opportunity that lies ahead montaka s paper says if so then amazon microsoft and alphabet as well as alibaba and tencent will likely surprise investors substantially to the upside over the coming years
share markets were hit over the last week as ukraine tensions escalated culminating in a russian invasion although russia has indicated it does not plan to occupy ukraine it has indicated that its attack is aimed at its demilitarization and denazification while us shares saw a small bounce on wednesday on hopes that a worsening of the energy crisis would be averted this still left us and global shares below the lows they saw in january australian shares were also dragged down with retailers materials and financials hit the hardest more than offsetting gains in defensive sectors like consumer staples and utilities oil prices pushed higher as the conflict escalated with west texas intermediate rising above us100 barrel briefly before pulling back a bit long term bond yields were mixed with fear of higher inflation being offset by safe haven buying metal prices rose but the aud was little changed despite safe haven buying pushing up the usd from their bull market highs late last year or early this year us shares have now fallen 12 nasdaq has fallen 19 and global shares have fallen 10 to their lows in january australian shares fell 10 but they are currently about 2 above that low the market reaction to the ukraine conflict reflects a fear of the unknown about how far the conflict will go how severe sanctions will ultimately be and uncertainty about how severe the economic impact will be with the main threat being through higher energy prices in terms of the latter the key risk is that russia which accounts for about 30 of european gas imports cuts off its supply of gas to europe when prices are already very high with a potential flow on to oil demand at a time when conflict may threaten oil supply in short investors are worried about a stagflationary shock to europe and to a lesser degree the global economy generally with uncertainty over the conflict remaining high the risk is that shares face further weakness in the short term as markets fall defensive trades like utilities health and consumer staples along with energy and hedges like gold which has been a far better hedge through this crisis than bitcoin which just seems to bounce around with shares will likely outperform if the conflict is limited to ukraine with russian gas still flowing to europe and nato not getting involved then the economic fallout will be limited and further share market falls may be no more than another 5 or so of course if gas is cut off and nato countries get involved then the plunge in share markets could be much deeper like another 15 or so however there are several points to make in relation to all of this first russia is aiming to neutralise ukraine to prevent it from joining nato and the conflict there could go on for a while until this is achieved russia has no interest in war with nato and president biden has continued to stress that the us will not engage in military conflict with russia just as it managed to avoid it right through the cold war and ever since the presence of nuclear weapons on both sides remains a huge deterrent here while western sanctions on russia targeting banks financing individuals and technology transfer will have a significant impact on russia the russian energy sector has been excluded with both the us and europe seeking to avoid a further sustained surge in energy prices both oil and gas germany has halted approval of the nord stream 2 pipeline but no gas is flowing through it anyway european exports to russia are just 0 7 of its gdp and us exports to russia and ukraine are less than 0 2 of its gdp so the direct impact on them from say a collapse in the russian economy would be small the main threat will come via a short term hit to confidence which is likely to be brief if the conflict is contained to ukraine and higher energy prices the us economy is less vulnerable on the energy front than europe as it produces and exports more energy than it consumes and imports there is a high risk russia could cut off the flow of gas to europe but with the sanctions carving out the russian energy sector and russia needing the revenue it s unlikely to do so about a third of russian government revenue comes from the energy sector but energy prices are likely to be higher than otherwise reflecting a risk premium as long as uncertainty remains high around the conflict and therefore the risk of supply disruption the same will likely apply to other commodity prices including foodstuffs as ukraine is a significant food producer on balance providing the conflict is limited to ukraine nato troops stay out and russian gas is not cut off the conflict is unlikely to significantly damage global growth but is more of a threat to inflation australia s trade links with russia are trivial with exports to russia accounting for less than 0 1 of gdp and the sanctions on it will have little economic impact on us however the main impacts will be three fold first a positive boost to national income via higher energy and commodity prices as export earnings will see a boost second a higher cost of living mainly via the further boost to oil and hence petrol prices which could easily spike another 10 20 cents a litre in the next two weeks and third a hit to economic activity if global growth slows hitting confidence and export demand but as noted above the latter is likely to be relatively minor source bloomberg amp of course no one really knows for sure how this will all unfold but there is a long history of various crises impacting share markets major events in wars terrorist attacks financial crisis etc and the pattern is the same an initial sharp fall which we have been seeing followed by a rebound based on multiple crises since 1940 the average decline in us shares has been about 6 albeit with a wide range but six months later the market has been up 9 on average and then up 15 on average one year later the same is likely to apply here as well but trying to time this will be very difficult so the best approach is for investors to stick to an appropriate long term investment strategy the ukraine crisis is unlikely to stop central bank monetary tightening but it may prevent rapid tightening moves the uncertainty and hit to confidence it provides in the short term will probably help head off a 0 5 rate hike next month in the us and may at the margin help delay rba tightening but as noted above ultimately the hit to economic activity globally and in australia is likely to be limited and the upwards pressure it adds to energy prices and wider commodity prices will reinforce the case for monetary tightening so we are not making any changes to our interest rate expectations in australia december quarter wages growth at 0 7 qoq and 2 3 yoy was not strong enough to advance the case for a june rba rate hike so we continue to predict the first hike coming in august of course another significant upside surprise on inflation for the march quarter due in late april and a further acceleration in wages growth in the march quarter due in late may and a continuing fall in unemployment could tilt the scales to a june hike but we are not there yet what to watch over the next week in the us jobs data for february friday is expected to remain strong with payrolls to rise another 400 000 and unemployment expected to fall to 3 9 consistent with the fed starting rate hikes at its march meeting in other data expect increases in the ism business condition indexes due tuesday and thursday consistent with gains in pmis eurozone inflation data wednesday is expected to show a further rise and unemployment thursday is expected to be unchanged at 7 in australia the rba is expected to leave monetary policy on hold and reiterate that it will be patient in assessing whether inflation will be sustainably in the 2 3 target band since the rba s last meeting jobs data for january was stronger than expected adding to confidence that unemployment will soon move below 4 and be consistent with full employment but while wages growth picked up in the december quarter it s not yet at the 3 or more pace that the rba would like to see on the data front in australia december quarter gdp wednesday is expected to show a 3 5 qoq rebound after the delta wave hit in the september quarter this will take annual growth to 4 1 and be largely driven by a surge in consumer spending along with strength in public spending and a contribution from inventories with capex soft and dwelling investment and trade detracting from growth in other data releases expect to see a small rise in january retail sales as omicron hit continuing strength in housing credit growth and a further lift in the mi inflation gauge all today housing finance on tuesday is expected to fall 3 and corelogic is expected to report a further slowing in home price growth to just 0 3 mom in february with prices in sydney and melbourne falling slightly building approvals are likely to have fallen 5 after an 8 bounce in december and the trade surplus is likely to rise slightly to 9bn both due thursday australian december half earnings results will

ukrainian chorus dumka of new york performs on saturday night live will heath tns this weekend saturday night live faced two questions of significantly different orders of magnitude would the show try to find topical humor in the russian invasion of ukraine and of far less importance to the global order but still a noteworthy matter within the snl realm how would it address the return of john mulaney to answer the first question the show avoided an opening comedy sketch altogether and instead began with a performance by ukrainian chorus dumka of new york which sang the hymn prayer for ukraine at the conclusion of the performance cast members kate mckinnon and cecily strong took the stage behind an arrangement of candles that were shown to spell kyiv advertisement article continues below this ad the opening recalled other rare but consequential moments when snl has opted for a more contemplative start to the show as in its first episode after the sept 11 terrorist attacks and a 2012 broadcast that followed the sandy hook school shooting then in his opening monologue mulaney addressed what he acknowledged has been a very complicated year for him mulaney making his fifth appearance as a host has long been seen as an snl success story a former writer and sometime weekend update panelist who became a popular stand up and a star of unexpectedly tender comedy projects like john mulaney the sack lunch bunch advertisement article continues below this ad his past visits to the show promised new installments in signature franchises like the diner lobster bodega bathroom series of musical sketches mulaney had also been a faithful friend on and off the show to pete davidson while davidson was working to preserve his sobriety and improve his mental health but in december 2020 it was reported that mulaney had entered a rehabilitation facility for drug and alcohol abuse as mulaney later explained in a 2021 interview with seth meyers he had first entered rehab in september 2020 exited that october hosted a halloween episode of snl relapsed and returned to rehab after meyers and other friends organized an intervention for him in that time mulaney divorced his wife artist anna marie tendler and began dating actress olivia munn he and munn have a son malcolm who was born in november at the start of his monologue this weekend mulaney said with obvious sarcasm that it is wonderful to be in a place that s always emphasized sobriety and mental health advertisement article continues below this ad he shared the story of his intervention which he said was presented to him as a dinner at a friend s apartment but whose true purpose he knew the moment he entered do you know how bad of a drug problem you have to have if when you open a door and see people gathered your first thought is this is probably an intervention about my drug problem mulaney said there s no other reason people would be behind a door mulaney described the experience of contacting his former drug dealer to tell him he was deleting and blocking him from his phone but before he could do so mulaney said the dealer texted him back to say i only bought drugs to sell to you because i was worried about you and i didn t want you to get worse stuff off the street speaking to the dealer mulaney said this is a weird time to ask but are you a drug dealer he said no i m a painter we talked about this ladies and gentlemen i have no idea how i know this person advertisement article continues below this ad mulaney also talked about being a father to his 12 week old son whose favorite brand of pacifiers was recently recalled even so mulaney said his son continues to eye a bowl full of those pacifiers with a look that seems to say i want to use those but i can t because they could kill me he paused and added welcome to my world homey rite of passage of the week it was mulaney s fifth stint as an snl host which meant it was time for another visit to the show s fabled five timers club it also meant that snl could finally make good on its obligation to paul rudd who crossed that threshold when he hosted the show last december in a curtailed episode that was missing a musical guest and most of the cast because of concerns about covid 19 this time both mulaney and rudd received their welcomes and a single jacket to share between them from other veteran hosts that included steve martin candice bergen tina fey and elliott gould as well as conan o brien who has only hosted once but said he was dropping by to sign up for peacock advertisement article continues below this ad weekend update jokes of the week over at the weekend update desk anchors colin jost and michael che continued to riff on the worldwide fallout from russia s invasion of ukraine jost began this week russia began their invasion of ukraine president putin launched the attack with support from allies like belarus and tucker carlson many analysts were surprised putin went through with the invasion even though it was obviously going to be a colossal mistake but he couldn t back down after all that buildup kind of like how nbc still had to go through with airing the winter olympics experts on russian politics are saying that economic sanctions in the west will not deter putin because his money is in nontraditional assets that are difficult to trace ugh so on top of everything else awful about putin he s also into crypto advertisement article continues below this ad che continued after the invasion of ukraine the russian stock market fell by 30 to negative 90 this is a tough subject to make jokes about i mean in my lifetime i ve seen footage of attacks like this on other countries but never a white one i don t know very much about this whole situation but i have a very close friend who s russian and i asked her what she thought about it and she said michael you no pay me to talk baby i am very impressed by all the ukrainian citizens signing up to defend their country even the famous ones imagine that here if you ever read on the news michael che has joined an american war we have just lost that war musical tradition of the week if you let out a little sigh of relief the moment you saw mulaney operating a subway newsstand at the start of this segment then you probably recognized it as the latest entry in his long running series of musical sketches set in familiarly seedy new york locations advertisement article continues below this ad this time around the song and dance numbers are triggered by a subway passenger andrew dismukes

this soup turned out amazing and i didn t even make it exactly by the recipe used butter and olive oil to cook the onion and garlic used 2 small cans of roasted tomatoes and two regular cans didn t have time to simmer for an hour so i only added 4 cups of water and better than bouillon chicken flavor blended with an immersion blender added basil and thyme felt it still needed some saltiness and i added natures seasons we loved it catherine k athens ga this is a really great soup really thick and creamy and flavorful i ve made it many times and have had several friends ask for the recipe and everyone who has made it loves it those who said it was watery must have done it wrong i do like to add 1 4 cup chopped fresh basil toward the end and also a tablespoon or so of sherry vinegar at the very end adds a nice brightness to it super good soup jogrinder california boy am i glad i decided to make this soup before reading the naysayers negative reviews if this soup did not work for you it may be your cooking skills and not the recipe i made this soup followed the recipe with the exception that i used chicken broth in place of the water the recipe calls for and i used oregano in place of the thyme i ll tell you what this soup was flavorful and not tomato water as some referred to the soup one needs to allow this soup to simmer for at least 45 minutes in order to reduce it and blend it in a blender or using an immersion blender i blended half the soup then added the 1 4 cup heavy cream and it was amazing i froze the remaining soup unblended for future use follow the recipe especially the time allotted for simmering and you should get a wonderfully creamy and tasty tomato soup zeelightful oregon so i ve been doing this recipe for years my only revision is i do half water half veggie stock ignore any negative review this soup is delicious anonymous queens ny ignore the negative reviews if you follow the directions correctly it comes out very creamy and flavorful not watery at all it s my go to tomato soup anonymous this recipe was an amazing choice the bad reviews on this soup was most likely due to user error the soup was very delicious and my family thought the same additions for this recipe i substituted the 8 cups of water with 6 cups of vegetable broth as it added more flavor and 8 cups of water is a bit too much in my opinion instead of the 1 4 cup of cream i used around about 2 3 to 1 cup of heavy cream as i felt like it was a bit too thick and definitely helped in the end result i added basil leaves live not dried oregano crushed red pepper and some garlic pepper overall this is a great recipe that can be kept in the refrigerator for a few days to eat i will definitely try this recipe again anonymous la california the soup was definitely not watering i only put 6 cups of water and at the end i put a half a cup of cream and i love it it s delicious i suppose i could have added a little more water but i like a thick soup and i definitely will make it again roderick fetnandez n yc as it stands this recipe isn t very good i ignored the reviews saying it was watery thinking that that was the result of their impatience nope as it currently stands it is watery to make it edible we had to add tons of salt msg and better than bullion i used very high quality tomatoes too and be assured i am one of those cooks that follows the recipe as it is written only making changes on the second go if they are needed i can assure you that as it is written this recipe isn t very good if you must try this recipe i am sure there are many better ones out there use broth it should be noted that my husband and i are fairly accomplished cooks we do not eat processed food nor have we for a few decades we cook almost everything from scratch and i make soup weekly i picked this recipe because i thought it might be palatable for my children my husband and i had roasted poblano tomato soup we both decided it was a bad recipe and i just wanted to let others know to look elsewhere i will be looking at the barefoot contessa and alton brown julie chicago il really enjoyed making this soup it turned out very velvety and creamy i substituted vegetable broth instead of just plain water i also added a little extra cream instead of using thyme i used basil when letting it simmer it did take much longer than 45 minutes for it to reduce but it was fine it s a delicious soup to eat on a cold day lisa n elko nevada great recipe ignore the bad reviews i make this in the summer with fresh tomatoes instead of canned and it s a great celebration of tomato season be sure to concasse the tomatoes to remove the skin and seeds skin doesn t break down in cooking and is not nice to chew seeds will make the soup bitter i also used a mixture of water and vegetable stock to boost the base a little anonymous washington d c this is a wonderful example of people simply not following the recipe and then complaining about the recipe this soup is amazing if you simply let it cook down and reduce different stoves carry head differently obviously will definitely make this again alex kassan indianapolis college park i ve made this a ton and it s so good and easy i will say i am very lazy so i get impatient and don t wait the full time to reduce sorry so i just sub the water with 4 cups veggie stock or water super delish anonymous montreal qc i am making this now if you follow the directions it reduces perfectly it takes about an hour very nice concentrated tomato ey flavor i added some spices that i saw in another ba tomato soup recipe celery seed and oregano it needs a good amount of salt at the end great recipe tonya hardy brookeville md this is my all time favorite tomato soup i ve been making it for years and everyone in my family and my colleagues know to request it for those cold winter days if you pay attention to the recipe and really let it simmer at a higher heat it will reduce by half and not be watery at all i keep my gas stove burner at medium at least to make sure the soup is still bubbling don t cover it at all and plan to let it go for at least an hour so the soup really does reduce by

korbel gold project starter pit scoping study melbourne feb 28 2022 aest abn newswire nova minerals limited asx nva qm3 fra nvaaf otcmkts is pleased to announce the results from its starter pit scoping study the study on the korbel main deposit within the company s flagship estelle gold trend located in alaska s prolific tintina gold belt key outcomes of the study highlight the potential for korbel main to support a large stand alone bulk tonnage open pit mining operation with ideal ore body geometry that allows mining at a very low strip ratio the 9 6 moz gold resource at estelle is hosted within the korbel and rpm deposits representing two of 21 prospects over a 450m2 claim area which is quickly developing into a prospective major gold trend the mineral resource was estimated in accordance with the jorc code 2012 and classified as follows asx announcement 23 december 2021 study deposit korbel main deposit o indicated 286mt 0 3 g t au for 3 0mozs cut off 0 15 au g t o inferred

time focused only on the korbel main deposit and the company has already identified clear opportunities for improvement with ongoing resource drilling programs targeting significant remaining upside at the korbel project which remains wide open in multiple directions as well as the inclusion of the high grade rpm project resources as the company advances next step pre feasibility level studies study highlights study confirms the viability of a stand alone gold operation at the korbel main deposit with a 15 year evaluation period rapid payback period of 3 years production with years 1 3 all

production rate and mine life has the potential to grow significantly with continued drilling programs aimed at increasing and proving up additional resources as demonstrated in recent announcements for korbel and at the high grade rpm gold project as well as further discoveries through ongoing exploration activities across the estelle gold trend immediate upside opportunities to be considered in the pre feasibility study pfs which has already commenced include o increasing the size and confidence of resources at the rpm gold project which currently hosts a maiden 1 5moz inferred resource asx announcement 27 october 2021 and includes the bonanza grade intercepts of 3 5 g t au over 400m which included 132m 10 1 g t au asx announcement 11 october 2021 geophysics and surface sampling has

underway investigating the low cost transportation of high grade rpm ore to a korbel central processing facility o significant upside remaining as step out and infill resource drilling continues across the wider korbel gold project area o ongoing exploration across the entire estelle gold trend nova ceo mr christopher gerteisen commented the company is pleased to announce the strong positive results of the scoping study which was focused on korbel main only to determine whether the resource defined at the deposit to date can support a potentially viable stand alone starter operation korbel main is a key component to the rapid development of the estelle gold trend and expected to contribute a significant portion of future gold production as nova positions itself to supply a market with a strong appetite for gold which continues to gain momentum as high inflation globally government deficits and central banks continue with their stimulus programs bottom line gold is money always has been always will be and nova is in the business to produce gold lots of it completion of the starter scoping study was an excellent achievement for the company and exceeded our expectations in many regards this now provides a solid foundation on which to build as we transition to the project development phase and move rapidly to a pfs which will capture the upside from further significant resource growth expected at both the korbel and rpm projects as we ramp up our 2022 resource drilling programs this year our drill programs and test work are aimed at rapidly converting the current 6 6mozs of inferred resources at both deposits into higher confidence measured and indicated resources as well as advancing the high grade rpm deposit to be included in the next stage pfs we believe the results of the scoping study are a great starting point that demonstrates the technical and economic strengths which come from having a large bulk tonnage project in a tier 1 location it s all upside from here key drivers for these robust returns are the geometry and nature of mineralization within these massive irgs ore bodies which start at surface to allow open pit mining with a very low strip ratio particularly important in the early payback years as well as being readily amenable to ore sorting allowing for significant upgrading of ore feed to mill following the starter scoping study additional key areas and opportunities have already been identified that have the potential to further improve the project s economics estelle has all the hallmarks of a world class gold trend with 9 6 moz in current resource inventory only the start of things to come and multiple exciting targets outside of the korbel and rpm projects which offer huge potential to continue growing the overall resource inventory across the entire trend we are confident that the combination of economic and technical studies and significant resource growth will drive further increases in shareholder value as

said it was preparing to implement steps by the west against some russian banks a move that will inflict a crippling economic blow to moscow but also cause much pain to western companies and banks 3 at least 198 ukrainians including three children have been killed the head of the ukrainian health ministry was quoted by the interfax news agency as saying 4 russia blew up a natural gas pipeline in ukraine s second city kharkiv although russia continues to supply europe with gas via ukraine 5 refugees continued to pour across ukraine s western borders with around 100 000 reaching poland in two

pipeline in kharkiv russian troops have blown up a natural gas pipeline in the ukrainian city of kharkiv ukraine s state service of special communications and information protection said on sunday a mushroom shaped explosion was shown in a video it posted on the telegram messaging app 06 16am european commission chief ursula von der leyen on saturday said that brussels would propose to freeze the assets of the russian central bank in a major escalation of sanctions against moscow following the invasion of ukraine von der leyen also said the eu would remove certain russian banks from the swift payment system in response to a key demand of kyiv to punish russian president vladimir putin these new measures will cripple putin s ability to finance his war machine von der leyen said she was speaking after a videoconference with the leaders of the united states germany france italy and canada intended to coordinate the west s response to the invasion the allies also agreed to further restrictions on russian oligarchs including measures to limit the sale of citizenship so called golden passports that let wealthy russians connected to the russian government become citizens of our countries von der leyen said she would make the proposals to eu leaders who could request amendments to minimise the effect of the measures on their economies the new wave of sanctions was an extraordinary leap forward in just a few days that was made possible by a sudden reversal by germany on its opposition to restricting russia from swift swift s messaging system allows banks to communicate rapidly and securely about transactions and cutting russia off would cripple its trade with most of the world italy hungary and cyprus were also opposed to the swift ban but have come around to the idea in the face of international outrage against russia s invasion of its neighbour in an apparent concession to berlin the powers agreed that the ban would only apply to selected banks in order to avoid the measure backfiring too harshly on european businesses in probably the most unexpected new measure against putin the powers agreed to limit the russian central bank s ability to access its vast foreign reserves these are estimated to be over 600 billion and are the vast windfall of russia s immense energy wealth this will freeze its transactions and it will make it impossible for the central bank to liquidate its assets von der leyen

russia s war and the global economy now that russian president vladimir putin has launched a full scale invasion of ukraine we must consider the economic and financial consequences of this massive historic development the ukraine war is not just another minor globally inconsequential conflict of the kind seen in recent decades this is a major escalation of cold war ii in which four revisionist powers china russia iran and north korea are increasingly challenging the long global dominance of the united states and the western led international order that it created after world war ii the risk now is that markets and political analysts will underestimate the implications of this global regime shift by the close of the market on february 24 the day of the invasion us stock markets had risen in the hope that the war would slow down rate hikes by the us federal reserve yet in terms of the broader economy a global stagflationary recession is now highly likely analysts are asking themselves if the fed and other major central banks can achieve a soft landing from this crisis and its fallout don t count on it the war in ukraine will trigger a massive negative supply shock to the global economy reducing growth and further increasing inflation at a time when inflation expectations are already becoming unanchored the short term financial market impact of the war is already foreseeable in the face of a massive risk off stagflationary shock global equities may move from the current correction range 10 into bear market territory 20 or more safe government bond yields will fall for a while and then rise after inflation becomes unmoored oil and natural gas prices will spike further to well above 100 per barrel as will many other commodity prices as both russia and ukraine are major exporters of raw materials and food safe haven currencies such as the swiss franc will strengthen and gold prices will rise further the economic and financial fallout from the war and the resulting stagflationary shock will of course be largest in russia and ukraine followed by the european union owing to its heavy dependence on russian gas but the us will suffer too because world energy markets are so deeply integrated a spike in global oil prices represented by the brent benchmark will strongly affect us crude oil west texas intermediate prices yes the us is now a minor net energy exporter however the macro distribution of the shock will be negative while a small cohort of energy firms will reap higher profits households and businesses will experience a massive price shock leading them to reduce spending given these dynamics even an otherwise strong us economy will suffer a sharp slowdown tilting toward a stagflationary growth recession tighter financial conditions and the resulting effects on business consumer and investor confidence will exacerbate the negative macro consequences of russia s invasion both in the us and globally likewise the coming sanctions against russia however large or limited they turn out to be and however necessary they are for future deterrence inevitably will hurt not only russia but also the us the west and emerging markets moreover one cannot rule out the possibility that russia will respond to new western sanctions with its own countermeasure namely sharply reducing oil production in order to drive up global oil prices even more such a move would yield a net benefit for russia so long as the additional increase in oil prices is larger than the loss of oil exports putin knows that he can inflict asymmetrical damage on western economies and markets because he has spent the better part of the last decade building up a war chest and creating a financial shield against additional economic sanctions a deep stagflationary shock is a nightmare scenario for central banks which will be damned if they react and damned if they don t in an environment of rising inflation where central banks are already behind the curve slower policy tightening could accelerate the de anchoring of inflation expectations further exacerbating stagflation but if central banks remain hawkish or become more hawkish the looming recession will become more severe although central banks should confront the return of inflation aggressively they most likely will try to fudge it as they did in the 1970s they will argue that the problem is temporary and that monetary policy cannot affect or undo an exogenous negative supply shock when the moment of truth comes they will probably blink opting for slower monetary tightening to avoid triggering an even more severe recession this will further de anchor inflation expectations politicians meanwhile will try to dampen the negative supply shock in the us policymakers will try to mitigate the rise in gasoline prices by drawing down its strategic petroleum reserves and by nudging saudi arabia to increase oil production but these measures will have only a limited effect because widespread fears of further price spikes will result in global energy hoarding nor can western leaders rely on fiscal policy to counter the growth dampening effects of the stagflationary shock for one thing the us and many other advanced economies are running out of fiscal ammunition having pulled out all the stops in response to the covid 19 pandemic more to the point a fiscal demand stimulus is the wrong policy response to a stagflationary supply shock though it may reduce the negative growth impact of the shock it will add to inflationary pressure and if leaders rely on both monetary and fiscal policy in responding to the shock the stagflationary consequences will become even more severe owing to the heightened effect on inflation expectations it is tempting to think that the russia ukraine conflict will have only a minor and temporary economic and financial impact after all russia represents merely 3 of the global economy and ukraine much less but the arab states that imposed an oil embargo in 1973 and revolutionary iran in 1979 represented an even smaller share of global gdp than russia does today putin s war will strike a massive blow to global confidence at a time when the fragile recovery was already entering a period of uncertainty and rising inflationary pressures the knock on effects from the ukraine crisis will be anything but transitory copyright project syndicate

a key feature of the international community s response to russia s aggression against ukraine has been the adoption of sanctions but what exactly are sanctions and how do they operate in practice and most importantly are they likely to have any meaningful impact what are sanctions sanctions are coercive measures that can be applied to diplomatic economic and cultural relations between states commonly non military in nature they are imposed by one state against another unilateral sanctions or by an international organisation such as the united nations collective sanctions advertisement historically measures have ranged from comprehensive sanctions to more targeted measures prohibiting trade in particular items such as arms timber or diamonds some sanctions have circumscribed particular activities understood to benefit a target such as diplomatic sporting and cultural relations as well as travel they have also targeted particular individuals and groups who pose a threat to peace and security including political elites rebel groups or terrorist organisations how do economic sanctions operate in practice economic sanctions are multidimensional they tend to include travel bans and financial sanctions financial sanctions consist of targeted asset freezes and restrictions on a wide variety of financial markets and services where the financial sanction is an asset freeze it is generally prohibited to deal with the frozen funds held by a designated person or entity funds are defined to include financial assets of every kind cash cheques money orders credit debts stocks and shares interest dividends or other income from or generated by assets the designation of targeted individuals and entities can occur on the basis of a national listing procedure or this designation may happen as a result of a sanctions regime adopted by an international organisation which is then implemented by its members this twin track approach is generally reflected in the sanctions practice of states which maintain consolidated lists separate consolidated lists are kept for those individuals and entities listed on the basis of unilateral sanctions and those listed as a consequence of collective sanctions some international best practice exists regarding sanctions implementation such as guidance by the g7 financial action task force but compliance will always depend on individual countries and the particular features of domestic companies financial institutions such as banks will have in place automated procedures to filter incoming transactions before entering and outgoing transactions before leaving their internal systems are economic sanctions effective they can be the impact on listed individuals and entities can be severe as illustrated by the internationally litigated cases of kadi and al barakaat international foundation v council of the european union or nada v switzerland both cases in the context of financial counter terrorism sanctions however the general effectiveness of economic sanctions is uncertain not least because it is empirically difficult to measure it according to dursun peksen a sanctions expert at the university of memphis economic sanctions result in meaningful behavioural change in the targeted country about 40 of the time yet as a recent study by the us government demonstrates establishing clear causality is impossible for example a sanctioned country or individual may decide to change their behaviour for many reasons some of these changes may be unrelated to the sanctions what sanctions are now applied against russia the international community has imposed a mix of economic and diplomatic sanctions with countries acting both unilaterally and collectively the us and the uk have introduced unilateral sanctions targeting russia s two largest banks sberbank and vtb bank they have also frozen the assets and restricted travel of key russian oligarchs canada and australia have followed suit germany has indicated it is abandoning the nord stream 2 baltic sea gas pipeline project designed to double the flow of russian gas direct to the country poland czech republic bulgaria and estonia have closed their airspace for russian airlines as for collective sanctions the un security council will remain unable to impose any sanctions due to the veto power russia holds as a permanent member indeed russia has already used this veto power to block a resolution condemning the invasion of ukraine the eu on the other hand has quickly introduced asset freezes and travel bans preventing listed individuals from entering or transiting through eu territory eu sanctions now apply to 555 russian individuals and 52 entities including 351 members of the russian state duma who have backed the aggression against ukraine the eu has since moved to adopt further sanction packages which include targeting president putin and foreign minister lavrov directly together with the us and the uk the eu has also agreed to remove select russian banks from the swift banking system the financial messaging infrastructure that links the world s banks the council of europe in strasbourg has also applied unprecedented diplomatic sanctions it has suspended russia from its rights of representation in the committee of ministers and in the parliamentary assembly are the sanctions likely to have any meaningful impact too early to say but probably not in the short term the unilateral and collective sanctions that have been applied are comprehensive they have also been adopted swiftly some of the measures such as targeting putin and lavrov personally are unprecedented on the other hand significant gaps remain and pose a considerable risk of fragmentation the example of switzerland is a case in point the swiss government has voiced support for complementing eu sanctions yet it has so far shied away from applying targeted asset freezes of those individuals listed by the eu the us and other countries as a new york times analysis details there is also growing concern russian companies may evade sanctions by turning to cryptocurrency tools including the so called digital ruble and ransomware the conversation pti

earlier i wrote on what s going on with malaysia s covid 19 booster shots malaysiakini february 21 2022 it was based on the world health organization s who interim statement on booster doses for covid 19 vaccination where they concluded that introducing booster doses should be firmly evidence driven who said there s no evidence healthy children and adolescents need boosters and warned that blanket booster programmes could prolong the pandemic and increase inequity repeating booster doses of the original covid vaccines is not a viable strategy against emerging variants and is unlikely to be appropriate or sustainable and booster campaigns won t end the pandemic mainstream news said research suggests that getting a booster can decrease risk of infection and severe illness but are the research at phases 1 4 or 5 medical journal jama reported protection should be long lasting immune correlates of protections have not been established for sars cov 2 vaccines although initial observations based on the moderna vaccine suggest that neutralising antibodies can serve as a measure of protection and that approximately 68 of protection can be attributed to the antibody level however it is still in its infancy and individual antibody levels as measured by myriad commercial assays do not offer a useful indicator as to whether a booster dose is needed and their use outside of clinical research should be discouraged why then is the health ministry moh rushing for sinovac recipients and seniors to get boosters now extended to march 31 it is said people who have a moderately or severely weakened immune system should get an additional primary shot and a booster shot but boosters don t block infections for long repeated boosters of existing vaccines also probably offer only diminishing returns in terms of protection against future strains are senior citizens the experimental rats for moh and if people who have a moderately or severely weakened immune system should get boosted why the blanket directive on all this is not a matter of any booster jab is better than no booster jab are booster shots now mandatory also why the rush for the proposed amendments to act 342 some clauses may need updating but existing laws are not enforced fairly and consistently do we need new laws the amendments may cause even more unnecessary sufferings since stakeholders were not engaged in its drafting was there proper regulatory risk impact assessment to see the impact on the economy especially in this pandemic you hope in the next parliament sitting to gain the trust of the public and get bipartisan support because public compliance is important we understand it is a crisis and not tying one s hands behind moh s back also do not forget to ensure effective implementation and not to further burden the rakyat by the way have the engagements started in march last year health expert dr amar singh hss calculated 30 of our population of 32 million are aged below 18 and not indicated for vaccination two to 3 of women are pregnant or breastfeeding and have generally deferred vaccination at least 1 will be too ill and a modest 10 will choose not to vaccinate it leaves us with only 55 60 of the population to be vaccinated in june last year it was reported that malaysia ordered enough vaccines to cover 109 of its population who qualify for inoculation with the aim of achieving herd immunity this was done after calculating the number of people above 18 years old and those suitable to receive the vaccination in july you said malaysia has secured enough to cover over 130 of the entire population on august 16 2021 the government procured 87 9 million doses equivalent to about 2 7 doses per person estimated at rm4 64 billion there were also about five million doses donations from the united states britain japan china saudi arabia and the united arab emirates therefore we had about 93 million doses of vaccines didn t moh know about amar s calculation and keep increasing vaccine orders since june 2021 did the government plan for booster shots for everyone since mid 2021 with 93 million doses are the vaccine stocks nearing expiry and the rush to get sinovac recipients boosted is to reduce the number of vaccines to be disposed of i got my astrazeneca booster shot on saturday and the expiry date is april 2022 and who is aware of the short shelf life especially astrazeneca the rush has also unnecessarily influenced selangor to require congregants to have the booster to be able to perform friday prayers as of yesterday 8 32am the covidnow portal showed 78 8 of the population got two doses total shots were 66 9 million but the sum total of all doses added up to 67 2 million a difference of 207 230 why the discrepancy we want moh to succeed and focus very firmly on the fight against covid 19 and not misspend your time handling suits and countersuits we trust there will be more transparency and hopefully this will reduce speculations and you will get all the support in the meantime please respond what say you february 28 2022 saleh mohammed reads the malaysian insight this is the opinion of the writer or

follow us on image source ap russian president vladimir putin looks on as he visits the construction site of the national space agency in moscow highlights sanctions are generally imposed by one state against another sanctions can also be imposed by an international organisation such as the united nations some sanctions have circumscribed particular activities understood to benefit a target a key feature of the international community s response to russia s aggression against ukraine has been the adoption of sanctions but what exactly are sanctions and how do they operate in practice and most importantly are they likely to have any meaningful impact what are sanctions sanctions are coercive measures that can be applied to diplomatic economic and cultural relations between states commonly non military in nature they are imposed by one state against another unilateral sanctions or by an international organisation such as the united nations collective sanctions historically measures have ranged from comprehensive sanctions to more targeted measures prohibiting trade in particular items such as arms timber or diamonds some sanctions have circumscribed particular activities understood to benefit a target such as diplomatic sporting and cultural relations as well as travel they have also targeted particular individuals and groups who pose a threat to peace and security including political elites rebel groups or terrorist organisations how do economic sanctions operate in practice economic sanctions are multidimensional they tend to include travel bans and financial sanctions financial sanctions consist of targeted asset freezes and restrictions on a wide variety of financial markets and services where the financial sanction is an asset freeze it is generally prohibited to deal with the frozen funds held by a designated person or entity funds are defined to include financial assets of every kind cash cheques money orders credit debts stocks and shares interest dividends or other income from or generated by assets the designation of targeted individuals and entities can occur on the basis of a national listing procedure or this designation may happen as a result of a sanctions regime adopted by an international organisation which is then implemented by its members this twin track approach is generally reflected in the sanctions practice of states which maintain consolidated lists separate consolidated lists are kept for those individuals and entities listed on the basis of unilateral sanctions and those listed as a consequence of collective sanctions some international best practice exists regarding sanctions implementation such as guidance by the g7 financial action task force but compliance will always depend on individual countries and the particular features of domestic companies financial institutions such as banks will have in place automated procedures to filter incoming transactions before entering and outgoing transactions before leaving their internal systems are economic sanctions effective they can be the impact on listed individuals and entities can be severe as illustrated by the internationally litigated cases of kadi and al barakaat international foundation v council of the european union or nada v switzerland both cases in the context of financial counter terrorism sanctions however the general effectiveness of economic sanctions is uncertain not least because it is empirically difficult to measure it according to dursun peksen a sanctions expert at the university of memphis economic sanctions result in meaningful behavioural change in the targeted country about 40 of the time yet as a recent study by the us government demonstrates establishing clear causality is impossible for example a sanctioned country or individual may decide to change their behaviour for many reasons some of these changes may be unrelated to the sanctions what sanctions are now applied against russia the international community has imposed a mix of economic and diplomatic sanctions with countries acting both unilaterally and collectively the us and the uk have introduced unilateral sanctions targeting russia s two largest banks sberbank and vtb bank they have also frozen the assets and restricted the travel of key russian oligarchs canada and australia have followed suit germany has indicated it is abandoning the nord stream 2 baltic sea gas pipeline project designed to double the flow of russian gas direct to the country poland czech republic bulgaria and estonia have closed their airspace for russian airlines as for collective sanctions the un security council will remain unable to impose any sanctions due to the veto power russia holds as a permanent member indeed russia has already used this veto power to block a resolution condemning the invasion of ukraine the eu on the other hand has quickly introduced asset freezes and travel bans preventing listed individuals from entering or transiting through eu territory eu sanctions now apply to 555 russian individuals and 52 entities including 351 members of the russian state duma who have backed the aggression against ukraine the eu has since moved to adopt further sanction packages which include targeting president putin and foreign minister lavrov directly together with the us and the uk the eu has also agreed to remove select russian banks from the swift banking system the financial messaging infrastructure that links the world s banks the council of europe in strasbourg has also applied unprecedented diplomatic sanctions it has suspended russia from its rights of representation in the committee of ministers and in the parliamentary assembly are the sanctions likely to have any meaningful impact too early to say but probably not in the short term the unilateral and collective sanctions that have been applied are comprehensive they have also been adopted swiftly some of the measures such as targeting putin and lavrov personally are unprecedented on the other hand significant gaps remain and pose a considerable risk of fragmentation the example of switzerland is a case in point the swiss government has voiced support for complementing eu sanctions yet it has so far shied away from applying targeted asset freezes of those individuals listed by the eu the us and other countries as a new york times analysis details there is also a growing concern russian companies may evade sanctions by turning to cryptocurrency tools including the so called digital ruble and ransomware also read india abstains
