the recent decade has shown that forecasters need to continuously adapt their tools to cope with increasing macroeconomic complexity just like the global crisis the current covid 19 pandemic highlights once again that forecasters cannot be content with just assessing the single most likely future outcome such as a single number for future gdp growth in a certain year instead a characterisation of all possible outcomes i e the entire distribution is necessary to understand the likelihood and nature of extreme events this is key for central bank forecasters as well as pointed out by ecb executive board member philip lane in his opening remarks at the 11th conference on forecasting techniques central banks rely heavily on forecasts to design their policy and need robust techniques to navigate through turbulent times they not only ensure price stability and are thus directly interested in the most likely future inflation path but in the process also contribute to the understanding managing and handling of macro economic risks and thus need to grasp the likelihood of extreme events see also the discussion in greenspan 2004 to enhance the collective understanding of new techniques which could potentially cope with the challenges posed by extreme events e g pandemics natural disasters such as floods or wildfires and shifting trends e g climate change demographics the ecb dedicated the conference to forecasting in abnormal times the conference participants leading experts in the field considered regime shifts and large outliers as particularly important challenges for central bank forecasters at the current juncture figure 1 and this is what many of the presentations tackled figure 1 what is the primary challenge in macroeconomic forecasting in central banks right now source survey of leading forecasting experts within 11th ecb conference on forecasting techniques 75 replies many of the contributions covered either of two strategies for improving forecasting models in a forecasting landscape dominated by the covid 19 pandemic the first strategy amounts to sheltering standard forecasting models such as vars and factor models against extreme events the second strategy aims at explicitly modelling economic dynamics in extreme states of the economy acknowledging that economic variables interact differently in such cases whereas these two strategies currently evolve rather independently they could complement each other going forward bringing the classical approach up to speed several recent studies propose ways to make the classical vector autoregression var model work through turbulent times the large shocks during the covid 19 pandemic have such strong effects on parameter estimates that they can lead to implausible forecasts while it is straightforward to cope with a single extreme observation by outlier correction this approach reaches its limits in case of a sequence of large shocks recent studies propose to place less weight on covid 19 observations by allowing for a higher volatility of the associated residuals lenza and primiceri 2020 carriero et al 2021 propose an alternative approach which combines stochastic time variation in volatility with an outlier correction mechanism in his keynote speech joshua chan pointed out that stochastic volatility is a long standing feature of macro economic data and that accounting for it improved the forecasting properties of large scale vars already prior to covid 19 in his keynote speech chris sims argued that structural shocks hitting the economy are better understood and identified by examining changes in the co occurrence of large fluctuations in multiple key macroeconomic quantities vars are a workhorse model hence the focus on them but actually it is not only vars that are affected by the abnormal observations this is the case also for most other standard time series models and in fact also for fully fledged structural models i e dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models dsges which are also being adapted to account for the unprecedented nature of the pandemic shock cardani et al 2020 forecasting benefits from bringing in relevant off model information such as expert judgement this holds even more so under extreme events banbura et al 2021 show that enriching pure model based forecasts with information provided by the survey of professional forecasters can be a valid way to improve the forecasting performance the new ambition modelling the entire distribution and non linearities if extreme events become more frequent policy must pay even more attention to possible tail outcomes in contrast to the strategy described in the previous section which largely neutralises extreme events the second strategy tries to tackle extreme events head on by explicitly modelling their dynamics one line of work starts from the observation that economic dynamics partly depend on the state of the economy for instance dynamics may differ between a deep recession and an expansion the increasingly popular growth at risk gar approach explores this possibility by modelling the dependence of economic dynamics on the direction and the size of the most recent shocks in this way it allows for different dynamics during a crisis see korobilis et al 2021 for an application to inflation gonzalez rivera et al 2021 build on the growth at risk approach arguing that for measuring vulnerabilities under extreme events such as a pandemic one should think in terms of scenarios their approach is inspired by the stress testing literature which had been developed to grasp tail risk in financial markets the combination of the growth at risk approach with scenarios for selected extreme economic developments provides a way to understand how the economy is affected by large shocks caldara et al 2021 show that regime switching models provide a promising alternative to the growth at risk approach a more recent and more radical approach to handle non linear economic dynamics in a flexible way is inspired by machine learning techniques several approaches combine time series techniques with regression trees these techniques model state dependence by piece wise linear models defining the states by purely data driven methods to avoid overfitting shrinkage and model averaging techniques have long been used to focus on the most relevant predictors in the context of machine learning shrinkage helps to achieve robust outcomes by averaging across many trees such as random forests coulombe 2021 or in combination with bayesian techniques clark et al 2021 the latter show that this flexible modelling of non linearities can help with forecasting not only the conditional mean but also tail risk the winning paper in the phd student competition kutateladze 2021 applies a kernel trick to estimate non linear dynamic factor models with highly non linear patterns the new developments are data intensive and their growing popularity is thus closely linked to the emergence of big data even with big data though the modelling of non linearities may remain fragile higher model complexity comes with a lack of robustness and the black box critique it is possible to enhance the interpretability of machine learning techniques via post estimation analysis buckmann et al 2021 at this juncture the lasting success of these models remains to be seen complements not substitutes the two strategies laid out in this column evolve rather independently in the current literature but they could complement and enrich each other going forward our conference survey shows that the classic approach has by no means become obsolete more than half of the participants indicated that they are using vars in their work at the same time there is a broad consensus that more research on new indicators and on modelling nonlinear dynamics is necessary figure 2 for that the classic and the new approach may learn from each other the conference revealed some gaps which can be filled via the complements between the two approaches figure 2 which are the most important avenues for future research in forecasting source survey of leading forecasting experts within the 11th ecb conference on forecasting techniques 46 replies two response options were allowed learning about the nature of non linearities helps make linear models more robust the wide range of big datasets available allows for constructing statistics which capture nonlinearity or risk at a higher frequency than ever before in this way certain types of nonlinearities may be introduced into linear models from microeconomic indicators conversely the success of new indicators in linear models for capturing nonlinearities in the economy might inspire the development of targeted nonlinear models this coincidence of wants might be reflected in big data ranked as the most important research avenue by conference participants figure 2 high frequency and big data already brought substantial gains in the now casting of the economy during the early covid 19 crisis due to the unprecedented speed with which economic events were unfolding novel high frequency variables such as credit card data mobility data google trends or booking information proved to be extremely useful in the real time monitoring of economic developments see antolin diaz et al 2021 or woloszko 2020 detailing the oecd weekly tracker this also came along with technical innovations on dealing with the short history of these data the implications of time varying uncertainty for updating the forecasts with incoming news labonne 2020 and on the robust forecasting of highly non stationary series castle et al 2020 2021 appreciating forecasts of uncertainty uncertainties have increased over the last years and it has become even more pressing to address them properly statistical models help translate historical patterns into the present situation inevitably this did not work too well during the pandemic which can be viewed as historically unique the covid 19 shock is not the usual macroeconomic shock as discussed early on in the pandemic by baldwin and di mauro 2020 in such situations one should strike for a balance between the predictions based on statistical models and those based on economic reasoning for instance via theoretical models appropriately measuring uncertainty is important on its own after all uncertainty is not a lack of precision chris sims vividly pointed out that there is a tendency for model developers and users to say that a model yielding very high uncertainty bands is not precise but this high uncertainty might in fact be an appropriate description of the state of the economy therefore policymakers should encourage models that say exactly how big the uncertainty is even when it is unpleasant news authors note papers presentations and videos of the conference can be viewed on the

on the boil procook is looking to become a household name this year is shaping up to be a bumper one for stock market flotations more than 80 companies have already listed their shares so far raising around 14billion between them by december the total number of firms will be even higher with proceeds topping 15billion many of these shares are only offered to individual investors once they have floated a travesty of stock market justice as wealth has highlighted in recent months but it seems as if some businesses are beginning to do things differently offering their shares to investors large and small life science reit life science reit is one such business the company is seeking to raise 300million via a 1 a share offer and it will be the first london listed company to focus exclusively on life science properties from laboratories to manufacturing sites and specially configured offices once science was primarily associated with men in white coats and bunsen burners today drug development is as much about artificial intelligence and digital data gathering as it is about test tubes and experiments that means those working in the industry from academic professors to multinational businesses need high tech sites with huge digital capacity so they can conduct research and create tomorrow s new medicines many of the best and brightest firms are in and around oxford cambridge and london these cities are home to four of the top ten research universities in the world so attract clever scientists fast growing businesses and investors looking for good opportunities yet uk life science firms have far less space than their us counterparts oxford and cambridge have five million square feet of purpose built laboratories between them boston home of harvard university has 30million square feet shortage of supply has created growing demand with firms striving to find top quality space so they can conduct research develop new drugs and produce them here in the uk rather than overseas life science reit aims to redress the balance between supply and demand while benefiting from the generous rents that sector specialists are prepared to pay the group has a pipeline of deals valued at 445million with six transactions worth 305million already at an advanced stage manager simon farnsworth therefore expects to spend the proceeds of the flotation within six months allowing the firm to start paying dividends next summer targeting an annual yield of 4 per cent in 2022 rising to 5 per cent the follow ing year sites to be acquired include a company whose research contributed to the development of covid 19 vaccines and a gene therapy business analysing dna to help cure alzheimer s disease these sites are all within the life science golden triangle of st pancras in london oxford and cambridge where demand is most acute farnsworth a career property man is highly selective about the deals that he pursues but he is also ambitious hoping to build life

home to seek their fortune but would meet their mother peggy every sunday for lunch a family of keen cooks they each tried to outdo the other with the quality of their cuisine in 1996 their hobby turned into a business when the family launched a mail order firm professional cookware shops followed and in 2005 the firm began to sell online the financial crisis sent it into administration but daniel o neill bought it back cut the number of shops to 13 invested in the website and relaunched it as procook growth has been steady ever since revenues rose from about 8million in 2008 to more than 53million in the year to april 2021 with sales expected to be even higher this year profits have soared as well reaching 8 5million last year having started with saucepans the firm sells a wide range of essentials from knives to dinner sets to chopping boards all under the procook brand there are more than 50 shops openings due before christmas and a thriving website now o neill is keen to take procook a stage further via a flotation which should value the business at up to 250million shares will be priced early next week and available to retail investors via aj bell hargreaves lansdown and other intermediaries procook differs from firms such as tefal and le creuset as products are sold directly to consumers either online or in its stores this allows o neill to offer similar goods to his competitors at cheaper prices while still making a healthy profit the 56 year old vowed after the 2008 crisis never to rely on bank debt so procook has a robust balance sheet and intends to pay attractive dividends while delivering long term share price growth o neill and his family are likely to sell between 25 per cent and 40 per cent of their business through the flotation so they will be

the big shareholder groups in betmakers technology group ltd asx bet have power over the company institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones warren buffett said that he likes a business with enduring competitive advantages that is run by able and owner oriented people so it s nice to see some insider ownership because it may suggest that management is owner oriented betmakers technology group is not a large company by global standards it has a market capitalization of au 1 0b which means it wouldn t have the attention of many institutional investors our analysis of the ownership of the company below shows that institutions are noticeable on the share registry we can zoom in on the different ownership groups to learn more about betmakers technology group check out our latest analysis for betmakers technology group what does the institutional ownership tell us about betmakers technology group many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market so they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices as you can see institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in betmakers technology group this can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community however it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors they too get it wrong sometimes when multiple institutions own a stock there s always a risk that they are in a crowded trade when such a trade goes wrong multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast this risk is higher in a company without a history of growth you can see betmakers technology group s historic earnings and revenue below but keep in mind there s always more to the story we note that hedge funds don t have a meaningful investment in betmakers technology group tekkorp holdings llc is currently the company s largest shareholder with 13 of shares outstanding with 6 3 and 4 8 of the shares outstanding respectively paradice investment management pty ltd and new york life investment management llc are the second and third largest shareholders furthermore ceo todd buckingham is the owner of 1 7 of the company s shares a deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority while studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock s expected performance there are plenty of analysts covering the stock so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting too insider ownership of betmakers technology group while the precise definition of an insider can be subjective almost everyone considers board members to be insiders company management run the business but the ceo will answer to the board even if he or she is a member of it insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company however high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company this can be negative in some circumstances it seems insiders own a significant proportion of betmakers technology group ltd it has a market capitalization of just au 1 0b and insiders have au 108m worth of shares in their own names it is great to see insiders so invested in the business it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying recently general public ownership the general public holds a 47 stake in betmakers technology group while this group can t necessarily call the shots it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run private equity ownership private equity firms hold a 13 stake in betmakers technology group this suggests they can be influential in key policy decisions sometimes we see private equity stick around for the long term but generally speaking they have a shorter investment horizon and as the name suggests don t invest in public companies much after some time they may look to sell and redeploy capital elsewhere next steps i find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company but to truly gain insight we need to consider other information too consider for instance the ever present spectre of investment risk we ve identified 1 warning sign with betmakers

as a self identified intersectional hood feminist i love the freedom that halloween offers to express oneself in the campiest and sluttiest of outfits this phenomenon has always intrigued me and as a sexologist i am perfectly pro halloween and all its campy cleavage wielding scantily clad costumes i often wonder however why society pressures female identified people to dress as scantily clad as possible when did halloween go from haunting to hedonistic to better understand this evolutionary occurrence i took a deep dive into the history of halloween and its spooky annals the origins of halloween are rooted in the pagan practices of the ancient celtic holiday samhain photo adobe stock this day signified the time in which celebrants would welcome in the harvest while honoring the beginning of the dark half of the year and the night in which the veil between the physical world and the spirit world breaks down allowing the opposing worlds to collide and fostering an opportunity for interaction between humans and dwellers of the otherworld america however would not see the onset of halloween traditions until the middle of the 19th century thus while annual autumn festivities were familiar it was the irish fleeing the potato famine that would bring us the halloween tradition of trick or treat and costumes we know today that would further fuel the popularity of halloween celebrations nationally then in 1907 a pittsburgh paper reported the masquerading of girls as tomboys on halloween at this time individuals experienced persecution through an arrest for cross dressing and homosexuality was a crime however by 1912 there was such a prevalence of cross dressing in pittsburgh that the police declared that they would no longer stop any cross dressers during the holiday simultaneously the great migration brought thousands of former enslaved people to the north in hopes of a new life as a result black people flooded cities like chicago and new york this great migration brought forth black culture and traditions to create thriving artistic communities that ushered in jazz and the ever popular drag balls in 1935 alfred finnie an african american queer street hustler and gambler founded what became known as chicago s best drag ball which would eventually become the must attend event of the season the ball was even profiled by ebony magazine in 1952 photo ebony magazine for both black and white queer communities halloween became an outlet for people to safely play outside the restrictive and oppressive lines of the gender binary these events also allowed people to embody play and experiment with their gender variant desires yet there should be no surprise as the lgbtq community has long been a vital part of pagan tradition even in early celtic cultures often taking on the role of priests shamans witches and healers who performed as a spirit medium during halloween season and beyond throughout the late 1940s through the 1970s halloween drag balls were in full swing however they were not popular everywhere you would primarily find them in big cities like new york and chicago by contrast most of the american population discouraged the switching of perceived gender roles during the festive holiday the united states was a robust nation that prided itself on building the wholesome nuclear family structure that adhered to strict gender norms and respectability politics thus began the commercialization of halloween as a time when neighbors came together to celebrate their communities with festive gatherings for children who would go door to door dressed as in their favorite characters for candy a far cry from the origins of warding off spirits and things that go bump in the night i believe we began to see the onset of hyper sexualized costumes through the practice of extreme gender stereotypes of children s costumes these oversimplified notions further created social norms that are divisive and exclusionary costumes would often portray girls as princesses or homemakers that oozed femininity and subordination to the patriarchy while boys costumes were depicted as solid villains warriors or criminals there was added emphasis on robust masculinity that tends to lead to a more toxic depiction of masculinity photo adobe stock while these hyper binary costumes were viewed as cute and wholesome no one appeared to foresee their long term effects throughout the sexual revolution where americans practiced free love through premarital sex we celebrated women in the workplace and access to birth control was on the rise yet today as a nation we continue to maintain rigid gender norms and patriarchal ideology in our halloween holiday celebrations there is no better example of that than the 2004 cult classic mean girls in which the now ubiquitous phrase slut o ween radically supercharged the idea of women dressing provocatively on this night without care or concern the film went on to justify the patriarchal practice with the infamous line halloween is the one night a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it empowering or problematic one could see it either way i ve always taken pride in my creativity and industrious diy skills to put together elaborate costumes yet i am not above personal critique and as i began to write this piece i took a walk down memory lane to examine my costume choices and realized that historically i have often utilized the holiday to unleash my inner hot thot photo adobe stock this required me to pause and explore the possibility that patriarchy had duped me into subconsciously exploiting myself for the pleasure of the male gaze while simultaneously believing i was consciously liberating myself sexually i am not sure whether there is a right or wrong answer to this discussion instead i hope it provides some context for future dialogue on this topic i believe that i have found a fair and comfortable way to flaunt my sexuality while pegging patriarchy with purpose a few years back i decided to combine some of my favorite passions by applying my theatrical creativity and sexual health knowledge to create a different kind of sexy halloween heroine one year i went as a vibrator demanding that we all celebrate the female orgasm another year i went dressed as the pesky sexual parasites known as crabs both costumes went over very well and allowed me to talk with partygoers about getting tested and knowing the importance of communication in pursuit of good sex at the end of the day i encourage people to live their best lives every halloween regardless of why they want to role play or cross dress in campy attire or seduce partygoers with costumes like the sexy nurse or a sexy pizza rat my only hope is that we do it more intentionally with purpose happy halloween queens michelle hope is a dedicated sexologist educator and activist with a master s degree in human development and extensive post graduate training in sexuality she is a veteran speaker with over 15 years of experience delivering impactful informative lectures and training across the nation she believes as though her work in marginalized urban communities has provided her with deep insight and comprehension of the holistic implications of sexuality on one s life hope is also the founder of mixed moxie a social

former us president ronald reagan once said inflation is as violent as a mugger as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hit man after a challenging period of high inflation throughout the 1970s and 1980s reagan s words cut deep for a generation that had seen skyrocketing petrol prices and the cost of living rising by over 13 per cent in the year he came to office for well over a decade the issue of inflation has generally slumbered throughout much of the western world as consumer prices indexes generally trended down and interest rates continued to be cut in april 2019 the magazine bloomberg businessweek went as far as asking is inflation dead and speculated on some of the potential downsides yet two and a half years and a pandemic later the question is no longer is inflation dead instead it s could we see hyperinflation what is hyperinflation hyperinflation is a rapid and excessive increase in consumer prices technically defined as prices rising by more than 50 per cent a month or 1000 per cent in a year it is a term that evokes a certain image in the public s collective consciousness of grocery bills in early 1920s germany being paid with wheelbarrows full of near worthless money and children playing with piles of cash that were worth less than the paper they were printed on historically hyperinflation has been triggered by a number of different reasons such as wars acute shortages of goods and excessive money printing german workers taking home bundles of cash money dollars their daily wage due to inflation during the depression of 1920s in germany while hyperinflation is generally a product of the modern era according to a study conducted by johns hopkins university there have been 57 cases of hyperinflation since 1795 with all but two occurring within the past century the worst hyperinflationary event in history occurred in hungary shortly after world war ii where monthly inflation peaked at 41 9 quadrillion per cent 41 900 000 000 000 000 per cent believe it or not that is correct number of zeros prices were rising so rapidly that they doubled roughly every 15 hours hyperinflation warnings last week twitter ceo jack dorsey made headlines around the world by stating on twitter that hyperinflation is going to change everything it s happening as an incredibly well connected tech mogul with a net worth of more than us14 billion a18 5 billion dorsey s warnings prompted a great deal of concern from some quarters that the twitter ceo s prediction could be right dorsey isn t the first high profile individual to raise the alarm on hyperinflation potentially becoming a major issue in february hedge fund manager michael burry compared the fiscal and economic situation in the united states with those of weimar germany in the early 1920s people queue next to a wall with a graffiti reading hunger in caracas venezuela on july 23 2018 as the country saw hyperinflation reach epic proportions picture juan barreto afp burry became a household name in the world of finance in 2015 after the film the big short immortalised his role in predicting the american subprime mortgage crisis that would ultimately lead to the global financial crisis through a long list of comparisons with early 1920s germany burry shared multiple examples of how the united states was on a similar path of financial market and government spending excess from the participation of everyday people in pursuit of easy money in financial markets to a government spending induced boom preventing business failures burry shared example after example of the similarities burry pointed out that the current high valuations in global asset prices were very similar to those experienced in 1920s germany before hyperinflation took hold the consequences of hyperinflation throughout history high levels of inflation have been the catalyst for social instability and in some cases the outright collapse of governments and empires in germany it contributed to the rise of the adolf hitler s nazi party and played a role in undermining faith in the existing elements of the political system in venezuela extremely high inflation and finally hyperinflation led to what can only be described as a collapse of the nation s economy this picture of a stack of 10 000 bolívar bills was taken in 2018 amid a hyperinflation crisis the imf said could reach 1 million per cent picture juan barreto afp in 2012 venezuelan gdp sat at an impressive us352 2 billion a467 5 billion as caracas enjoyed the windfall of high oil prices and high levels of government spending by 2022 it is estimated the venezuelan economy will have a gdp of just us40 4 billion a53 6 billion making it less than 12 per cent of the size it was a decade earlier to say that hyperinflation would be a disastrous outcome is an understatement even historically high levels of inflation where prices rise less in a year than they would in a hyperinflationary fortnight have been damaging to the social fabric in impacted nations but consumer prices don t need to rise 50 per cent every month like in a hyperinflation scenario for inflation to begin to undermine governments and to create a volatile social environment twitter ceo jack dorsey has warned that hyperinflation is real and happening sparking global headlines picture jim watson afp the likelihood of hyperinflation while the likes of burry and dorsey are raising the alarm about the prospect of hyperinflation the likelihood of a textbook case actually happening is at most minimal the chances of your weekly grocery bill rising by 50 per cent in a single month are currently highly unlikely at least in australia but that doesn t mean that high inflation like the levels last seen in the 1970s and early 1980s are out of the question with the forces of deglobalisation and high energy prices to potentially contribute to the inflationary impulse for quite a while to come a high inflation future is a scenario that cannot

home to seek their fortune but would meet their mother peggy every sunday for lunch a family of keen cooks they each tried to outdo the other with the quality of their cuisine in 1996 their hobby turned into a business when the family launched a mail order firm professional cookware shops followed and in 2005 the firm began to sell online the financial crisis sent it into administration but daniel o neill bought it back cut the number of shops to 13 invested in the website and relaunched it as procook growth has been steady ever since revenues rose from about 8million in 2008 to more

the cracks or checks in the language of the wood industry aren t easy to see we had some small check problems with some cherry wood we were drying explains rick richardson a lumber purchaser and vice president for vaughan bassett furniture company we didn t see any issues until we applied finish to the wood and the checks would show up for vaughan bassett the largest manufacturer of bedroom furniture in the united states such checks small cracks caused by the separation of wood fibers during the drying process can have a significant impact on the bottom line to help solve the challenge vaughan bassett consults with college of natural resources and environment professor brian bond an extension agent who frequently works with wood products companies in virginia to provide information and advice about how to improve hardwood drying strategies that turn green wood into wood usable in furniture production we ve been doing industry scale lumber drying workshops focused on hardwoods since before my time and there is still a need explained bond who teaches in the department of sustainable biomaterials this is a hardwood region and understanding the drying processes we use is incredibly important to the utilization of the resource the cracks are small but the stakes for the hardwood industry in the region could not be greater the industry has suffered a decade where many hardwood manufacturers have moved overseas for cheaper labor with the raw materials following add the challenges of a covid pandemic that has caused area mills to delay production and it is safe to say that the hardwood industry in appalachia has taken it on the chin recently but the challenges of a difficult moment might offer a silver lining an increased demand for locally sourced products coupled with new breakthroughs in the treatment and utilization of hardwood offer promising economic opportunities for the region extension agents like bond and fellow professor henry quesada are in a unique position to help the appalachian hardwood industry forge a new identity as scientists and outreach professionals they play a crucial role in connecting the learning taking place at virginia tech with the output that will impact the economy of the appalachian region wood hard or soft hardwood lumber sourced from slower growing deciduous trees like oak walnut and yellow poplar is renowned for its strength and aesthetic qualities it is used in furniture construction flooring and veneer paneling if you see wood in your home you are typically looking at hardwood softwood on the other hand like that harvested from spruce pine and fir trees grows faster costs less and weighs less it is in high demand as it is used in the construction and framing of residential homes today the demand for softwood in the u s outstrips the supply yet upward of 25 percent of american hardwood is exported to factories overseas that pattern of having to import softwoods to meet demand while sending high quality hardwood overseas is one that quesada would like to change one solution mass timber it uses large solid wood panels for wall floor and roof construction mass timber is a new material that you can use to build buildings higher than five stories explained quesada it is a way to utilize hardwoods as a carbon friendly alternative to concrete or steel to open the door for mass timber to participate in the construction market quesada is working with industry associates and lumber producers to conduct three federally funded projects aimed at developing mass timber products understanding the supply chain challenges to bringing materials to market and conducting resiliency tests of one version of mass timber cross laminated timber with a manufacturer to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the product we ve been working closely with quesada and bond on a project that uses poplar in the construction of cross laminated timber explained tom inman president of appalachian hardwood manufacturers inc a leading trade association of sawmill distributors in the region our work has shown poplar to have tremendous strength properties and we re now at work getting that product approved by national organizations so that architects will specify it and builders will use it there are many benefits to utilizing poplar it is a fast growing tree that comes back quickly after harvesting it can be harvested and processed rapidly and it thrives in the area which means that transportation of materials isn t a significant burden if we can develop a product like mass timber it has the potential to create jobs and bring back economic development to areas that are currently suffering explained quesada to that end quesada and bond have also been working on new ways of treating hardwood to develop alternative uses for the material in a process called thermal modification researchers use chambers to heat hardwoods in an oxygen free environment causing the wood structures to strengthen the traditional belief is that you can t use hardwoods for siding because it decays too fast he explained but we ve found that thermal modification processes allow us to use hardwoods for flooring applications decking and even house siding where it has a lifespan that matches cedar in durability tests from local connections to global consequences finding additional uses for hardwood materials means there are more avenues for the industry to grow for extension agents like quesada and bond one specific challenge is getting the message out to professionals who would be interested in using hardwood materials in new ways that s where the extension part of our job comes in said bond a key part of our work is getting out there on the factory floor or in the field with architects and engineers and the people who utilize building materials so we can explain the benefits of these materials a key avenue for building that rapport is long standing relationships with industry professionals bond has been working with the flooring inspectors educational guild to provide training on the use of wood flooring materials installed in the home and potential challenges that may arise with new products bond is also frequently called upon to help solve problems brian is very good at taking the time to answer my calls explained richardson who has worked at vaughan basset for 43 years and if i have any issues at all he ll come right up to galax to help us in any way that kind of access a keystone in the philosophy of the virginia cooperative extension program means that quesada and bond are able to react quickly to changing demands in the hardwood marketplace and can even tailor research questions that will have an immediate impact quesada and bond stay in close contact with manufacturers in the region said inman they know what s going on in the markets and what s happening in the industrial residential and commercial applications as a result they re able to see if there is a particular angle to a research question that needs to be considered while bond and quesada are focused on the area hardwood industry they stress that increased hardwood utilization has positive global consequences some of the materials we re looking to develop new markets for are replacing tropical species that are imported to the u s from overseas explained bond so we re using sustainably harvested materials in virginia that replace materials that are not sustainably harvested elsewhere using local products to limit the degradation of rainforests and the impacts of transporting materials across the globe is a crucial way for the forestry industry in the region to take a leading role in the green economy of the future and wood products from housing materials and siding to the flooring and furniture inside are passive examples of carbon sequestration trees can save the world said quesada the challenge for the wood industry is finding a unified message that connects their work with that broader message people understand how trees protect water sources and provide oxygen and habitats for creatures and we need to draw a clearer connection from those benefits to the benefits of using wood materials but we have a bright future we have great forests and great products and i m optimistic about the coming years

williamsburg va what is likely the oldest extant building in the northern hemisphere used for the purpose of educating enslaved and free black children is relocating to during a ceremony held today inside colonial williamsburg s hennage auditorium the two educational institutions also announced the creation of a joint research initiative to document the history of the school and its students which will lead to new interpretive programming that explores the complicated history of this 18th century institution dedicated to the education of black children renovations performed over the years have obscured the original structure of the small white building currently situated at 524 prince george street two blocks east of its original location at the intersection of north boundary and prince george streets the modern additions make it difficult to visualize the 18th century schoolhouse that has captured the attention of historians and the public alike that will change over the next several years through a special arrangement between the university and the foundation as part of the agreement the newly formed bray school board voted unanimously on sept 13 2021 to approve colonial williamsburg s purchase of the building remove the modern additions to the building and transport it to its permanent home at the northwest corner of the intersection of francis and south nassau streets where it will be restored to its original state and used in the foundation s public history programming upon its arrival the williamsburg bray school will become the 89th original structure on colonial williamsburg s campus the first new addition to the foundation s cadre of historic buildings since the 1960s the foundation anticipates restoring this nationally significant structure by 2024

importance in african american history the william mary bray school lab is comprised of william mary students faculty and collaborators whose research is focused on gaining a deeper understanding of the school from the perspectives of families whose children attended it they also are examining the motivations of the founders who developed the institution and its pro christian curriculum in which white slaveowners sent black children to this school to receive indoctrination in the christian faith most importantly the lab will explore the legacies of the children who took ownership of their education and used it in ways the founders never intended colonial williamsburg will bring this important research to life through rich and detailed narratives using the restored bray school as a backdrop to interpret the lives of those with ties to the school a multidirectional flow of research is essential to understanding more about the school and particularly the students said ann marie stock the university s presidential liaison for strategic cultural partnerships who will oversee research operations regarding the bray school we ll be doing descendant research conducting oral histories to document the restoration while getting input from visitors and the local community it s an exciting expansion of our approach to research by engaging the community in this endeavor we

her graduate research and her experience as a living history interpreter at colonial williamsburg will add so much to the work of the lab elgersman lee said she really problematizes the education of enslaved black children during that period because it was not provided as a means of self actualization it was pragmatic the actions of slave owners to further claim and control their chattel a certain amount of education delivered through certain means of catechism but it was education nonetheless and blacks had agency to use it for their benefit the william mary bray school lab will be aligned with related initiatives at both organizations including the university s lemon project and will benefit from input by two administrative bodies the bray school board and the bray school community advisory council the former is comprised of foundation and university specialists and two community members who work closely on the partnership and the bray school initiative the latter is comprised of community leaders representing local church congregations local educators former elected officials and dr terry meyers a william mary professor emeritus of english whose initial research led to the discovery of the original structure the council will help ensure that researchers engage the broadest possible number of voices and visions so that they consider a wide and diverse range of perspectives the board will review this input and make recommendations to advance the bray school initiative the lab creates an incredible opportunity to continue to welcome the local community into the academic spaces where we have traditionally formed our understanding of history and culture elgersman lee said as a historian and as someone who has worked in community history i ve learned that the history often resides much more in the community than in the academic spaces i see building and strengthening these bonds as an essential component of lab work the bray school partnership continues a tradition of collaboration between william mary and the colonial williamsburg foundation which includes the reestablishment of colonial williamsburg along with the university to support the omohundro institute of early american history culture and a joint partnership with the greater williamsburg community that includes members of the city s historic first baptist church to research and interpret the church s first permanent site on south nassau street what is likely the oldest extant building in the northern hemisphere used for the purpose of educating enslaved and free black children is relocating to colonial williamsburg s historic campus eight months after researchers from colonial williamsburg and william mary announced they had identified the original williamsburg bray school and four months after the researchers conclusively verified its identity the two organizations today announced the site of the building s future home on the living history museum s historic campus where it will become a central point of interpretive focus in the foundation s ongoing efforts to tell a more complete story of 18th century america during a ceremony held today inside colonial williamsburg s hennage auditorium the two educational institutions also announced the creation of a joint research initiative to document the history of the school and its students which will lead to new interpretive programming that explores the complicated history of this 18th century institution dedicated to the education of black children renovations performed over the years have obscured the original structure of the small white building currently situated at 524 prince george street two blocks east of its original location at the intersection of north boundary and prince george streets the modern additions make it difficult to visualize the 18th century schoolhouse that has captured the attention of historians and the public alike that will change over the next several years through a special arrangement between the university and the foundation as part of the agreement the newly formed bray school board voted unanimously on sept 13 2021 to approve colonial williamsburg s purchase of the building remove the modern additions to the building and transport it to its permanent home at the northwest corner of the intersection of francis and south nassau streets where it will be restored to its original state and used in the foundation s public history programming upon its arrival the williamsburg bray school will become the 89th original structure on colonial williamsburg s campus the first new addition to the foundation s cadre of historic buildings since the 1960s the foundation anticipates restoring this nationally significant structure by 2024 which marks the 250th anniversary of the school s closure on the eve of the american revolution purchase of the building is made possible by a grant from truist financial corporation through its truist charitable fund a donor advised fund at the winston salem foundation truist is proud to support efforts to ensure williamsburg bray school has a prominent and permanent home on colonial williamsburg s campus said thomas ransom virginia regional president for truist stories of bray school s rich history will live on ensuring future generations understand its significance and the people who were part of it additionally colonial williamsburg s initial work to restore transport and interpret the bray school s historic structure is possible in part thanks to a grant from the gladys and franklin clark foundation a major component of the partnership includes the creation of the william mary bray school lab that will document the school s history to fully understand its complex legacy funding for the lab s development has been made possible by a generous lead gift from william mary alumni steve and gale kohlhagen this nondescript building that was hidden in plain sight for decades is taking the colonial williamsburg foundation and william mary in a new and exciting direction said cliff fleet president and ceo of colonial williamsburg thanks to the generosity of truist the gladys and franklin clark foundation and steve and gale kohlhagen we are able to fully research and interpret the story of the williamsburg bray school this important work will expand our understanding of 18th century america and add to our body of knowledge about this important time in our nation s history these new stories will be passed along through our public history programming and offer visitors a richer and deeper connection to our shared past additional funds are being raised by both institutions colonial williamsburg is securing funds to complete the restoration and support interpretive work and william mary is fundraising to expand the william mary bray school lab this partnership between william mary and colonial williamsburg promises to transform our nation s understanding of the intertwined histories of race slavery education and religion in america william mary president katherine a rowe said each intersects in the story of the bray school bray school research will illuminate what it means to educate justly william mary s commitment for all times coming william mary is also requesting state support for the project including funding the research teams to study the bray school and other similar projects state senator monty mason from williamsburg and delegate cliff hayes jr from chesapeake attended today s ceremony and offered their support this initiative will position williamsburg as a model for broadening and deepening nation wide dialogue around the origins of our democracy leading up to the 250th anniversary of our nation s founding in 2026 mason said it is hard to overstate the importance of this work to our community region and commonwealth hayes added like the cornland school in chesapeake bray school has an empowering story to tell and now more than ever we need to tell the full story of the bray school and its importance in african american history the william mary bray school lab is comprised of william mary students faculty and collaborators whose research is focused on gaining a deeper understanding of the school from the perspectives of families whose children attended it they also are examining the motivations of the founders who developed the institution and its pro christian curriculum in which white slaveowners sent black children to this school to receive indoctrination in the christian faith most importantly the lab will explore the legacies of the children who took ownership of their education and used it in ways the founders never intended colonial williamsburg will bring this important research to life through rich and detailed narratives using the restored bray school as a backdrop to interpret the lives of those with ties to the school a multidirectional flow of research is essential to understanding more about the school and particularly the students said ann marie stock the university s presidential liaison for strategic cultural partnerships who will oversee research operations regarding the bray school we ll be doing descendant research conducting oral histories to document the restoration while getting input from visitors and the local community it s an exciting expansion of our approach to research by engaging the community in this endeavor we will catalyze collaboration across boundaries and ensure a broad range of perspectives professor

kenyan recce company officers search for attackers during the dusitd2 complex terrorist attack by somali terrorist group al shabaab in nairobi kenya 15 january 2019 photo epa efe dai kurokawa clandestine kenyan team has been paid and assisted by the cia to take down terror suspects since 2004 we re really hands on we don t just hand them the money once a month one us official said unconstitutional killings include a family man wrongly slain due to mistaken identity and allegations a terror suspect was summarily executed britain s mi6 plays a key role in identifying suspects for a kill or capture list and finding and fixing their location paramilitaries use covert tactics such as fake number plates and disguise themselves as aid workers on operations in refugee camps which shield perpetrators of abuses from any shred of accountability killings are radicalising kenya a former us ambassador and kenyan vice president both told declassified read part 2 of this investigation here a day before being killed in august 2019 45 year old motorcycle taxi driver mohamed modi mwatsumiro was heard arguing with his wife at their tin roof dwelling in the small town of ngombeni on the south coast of kenya modi had ordered her to leave with their young child and stay with her family even though she really tried to resist he was insistent that she must leave with the child he became aggressive and she had to give in it was as if he was expecting something to happen that night a neighbour told kenya s leading newspaper hours after modi was killed it is not known whether modi had asked his wife to leave because he feared he was a marked man but kenyan police suspected he was linked to a suicide bomber involved in the dusitd2 hotel complex terrorist attack in nairobi in january 2019 which killed 21 people including a us citizen somalia based group al shabaab which is designated as a terrorist organisation by the us and british governments among others claimed it had ordered the operation in retaliation for the us decision to relocate its embassy in israel to jerusalem eight months later on 30 august the same kenyan paramilitary team that swept in to repel the dusitd2 attackers reappeared this time at modi s mud stone home which sits among thickets of coconut palms cashew and neem trees what followed took a familiar pattern for night time counter terror raids in kenya many of which remain shrouded in mystery and rumour at just after 4am kenyan paramilitary commandos arrived in unmarked vehicles armed with us made m4 assault rifles and glock pistols ordering concerned neighbours to stay indoors the plainclothes officers stormed modi s home after the commandos breached his property modi hurled a grenade that failed to detonate police later claimed seldom does a suspect emerge alive in such raids modi was no exception a covert war the commandos who raided modi s home belong to the rapid response team rrt a clandestine special team of the kenyan paramilitary general service unit s recce company the rrt was set up equipped trained and is guided on tactical counter terror operations by america s central intelligence agency cia a declassified investigation can reveal the secretive kenyan team is informally known as the rendition operations team and is composed of around 60 police commandos the cia s covert programme which began in 2004 is managed by a paramilitary liaison officer at the us embassy in kenya s capital nairobi but has until now successfully avoided public scrutiny based on interviews with over two dozen cia us state department and kenyan intelligence paramilitary and police officers this investigation has found that in its 16 years of operation the cia backed team has been responsible for the capture of high value terror suspects as well as rendition operations killings and alleged summary executions the creation of the rrt was an indigenous solution to an indigenous problem a former senior cia counter terrorism official told this investigation our leadership at ctc and others felt that setting up these units was important it was something that gives value to the partnership and it puts a unit under our control for when we have targets that we feel need to go down often the paramilitary team s raids are driven by intelligence provided by the cia itself as well as kenya s national intelligence service nis however multiple current and former us and kenyan diplomatic intelligence and police sources said that britain s secret intelligence service sis better known as mi6 plays a key role in identifying tracking and fixing the location of targets as well in decisions determining their fate kill or capture the american and british governments provide covert support to kenya in order to help it defeat al shabaab an al qaeda linked group that has carried out dozens of deadly attacks in kenya its most high profile atrocities have been on nairobi s westgate shopping mall in 2013 where it killed 67 people and on garissa university in 2015 which killed 148 al shabaab and its sympathisers are also behind a number of high profile abductions and attempts to kill foreign dignitaries including a plot to bomb then secretary of state hillary clinton during a visit to kenya in 2009 former deputy chief operations of the cia s counterterrorism center henry crumpton explained the nature of the war on terror in kenya it s a different type of conflict a different type of war and it is intelligence driven crumpton who led the cia s war in afghanistan in 2001 continued i think that s why the cia really has had the lead in many areas long before any others because the cia was there and the cia was providing value to those partners and the operations whether they are diplomatic or law enforcement or military even economic all those instruments of statecraft they re all informed and driven by the intelligence that s the foundation for this conflict a former senior us official based in africa with knowledge of us kenyan counter terrorism operations said that the same agencies cia and mi6 also determined the fate of the target it s the intelligence services identifying the threat figuring a way out to mitigate the threat figuring out that this is going to be a law enforcement end state or not and then dealing with it the decision around the fate of a given target would be decided between us and your guys on the intel side the former us official continued we had these conversations about what are we going to do with this guy you know given these set of facts what can we do with these guys modi s post mortem report references seven gunshot entry wounds from rrt fire two to his left elbow another in the right forearm two in his chest and a further two gunshots wounds in his left upper jaw with exit wounds in his lower jaw we knew him modi s neighbour ali matete told reporters the day after the killing he conducted his prayers here in this area and in our mosque but we do not know what he did when we saw the incident today we asked ourselves because we re in darkness just over a month after modi was killed rrt paramilitaries were in action again in a dawn raid on a house in neighbouring mombasa county police alleged the men inside were linked to modi and had planned to launch terror attacks after another alleged shootout the three suspects emerged in body bags while the precise number of rrt kill or capture raids against terror suspects is unknown due to the clandestine nature of the force s operations declassified has investigated over a dozen cases in many instances suspects raided by the rrt have ended up dead with a police spokesperson subsequently claiming the target was armed and dangerous but this investigation has also found cases of mistaken killings and alleged summary executions khelef khalifa chair of kenyan human rights organisation muhuri said when these extrajudicial killings happen muslims feel they are under siege because they cannot comprehend why the government cannot arrest these people and take them to court instead of killing them intent on remaining in the shadows once suspects are neutralised killed or captured the plainclothes commandos of the rrt hand control of the operation to local police typically kenya s anti terrorism police unit atpu in doing so the rrt successfully avoids scrutiny let alone accountability for operations now spanning over a decade so too does its american backers the present government targets in extrajudicial killings and takes out people in mombasa like rogo former kenyan vice president kalonzo musyoka said referring to the late cleric aboud rogo who was killed by an unidentified hit squad in 2012 police reports after modi was killed claimed he had been radicalised by rogo describing the killings as unconstitutional the former vice president added this has spread bitterness but because we are doing the bidding of the west in the war on terror they are allowed to rrt commandos and their american backers stressed that the kenyan force is not strictly a kill team in the way tier 1 special force units such as delta force and seal team 6 can and do receive express orders to take out targets it s not the same as having seal team 6 go after a target it s not like it s going to be investigated if it ends up in a military end state the former senior us official explained however in a case investigated by declassified an officer confided that the unit was explicitly tasked to eliminate a high value terror suspect only to wrongly kill a family man in two other cases witnesses say the suspects were killed by rrt commandos without any armed resistance the former senior us official added there s never a real investigation by the kenyan government they don t want to get to the bottom of it it s just not going to happen mistaken killing defenders of the rrt say it has been instrumental in neutralising the threat from al shabaab while the kenyan and international press have made no mention of the rrt s central role in counter terrorism operations multiple us and rrt sources confirmed that the cia supported team played a lead role in successfully neutralising the garissa and dusitd2 attackers in another pre dawn raid in kenya s coastal town of mombasa on 28 october 2012 omar faraj and his wife woke to banging on their front door fearing that a family member had come to deliver bad news about his sick mother faraj rushed to answer but before he unfastened the lock he realised from the sound of the visitors voices that they were strangers open up the men outside demanded thinking they were robbers faraj called his neighbour who told him that the men were in fact heavily armed plainclothes police unsure of what to do faraj who worked as a cashier at a local butcher and as a part time islamic preacher turned to his wife she urged him not to open the door he was a religious person and the kenyan government goes after religious people faraj s wife rahma ali said several people had died in such scenarios i thought he d be killed mombasa had already witnessed a string of unexplained killings of radical muslim figures two months prior to faraj s killing unknown assailants gunned down the radical cleric aboud rogo sparking three days of riots the raid that unfolded at faraj s home was reported as being by kenya s atpu but this investigation has learned that it was in fact led by the cia supported rrt according to a kenyan officer briefed on the operation on the night of the raid the team was in fact hunting for fuad abubakar manswab the alleged mastermind of a foiled 2011 terror attack in mombasa whom authorities believed to be hiding in the neighbourhood manswab was thought to be armed and dangerous and someone who can engage and kill the officer said noting that he escaped a prior operation with a wound so the rrt were instructed to eliminate him but the kenyan officer corroborating further accounts obtained by declassified recounted how an intelligence informant mistakenly led the paramilitary team to faraj s home believing that manswab was there the operation s target was somewhere else but there was some mix up and they headed to the wrong house the officer said unaware they were targeting the wrong home the commandos broke down the door and fired tear gas inside faraj took his wife s hand as they climbed out of their bedroom window hoping to scale their neighbour s wall and reach the safety of his brother s nearby home they never made it faraj s wife rahma ali remembers watching the commandos open fire on her husband who was balanced on a flowerpot trying to climb the wall they hit him in the temple and he fell back on top of her blood streaming from his head fearing that the commandos would kill her too ali who was covered in faraj s blood says she played dead next to him in plainclothes but according to ali sporting body armour and m4 carbines supplied by the cia the operatives approached and stood over the couple surveying their kill as she lay terrified on the floor ali heard one of the commandos say they should make sure she was dead but the man s superior overruled him declaring we ve finished the job kill or capture faraj s killing epitomised a shift in rrt priorities initially designed and trained to capture terror suspects for detention interrogation and possible rendition to other countries its objectives appear to have shifted mid way through president obama s first term in office at a time when suspects in kenya became harder to capture in the days before these guys were never violent and never armed explained a former atpu officer who shadowed rrt commandos on multiple tactical operations so it was not hard to arrest them it s only after 2011 when kenyan forces went into somalia and kenya became a legitimate target so they are always armed they brought a lot of arms into kenya they can really give a good fight so that is where the use of the recce came in by 2011 america s preferences for dealing with terror suspects had already been embraced in the war in afghanistan in the form of the joint prioritised effects list jpel a us uk secret list of priority targets designated for kill or capture the former senior us official based in africa said describing jpel targets as a list of problems to be eliminated the former official continued that s the mentality that carried over i m sorry to say and it sounds obnoxious to say it but it s something we did there current and former members of the rrt stressed their objectives prioritise capture over killing however they all confirmed that any perceived threat or resistance from targets is to be met with lethal force i don t have to shoot if i don t see your hand a rrt officer said describing the team s rules of engagement because the hand is the most dangerous part but if you have something in your hands i don t have to spare you because you mean danger to me the senior us official familiar with rrt operations explained that the team s tactical operations against terror suspects surprise raids under the cover of darkness did not always afford the the good guys a chance to be arrested as in faraj s case when they say that the goal is to arrest it s to arrest somebody like a louisiana parish sheriff would arrest somebody the former us official said referring to louisiana police s reputation of being a law unto itself they do have the ability to make an arrest but the good guys don t always stop exactly when most people think they should stop some rrt members provided a starker account when we were trained on threats we were taught human rights come later if you have this bad guy and you cannot get him for interrogation then you d better execute said one of a dozen current and former kenyan paramilitary officers who spoke on condition of anonymity three atpu officers one former and two still serving who had flanked the rrt on tactical operations echoed the description of rrt mission objectives you know the recce company have been trained to take out suspects said a serving officer their mission is just to take out suspects you know they don t investigate they just identify the target neutralise the target and then they go back sometimes though targets are taken alive in 2010 kenyan police kidnapped and rendered the suspected militants behind the al shabaab inspired bombings of a rugby club and restaurant in kampala uganda to face interrogation by american british and ugandan agents though kenya s atpu was widely blamed for the renditions multiple police and paramilitary sources confirmed that rrt operatives undertook some of them in addition to renditions from somalia in the years before one rrt officer recalled a us sponsored rendition operation to uganda rrt operatives captured the suspect in nairobi drove him overland to the western border and then handed him over to their ugandan counterparts the officer recalled strong interest in the case from the rrt s cia handlers explaining that they even gave us fuel for the vehicles and our upkeep all the journey but more often rrt members set out on operations knowing the target will never be interrogated or tried such outcomes suited decision makers back in washington according to the former senior us official based in africa there s one stat that counts more than convictions and that s neutralisation of a criminal organisation as with the renditions journalists and human rights activists have long blamed the atpu for extrajudicial killings of terror suspects but former and current us officials with knowledge of kenyan counter terrorism as well as rrt officers confirmed that the atpu has neither the capacity weaponry or close quarter battle skills to undertake high risk raids additionally the cia has no direct relationship to the police unit as such it cannot be tasked with neutralising high value terror suspects instead the atpu plays an investigative role either by claiming the arrest or handling the crime scene those guys are highly trained and they are serious about things a former atpu officer said any suspect even the amateurs who we believe to be armed they are the ones to get in and neutralise then they leave us to do the investigations and collection of evidence atpu takes a back seat in high risk or high value operations a study by the independent medico legal unit a non profit organisation that monitors misconduct by law enforcement recorded 1 873 gun deaths in six urban areas in kenya between 2009 and 2014 it found kenyan police were involved in nearly two thirds of the cases many of them execution style killings more recent imlu figures show a decline in extrajudicial executions in the last five years but they still amount to over 100 per year the rrt does not account for the bulk of these alleged extrajudicial killings in kenya both us officials and rrt officers stressed since its role is dedicated to targeting high value or high risk terror targets but when suspects disappear or turn up dead the kenyan government rarely undertakes a formal investigation according to maria burnett former east africa director for human rights watch out of hundreds of extrajudicial killings that have taken place during counter terrorism operations in recent years only a small handful had been seriously scrutinised in faraj s case the kenyan government never acknowledged its role in his death instead claiming that security forces killed terrorists after being fired upon it was similarly unabashed about the fate of titus nabiswa the police informant who led the commandos to faraj s house that night and whose body was later found dumped killed by a gunshot wound to the head the us hand housed at a secretive base in the town of ruiru roughly 30 miles east of nairobi the ranks of the rapid response team rrt have thinned in recent years as some members have decamped for kenya s burgeoning private security sector which offers better pay and working conditions to counter these temptations the cia s paramilitary liaison to the rrt provides regular financial support including allowances for operations and bonuses for successful missions this is designed to supplement the low wages of kenyan police officers who make as little as 115 per month injured operatives are given cash payouts and treatment at nairobi s private aga khan hospital rrt officers call these motivation packages while the amounts have varied over the years rrt officers confirmed receiving the equivalent of a 30 boost to their salaries per month paid for by the us embassy for a constable ksh 5 000 us 46 is a huge amount of money one rrt officer said you could educate your child he added the rrt also receives weapons and equipment from the cia initially supplied with m16 assault rifles then m4 carbines they have also received glock pistols m79 grenade launchers body armour helmets and m67 and stinger cs grenades the rrt s operations appear to need sign off from the us multiple rrt sources independently confirmed that the team is not to be deployed by its kenyan command for tactical anti terror operations without the knowledge and consent of its us embassy handlers the exceptions are for rapid response to high profile terror attacks such as the westgate mall and dusitd2 attacks and for the diplomatic protection of foreign dignitaries you know those teams are owned by their trainers they are the equippers so they are like their bosses now so if there is anything they communicate direct we need this to be done a kenyan paramilitary officer with knowledge of the us embassy liaison relationship said since 2004 the cia has paid for rrt commandos to fly to the us for swat style training in rendition and disruption operations including reconnaissance and surveillance storming a building close quarter battle and weapons handling at locations that include annapolis naval academy in maryland but the us role goes further the cia paramilitary liaison based at the us embassy in nairobi is directly involved in planning some of the rrt s operations occasionally cia operatives themselves have participated in operations us officials and kenyan rrt officers confirmed if they really really want the results they will even assist directly one mid ranking kenyan paramilitary officer said cia paramilitary officers and contractors have also assisted the rrt by conducting surveillance and tracking of a target either remotely or from a nearby safehouse or vehicle however even as they observed operations unfolding they maintained a careful distance rrt officers said some areas such as the slums of nairobi s eastleigh district would often prove too dangerous for us officers you know the eastleigh area is dominated by muslim guys so they would not dare to go there and do that surveillance without the support of armed people one officer said however for operations in other parts of nairobi and in mombasa cia officers on the ground have assisted in planning raids having conducted surveillance on a target s dwelling and provided their position often by use of mobile phone location trackers a senior rrt officer said such intelligence support was essential to avoiding detection if we don t have something to track the phone we go banging on other people s houses and it d cause an outcry like we are robbers the officer said with that support we were able to zero in and locate the exact areas where the targets were and avoid that issue of complaint because once we hit the right target we get whatever we wanted britain s role working closely with its counterparts at the counterterrorism unit of kenya s national intelligence service nis the cia identifies suspects and prepares target packages intelligence and analysis on a given suspect that include actionable intelligence together they decide a given target s fate in a so called disposition matrix that includes options ranging from arrest to using lethal force according to the former senior us official based in africa a former rrt officer with knowledge of this coordination with the us embassy explained sometimes we would have them in our office you have dealt with this one you are remaining with these ones all that information we are being given by the us government not the nis a mid ranking rrt officer familiar with the target list said it included jeremiah onyango okumu dudah black and samir khan both faced terror charges and were disappeared with khan s body subsequently found mutilated while the officer admitted that his team had arrested khan on the first occasion he denied rrt s involvement in his subsequent disappearance in 2015 then cia director john brennan told an audience we exchange information with our counterparts around the world to identify and track down men and women believed to be violent extremists our cooperation with foreign liaison quietly achieves significant results working together we have disrupted terrorist attacks and rolled back groups that plot them in formulating the target packages cia officers in nairobi also work closely with their counterparts at mi6 britain s foreign intelligence service which relies on its long standing human intelligence network to provide actionable intelligence by finding and tracking targets and infiltrating militant circles the brits were worried a former senior cia counter terrorism official said noting the influx of british jihadi tourism to somalia via kenya after 2010 because they had a lot of british cases and i mean british citizens in some respect i think the british kids were showing up there before some of our guys before the american citizens started going to be suicide bombers he continued if you re working with the kenyans you re going to want to know about these british guys that are going to be coming to kenya to get to somalia as well as long standing colonial ties to kenyan tribes and communities mi6 boasts a specialism in human intelligence tracking and infiltration operations such capabilities are often relied on by the cia in kenya and other covert counter terrorism operations such as in yemen two former senior us officials confirmed we reinforced each other a former senior us state department official said of us uk counter terrorism in kenya but the us was very much in the lead and there was good cooperation between us and the uk on the ground and nis always understood that echoing mi6 s importance the former senior cia official recalled i ve seen them infiltrate when it comes to human intelligence in ct i think they re one of the best services in the world in terms of running penetrations of terrorist organisations leaked us diplomatic cables show that for over a decade kenya s intelligence service nis has had primary responsibility for ct in the country as lead agency nis is the principal beneficiary and conduit of the bulk of cia and mi6 s efforts in kenya former senior cia and state department officials confirmed they were the meat and potatoes of everything we did the former senior state department official said the police didn t have much of an intel capability actionable information always flowed through the intelligence service unlike the cia actionable intelligence from mi6 does not reach the rrt paramilitaries directly but through its cia and nis counterparts when the british supply intel it takes time to get down to us the americans come to us directly they tell us this is what is happening and they have already informed the other authorities so we are given information to go and conduct the operation one paramilitary officer explained arctic as well as working with the cia on target development mi6 also collaborates with a dedicated team of kenyan intelligence officers as part of a liaison cell within nis counter terrorism unit codenamed arctic multiple kenyan and us intelligence officials confirmed at times the nis arctic cell works directly with rrt operatives in finding targets and fixing their location before sending in the rrt one of mi6 s targets included british national jermaine grant grant had sneaked back into kenya after allegedly receiving paramilitary training in somalia and was an associate of british terror suspect samantha lewthwaite dubbed the white widow as a british national killing grant would have focused scrutiny on the relationship between britain and kenya s security forces so in 2011 rrt officers guided by nis arctic agents working in collaboration with mi6 led an operation intent on capturing him two kenyan officers familiar with the operation confirmed one kenyan officer explained the recce and nis were ahead of us they arrested they took away his flash disk and his purse after some time they brought him to the police station but they didn t book him in they came and he was in the boot of the car outside the police station but not all mi6 targets are as fortunate as grant who is now serving a 13 year jail sentence in kenya after being convicted for possessing bomb making material and using forged documents to obtain kenyan citizenship two years later in june 2013 rrt commandos would kill kassim omollo an alleged al shabaab trainer bomb expert and an accomplice of grant in another pre dawn raid omollo had allegedly slipped back into kenya from somalia and was maintaining a low profile at his family home in mombasa in the aftermath a kenyan police spokesperson claimed omollo was killed after refusing to surrender stating that hand grenades a pistol an ak 47 assault rifle ammunition and chemicals for making home made explosives had been recovered however independent investigations report that omollo his wife and their four young children were told we were sent to kill you after omollo kissed his son the officers pulled his children away and proceeded to shoot him in the chest and then a further three times in the head a witness told researchers omollo s killing was wrongly attributed by the press and human rights organisations to the atpu which handled the crime scene after the raid an officer with direct knowledge of the operation confirmed that owing to omollo s firearms training an rrt team led the raid having been guided to his location by the mi6 nis intelligence liaison cell arctic hands on often it is the cia s liaison an officer in the agency s paramilitary special activities center sac ground branch who feeds the actionable intelligence to the rrt commandos either directly or through the nis one former liaison officer was known to the kenyan operatives as matt said one rrt officer who described him as a down to earth guy who would sit with the guys and talk to them the officer added matt made us form a family and we were really a family far from being exceptional matt s approach reflected the cia s broader attitude towards its liaison partners a former senior us state department official confirmed when we support these kinds of units we re really hands on we don t just hand them the money once a month the rrt commandos who worked with matt explained that his cia counterpart would prepare the team through the general service unit recce rrt chain of command in advance of orders issued by kenya s inspector general of police we normally had that information ahead of time from matt or the nis guys we agreed on the number of people and then he would drop the finances and tell me to wait until the time it s official from the bosses the americans are the same people giving the information to nis so we would work as one team the rrt officer explained describing the cia liaison s hands on approach to the rrt another former kenyan commando explained they will spearhead everything they will do an operation plan share that with you they will come take you down sit you through it after the operation he added they debrief you and then they re gone five current and former senior us officials with knowledge of the cia programme told declassified their support was key to ensuring the rrt s professionalism it gave a lot of incentive for guys to want to be in that unit and stay said the former senior cia official familiar with counter terrorism operations in the region rrt members he added receive top tier training from some of the best operators in the world legends in special forces and then you get a bonus for being on call and being part of that unit during one raid in likoni mombasa in october 2012 rrt commandos surrounded a residential compound with two terror suspects inside officers demanded the suspects open the door but one responded by hurling a hand grenade killing an rrt commando and seriously injuring the officer commanding it was the first time an rrt officer had been killed in a tactical operation what followed underlined the strength of relations between the us embassy and the commando team the cia liaison at the time matt covered the cost of the injured officer s six week treatment and convalescence at the aga khan hospital paying him multiple follow up visits officers confirmed on top of this the injured officer received a one off payment of 120 000 kenyan shillings then worth approximately us 1 400 from matt over ten times the officer s monthly wage that person would know someone else is feeling his pain an rrt officer said commenting on us support to the rrt former us ambassador to kenya michael ranneberger who left office in 2011 said that kind of support is critical to making them a professional force if you re really trying to set up a professional unit that will respect human rights and be effective in carrying out its operations our support is critical while neither the us government nor the us embassy in nairobi has previously commented on its role in supporting the kenyan commando team former cia director john brennan did admit to knowledge of abuses by partners responding to concerns raised by us senator ron wyden over the cia s support to abusive foreign security forces in 2015 brennan said we strive to identify and where possible avoid working with individuals whom we believe to be responsible for such abuses in some cases we have decided to continue those relationships despite unacceptable behaviour because of the critical intelligence those services provide including information that allows us to disrupt terrorist plotting against the united states however members of the secretive kenyan team say their american handlers have done little to hold it accountable moreover targeted killings rendition operations and other tactics barred by kenyan law became routine for the unit whose operational tempo increased dramatically after kenya s 2011 invasion of somalia provoked a wave of domestic terror attacks avoiding detection for 16 years rrt operatives have managed to avoid detection and public scrutiny multiple rrt officers who operate in plainclothes when on tactical counter terror assignments admitted using unmarked cars hired from private companies and swapping between private or unregistered number plates in order to avoid identification a single rrt vehicle typically carries at least three plates which are swapped at least once on operations upon departure from a target s location the vehicles used vary but former rrt officers confirmed that the us had supplied a stock of at least six white toyota landcruisers 76 model specially ordered with blacked out windows and a custom cabin to accommodate the commandos needs kenyan officers conducting surveillance in urban areas sometimes also appear in less conspicuous toyota premio sedans while in high value operations their cia handlers would occasionally join them but remain at a safe distance in black fully tinted landcruiser prado suvs j120 model declassified has also learned that since 2004 rrt operatives have disguised themselves as aid workers when on operation in refugee camps such as dadaab in eastern kenya or kakuma in the northwest in dadaab concerned by al shabaab s infiltration of the camps weapons smuggling and attack plans on kenyan soil the officers used united nations world food programme wfp vehicles and wore wfp t shirts while posing as aid distributors as they sought to identify those suspected of bringing in weapons and collaborating with the militant group once the suspects had been identified and reports filed on the targets a second team would then be sent in to mop up and neutralise the targets a former rrt officer familiar with the operations said declassified understands that the rrt continues to send undercover officers to the camps on rotation a un wfp spokesperson said the agency had no knowledge of the covert operations within the refugee camps the unhcr which administers the camps did not answer questions as to whether it had any knowledge of or involvement in facilitating the covert operations instead noting that the kenyan government retained responsibility for their security the kenya police service under which the recce company rrt falls did not answer requests for comment in another raid on 18 may 2013 rrt operatives surrounded an apartment building outside nairobi according to an officer with knowledge of the operation the target and his wife were killed after they violently resisted capture a police spokesman would claim and their baby was taken into custody the man killed was later named as hassan omondi owiti a terror suspect the police had allegedly been trailing for months also killed was his wife shekha wanjiru four witnesses told human rights watch that the police had not encountered any armed resistance contrary to the claims of kenyan police but despite the evidence compiled by the human rights organisation there has been no known official kenyan investigation into whether the rrt s deadly raid was based on mistaken identity whether excessive force was used in killing owiti or why his wife was also killed an rrt commando familiar with the incident explained that his squad operated in secret in order to avoid scrutiny and protect the team s morale the work our special team does needs a lot of secrecy if i expose myself and my team we will become weak he said maria burnett formerly of human rights watch said she had long standing concerns that some kenyan security forces make considerable efforts to conceal their identity especially during counter terrorism operations she added such efforts are not only contrary to kenyan law they ultimately work to shield perpetrators of abuses from any shred of accountability successes current and former senior us officials with knowledge of the cia programme in kenya pointed to the rrt s success in disrupting attacks the year 2018 witnessed one of the lowest death tolls from terror attacks in the past decade in kenya and while 2019 witnessed a 20 increase in casualties on the year before the bulk of this difference was due to a single incident the dusitd2 attack on the whole and with significant assistance from the cia kenya has made substantial strides in disrupting terrorism however while al shabaab s attack on dusitd2 claimed fewer casualties than the earlier westgate and garissa attacks experts described the raid as representing a new and dangerous phase in the group s evolution since it was the first major operation relying on kenyan nationals of non somali descent capitalising on the dusitd2 attack in september 2019 al shabaab car bombers hit us and european military bases in somalia while the operations missed their targets within two months a group of un experts declared that al shabaab s use of improvised explosive devices reached its greatest extent in somali history for critics of the west and kenya s war on terror recent events are ominous we are being hit all the time because we are being seen as pro american pro west former kenyan vice president kalonzo musyoka said it s not a matter of if but a matter of when we get attacked again for as long as we have our troops inside somalia all us diplomatic and intelligence sources interviewed by declassified expressed concern about kenya s abuses in the war on terror nonetheless former us ambassador william bellamy who served in nairobi from 2003 06 said that american backed teams like the rrt should be safeguarded and preserved that is the kind of ct relationship where you feel your partner is accountable and responsive and where you have some correlation between your inputs and their outputs that you can point to he said but others say that in addition to flouting kenyan law the killings carried out by the rrt and the culture of impunity it exemplifies can breed extremism heavy handed tactics seem to have become more pronounced in response to the terrorist threat following westgate another former us ambassador michael ranneberger said all of this of course is linked to the culture of impunity and heavy handed tactics contribute towards radicalisation musyoka provided a starker assessment extrajudicial killings push people underground people say ok this is how our relatives have been killed we shall take revenge there is nothing that really radicalises than taking somebody out in a manner that is not in accordance with the law khelef khalifa of muhuri which advocates for justice on behalf of victims of the war on terror expressed similar concerns there is a lot of anti american feeling because of everything they do people say it is the americans who fund the police to do this even when they know something is wrong they don t speak up for omar faraj s family still living on kenya s coast every new killing or disappearance is a reminder of the night their son was murdered in 2019 their region reportedly witnessed 43 extrajudicial killings by kenyan police an increase of almost 50 on the previous year as an elected member of the county assembly faraj s brother saad s status brought him into contact with us ambassador to kenya robert godec who departed in 2019 he says he asked godec why his government was supporting abusive units such as the one that killed his brother he appeared shocked when he heard the news so he gave me his contact saad told declassified he says he reached out to godec but never received a response saad his voice choking as he fought back tears said if they are truly working to defeat extremism they need to be sure before they take drastic decisions to eliminate people because i ve lost a very important person in my life the least they can do is to come clean and say they apologise and admit the killing was a mistake former cia deputy henry crumpton dubbed a master of covert operations said respect for rights was key to winning the long war you ve got to win allies in this kind of war and human rights abuses have no part in that when you look at the counterterrorism programme in kenya it s been successful but i haven t seen anything about winning the peace and that is where the policy issue is essential he added you can have great covert action great law enforcement great military cooperation but if you don t have a policy where you think about the long term then you re just going to be engaged in the same operations in the same districts in the same border areas in the same valleys again and again the us embassy in nairobi the kenya police service and the kenyan ministry of the interior did not respond to requests for

michel martin host you probably heard about that proposal by senate democrats to tax certain assets of billionaires to help pay for president biden s spending plan you probably also heard that that was one of the ideas that did not make it into the compromise announced on thursday it was stripped out along with popular and controversial provisions like free community college and paid family leave and it also came after some of the world s wealthiest people turned thumbs down calling it stupid and possibly illegal but our next guest who has written extensively about the tax code says it is none of those things emory university law professor dorothy brown is with us now to tell us more welcome professor brown thank you for talking to us dorothy brown it s my pleasure to be here martin i just wanted to get your reaction to this all the sort of the back and forth and the drama around the so called billionaire s tax and the fact that it was left out of the president s spending framework is there something from the back and forth this week that stood out to you brown well what stood out is more of the same billionaires with the greatest ability to pay don t want to pay anything to the federal government they would rather pay it to their tax lawyers to figure out ways to not pay income taxes so i wasn t surprised that billionaires pushed back i mean so many of them are paying no taxes and suddenly the idea that they might have to pay taxes just sent them over the edge so it was troubling that it was left out of the bill but ultimately predictable because as i write in my book the whiteness of wealth wealthy white taxpayers have always been able to work behind the scenes to get tax laws that benefit themselves martin let s sort of walk through it i mean as we said some of the world s wealthiest people like elon musk worth some 300 billion tweeted that democrats should forget it the billionaire investor leon cooperman said in an interview with the daily beast i doubt it s legal and it s stupid so first of all you say it s not stupid at all you say that our tax system is built on the ability to pay and the richest among us pay some of the lowest tax rates first of all why do such super wealthy people pay the lowest tax rates why is that brown because they are in charge of how much income they actually receive technically under our tax laws so they either take little or no salary they finance their lifestyle through loans that are secured by their stock investments and under our tax law when you get a loan you have an obligation to repay and the tax law doesn t see that as income so they pledged their wealthy holdings in stock to get a loan that finances their daily expenditures and they pay no taxes it s a shame martin as many have pointed out under the new tax rules in this bill millionaires the so called working wealthy will in most cases pay more in taxes than billionaires and those with dynastic wealth and why is that is it the sort of working wealthy brown work laughter martin make their money like the way you and i do just by working brown yes martin why is it that the money you earn while you re awake is taxed so much more heavily than the money you earn passively brown while you sleep martin while you sleep yeah why is that brown well it s because there s a bias in our tax laws that advantages income from capital income from stock and disadvantages income from labor it s an unfair advantage but it s a provision that dates back to the 1920s and ultimately came into the tax law because a wealthy white man wanted to pay less in his taxes so here we are you know decades later almost a hundred years later still dealing with this i mean one of the proposals president biden originally had was for those making more than a million dollars to pay income on their stock the same way as income on their wages that didn t make it into the bill martin i think what underlies this kind of visceral reaction to it is well number one as you pointed out that the extremely wealthy have disproportionately had a lot to say about the way the tax code operates from the very beginning brown yes martin but the broader philosophical issue i think their argument is that their businesses and enterprises create jobs and generate wealth and isn t that contribution enough brown they don t all generate jobs what we saw during the pandemic is companies taking loans and firing workers we see bezos tax rate lower than his warehouse workers we see these billionaires creating problems that the federal government then has to solve and the billionaires that create the problem don t want to pay their fair share of having created the problem so no there s not this i mean that s the rhetoric right that you know we do all this good no they do good for themselves martin and before we let you go just for people who haven t read your latest book the whiteness of wealth how does race enter into this brown race is very relevant because when we look at who the people are who are not paying taxes they are by and large wealthy white americans and it s wealthy white americans who are behind the scenes pulling levers to get tax laws that benefit themselves and who pays black americans pay higher taxes because wealthy white americans pay less as well as middle class white taxpayers pay more because wealthy white americans pay less so it s really important when we talk about taxes to talk about race and tax something that treasury and the irs fails to do but something that i think is critical to the conversation going forward martin dorothy brown is professor of tax law at emory university her latest book is the whiteness of wealth how the tax system impoverishes black americans and how we can fix it professor brown thank you so much for talking with us today brown thank you for having me soundbite of aloe blacc s with my friends transcript provided by npr copyright npr

not since minnesota s same sex marriage debates of 2012 13 has star tribune opinion seen an outpouring of commentary like that on this year s city charter amendments especially question 2 in

city government lacks clear and responsive direction the mayor represents all minneapolis citizens but has responsibility with little management authority who is in charge we need to align responsibility with management authority strong mayor amendment is the one that matters by stephen bubul a minneapolis attorney sept 15 city question 1 would finally clearly state that the mayor is

the tax levy approving the budget and similar matters strong mayor plan mainly strengthens white elite by lynnell mickelsen minneapolis writer oct 7 i think the strong mayor amendment is the most radical dangerous thing on the ballot it would take power and representation away from poorer neighborhoods from people of color and younger people and give even more power to affluent older white

pick up the tab stabilized rent is a step in the right direction by peter and jane eichten minneapolis landlords sept 30 we became landlords because we wanted people to have a good stable home not so that we could make a quick buck at someone else s expense by spiking the rent whenever we felt like it let s not relive the rent control nightmare others endured by will rolf a st paul realtor oct 5 well intentioned people championed rent control and stabilization in new york it was not their goal to decimate the housing stock and the tax base that was an unintended consequence st paul voters

oct 13 in general there is little to mixed evidence that rent stabilization deflates property values reduces the rate of new housing construction or has detrimental impacts on mom and pop landlords
maine sea grant staff and maine based researchers will advance a multimillion dollar noaa sea grant american lobster initiative ali which announced its third round of funding six newly funded research projects three of which are led by maine based researchers will address critical gaps in knowledge about how the american lobster homarus americanus is being impacted by environmental change in the gulf of maine georges bank and southern new england the focus of this work is based on specific language in sea grant s fiscal year 2021 appropriations language one of the most iconic modern american fisheries the american lobster also represents one of the largest and most valuable single species fisheries along the atlantic coast in 2020 the landings value of the american lobster fishery was estimated at 524 5 million in the united states according to noaa fisheries of which the maine fishery accounted for an estimated 408 million within maine lobsters make up roughly 80 of the landings value of all fisheries combined however ecosystem shifts food web changes and ocean acidification all present threats to the american lobster fishery given the importance of lobster to the economy and culture of maine i m thrilled to have these new projects join the growing initiative said amalia harrington a marine extension team member with maine sea grant at umaine and the regional extension coordinator for the american lobster initiative the more we learn now the better prepared our lobster industry will be in the future the american lobster initiative supports both scientific research and a northeast regional sea grant extension program coordinated by maine sea grant to increase the american lobster industry s resilience to the biological economic and social impacts of ecosystem change over the past three years the american lobster initiative has invested more than 5 4 million in research and extension projects including more than 2 5 million to fund 10 projects led by researchers in maine this year more than 660 000 will support new research at the university of maine maine department of marine resources and wells national estuarine research reserve damian brady an associate professor in the school of marine sciences at the university of maine will expand the decades long work of modeling larval american lobster transport to include dynamics associated with prey availability through the team s work with the maine department of marine resources maine lobstermen s association and the lobster institute the study will build a flexible ecosystem based early life history model capable of answering fundamental questions from industry members and stakeholders regarding changes in ocean conditions larval distribution and their relationships to their food supply rebecca peters a marine resource scientist at the maine department of marine resources will partner with the maine center for coastal fisheries to understand what current and new predators of american lobsters exist in the gulf of maine especially as it pertains to juvenile lobsters to answer this question they will use current surveys to collect stomachs from seven species that prey on lobster atlantic cod white hake red hake atlantic halibut atlantic mackerel black sea bass and striped bass this team of researchers state agency scientists and industry members will share results with federal research partners members of the lobster industry and students across maine the research will provide data on potential lobster predators and allow managers to use these data to update current single species american lobster assessments and work on ecosystem models for the gulf of maine jason goldstein research director at the wells national estuarine research reserve will work to evaluate the overall health and quality of egg bearing american lobsters and examine how environmental drivers of climate change in the gulf of maine may be impacting this key life history phase the data obtained from this project will be used to inform future stock assessments and lay the groundwork for a long term monitoring program that includes the linkages between egg bearing lobster health and climate change stakeholder engagement and outreach will serve to connect the findings with the commercial lobster fishery fisheries managers students and the public through data sharing presentations

this weekend the democrats and their supporters are busy with some pretty vile actions we saw the crazy tiki torch smear in virginia which is backfiring on the mcauliffe campaign which was already in big trouble and collapsing with sparse numbers at events cnn gave them some help with the smear but mcauliffe is in such trouble in the polls his campaign had to resort to having kamala harris at a rally to stump for terry mcauliffe so you know they re desperate advertisement but that s not the only place democratic supporters are showing how low they will go we ve been covering the continuing effort by radical leftists to harass sen kyrsten sinema d az for not going along with biden s build back better spending bonanza bill she and sen joe manchin d wv have been the leading moderate voices who have raised questions about the price tag of the bill as well as many of the questionable provisions while they re the leading voices they re backed by other moderates with similar concerns the latest failure to put the bill through appears to have been largely the fault of the progressives who didn t want to vote on the infrastructure bill this past week after house speaker nancy pelosi d ca called for a vote so pelosi and joe biden went down in flames yet again however that fact hasn t stopped the left from still blaming sinema how dare she have thoughts other than the ones they do there was even an op ed written asking if she was bad for bisexual americans talk about low but the left keeps proving they ll keep reaching for those lows sinema was officiating at a wedding of a personal friend today the radicals stalked her there and were screaming their heads off right outside the wedding the mother of the bride who shouldn t have to worry about this nonsense came outside to beg and plead with them almost in tears to at least give them an hour so as not to destroy the ceremony with all the screaming they didn t give a darn and told her to throw sinema out and then they ll shut up advertisement they start chanting shame shame when they re the only shameful people there one woman spits out tell her we don t like what she s doing to our country they even had a let them eat wedding cake sign making it clear they knew and planned on bothering the wedding guests they then attack the poor mother who s only trying to look out for her daughter and tells her to go back inside to her millionaire friends this doesn t exactly look like a millionaire venue it s a small courtyard right behind the fence next to to the stock exchange saloon in bisbee arizona but they don t care at one point even the bride spoke to them and still that didn t move them thanks for ruining my wedding i really appreciate it she said sarcastically it s just my wedding i really wish i could enjoy my wedding without you ruining it ultimately some agreed to quiet down for the ceremony although one continued to make noise this is where these people are at how is this protesting and not just harassment at this point sinema isn t even listening to them they re just being jerks they have no morality or actual concern about anything other than their own agenda they ll stop at nothing to get what they want that s all they keep showing again and again these are not good people there s something deeply wrong with them advertisement this is what the true party of intolerance has created this is where the left wants to lead us to a place where everything is subordinate to the political agenda even a pleading mother and a sacred ceremony

skimpflation isn t just a reflection of greedy corporations squeezing consumers to fatten profits cough disney cough skimpflation is a direct result of the workforce declining to take jobs in which

mattresses to tuck in sheets all day long for garbage level pay the demise of breakfast buffets and disneyland s still defunct tram service entry prices have soared but never mind you have to come here right because we brainwashed your kids so pay up and shut up because you have to pay there is no way out as i have been saying for some time labor has been devalued and denigrated for decades most recently in my conversation with max keiser in an economy obsessed with measuring money economists focus on pay and benefits as if those metrics are all that matters what about being valued having some say about one s work being respected for one s efforts and earning dignity not just rapidly depreciating dollars none of those realities ever enter mainstream economics but that doesn t mean they don t exist it s not just low pay that makes work wretched it s being treated as an object owned by the employer exploitation comes in many flavors and they all taste bad there s another factor left out of economists obsession with counting dollars the public is increasingly unhinged and those having to deal with the public are paying an increasingly steep price flight attendants are being assaulted workers are being threatened cussed out etc who wants a job where someone seeking to vent their rage can unload on an employee labor s quiet rebellion is feeding a self reinforcing feedback loop of collapse corporate america so accustomed to treating its workforce like donkeys just load on more work has responded to labor shortages by increasing the workload of those still on the job burning out the remaining employees in the process this darwinian feedback those willing to stay on the job are soon crushed by overwork and screaming customers increases the pressure on managers to cut services and load more work on whomever is left as the sole means of meeting management s relentless demands for more sales and profits as the means to do so fall off a cliff the financial nobility s answer give the super wealthy more trillions isn t trickling down to the real world conjuring money out of thin air while changing absolutely nothing in the real world economy is not going to force workers to take chattel jobs which only get more oppressive with each passing day imagine the berobed noble being driven down from the castle to address his army of indebted serfs and you have a snapshot of corporate america oh how sweet and endearing the noble s false phrases of appreciation and then the whip comes out it s not just the workforce that s rebelling consumers will eventually rebel too the solution to corporate scrimping on service is to simply stop giving them money don t wait in line for diminished products don t book the room or flight do something better and more satisfying with your time and money the returns on trying to make all this go away by giving another trillion or three to the super rich are diminishing fast quiet rebellion leads to

the bill that ultimately became the wa cares program was an ambitious idea to tackle a problem many washingtonians will face it created a social insurance program to help people pay for care for themselves in old age or sickness if i could just for a moment say that how very proud i am that washington will become the first state in the nation to provide long term care insurance for every worker in the state said jinkins from the house floor the day it passed its final vote starting in january the program imposes a 0 58 payroll deduction on workers in washington for someone making 50 000 a year that s 290 per year beginning in 2025 beneficiaries could start claiming up to 36 500 to help them pay for home care that could include among other things delivered meals and in home care transportation assisted living and nursing home services and respite for family members giving care the idea is to give people the resources they ll need for care and prevent people from spending themselves into poverty but the fledgling program is off to a rocky start the only way for working residents to not be included in the program is to take advantage of a one time opt out offered this year to qualify those people must apply with the employment security department and have purchased a long term private insurance plan by monday on oct 1 the first day for residents to apply the opt out website crashed by that point private insurance companies were already pulling their long term care policies over concerns that people would purchase them and then perhaps quickly drop them to avoid the payroll tax wa cares has also encountered increasing resistance over who receives a benefit critics and even some supporters of the program point to people who will pay into wa cares but never earn a benefit such as older people right now who won t have time to get vested under the current law s timeline others point to workers who could pay in for decades and never receive a dime if they leave washington to retire elsewhere a similar problem exists for people who work in washington but live in oregon or idaho or military families rotating in and out of the region meanwhile scores of businesses unions and groups including microsoft amazon alaska airlines and more than 40 local of chambers of commerce penned a letter in september asking gov jay inslee to delay the program in earlier proposed legislation for the program jinkins who has since become speaker of the house had two republican co sponsors in 2019 another republican rep drew macewen of union mason county co sponsored the bill and spoke in favor of it early on before renouncing his support and ultimately voting against the policy now i think the best thing the legislature can do is ideally get rid of it or delay it and do some serious fixes said macewen in interviews democrats acknowledged the rollout has been troubled but even as they examine changes to improve the policy democrats have vowed to move forward without delaying the start of the payroll tax a bipartisan commission is set next month to vote on recommendations for lawmakers to consider when they gather for the legislative session that begins in january rep nicole macri d seattle who along with macewen is a member of that group said democrats are focused on finding fixes like making sure adults who are older right now can get vested for benefits but added macri we will not see proposals from democrats that would increase payroll deductions problems and questions as of friday nearly 280 000 residents have applied to opt out of the program through the employment security department esd more than 93 000 of those applications have so far been approved according to the agency state sen mark mullet a moderate democrat from issaquah who voted against the program in 2019 said he s still waiting for his exemption to be approved he described the multistep process through esd as misery it was like going to a dentist without novocain for the 187 000 washingtonians awaiting confirmation a delay on processing applications could be problematic said mullet that s because people authorized to opt out must show the approved papers to their employer by jan 1 to be taken off the payroll tax if you fail to present your esd approval letter employers will withhold non refundable wa cares premiums according to esd s website meanwhile the long term services and supports trust commission is expected to vote on recommendations on nov 10 on recommended changes for lawmakers to consider macri said the commission is composed of lawmakers officials in government and labor and other stakeholders one focus will be addressing older adults to make sure they can get benefits when the program starts in 2025 right now an individual must have been contributing to the wa cares fund for at least 10 years at any point in their lives without a break of five years or more within those 10 years for older adults who don t have many working years left a fix in the program might allow them to qualify for benefits by paying in for few years so a fix might be aimed for example at somebody who paid for eight total years and didn t vest said jinkins but i m less inclined to say we should delay it because i m not sure what advantage that gives to delay it she said either fix it or scrap it conservative activists have begun collecting signatures for an initiative that if it qualified could deal a hefty blow to the program proposed initiative 1436 if approved by the legislature or later by voters would allow state residents to opt out from the program at any time we re working hard to get it qualified said cary condotta co founder of the group restore washington we think this is the way to get in front of the legislature and say hey either fix it or scrap it it s not that it s a horrible idea it s just executed poorly added condotta a former longtime republican state lawmaker from wenatchee as an initiative to the legislature advocates would have to gather about 325 000 valid signatures by dec 30 if it qualifies by collecting enough signatures the measure would go first to lawmakers where they could approve i 1436 or deny it if they deny it the initiative would go to the 2022 ballot if legislators amended i 1436 both the amended and original version would go before voters in november 2022 wa cares has already taken one blow at the ballot box last november washington voters rejected a proposed constitutional amendment to allow the trust funds to be invested in stocks a key move for making the program solvent for several generations supporters of the program and that amendment pointed out that the vote came amid the economic uncertainty of the earlier half of the covid 19 pandemic jinkins said she isn t aware of any serious effort to stop or change the program in a regularly scheduled news conference thursday inslee said he wasn t concerned about the program s troubles being a liability for democrats in next year s elections that is because it s a good plan and it helps people get care and we have a lot of people who don t have care said inslee and they don t want to live in poverty and they don t want to become wards of the state backers of the program have already kicked into gear with messaging to explain wa cares for voters and build support democratic state lawmakers have been holding virtual town halls to explain why the measure is needed a group washingtonians for a responsible future has been sponsoring content explaining the new program and how it could help people that group is funded partly by service employees international union local 775 which represents home health care workers seiu 775 funded most of the campaign last year on the constitutional amendment to invest long term care trust moneys into stocks and bonds adam glickman secretary treasurer of seiu 775 said the union which also backed the original legislation is open to changes particularly around getting older washingtonians benefits labor meanwhile will fight to preserve the program whether it s in the legislature or at the ballot it s safe to say seiu will do everything to preserve this program and strengthen it for future generations said glickman we will wholeheartedly oppose any efforts to eliminate it ___ c 2021 the seattle times visit the seattle

bowman dairy farmer kent whetsell has been milking cows for about 20 years he has seen a little bit of everything over two decades and has been able survive the ups and downs of the dairy business this year had the added challenge of a world trying to come to grips with covid 19 and its various impacts whetsell said 2021 has proven to be a little bit better than 2020 last year it was pretty tough he said this year all the supply chain issues have been worked out for example last year whetsell said farmers were told they had to cut about 10 of production because plants could not keep up with processing so many farms had to dump milk because of the supply chain issues he said currently whetsell milks about 175 jersey cows on his farm on landsdowne road where his operation helps to provide goods and product for low country creamery across the street the creamery produces whole milk chocolate milk greek and swiss yogurt and buttermilk much of the farm s production goes to charleston restaurants and coffee shops one relative constant in dairy is lower than desired milk prices they are not terrible right now but they are not where they need to be whetsell said for us we are getting about 19 to 20 per hundredweight cwt i would like to see them around 22 to 24 fluid milk prices are up actually slightly over the last couple of years in march 2018 prices got as low as 13 per cwt milk prices were as much as 24 cwt back in 2014 in addition to lower than desired milk prices another issue facing dairy farmers is input costs feed prices are very high right now whetsell said they are the highest over the past 10 years for example soybean is about 450 a ton typically it is under 300 a ton i don t know what our costs will be in the next six months whetsell said everything is so volatile it is not getting easier overall whetsell said the dairy market is generally up while fluid milk demand is down people are consuming more dairy products now than ever before whetsell said the pounds of dairy products per capita have been increasing with such things as yogurt and cheese market dynamics clemson extension associate professor of agribusiness and economist at the sandhill research and education center dr adam kantrovich said that at the farm level the mailbox milk price mmp is an important factor the mmp is the price that a dairy producer will see plus or minus costs associated with hauling and any other local differentials that may exist locally the region saw a mailbox price increase through the first six months of 2021 of about 2 per cwt more than this same time last year kantrovich says south carolina dairy producers were seeing a slight positive adjustment for the class i beverage milk price compared to others within the region providing a slightly higher price but unfortunately for some south carolina dairy producers this may be offset by the higher cost of hauling the milk from the farm he said this is an issue of seeing fewer dairy producers and fewer cows the cost of hauling milk increases dairy farmers for the early half of the year saw increasing milk prices as the economy began to open compared to last year however we are again beginning to see a slight pullback in prices kantrovich said cheese prices have begun a downward trend when compared to the same month of the previous year and a downward trend compared to earlier in the year nationally cheese production continues to move forward and for august is up over 4 compared to august 2020 in fact kantrovich says august was one of the highest cheese producing months in nine years cheese prices for the year however have been declining looking into 2022 indicators are that cheese price should hold relatively steady also barring any major shifts that would change present demand he said butter production and butter stocks are also down compared to last year indicators are looking for a steady to a slight potential increase in butter price as we move into and through 2022 but we will need to see continued growth in demand kantrovich said looking ahead kantrovich says 2022 could see a potential pullback of prices based on per cow production increases shipments of condensed and dry milk products this july and august as compared to last year have decreased the positive is that we have also seen stocks down which we hope will negate any negative effects of shipments kantrovich said as we come out of the pandemic and hopefully an attempt to resolve any continued trade war issues we could see an upside but right now that is a big if as of right now it is most likely to see steady to a slight decrease in milk price at the farm as we head through 2022 pending any major disruptors good or bad kantrovich said the positive right now to holding milk prices steady is the decrease in cow numbers nationally as well as the state with the amount of milk per cow not increasing as fast as expected changing consumer demand will also play a role in this as well as international trade issues that began a few years ago have not yet been resolved kantrovich said given the many issues globally we will continue to have to live in a bit more of a dynamic market situation kantrovich says government price supports have proven beneficial to dairy farmers again this year this has provided some additional taxable income to producers but it still may not be able to assist in the longer term outlook for dairy prices and profitability nationally and here in south carolina he said without the usda program payments it is very possible we would have seen a higher loss in 2020 of cows and dairy farms than what was seen milk production declining dairies lower cow numbers and the stress of summer heat and humidity have reduced milk production according to the latest statistics and the latest appalachian federal milk marketing order information available as of august south carolina had produced approximately 6 721 632 pounds of milk with about 35 of that production coming from three farms in one county these are farms that sell milk through federal marketing orders which account for about 63 of milk sold while nationally milk production has increased slightly local dairy farms and cow numbers continue to decrease between 2019 and 2020 it is estimated that south carolina lost about 2 000 milking cows almost 16 7 of the state s herd kantrovich said i expect to see a further reduction in south carolina milking cows for 2021 but hopefully not as much of a drop as we saw between 2019 and 2020 kantrovich says one of the biggest challenges for dairy farmers this year has been maintaining a dairy herd in a time of decreasing farms and cow numbers this includes everything from replacement heifers to nutritionists and milk hauling kantrovich said another issue is going to be the cost of feed ration input costs for those dairies that purchase much of their feed ration vs raising it he said with an increase in feed costs there is a narrowing of input costs and milk prices covid and the farm kantrovich says the oversupply of milk experienced in 2020 as schools were closed required some changes in packaging to fit consumer purchasing most of these issues have subsided with the reopening of schools kantrovich said there are still occasional issues due to labor and logistical challenges throughout the food chain system kantrovich believes home consumption will decrease from last year as students are back to in person school and consumers are dining out more often another issue facing dairy farmers is hiring and labor even with some farms significantly increasing the wages paid it is just difficult finding help and keeping them on the farm he said kantrovich says in order for dairy farmers to survive into the future they will have to think outside of the box this will include looking for additional opportunities methods of marketing adding value to their milk possibly working with other dairy producers in new ventures and expansions kantrovich said and above all you need to be above average to make sure there is enough income for retirement and the ability to successfully bring the next generation on board for the long haul uncertain dairy future kantrovich says the dairy industry s challenges go beyond this year it is difficult to get the next generation to remain on the farm due to long hours without seeing an economic benefit he said it is simply very difficult for smaller to medium sized dairy producers to continue to build their net worth with such a narrow margin if any of profit or cash flow it simply takes a much higher number of cows being milked to raise a family as it did just a couple of decades ago let alone if you want to bring children and their family back to the farm

the issue of whether or not ceos are overpaid has been debated for many years the professionals in the ceo role are among the most prominent and influential people in any company they have a huge responsibility which is to manage and lead their employees to success but should they be paid so much more than an average employee the answer depends on who you ask many people argue that ceos deserve every penny of their salary because of the amount of work and time they put into their position but on the other hand there s also a large population that believes ceos get paid far too much money for what they do especially when compared to how much lower level employees make in this blog we ll walk through some interesting facts surrounding how we got here let s begin why do ceos earn so much due to their experience education skills and responsibilities c level executives are usually company s highest earners however there is still a debate about what level of compensation is appropriate ceos get paid an average of 12 25 million annually which is 272 times what the typical worker makes in a year it s easy to see why people think that ceo pay is too high but it isn t that simple many ceos work long hours and face significant risks for their company s performance if their companies do poorly they bring in major revenue or lose out on significant revenue so shouldn t they be rewarded you be the judge it s worth noting there are ways to determine fair compensation for executives without drastically reducing salaries at larger corporations across america one method could be tying executive salary with shareholder returns for example suppose a ceo s salary is based on the company s performance in that case they ll be incentivized to make decisions that benefit shareholders i e long term growth versus short term gains like acquisitions or cutting costs for quick results this could help ensure corporations grow efficiently and create more opportunities for employees along the way what do experts say it s easy to feel like ceo salaries are rising at an unsustainable rate compared to the average worker s salary this was one of the arguments made by presidential candidate bernie sanders during his campaign for office in 2016 i do understand that ceos make hundreds and hundreds of times more than the typical workers he said on an nbc s meet the press there is something wrong with our system however as the usa today points out above if we look back far enough into history we see that it wasn t always this way ceo pay increased sharply from the 1990s through the mid 2000s but has stagnated since 2010 executive earning rate ceo salary increases were primarily flat in 2016 compared with 2015 according to an analysis by executive compensation data firm equilar and the associated press published last october this marks the second year of no increase for s p 500 ceos after hikes ranging between 14 percent and 22 percent occurred during each of those years respectively following four consecutive years of increases of course ceo salaries are often under fire when the economy is weak but it s easy to forget ceo pay in good times according to usa today the average salary for ceos of s p 500 companies increased by an estimated 11 from 2015 to 2016 the drop off was attributed to a decrease in the number of ceos receiving bonuses and long term stock incentives and those who received perquisites such as personal use of company aircraft or security services according to equilar s analysis moving forward in 2015 median total compensation among these ceos rose nearly 12 percent in addition average salaries increased about 13 percent over 2014 marking the most significant increase since 2010 when increases ranged between 17 percent and 19 percent compared with 2013 averages by contrast median salary increases in 2016 were just under 0 04 percent compared with a year ago as these ceos median total compensation was essentially flat the new ceo pay study shows that median compensation for s p 500 ceos was 11 million in 2016 not including gains from vested shares and exercising stock options this study is based on the value of all perks bonuses and other forms of compensation during the year and salary data reported to shareholders in addition although the study included executive officers listed by their titles they were counted only once even if multiple executives held the same position or job title at different companies within this group final words finally the question of whether or not ceo salaries are fair is inherently subjective it s important to note that there isn t a single answer it varies from one person and organization to another depending on industry standards which change over time board compensation philosophy and leadership style
the ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas i e the class which is the ruling material force of society is at the same time its ruling intellectual force karl marx and friedrich engels the german ideology 1932 if you stick a knife in my back nine inches and pull it out six inches there s no progress if you pull it all the way out that s not progress progress is healing the wound that the blow made and they haven t pulled the knife out much less healed the wound they won t even admit the knife is there malcolm x in a march 1964 interview how does our capitalist economic system work upon what structural elements does it depend and how does money function in a modern economy these are some questions nearly everyone has pondered at some point in their lives as pretty much everyone knows the system we call capitalism has built the modern world and is the basis for mainstream economic theory according to most establishment pro capitalist economists capitalism can provide for a decent life for all of humanity conserve wildlife and ecosystems and maintain prosperity for nearly everyone if we only listen and apply their theories according to capitalists and their political academic and corporate advocates all the failures assumptions loopholes and lack of pricing in externalities can be fixed if we reform politics to properly account for a pristine capitalistic theory shorn of all the ideological laws and measures which get in its way is this really true or are capitalists and pro capitalist ideologues merely attempting to justify a system which benefits themselves at the expense of the world s poor and working classes as well as other species and the web of life which sustains us according to merriam webster capitalism can be defined as an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods by investments that are determined by private decision and by prices production and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market the obvious question to ask then is does capitalism deliver the goods does our system properly price produce and distribute goods in a rational manner to account for human non human and ecosystem needs is capitalism responsible for the technological and social progress we see around us the answers i believe are most definitely no assembled below are a few of the main reasons why not 1 capitalism is unsustainable our economy runs on infinite growth and an assumption that the earth s resources are bottomless our pricing system cannot account for the externalities of capitalism that is to say it cannot properly price in all the waste non renewable fossil fuels and resource extraction from the planet s ecosystems capitalists sell products on the market without a thought as to how the planet can regenerate habitats grow more trees produce clean water and properly regulate the climate since capitalism relies on ever increasing consumption its logic dictates that it will destroy the entire world to make more money since destruction and ecocide cannot be priced into its calculations further since the capitalist engine of wanton consumption is internalized in each of us in western society for it to function we all are coerced into becoming idle consumers where greedy and narcissistic impulses are rewarded selflessness and sharing must be relegated to the ever shrinking public or civic sphere while private businesses and property relations dominate more and more of human existence regardless of human needs while there are many more middle class people than ever before on our planet the costs based on a capitalist based growth model are too much to bear for the rest of the populace and the earth s ecosystems climate catastrophe threatens all of us and the twin threat of habitat destruction and degradation likewise will lead to cascading waves of suffering for generations environmental health impacts do not bode well for humanity either for instance by 2050 one third of all women and ½ of all men are predicted to have cancer at some point in their lives and this is directly connected to industrial practices and resource extraction which pollutes the earth with carcinogens if the climate breaches a 1 5 celsius increase from pre industrial levels we many reach a tipping point towards a hothouse earth scenario where positive feedback loops push the increase to 4 6 degrees above the norm which would wreak global devastation and an apocalyptic dystopian future 2 capitalism creates unjustifiable hierarchies today it is obvious to the poor and the majority of the working classes that capitalism has spun out of control and is responsible for mass immiseration imperialist wars and ecological destruction yet to even tacitly acknowledge that this is happening in middle class and bourgeois society marks one as a radical leftist a heretic basically the religious fervor becomes obvious at this point and arguments become emotional and infantile when pro capitalists insist that every positive of our current system is due to capitalism and not labor re producing life products and services while every negative gets rationalized away as due to the minor flaws of a system that just needs a little tinkering and reform around the edges within this mindset conservatives frame the problem as too much regulation or crony capitalism while liberals insist that simply more regulation will solve all the ailments our system produces from a leftist anti capitalist perspective however we acknowledge that while more regulation would in fact alleviate many problems they will not be enough to solve the conundrum of capital accumulation overproduction and waste generation and resource hoarding that lies at the heart of our economic engine besides the capitalist sycophants say and write you re writing this from your iphone so aren t you being a hypocrite yet it is the labor of the working classes not capitalism which actually physically produces goods and services the underlying subtext of their statement is obvious you re benefiting from the system too so don t rock the boat and screw up our gravy train of sweet treats gadgets entertainment and the comfort and security that living in a globe spanning military and economic empire provides it s quite sad really because there is simply no justification for the slave labor and habitat destruction that goes into making our technology clothing and various consumer items that we ve been imprinted into believing that we need it is our capitalist based jobs which compel us under the force of a gun to earn money to live the implication being of course that if you don t like it here you re welcome to leave and toil away in the mines and factories of developing nations no serious thought is given to structurally revolutionize the system because our capitalist masters would become angry and we know what their wrath can be like with centuries of massacres and oppression to show for it in such a system there is no such thing as a free contract between employees and employers corporations and employers have all the leverage and can effectively force employees to work or starve capital today remains just as it always has a rentier economy where the ownership class squeezes those who work with every conceivable form of rent for housing health care transportation various insurances food internet access etc until one s earnings are whittled down to nil there are over one billion people in extreme poverty and by any reasonable metric more than half the globe lives in impoverished conditions of one form or another the economic system that we know as capitalism has had over 200 years in control and i ve yet to hear any serious pronouncement from a capitalist economist on when poverty can be eliminated and although some may even admit that other forms of social organization are superior in eliminating poverty such as in indigenous cultures the refrain is there is no going back because of all the progress we ve made in other words capitalists and their sycophants wholeheartedly believe there is no alternative and what s more pro capitalist ideologues generally have a cynical dismal social darwinist hobbesian view of humanity and the masses 3 capitalism is inherently exploitative and alienating our system has managed to accumulate so much concentrated wealth because capitalism separates the worker from the means of production in doing so employees do not reap the full benefits at their jobs as wages and salaries are determined by the contract signed with their employers rather than free and fair contracts between equals workers do not have the leverage or bargaining position to ask for their proper payment because our system keeps people desperate and living from paycheck to paycheck and even with solid unions profit sharing stock options and collective bargaining agreements workers are still stiffed and do not accrue the surplus value from what they have created business owners thus extract the surplus value that is produced from workers employers give employees the bare minimum to keep on at their jobs profit sharing unionizing pensions and other benefits have been on a steady decline for decades now as capital consolidates wealth as prices for resources rise corporations have found that the strategy to keep late capitalism going is to cut labor costs when the majority of the population is forced to choose between always working a job that barely allows one to make ends meet or not even make ends meet and homelessness lack of health care and or starvation to even call this situation a job market or society is a stretch what we have is a system of severe coercion an abusive relationship with capitalists that we rationalize as necessary that we may deem necessary for western civilization or the economy to function but what we are facing is wage slavery and systems of propaganda that from birth inure us to exploitative conditions and program us to accept jobs that do not allow for full economic freedom due to exploitation and do not allow us to reach our potentials for intellectual spiritual enjoyment and growth due to alienation as we shall see capitalism alienates the worker because not only are we not valued economically by not taking part in the ownership of the goods and or services that a corporation produces employees realize that the products they make distribute sell etc are not actually useful to society in fact much of what capital creates is in fact useless and harmful if not downright toxic and deadly to people and wildlife workers become disillusioned and carry that resentment and frustration into all aspects of their lives these dark clouds of energy created by the satanic mills in which we toil provide the tragic backdrop to our lives sapping energy and robbing us of free will similar to how vampires and zombies are depicted in science fiction in this fraught environment nearly everyone is competing consciously or not for a slice of that american dream even if it means your friends across town will be evicted by rising real estate prices in your neighborhood or if the town next to you is despoiled by coal mining while your town is protected by affluence or regulations against such industry this can create resentment for those who do not realize or cannot come to terms with the fact that at least for now in the western world it is set up as a dog eat dog kill or be killed economy however many people have been lifted out of poverty by capitalism the surplus population of what are euphemistically called unskilled workers multiplies because there are simply not enough jobs available capital relies on the reserve army of labor to put downward pressure on wages also inflation due to fiat currencies financial and real estate speculation the monopolization of industries and price gouging practices create the conditions whereby the rich get richer and the poor get poorer 4 capitalism is extremely volatile historically nearly every seven to eight years western economies experience recessions or depressions due to inherent flaws in their makeup and what these crashes share in common are financial speculation when profit seems inevitable for investors in specific sectors of the economy bubbles are formed where vast influxes of capital flow towards sectors that seem too good to be true in terms of returns on investment as the old saying goes when something seems too good to be true it usually is whether in 2020 with the response to covid 19 creating a lockdown induced crash in 2008 with the real estate crash in the 2001 dot com bubble during the 1990 1991 recession caused by the gulf war and restrictive monetary policy the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s as well as the 1987 stock crash nearly the entire 1970s dealing with stagflation to the great depression and all the way back to the panics of 1873 and 1893 capitalism has shown it is fundamentally unstable when speculation whether in real estate stocks corporations cryptocurrencies or any other investment becomes the primary driver of the economy you re cooked it s only a matter of time before the financial system resembles a house of cards and just like a ponzi scheme or a bank run when the majority of banking customers investors or shareholders wants to pull out the crash ensues this is simply because monetary systems around the globe are run by a scheme of incurring ever greater debts which means that the physical money supply is only a fraction of what the economy supposedly consists of this is how all fiat currencies function today as fractional reserve banking allows commercial and local banks to loan out far more than their actual assets this means in effect that money is debt only by printing or today digitally creating new money through computing banks loan out more than they have and increase their holdings through interest payments which borrowers pay back over time therefore the entire economy relies on the money supply constantly expanding to repay what lenders are owed money just like production of consumer goods is a trap in which the entire economy and thus human life and labor becoming devoted to producing more and more not for usefulness or human necessity but simply to feed the bottomless pit of an ever expanding appetite in conclusion capitalism can t deliver the goods as we ve seen capitalism produces many paradoxes and contradictions to escape from feudalism humanity developed free markets which have ended up enslaving most of the planet in some form or another in order to start the engine of capitalism genocide slavery imperialism enclosure acts and primitive accumulation were the fuels by which capital could be consolidated by the bourgeoisie and power centralized in the nation state while the modern west has ensconced many of its citizens in affluence and privilege much of the world has only known strife and poverty for the last 200 years as capitalist domination has accelerated while the old model rested on territorial exploitation via imperial oversight today s empire is run from global metropoles of finance backed by threats of violence via economic subordination debt peonage via the world bank and imf exploiting cheap labor using wto and intellectual property law which prevent developing nations from self producing needed technology infrastructure and medicine having so brazenly exploited the periphery of empire for so long with little pushback from a complaint citizenry now the chickens are coming home to roost as capitalism squeezes the middle class out of existence in the core of empire today we find ourselves in a situation where capitalism has not just colonized most of the planet but through ruling class control of the media also the minds of billions in the developed and developing worlds the ruling class has put many into a false double bind whereby the only solutions seem to be between a liberal order which promises more regulations a more humane and less racist and sexist world promises of a slightly more equitable social democratic framework all the while failing on nearly all fronts due to the adherence to capitalist neoliberal economics and austerity politics and a reactionary conservatism which promises to restore national greatness yet stokes imperialist racist xenophobic and atavistic impulses within this constrained and artificial binary choice for most urbane people the liberal choice appears better while for most rural citizens and those disconnected from the cultures of large cities the conservative side seems more appealing little to no thought is given to a post capitalist leftist politics which could emancipate the working classes of the world capitalism can no longer produce allocate and distribute resources effectively while the media superstructure will continue to place blame on the pandemic for all of its woes capitalist overproduction systemic inflation wage suppression and the falling rate of profit are leading to another large economic crisis despite what mainstream news says the supply chain problems we see today are not simply due to worker shortages or production bottlenecks capital has misallocated labor towards jobs that produce little to no value to society as well as systemically underpaying key labor sectors leading to massive job losses while being unable to plan for key agricultural logistical and technological needs progress which seems tied to capital in reality is due to the innate ingenuity and inventiveness of workers i e the material and mental labor which produces essential commodities capital influxes which once seemed necessary to marshal large scale organization and production are now superfluous in a post scarcity world where the seemingly rational invisible hand of the market and control of production through supply and demand gives way to ruthless monopolies and a planet threatening military industrial complex this was always the direction and logic capitalism would take and while legal reforms could make impactful differences the structural revolution which is necessary for human flourishing will inevitably need economic democracy in the workplace as a cornerstone of a sustainable post capitalist world finally climate change and habitat loss promise to erase the gains of capitalism as global warming scarcity of clean water desertification and degradation of farmlands threatens apocalyptic devastation for large swaths of the planet using non renewable fossil fuels to guide expansion of the economy seemed great in the 19th century but has proven to be a faustian bargain conversion to renewable resources should be made according to popular will not held back by the dictates of multinational corporations which sacrifice the environment social re production dignified lives for the masses and future generations for short term profit new democratic structures will need to be built to rationally allocate resources and redistribute private property into communal holdings as we can no longer rely on the capricious whims of capitalists or on the conspicuous consumption of the affluent nations to drive production and finance in order for this to be achieved many affluent westerners will have to be reminded that the siren calls and pandering from capitalists who have molded a self satisfied and compliant citizenry are a poison to us all and that regardless of one s level of comforts capitalism in fact is not our friend

charges of evading arrest minutes apart thursday following two unrelated incidents one of which involved an alleged dui driver who allegedly took out several road signs and a light pole on i 15 while a motorcycle rider reportedly created a ruse took off and ran from officers in hurricane he was later arrested in washington city on thursday officers were notified of a dodge flatbed pickup that was reportedly going more than 100 mph and unable to maintain lane travel as it headed towards interstate 15 a second 911 caller reported the same pickup truck heading south on i 15 and according to the caller the dodge was all over the roadway taking out several signs and a light pole in the process the dodge left the freeway at exit 10 and continued into washington city where an officer spotted the vehicle heading east on telegraph and turned around to catch up to the truck while trailing the pickup the officer noticed heavy damage to the driver side door as well as damage running down the side of the truck the officer also noted one of the truck s windows was cracked and the driver s side mirror was missing damage consistent with being involved in a crash of some type the officer activated his emergency lights intent on stopping the truck i was in my department issued patrol vehicle with an overhead light bar and bold police letters marked down both sides clearly showing it was a police vehicle the officer stated but instead of pulling over the dodge continued east on telegraph with lights and sirens still activated the officer continued trailing the dodge in an attempt to stop the vehicle that continued down the roadway at one point the officer pulled up alongside the pickup to get the driver s attention and even with the driver s side window missing the driver did not seem to notice the officer nor did he appear to hear the siren that continued blaring from the patrol vehicle after several blocks the dodge pulled over near 200 west which is when the officer approached and spoke to the driver who was identified by his driver s license as 55 year old jacques michel jasmin of washington city officers removed jasmin from the truck and said they noticed a strong odor of alcohol his balance appeared unstable to the point he was unable to stand without assistance the officers also said jasmin s actions appeared labored and he appeared to be disoriented so the field sobriety test was terminated shortly after it began due to safety issues a portable breathalyzer was administered and showed a blood alcohol level of 172 more than three times the legal limit in utah jasmin was transported to st george regional hospital for medical clearance before being booked into jail on felony evading and other misdemeanor traffic related charges officers with the washington city police department also assisted with another evading incident 14 hours earlier involving a suspect who reportedly evaded officers in hurricane he was arrested and booked into jail shortly after 2 a m on thursday the incident began when a patrol officer heading east on state street in hurricane noticed a motorcycle pass him going in the opposite direction at a high rate of speed the officer recorded the bike on radar doing 82 mph the officer turned around and activated his emergency lights and siren but the bike continued accelerating away from his pursuer it was not until the bike approached the intersection of 6300 west and state street that the rider stopped for the traffic light and as he did so the officer noted the rider looked back at the officer who still had his emergency lights activated and pointed to the side of the road as if to indicate he would pull over when the light changed the officer wrote as soon as the light changed the rider started into the turn but then pulled the bike back onto state street and took off in the direction of i 15 where he entered the onramp heading south meanwhile the officer who had recorded the license plate on the bike when it was stopped at the light called the plate into emergency dispatch and obtained the registration information indicating the bike was owned by 23 year old jaxon lee scott who had an address listed in washington city the officer also confirmed it was scott after obtaining a driver s license photo that matched the suspect officers in washington city were then dispatched to scott s address where they noticed a motorcycle parked at the apartment complex that matched the bike involved in the earlier incident along with a helmet that was identified as the same one he was wearing when asked scott said he did see the officer but that he rode off because he was scared the report states scott was arrested and taken to purgatory correctional facility where he was booked into jail on felony evading and a misdemeanor reckless driving charge ed note a new utah law generally prohibits the release of arrest booking photos until after a conviction is obtained this report is based on

karachi pakistan may experience fiscal and monetary tightening in 2021 22 because of inflation and higher current account deficit which have been aggravated by global logistic bottlenecks and rising commodity prices said salim raza former governor of the state bank of pakistan sbp addressing the ceos and senior management of banks at the pakistan banking awards held on friday evening the veteran banker said banks would nonetheless preserve their earnings growth going forward our banks are well experienced in managing portfolios and business risks during tightening periods he said mr raza expressed hope that the aftershock of covid 19 might be over by next year but warned that it could take longer because the old economy consisting of energy metals and commodities didn t receive any investment in the last seven or eight years if you take pakistan s different business segments and compare them with international competitors i think the banking sector will rank among the best it s got a solid tier 1 capital position and a very strong return on equity he said a primary source of funding tier 1 capital is a measure of banks financial strength consisting of their shareholders equity and retained earnings the average tier 1 capital for pakistani banks is 14 6 per cent against 13pc and 16pc for the banks in north america and the european union respectively he said veteran banker calls commercial banking sector a virtual monolith of finance as for the return on equity which measures the rate of profit that bank owners receive on their shareholdings the average value for pakistani lenders is 14 5pc versus 9pc and 5pc for north american and eu banks he added mr raza criticised banks for their lack of exposure to the small and medium enterprises sme and agriculture sectors against a 14pc share for the two sectors in pakistan s total bank loans the corresponding values for indian and chinese banking sectors are between 40pc and 50pc rather than a traditional reliance on collateral and documentation banks credit assessment needs to focus on cash flow and supply chain positioning for sme agriculture incursion he said highlighting that government securities took up 53pc of banks loanable assets the former sbp chief said pakistani lenders drove about 42pc of their overall earnings from risk free instruments the share of advances in banks loanable assets used to be 70pc in 2002 09 he said it meant the loan volume would today be rs4 6 trillion or 48pc higher than its current level had the banks maintained their focus on advances he added the share of casa non term deposits with either no or low interest rate in the country s banking industry is 78pc versus 44pc in india he noted it s high primarily because time deposits spread equally between national savings and banks both are rs3 7tr he pointed out he urged bank ceos to take the lead in diversifying banking services our commercial banking sector is a virtual monolith of finance he said noting that it should strive to expand into undeveloped business segments like securitisation bond market mergers acquisitions buyouts and consolidations complaining that the revenue sources of pakistani banks have stayed the same since the time when dinosaurs roamed the planet mr raza complained about limited innovation in the banking sector using artificial intelligence digital companies can establish payment histories and allocate predictive rating scores for intermediate entities factoring credit within supply chains can become a substantial business feedback loop from e commerce gives better rating outcomes than bank models he said published in dawn october 31st 2021
by lucila sigal and daniela desantis charigue argentina reuters gustavo alcides diaz an argentine fisherman and hunter from a river island community is at home on the water the parana river once lapped the banks near his wooden stilt home that he could reach by boat fish gave him food and income he purified river water to drink now the 40 year old looks out on a trickle of muddy water the parana south america s second largest river behind only the amazon has retreated this year to its lowest level since its record low in 1944 hit by cyclical droughts and dwindling rainfall upriver in brazil climate change only worsens those trends the decline of the waterway which knits together a huge swathe of the continent has hurt river communities like diaz s snarled grains transport in argentina and paraguay and contributed to a rise in wildfires damaging wetland ecosystems this is historic i ve never seen it so low in my lifetime diaz said at his home in charigue some 300 kilometers 186 miles upriver from the argentine capital buenos aires lamenting the impact on fish stocks and fresh water when everything dries up the water rots the parana s crisis is among the multitude of woes arising worldwide associated with global climate change linked to the burning of fossil fuels and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions world leaders are set to meet at the united nations climate change conference or cop26 starting on oct 31 in glasgow scotland amid warnings from a u n panel about climate related disruptions for decades if not centuries to come the river born in southern brazil snakes about 4 880 kilometers 3 030 miles through paraguay and argentina before reaching the atlantic ocean it is a vital waterway for commercial shipping and fishing provides drinking water to millions of people powers hydroelectric plants and supports rich biodiversity billions of dollars worth of agricultural commodities such as soy corn and wheat are transported to ports down the parana to be shipped around the world it carries about 80 of argentina s farm exports though some shippers are now looking to move goods over land due to the reduced water levels the parana s flow at some points this year has fallen to just over half the normal amount satellite imagery clearly shows how much the river has receded the dry weather driving the parana s decline is due in part to a long term natural cycle of weather patterns that is being worsened by global warming wetlands burning and hydroelectric dam construction all coinciding with the la nina natural ocean atmospheric phenomenon that lowers rainfall levels agronomist and climate expert eduardo sierra said the broader dry cycle could last for decades forcing a readjustment for communities farmers and shippers sierra added this is a twice in a century event said sierra an adviser to the buenos aires grains exchange referring to the river s decline we also have a human cause which is global warming which is accentuating all the variations in the climate sierra added noting that human activity including damming also impacts the river s ability to self regulate like the sea the parana meaning like the sea in the tupi guarani language spoken by local indigenous peoples owing to its vastness is formed by the convergence of two rivers in brazil the rio grande and the paranaiba the parana fills with water in brazilian states including goias minas gerais sao paulo and mato grosso do sul before its long journey to the river plate estuary at buenos aires these areas upriver have experienced steady declines in rainfall levels over the past 10 years according to a reuters analysis of refinitiv weather data spanning the past three decades the analysis showed that combined average rainfall in those four brazilian states has plunged to the lowest level since at least the early 1990s precipitation levels during that time have dropped by half with the trend accelerating in the past decade this past year will stand out compared to anything else from the past any way you measure it said isaac hankes refinitiv senior weather research analyst that sustained drop in rainfall directly impacts the level of the parana thousands of kilometers miles down river in argentina and paraguay where huge ships and barges rely on deep river channels to ferry large agricultural cargoes the river s declining levels are hindering the transport of such cargo because ships are unable to be fully loaded due to concern that a deeper draft the distance from the waterline to the vessel s bottom from the extra weight might cause them to run aground the river s average depth over the past two years at the argentine inland grains port of rosario is the second lowest on record behind a historic drought in 1944 measuring sticks that dot the river at key points and provide depth gauges related to a set historical zero level instead of the river bed have dropped into negative territory guillermo wade manager of argentina s chamber of port and maritime activities said the lower level means that ships are cutting grain cargoes by around 20 versus normal volumes ships must cut from 1 600 to 2 175 tonnes of cargo to save a foot of draft wade added vessels are leaving rosario with an average draft of about 9 1 meters 30 feet versus the normal 10 4 meters 34 feet wade said in more than 40 years that i have been in this job i have never seen it reach 33 centimeters 13 inches below zero i had never seen that wade said low river levels also have forced exporters to take smaller loads in cargo ships while upriver and then add cargo at deep water ports down the river raising logistics costs argentina has lost about 620 million in soybean meal and soyoil exports alone due to transport problems caused by lower river levels according to the rosario grains exchange through this decline we are losing cargo loads wade said perhaps next time instead of coming for this little bit here boats will go directly to brazil and we will lose out rapid recharge in wetland areas around the river delta in argentina lower water levels have contributed to a spike in wildfires with people in river island communities losing homes and livestock when the river rises just 10 centimeters 4 inches here they celebrate said javier herenu 53 a local teacher near charigue whose boat commute from his home to the school has been replaced by a long walk in a dry riverbed the economic impact is gigantic carlos balletbo a senior official at regional shipper atria said at his office

house democratic leaders are pressing forward with president biden s smaller plan for a domestic policy bill that sweeps up some of his top priorities after months of infighting and a stinging loss in virginia s gubernatorial race there is a new sense of urgency to show the party can deliver but the revised bill faces hurdles in the senate where several democrats say they have issues with the new version and the process to get to a final deal is expected to drag out through the fall biden announced a 1 75 trillion framework last week a scaled back version of his initial 3 5 trillion build back better plan democrats are using a budget process known as reconciliation to get around a gop filibuster in the senate so they need all 50 senators who caucus with the democrats on board with the framework opposition from two key senate moderates sen joe manchin d w va and sen kyrsten sinema d ariz forced leaders and the president to trim programs and lower expectations for those on the left house speaker nancy pelosi d calif abandoned a pledge to moderates that they would not vote on a bill unless they had full agreement with the senate instead pelosi decided to add items that her members viewed as top priorities even though it s unclear some of them will pass muster with senate rules limiting what can be included in a budget measure and which manchin has already said he opposes including paid leave here s a snapshot of biden s latest plan with more details on the fate of major policy proposals below here s what s currently in the plan education and child care universal pre k for all 3 and 4 year olds for six years child care support for about 20 million children for six years limits costs to no more than 7 of income for families earning up to 250 of state median income as long as parents are working seeking work in training or dealing with a serious health issue an extension of the child tax credit and earned income tax credit for one year four weeks of paid family leave many democrats wanted 12 weeks paid family leave but the policy was dropped from the president s framework because of manchin s opposition pelosi insisted it has full support and had it put back in climate 555 billion in spending on climate including clean energy tax credits for rooftop solar electric vehicles clean energy production a civilian climate corps program and investments in clean energy technology and manufacturing health care extending the expanded affordable care act premium tax credits through 2025 covering hearing costs through medicare for seniors 100 billion for reforms to reduce backlogs in the immigration asylum process prescription drugs allow medicare part b and part d programs to negotiate prices for specific medications directly with drug companies here s what s out free community college broad plan to have medicare negotiate directly with drug manufacturers on the prices for prescription drugs taxes that would help pay for the plan a 15 minimum tax for large corporations that report profits of more than 1 billion to shareholders a 1 tax on stock buybacks a 15 minimum tax on foreign profits of u s corporations a surtax on the top 02 wealthiest americans of 5 on income over 10 million and an additional 3 on income over 25 million a deeper look at key provisions child care gets squeezed the expanded child tax credit that was enacted as part of this spring s coronavirus relief package has been credited with dropping child poverty rates democrats view it as a key policy achievement biden had hoped to extend it for four more years the president s framework extends the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit for one year house speaker nancy pelosi told reporters earlier she preferred a permanent extension but said it is called the biden child tax credit so if it s acceptable to him in light of the bill it s acceptable to me many democrats believe the popularity of the policy and the immediate impact will make it tough for republicans to roll it back if they take control of one or more chambers in the 2022 midterm elections universal pre k programs are expected to remain in the proposal and pelosi linked them to the child care and family leave proposals as a comprehensive effort to support working parents and as critical human infrastructure paid family leave was dropped from the president s framework because of opposition from manchin but pelosi told reporters we can afford it it s universal it s a compromise from the original 12 weeks many democrats wanted other democrats acknowledged it would likely be stripped out in the senate but because the provision was popular many house democrats wanted the opportunity to vote for it climate change provisions are scaled back the president had touted the clean energy performance program cepp which provides incentives for utility companies to switch to greener technologies and fines those who don t as the centerpiece of his climate agenda he saw it as a tool that could achieve his goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50 by 2030 but the program has been dropped because manchin who represents a state heavily reliant on coal production doesn t support it house speaker nancy pelosi downplayed that concession and insisted there are other ways to get to that goal it isn t about a particular plan it s about reaching our goals and how we do it i feel very satisfied the path we re on to do that she said recently biden pelosi and other congressional democrats traveled to the cop26 climate change conference in scotland around the time the framework was unveiled so negotiators had to find various other proposals that manchin can back a mix of tax credits and other programs and that can show world leaders the u s is making good on its climate goals the white house is also discussing some administrative actions they can take that wouldn t require congressional approval some health care programs stay but not all there are three main health care programs that democrats say they intend to keep in a final deal the affordable care act medicare and medicaid but as the number for the overall for the package shrank the challenge became how to structure these plans pelosi who steered the affordable care act through the house and views it as a legacy issue for her has pushed to make subsidies for the program permanent but the scaled back plan included an extension of these tax credits only through 2025 budget committee chairman bernie sanders i vt proposed to expand medicare to cover vision hearing and dental procedures the costs for all three could prove too expensive in this smaller package biden said it would be a reach to get all three the president s framework includes coverage for hearing care but not for dental or vision something sanders said was still concerning to him the bill also expands medicaid coverage funds home care programs for those seniors who want to live independently a slimmed down prescription drug proposal the white house and democratic leaders announced a deal that will lower the cost of some prescription drugs for seniors the plan would allow medicare part b and part d programs to negotiate prices for specific medications directly with drug companies it would also cap the out of pocket costs for seniors to 2 000 per year significantly less than the current cap of 6 500 per year the proposal penalizes drug companies that increase their prices at rates higher than inflation this compromise was negotiated with a small group of democrats opposed to a broader plan for medicare to negotiate directly with drug manufacturers on the prices for prescription drugs immigration democrats initially planned to include a pathway to citizenship for 8 million immigrants in the reconciliation package but the senate parliamentarian who determines what policies are permitted under the rules for the budget process determined would not be allowed sen dick durbin d ill also tried to craft a plan to expand an existing registry for immigrants to allow them to reside in the u s but that plan was also ruled out of order by the parliamentarian house democrats added provisions to their bill that gives work permits for those undocumented workers who have been in the u s since 2011 their revised bill also includes making available work and family visas that have not been used yet it also has resources to reduce the immigration backlog but it is possible that these provisions will be stripped out in the senate brings back the state and local tax deduction the 2017 trump tax bill limited the deduction homeowners could deduct on their tax returns house democrats want to repeal the cap the new maximum deduction on the so called salt limit would be 80 000 a year through 2030 the cap would return to 10 000 in 2031 many progressives preferred this provision wasn t included and say it will end up helping the same wealthy americans they campaigned were already not paying their fair share in taxes but many house democrats from new york and new jersey which has high housing costs argued the elimination of the credit amounted to an unfair targeted tax that hit many families this change was designed to secure the votes from lawmakers from states affected by the elimination of the deduction but it is also likely to be changed in the senate where sen bernie sanders i vt wants to limit the deduction to those making below a certain income free community college gets cut the democrats original bill included a plan for two years of free community college but it is one item that both progressives and moderates said was not going to make it into a final deal the president noted to lawmakers that the proposal was a personal priority for the first lady who still teaches at a community college in northern virginia but the idea was not able to get broad support in his meetings democrats do plan to include some funding for pell grants and vocational programs in their reconciliation package corporate tax increases and tax on super rich offset costs democrats campaigned on rolling back the 2017 trump tax cuts on corporations and the wealthy and planned to use the significant revenue from those tax changes to pay for this package but sinema opposed changes to rates and instead negotiated some new tax provisions that would still target new taxes on some ultra rich americans and companies that have avoided paying large tax bills the revised bill includes a 15 corporate minimum tax a surtax on the ultra wealthy and changes to international tax provisions it also calls for stepped up efforts by the irs to go after non compliance b individuals and companies pelosi touted a report from the joint committee on taxation that shows that these tax increases raise almost 1 5 trillion over 10 years and argued that the prescription drug plan and plans to toughen irs enforcement will cover the remaining cost of the bill leaders do not expect a final cost analysis from the non partisan congressional budget office until later this month final deal could take weeks months pelosi has little room to maneuver in the house with only a three seat vote margin after months of saying she wanted a deal with the white house and senate democrats she reversed course and agreed to include some provisions that already are opposed by manchin and potentially others this means that even if the house reconciliation package is approved it is all but certain to change in the senate and the house will have to vote on another version later this fall president biden urged congress to move quickly to approve his agenda and the window for passing major legislation is traditionally the end of the year once 2022 begins and the focus intensifies on the midterm elections it is tougher to pass any significant bills and this proposal would be the largest domestic spending bill congress has passed in decades sen sherrod brown d ohio who chairs the senate banking committee told reporters recently about the challenge in an evenly divided senate it s hard to keep 50 people together with different constituencies right now brown is focused on another issue for the package investments in public housing and help for first time home buyers it will greater supply of housing and more affordable housing he said the package will be the biggest investment n housing that will span urban suburban and rural areas still it s an example of why getting to an agreement on a final framework may be difficult there are many issues democrats want to see in this bill while staying under 2 trillion copyright 2024 npr to see more visit missing some content care to comment check the source npr

government believes resistance to corporate banking complex a form of terrorism by keith johnson newly released federal bureau of investigation fbi files prove that federal agencies within the united states government colluded with the private sector to spy on the occupy wall street ows movement even before the first demonstration was held in new york city s zuccotti park these documents show that the fbi and the department of homeland security are treating protests against the corporate and banking structure of america as potential criminal and terrorist activity stated mara verheyden hilliard executive director of the partnership for civil justice fund pcjf these documents also show these federal agencies functioning as a de facto intelligence arm of wall street and corporate america in the fall of 2011 pcjf filed freedom of information act demands with various federal and local law enforcement agencies to determine if there was a concerted effort to crackdown on the ows movement after stonewalling for more than a year the fbi finally surrendered a public version of their internal communications on the weekend before christmas 2012 the documents are heavily redacted and it is clear from the production that the fbi is withholding far more material says pcjf staff attorney heather benno we are filing an appeal challenging this response and demanding full disclosure to the public of the records of this operation the documents identify a department within the fbi known as the domestic security alliance council dsac as being directly involved in coordinating the intelligence gathering activities against the ows movement on their website dsac describes itself as a strategic partnership between the fbi the department of homeland security and the private sector it s leadership board boasts nearly 30 representatives from various corporations and is chaired by grant ashley vice president of pharmaceutical giant merck and company other participants include walmart bank of america coca cola time warner general electric fed ex citigroup and dozens more according to their 2005 mission statement dsac advances elements of the fbi and dhs missions in preventing deterring and investigating criminal and terrorism acts particularly those effecting interstate commerce while advancing the ability of the u s private sector to protect its employees assets and proprietary information files show that dsac circulated a memo on december 9 2011 to warn its corporate clients that ows protestors planned to shut down shipping ports in eight west coast cities although the report acknowledges that similar demonstrations held in the past were relatively peaceful it goes on to surmise that future protests could turn ugly civil unrest can range from small organized rallies to large scale demonstrations and rioting the report says even seemingly peaceful rallies can spur violent activity or be met with resistance by security forces bystanders may be arrested or harmed by security forces using water cannons tear gas or other measures to control crowds other documents reveal how federal agencies hyped the threat posed by the ows movement in the weeks leading up to the first demonstration in new york city for instance on august 19 2011 fbi agents met with members of the new york stock exchange to share information about the planned protests then in the days that followed the fbi canvassed several businesses warning them that they may be targets of ows protests documents also show that once the protests spread to other u s cities the fbi and dhs shared intelligence information on ows with campus police fusion centers and other local law enforcement agencies throughout the nation banking institutions were also heavily involved in the intelligence gathering activities according to pcjf the federal reserve in richmond appears to have had personnel surveilling ows planning they were in contact with the fbi in richmond to pass on information regarding the movement known as occupy wall street there were repeated communications to pass on updates of the events and decisions made during the small rallies and the following information received from the capital police intelligence unit through jttf joint terrorism task force similarly the fbi s branch office in denver colorado met with members of its bank fraud working group a coalition of private financial institutions and local law enforcement to brief them on ows activities in november 2011 although there is plenty of fear mongering focused on the ows movement the only real tangible threat of violence contained in the fbi documents are against the protestors themselves one particular fbi document claims that an identified individual planned to gather intelligence against the leaders of the protest groups and obtain photographs then formulate a plan to kill the leadership via suppressed sniper rifles it is unclear if the fbi followed up on this potential act of violence or if they even bothered to alert ows participants of the threat what is clear is that federal agencies are far more concerned with protecting the criminality of the nation s corporate elite than they are an american s constitutional right to speak out against it keith johnson in an investigative journalist and host of the revolt of the plebs radio program

a spike in demand for private jet travel has created a shortage of planes xo is operating shared chartered flights as a solution to supply chain troubles across the industry advertisement the growing demand for private air travel is outstripping the supply of private jets according to xo one of the largest private aviation firms in the us the company launched in 2006 and is based in fort lauderdale florida its services allow flyers to share chartered services they also have the option to create new flights and make unused seats available to purchase to fellow flyers this can all be done through an app which is available to members travelers also have to option to charter a full aircraft if clients are flying with family colleagues or even on their own the spike in private jet fliers comes amid health concerns related to flying commercially during the pandemic but as many lean towards high end travel there are not enough private jets to accommodate them advertisement vinay roy xo s senior vice president and head of product told insider those who wanted to fly continued to do so either because they wanted to maintain social distancing at the airport or because commercial airlines were canceling flights to less popular destinations thomas flohr the founder and chairman of xo s parent company vista global previously told insider s thomas pallini it had added 15 light jet aircraft to its dedicated fleet of charter planes due to explosive membership growth since april 2020 the private aviation industry is not alone in its struggle as businesses in all corners of the economy have been hit hard by supply chain problems consumer products including electronics and cars are low in stock and prices are spiking as a result a ubs note estimated that in april used cars saw their largest monthly price increase in 68 years of tracking with prices rising between 8 2 and 9 3 according to the company xo s services are tackling the problem head on some other operators in the private aviation industry struggling to do the same however cnbc reported that private aviation firm netjets halted sales of jet cards and leases for light aircraft xo s shared flight option has particularly grabbed the attention of consumers this year one million search queries were conducted on xo s mobile and web applications roy said advertisement the idea is based on the fact that on average there are fewer than three passengers on a private aircraft at any given time xo s shared flight program allows 10 or more travelers to join an already booked flight this can increase the efficiency of seating capacity by 230 the option increases the existing supply base of private jets to be used much more efficiently and it reduces the cost for flyers on average if you book a private charter by seat you are paying 90 less than if you had booked the entire charter making private flying more accessible as a result roy said while most of xo s clients have experienced flying privately before many have not according to roy in june 2021 we saw a 56 increase in first time chartered clients compared to the same period last year he said once xo members have booked their seats through the app roy said the company curates a seating plan for families or friends who wish to sit together advertisement and of course with private flying comes premium perks these include being greeted at the private jet terminal to complimentary in flight wi fi on xo s sleek jets xo facilitates international flights but according to lynn fischer the company s chief marketing officer domestic chartered services are the most active we hope to see more international flights now that the restrictions are lifted in the us fischer told insider those who previously flew commercial have enjoyed traveling in a different way and plan to stick with it roy said during the next five years we expect private aviation to become a much more common mode of travel especially after the pandemic he added

america s great depression began with the dramatic crash of the stock market on black thursday october 24 1929 the depression had devastating effects on the country the stock market was in shambles many banks couldn t continue to operate and farmers fell into bankruptcy a quarter of the working force or 13 million people were unemployed in 1932 the great depression lasted over a decade with hundreds of thousands of americans losing their jobs businesses failing and financial institutions collapsing speculation in the 1920s caused many people to buy stocks with loaned money and they used these stocks as collateral for buying more stocks broker s loans went from under 5 million in mid 1928 to 850 million in september of 1929 the stock market boom was very unsteady because it was based on borrowed money and false optimism when investors lost confidence the stock market collapsed taking them along with it short sighted government economic policies were one of the factors that led to the great depression politicians believed that business was the key industry of america as a result the government took no action against reckless investing congress passed high tariffs that protected american industries but hurt farmers and international trade the economy became unstable because the national wealth was not spread evenly instead most money was in the hands of a few families who saved or invested rather than spend their money on american goods as a consequence supply was greater than demand some people profited but others did not prices went up and americans could not afford anything farmers and workers couldn t profit and the disproportion of prosperity made recovery difficult the u s stock market boomed in the 1920s prices reached levels measured as a multiple of corporate dividends or corporate earnings that didn t make sense in terms of established patterns and rules of thumb for assessments an array of indicators suggests that at the market peak in september 1929 something like forty percent of stock market values were pure air prices above fundamental values for no reason other than that a large cross section of investors had the notion that the stock market would go up simply because it had gone up the u s financial system was already past the peak of the business cycle when the stock market crashed in october of 1929 as a result of the federal reserve raising interest rates too such a high level it brought on the recession that they had hoped to steer clear of when the stock market crashed in 1929 there was an over production of goods at the same time as well as a surplus of banks and flooding the economy with a surplus of loans added to the mid was a tariff and war debt policy that curtailed foreign markets for american goods finally coverage of factors affecting the economy then was not as detailed as it is today the great depression severely hurt the economy people who had money in the banks lost every penny and

as ambiguous as she is hideous baba yaga is an anomaly in slavic folklore baba yaga is both a maternal mother nature figure and an evil villain who kidnaps and eats children numerous renditions of her tale portray her as a harbinger of transformation possessing the power to either assist or obstruct those who she chances upon and eating those who fail to satisfy her demands an alternative wicked witch from russian and slavic legends baba yaga is depicted as flying through the forest within a giant mortar and pestle though the origins of her name are as unclear as her purpose tends to be it is believed that baba means something akin to old woman or grandmother while the meaning yaga is said to mean anything from snake to wicked regardless even baba yaga s name emphasizes the strangeness of her person making her an interesting character to decipher the story of baba yaga was first recorded in writing in 1755 though legends about her appeared far earlier and can be evidenced in artworks from at least the 17th century modern day interpretations such as into the forest tales of the baba yaga have emphasized her role as a possible proto feminist icon the essence of baba yaga exists in many cultures and many stories and symbolizes the unpredictable and untamable nature of the female spirit of mother earth and the relationship of women to the wild explained ryan the editor of the collection in an interview with the bbc she s a shamanic trickster a category and boundary crosser a that freedom lies a little beyond the border of social norms and that we can learn as much from the dark as the light baba yaga in her mortar by ivan bilibin public domain depictions of the mythical baba yaga the most common portrayal of baba yaga is as either one old woman or a trio of old sisters all of whom are depicted as skinny with iron teeth and noses so long that they touch the ceiling when they sleep baba yaga is commonly illustrated as riding around on a mortar rather than a broom wielding a pestle as both a flying aid and a wand stories about the baba yaga abound with most of them taking place within her hut located deep in the woods to make the story even more eerie legend has it that her hut was surrounded by a fence made of human bones and stood on magical chicken legs with a rooster s head on top tales about baba yaga usually recount that heroes daring to enter her humble abode would find her draped across her cooking stove the enormous stove is described as reaching from one side of the hut to the other subtly emphasizing her size and magical powers the stove is another common detail included in tales of the baba yaga as the location where her victims are cooked and eaten despite an ambitious appetite however baba yaga is always portrayed as skinny and bony with her own epithet of the bony one benefactor or villain the ambiguous character of baba yaga the majority of well known narratives featuring baba yaga revolve around the heroes who cross her path rather than her own personal exploits it is the characterization of baba yaga that contributes to much of the ambiguity surrounding her as she oscillates between assuming the role of a benefactor and a villain either aiding or obstructing the heroes of slavic folklore while it seems that baba yaga never initiates any confrontations as she only reacts when someone ventures to her hut her moral compass appears to be all but absent yet regardless of her questionable ethics she remains true to her word and keeps whatever promise she makes to the hero who triumphantly completes her assigned tasks the eerie and unpredictable nature of baba yaga only adds to the gripping mystery of her character making her encounters with slavic heroes all the more thrilling and unpredictable illustration of baba yaga from 1925 by ivan malyutin public domain baba yaga in the tale of vasilisa the beautiful in one story known as vasilisa the beautiful vasilisa is a cinderella type character with a magical doll whose mother died and father remarried a horrible woman with equally unkind daughters when vasilisa s father goes away for a trip the new stepmother sells their house and moves her and the three girls to a cottage in the woods giving the daughters impossible tasks to complete by candlelight when vasilisa heeds her stepsisters demand to find fire for their home she unwittingly stumbles upon baba yaga who assigns her a series of arduous tasks in exchange for a flame to bring back to her family with the aid of the magical doll vasilisa triumphantly completes all the challenges and is rewarded with a fire ensconced in a skull lantern which promptly incinerates her vile stepsisters upon her return home vasilisa s story ultimately concludes when the tsar of russia or the king depending on which version of the story is told falls deeply in love with her providing a classic happily ever after ending it is however the enigmatic role of baba yaga in the tale that truly captivates the imagination within vasilisa the beautiful baba yaga embodies both an obstacle and a savior for vasilisa without the lantern she would have remained trapped in the clutches of her malevolent stepfamily however baba yaga s gruesome methods of liberating vasilisa underscore her amorality and hazardous nature unlike the benevolent fairy godmother from the original cinderella story baba yaga evokes the wicked stepmother who allows her daughter to mutilate her own foot to fit the glass slipper baba yaga goes to extraordinary lengths to free vasilisa exacting three agonizing deaths and causing her much distress before finally permitting her to leave the hut her actions surpass the mere task of helping vasilisa escape her oppressive family leaving a chilling impression of baba yaga s true motives and character the heroine vasilisa outside of the hut of baba yaga as depicted by ivan bilibin 1902 public domain baba yaga as mother earth baba yaga is also cast as a mother earth figure having an influence on the natural world through three of her servants as witnessed by vasilisa twice vasilisa sees three riders the first white the second red and the third black upon asking who they were baba yaga replies that they are day the sun and night respectively each controlled by her this particular episode of the story showcases the vast extent of baba yaga s power hinting that she possessed the ability to liberate vasilisa from her family s grasp with less extreme measures however her decision to employ such gruesome tactics emphasizes her malevolent nature and a propensity for ruthless behavior baba yaga and the peasant children another fable featuring baba yaga involves two hapless peasant children who are victimized by a tyrannical stepmother in this narrative the wicked stepmother sends the children to baba yaga s abode hoping to be rid of them for good the resourceful youngsters are aided in their escape by the animals plants and objects baba yaga has neglected a black cat helps them plan their escape as they had been feeding him while baba yaga had not a gate shuts baba yaga out because she had neglected it even the forest trees obstruct her path because of her similar mistreatment the children successfully return home unscathed and baba yaga abandons her pursuit when it becomes too difficult again this tale ends happily with the father banishing the cruel stepmother and protecting his children once more baba yaga s role is that of an obstacle only bothering the children because they first trespassed into her domain this illustrates a paradoxical aspect of baba yaga s character as she is often regarded as a deity who embodies the power and unpredictability of mother nature despite being considered a deity akin to mother nature the natural world still turns against her due to the pain she has inflicted upon it this is one of the reasons why scholars find it challenging to categorize her as she falls into many different roles and demonstrates contradictory traits baba yaga s enigmatic character is what makes her such a captivating figure in mythology and the subject of ongoing scholarly research her ambiguous nature leaves readers wondering whether she will act as a malevolent force or a benevolent savior in the various tales in which she appears top image sculpture depicting the gnarly faced

michel martin host facebook s role in amplifying falsehoods and hate speech has been a central concern in recent weeks after whistleblowers went public with internal documents and critics noted the role of such content in promoting violence in places around the world and i ll mention here that facebook s parent company meta pays npr to license npr content but a new project from the university of maryland s journalism school shows that while the reach and speed of social media might be new the role of the media in spreading hate is not the project is called printing hate and it s an online reporting project that documents the role newspapers played in promoting lynchings throughout the united states from the post civil war period onward deneen brown is a washington post reporter and journalism professor who conceived the project and is the lead editor on the series brown says lynchings were so common they were routinely featured in newspapers often reported next to graduation announcements and stock prices when we spoke she says newspapers promoted lynchings both by demeaning black people and advertising when lynchings would take place deneen brown they portrayed black people in the most heinous ways they called them brutes and fiends sometimes they would print the time date and location of a massacre it was almost like they were glorifying the lynching so for example there s a headline that says negro fiend meets his fate and here s another one lynching caused by brutal murder any person who s studied journalism 101 knows that you have to be careful about that word caused another one said negro under sentence to hang at tallahassee so that s announcing a lynching that took place in 1909 and then another one that i did a lot of reporting on it s about the elaine massacre of 1919 there was a headline that ran in the arkansas democrat that said governor brough fired upon by negroes at elaine negroes had plot to rise against whites are charged that was outrageous headline that was completely false it was no negro uprising and no black people fired on the governor who actually may have been the first governor in history to actually hunt black americans so yeah these headlines and these stories will amaze you martin i was going to ask you about that because part of this project involved students traveling throughout a number of states digging into the archives of these newspapers and i was just wondering could you just say a bit more about what struck the students brown yeah so some of the students traveled to different places in the south and actually reported these stories there were students in elaine there were students who traveled to virginia to florida and they did amazing reporting some of the students said that this work was profound it changed their lives it changed the way they looked at history it changed the way they looked at racism and oppression one student whose family is from mississippi told me that when she was explaining to her parents what she was finding in her research they pushed back you know was is it really true and she s trying to explain to them yeah this is what i m finding in my research this happened yes black people were lynched yes black people were lynched because of newspaper headlines i m finding this so it was a tremendous experience for these students for the professors for the faculty and staff and the visiting editors it was life changing martin as we said at the outset of this conversation the focus at the moment has been on facebook in particular but social media in general in amplifying hate speech around the world around the world and we ve seen this before i just wondered if this work that you ve undertaken with digging into newspapers of the post civil war period does this amplify the current conversation in some way is there something about looking at the past that teaches us about the present that you think you would want to point up brown yeah i see a direct correlation between the history that we ve uncovered in this project and modern day coverage of black people according to the research the media continues to dehumanize black people well not all media but some media in general so for example michael brown who was killed in 2014 in ferguson was portrayed as quote unquote no angel you know eric garner who was killed in new york was there was a lot of coverage on you know focus on you know quote unquote mr garner was illegally selling cigarettes and therefore brought on his demise in the coverage of george floyd there were a lot of stories that talked about how he died because of his underlying conditions despite the fact that we watched him die on camera so again i think there s a direct correlation between how black americans were characterized by these newspapers historically that advocated for lynchings and massacres and modern day characterizations of black people who have been killed recently martin this project takes place against the backdrop of legislators and some sort of parent activists in parts of the country trying to literally erase or remove certain works from their libraries or from being taught sometimes this is a focus on fiction sometimes this is a focus on nonfiction just i m curious you know it s interesting that your work to recover this information arrives at the same time that some people are trying to erase this information from our sort of discussions at least at the school level and i was just wondering if you have thoughts about that brown you know what i said earlier in the conversation i really believe that journalists great journalists are in pursuit of the truth and the truth is this history the history that we re uncovering is the truth of what happened in america and i do know you know from my research that organizations you know after the end of the civil war set out to change how history was written so i just feel that this project and my work is trying to correct that trajectory and at a time when people are as you said are trying to cover up these ugly chapters in history but they happened it s true that you know black people endured enslavement and horrible jim crow movement and that s a truth that happened in history it s just my hope that you know people will continue to pursue the truth of history and that students will learn about it because if you don t know you know there s that old adage if you don t know your history you re damned to repeat it and it s so important to know that this history happened because it provides context for what s happening today martin deneen brown is a washington post reporter and an associate professor of journalism at the university of maryland this work printing hate is available online now professor brown thank you so much for talking with us brown thank you so much michel it was great to be here transcript provided by npr copyright npr
the origin of jewish new year celebrations has long been shrouded in mystery families around the world celebrate it during autumn with sweet delicacies joyous prayers and the blasting of the shofar ram s horn called rosh hashanah head of the year it is also yom hazikaron day of remembrance however what exactly is being remembered the bible offers no clue it is a day of ancient riddles and questions and simply no one knows its raison d être searching for the origins of the jewish new year scholars agree to its great antiquity going back to the time of moses we first read of the holiday in leviticus 23 24 where it is called zikhron teru ah a memorial of shouting a holy convocation to be held on the first day of the seventh month meanwhile numbers 29 1 calls it yom teru ah or day of shouting the day s three special prayers are for the kingship of god remembering and for blowing the shofar blowing the shofar at jerusalem s western wall during the eve of rosh hashanah government press office israel cc by sa 3 0 something of great importance must have been memorialized during this celebration now lost to antiquity we know it required both shouting and the blasting of the shofar horns which marked the coronation of monarchs in israel at least a dozen ideas have been put forward as to the reason behind the celebration including remembering the binding of isaac by abraham commemorating the future arrival of the messiah and god s final judgement during the times of the talmud 3 6 th centuries bc rosh hashanah was associated with the coronation of god say before me on rosh hashanah the sovereignty service so that you can make me king over you rosh hashanah 16a this stems from the very ancient song of the sea in exodus 15 18 which states yahweh will reign forever and ever it also evokes the coronation psalms which describe god as king such as psalms 45 47 93 95 and 97 in psalms 98 6 we read with trumpets and the blast of the ram s horn shout for joy before the lord the king i wonder however why it isn t mentioned in the torah if this really was the reason if moses meant to celebrate the crowning of god why didn t he explicitly say so i still sense a secret what are jewish families celebrating each year during rosh hashanah what secret event are they so joyously commemorating i have a radical proposal they are remembering the coronation of akhenaten the monotheistic sun king of the amarna age and i believe the secret king moses at the heart of judaism i believe we can make the most sense of this puzzle if we connect the pharaoh akhenaten to the hebrew prophet moses the most well known tradition of rosh hashanah is the blowing of the shofar rudall30 adobe stock coronation of the sun king linking akhenaten to the jewish new year the coronation of akhenaten then called amenhotep iv has been extensively studied and debated by scholars this is because no explicit text describing the event exists we know he succeeded his wealthy father amenhotep iii sometime in 1354 bc we also know the priest manetho who lived during the 3 rd century bce recorded that amenhotep iii spent seven months of his final year on the throne and thus his son came to power after seven months of his father s yearly rule this took me by surprise because the same relationship exists between the start of the religious year rosh hashanah which falls seven months after the first of the jewish civic year in spring could rosh hashanah have been set for the first of the seventh month because that is when akhenaten came to the throne exactly seven months after the beginning of his father s rule several scholars have indirectly researched the accession date of akhenaten by calculating that of his father for example charles cornell van siclen iii carefully analyzed all inscriptions associated with amenhotep iii s accession and deduced that it most likely occurred on the first day of the second month of the shemu or season of harvest the tenth egyptian month could it be that rosh hashanah originated as a celebration of the coronation of akhenaten horemweb cc by sa 4 0 if his son took the throne seven months after his father s year began he would have ascended during the first day of the first month of the season of growth peret or the fifth egyptian month in other words his accession day was very likely the first day of the seventh month after the year began i e his father took the throne or exactly when rosh hashanah takes place remarkably this is independently confirmed by amarna expert william j murnane who has argued separately that akhenaten very likely came to the throne some time during the first eight days of the first month of peret during this time 1354 bc this specific date would have fallen sometime in early november with his father assuming the throne during april on a lintel from the tomb of the royal steward kheruef tt192 we see what may be a coronation scene of the young amenhotep iv before he changed his name to akhenaten the young monarch depicted in traditional egyptian proportions and poses offers wine and incense to the traditional male and female deities atum hathor ra horakhty and ma at in the center over his new royal name we see the ram horns that will later come to typify jewish shofar horns a shofar ritual ram s horn zachi evenor cc by 3 0 shofars sheep and shouting following the archaeological evidence the most well known tradition of rosh hashanah is the blowing of the shofar during this holy day the ancient ram s horn is blown one hundred times to celebrate god and commemorate the beginning of the new year however no reason is given in the torah we know in other situations the blasting of the shofar horns marked the coronation of monarchs in israel shofars can be made from the horns of many species of bovid including cattle sheep ibex pronghorn and even the majestic kudu antelope amazingly excavators working at akhenaten s city of amarna during the 1920s discovered two antelope horns so similar to modern day shofar horns that they could possibly be history s first examples we also see a large tomb scene at amarna depicting a nubian contingent offering tribute to akhenaten gold ivory cheetahs and most relevant to our study antelope with long horns music was an integral part of life at amarna under akhenaten and these antelope horns would have certainly contributed to the musical milieu as lyn green comments in fact music in some form or other seems to have surrounded akhenaten and his family at almost all times when they were in public it should be seen as the essential element of the cultural revolution that has mystified and intrigued us for well over a century we also know from the amarna letters correspondence between akhenaten and other regional kings that the king of mitanni tushratta sent many horns to egypt for the king i set their ram horn strung on a wire of gold ea 25 william l moran the amarna letters 1992 there were two main types of sheep in ancient egypt during the old kingdom the main species was the ovis longipes palaeoagytiaca they had long straight wavy horns and were dominant in art for many centuries for example the ancient ram headed god khnum sported these original wavy horns this species however became extinct and another species of sheep the ovis aries platyra aegyptiaca became popular past 2000 bc in egypt they were characterized by a curved horn and were most commonly associated with amun god of thebes image of akhenaten and nefertiti making an offering to the aten taken from the tomb of panehsy in amarna akhenaten and nefertiti both wear elaborate new plumed crowns featuring sun disks protective cobras and ram horns these hemhem crowns or crowns of shouting were associated with the joyous rising sun and rebirth and their ram s horns are reminiscent of modern jewish shofar horns lepsius public domain we know from inscriptions that akhenaten favored the older long wavy horn of the ovis longipes palaeoagytiaca species associated since the old kingdom with the pharaoh the gods creation and most importantly the sun the horns were associated with the atef crown first worn by the old kingdom sun pharaohs sahure and nyuserre during their sed festivals coronation esque ceremonies of the king s renewal and rebirth as a solar divinity these powerful pharaohs inspired the young king who re imagined their ancient headpiece as a new crown the triple atef or hemhem the new hemhem crown incorporated ostrich feathers sun disks cobras and twisted ram horns and it memorialized the rising sun and rebirth both common new year s themes its name even translates to shouting out nearly identical to the biblical name of rosh hashanah yom teru ah or day of shouting why shout on rosh hashanah well mighty shouts of joy always accompanied a king s coronation in ancient egypt and israel for example they blew the shofar and shouted jehu is king 2 kings 9 13 also we read from the coronation inscription of pharaoh horemheb translated by sir alan gardiner that the entire people were in joy and they cried aloud to heaven great and small seized upon gladness the whole earth rejoiced keep in mind that horemheb helped restore egyptian religion after the amarna regime may your name be written the importance of a name during the coronation the new names of pharaoh were written on the leaves of the tree of life in heliopolis they were also inscribed in the book of life a scroll known as the book of the dead that was written to magically help the monarch achieve eternal life i shall not die but live psalms 118 17 names in ancient egypt were of utmost magical importance and as matthew militza notes the knowledge of the name of a god or of a man gave the magician complete power over him from an amarna tomb scene we see akhenaten and nefertiti offering the royal name of the aten in cartouches to the eponymous sun disk emphasizing the importance of the royal name of god now thousands of years later these themes of kingship and name power still resound during the new year for example the famous rosh hashanah prayer avinu malkeinu calls god our father our king also the most important greeting during rosh hashanah is l shana tova tikateyvu or may your name be written for a good year where is your name written both in god s book of life sefer hachaim and on his tree of life etz chaim this is immortalized in psalms 72 17 may the king s name endure forever may it continue as long as the sun shines the name of the new pharaoh is written on the leaves of the sacred ished tree of heliopolis by the gods seshat and thoth during the coronation from the ramasseum mortuary temple of ramses ii public domain a person s name is very important during the holiday with the hope that through confession and repentance of sins their name can be salvaged and restored by being written both in the book of life and on the tree of life this is an echo of the sacred ished tree of life in heliopolis on which pharaoh s names were symbolically written during his coronation heliopolis was the ancient city of the sun revered by akhenaten and even appears in the torah as the adopted home of joseph who married the daughter of a high priest of ra a mystery celebration three millennia later the conflation of two icons stephen d ricks and john j sroka describe twenty seven elements of ancient coronation rituals in ancient egypt remarkably most of them correspond toh the celebrations of rosh hashanah first ceremonial washings were believed to avert evil give life and symbolize rebirth of the king we see this ritual in many temple scenes which depict the pharaoh being covered by the gods in the waters of life we know similar washing rituals were very common at amarna remains of lime plastered washing basins have been excavated and tomb inscriptions depict ritual washing pools with twin sets of stairs these are strikingly similar to both ancient and modern jewish mikva ot stepped ritual baths which often have different entry exit routes so as not to mix washed from unwashed people washing in the mikveh meanwhile remains an important custom just before rosh hashanah the gods thoth and horus pour life giving waters over the head of pharaoh ptolemy vi to purify him before he takes the throne of egypt in a scene from the kom ombo temple southern egypt this is similar to the purifying ablutions that jews perform before rosh hashanah cc by sa 3 0 another element discussed by ricks and sroka is that the king is symbolically reborn during his coronation while rosh hashanah celebrates the rebirth of nature the year and our souls other connections include feasts secrecy pure white garments and the placing of the crown which is today called the keter torah and is placed onto the head of the torah scroll itself ricks and sroka finally draw attention to larger themes that underlie coronation rituals and which also connect to modern judaism they were generally connected to the priesthood they took place in a sacred space such as a temple and the monarch was generally a priest as well or endowed with priestly power these all echo modern themes of rosh hashanah where the services occur in the synagogue the holiest place of jewish prayer and the successor institution of the jewish temple where the priests administered the sacrifices and other rites according to the torah of moses a silver torah scroll crown or keter i believe the focus on the crown of the torah and the crown of god during rosh hashanah hint at a secret ancient coronation that occurred during this day that of akhenaten metropolitan museum of art cc0 during the old kingdom regnal years of egyptian kings were determined by the founding of temples and also country wide censuses i e the year of the nth counting while during the middle kingdom they were subsumed into the civic calendar by the new kingdom however the regnal years of kings were reckoned from their accession days in other words each new year began on the anniversary of their accession without regard to the beginning of the civil calendar this eventually became an established part of the later israelite monarchy and is still i believe preserved in rosh hashanah or the new year that began on the anniversary of the accession of akhenaten since there is no logical reason why the first of the seventh month should be regarded as a holy new year i submit it is because it recalls the accession of akhenaten on the first of the seventh month of his father s reign marking the beginning of a new reign and a new year could jews still be secretly celebrating the coronation of moses the secret king at the heart of their religion an ancient passage from the torah may hold a clue called the blessing of moses it concerns the eponymous leader blessing each israelite tribe in turn however one verse stands out he moses was king over jeshurun when the leaders of the people assembled along with the tribes of israel deuteronomy 33 5 if moses was once long ago conceived of as a king then it makes all the more sense that rosh hashanah is secretly celebrating his coronation every fall during the new year s celebration the shofar is sounded to remind jews to remember a forgotten event and to commemorate it with shouting and joy if this momentous yet thoroughly mysterious celebration really hides the seeds of a pharaonic coronation somehow lost over the course of three thousand years then it would strongly suggest that akhenaten did indeed live on to become moses thereby preserving his revolutionary monotheism for untold countless future generations top image could the origins of jewish new year really lie in the coronation of akhenaten source on the

iran contra scandal diary entry january 17 1986 ronald reagan was inaugurated into the most powerful office in the world january 20 1981 what he accomplished during his eight year tenure will be remembered for a very long time through the good the bad and the ugly reagan weathered all the storms perhaps the greatest tempest of the reagan years was iran contra yet reagan managed to emerge without a scratch in his teflon image untarnished to this day some would argue should the president of the united states be allowed to lie about the war on drugs the war on terrorism ignore his country s foreign policy and moral and social values without suffering the consequences since the cold war started after world war ii iran had been a fairly stable state thanks to the united states government which installed shah mohammed reza pahlavi in 1953 as leader of the country the government of iran was therefore closely tied to america and it took little trouble to disturb the us jimmy carter was once quoted as saying that the shah and iran was an island of stability in one of the most troubled areas of the world at the time of his statement this was true to an extent but as always in the middle east this stability did not last in february of 1979 while carter was still president a group of fundamentalist militants drove the shah s government out this group was lead by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the ousting of the stable shah did not sit well with the united states but to make matters worse the fundamentalists seized the us embassy in teheran and took 66 hostages carter quickly placed a general embargo on iran which included all forms of weapons ronald reagan was lucky his first day in office at the same time he was giving his inauguration speech the 66 hostages taken at the us embassy were released after 444 days of captivity this did not exactly make carter look good but reagan of course reaped the benefits right from the start reagan took an anti terrorist stance claiming that the us gives terrorists no rewards no guarantees we make no concessions we make no deals little did the public know that this was in fact almost a complete lie things started taking a turn for the worse late in 1983 on october 23 the largest non nuclear bomb ever recorded was driven into the us marine barracks in beirut lebanon and detonated killing 241 marines the bomb was connected to an iranian terrorist group this event caused america to reevaluate current embargoes on iran unfortunately the us was not the only country to provide weapons to iran worried that iran would win the war against iraq and threaten the supply of oil from the persian gulf and still upset over the bombing of the marine barracks the us worked to halt all weapon imports into iran in december of 1983 ronald reagan initiated operation staunch which urged all 41 nations involved in supplying iran with weapons to the international community the us referred to being themselves despite these efforts the war between iraq and iran continued and so did the terrorism in march of 1984 william buckley a cia station chief and a few others were captured by iranian terrorists buckley was eventually killed a year later in june of 1985 twa flight 847 was hijacked and 29 americans were held hostage by terrorists again connected with iran in some way the terrorist community seemed to be mocking reagan s promises to stop them a failed rescue mission in which two us helicopters collided after refueling in the desert only served to make matters worse the image of helicopter wreckage strewn across the desert had a lasting effect on the american people something had to be done and ronald reagan had to do it but he did not have many options by 1984 operation staunch and us embargoes had made iran desperate for arms operatives throughout the middle east started receiving offers from iranians to buy or trade american weapons according to john m poindexter the first person to ever suggest an arms deal with iran was an israeli official but robert mcfarlane national security advisor to the president and william casey cia director both pushed reagan to reopen diplomatic relations with iran casey longed for the old iran before khomeini and also wished to recover buckley who was taken in 1984 mcfarlane had been suggesting opening channels to iran as early as 1981 john poindexter when asked about the topic stated that finally in 1985 reagan bought the idea and expressed approval of arms shipments to iran as a measure to acquire some leverage and influence with the moderate groups in iran this was in fact a straight arms for hostages deal on august 2 ronald reagan approved an initial shipment of 100 us tow missiles to iran these weapons were shipped from israel and the isrealis were promised that their stock would be replenished a month later 408 us tow missiles were again shipped from israel to iran the next day an american hostage was released by terrorists in lebanon this early success helped fuel the initiative into the next year at the same time as the terrorist situations in the middle east a problem was brewing in central america the communist government in nicaragua caused some fear in the administration reagan was a die hard anti communist and the nicaraguan sandinista communist government bothered him greatly this was also true for william casey head of the cia reagan had casey organize a guerrilla movement that could fight against the sandinistas and their unhumanitarian treatment of the nicaraguan people the cia became highly involved with the guerrillas freedom fighters as reagan liked to call them in a short period of time training manuals for sabotage and assassination were provided by the cia arms and money were provided as well at the same time ronald reagan was declaring a war on drugs he approved the use of manuel noriega as a conduit for money to the freedom fighters the same noriega that was connected with the medellin drug cartel reagan overlooked noriega s drug involvement for the time being since he was aiding the us noriega was simply in it for personal gain and he reaped the benefits of handling large amounts of us money to the freedom fighters the cia even went so far as to mine nicaraguan harbors an event that eventually made it into the american press this did not please congress and they placed a 24 million spending cap on funding to the guerrillas eventually the boland act was passed by congress making it illegal for intelligence agencies to support the guerrillas reagan called congress a meddlesome committee of 535 and told his staff to work around the law at this time the national security council of which mcfarlane was director decided to consider themselves a non intelligence based agency and continued support for the guerrillas as reagan wanted the passage of the boland ii act that clearly ends us support for the war in nicaragua did not seem to phase reagan or the nsc staff either enter oliver north a marine lieutenant colonel who was assigned to the nsc staff north was put in charge of keeping the freedom fighters referred to as contras by some together through a system suggested by mcfarlane of private and foreign contributions north raised money to support the contras foreign countries providing aid were repaid in disguise as other projects north borrowed another idea from the department of defense the pentagon had a basement project known as the special operations department this group was comprised of highly trained marines the best equipment and could be deployed at a moment s notice north took this idea and combined it with his money effort to the contras to form the enterprise before long the enterprise which consisted of arms merchants former cia and pentagon operatives and former armed forces personnel had built up a large base with their own funding swiss bank accounts navy air force and private companies the enterprise became a private organization that did not have to abide by us laws but which was available to the president as a military or financial source they carried out their missions through a network of shadowy figures who operated in the netherworld of third world intrigues and revolutionary movements skirting or actually dealing with terrorists hostage takers and drug dealers richard secord a former air force general headed the enterprise and persuaded the saudi government to donate moneys that the enterprise used to buy and distribute weapons to the contras the saudi s were given a swiss bank account number in which they could place a monthly million dollar gift to the contras without detection by anyone invariably money brought the iran initiative and the plight of the contras together north came up with the neat idea to divert money earned from the iran arms sales to the nicaraguan guerrillas when the first sale produced a few hundred thousand dollars of profit this idea was welcomed by both poindexter who had become national security advisor after mcfarlane had resigned and reagan although the majority of the money which was made from the arms deals went to the enterprise a good three or four million made it to the contras in 1986 the sales to iran continued in february north arranged a deal of 1000 tow missiles which brought a profit of 6 to 10 million which secord could use for the contras yet hostages still remained in captivity and by this time william buckley the cia station chief had been tortured and killed the iran contra connection was in full bloom the iranians demanded more weapons still and even intelligence data on iraq in may of 86 mcfarlane who had resigned but was still involved in the operation and north flew to teheran the capitol of iran in person in an attempt to calm things using fake passports they carried a small shipment of missile parts 357 pistols and suicide pills should they be captured mcfarlane made an offer involving yet another shipment this time of hawk missile parts for the exchange of all americans held in beirut the iranians were not cooperative and the adventurers left accomplishing nothing in june congress finally allowed reagan to resume aid to the contras but they specified that the money would not be available for four months north set to work to secure another arms deal to aid the contras until the congressional money would be available when the iranians released father lawrence jenco in july north got approval from reagan and poindexter to go ahead with a shipment of hawk missile parts it was now august and the sales to iran had been going on for more then a year after negotiating with another contact in iran north had israel ship 500 more tow anti tank missiles to iran and in november hostage david jacobsen was liberated from beirut at this point things began to fall apart for the reagan administration and the neat operation they had been conducting in early october sandinista soldier s shot down a cargo plane carrying weapons to the guerrillas and only one crew member survived he confessed to being part of a secret american government program to aid the contras a few days later a press conference was held in which the crew member named cia employees top cia officials made attempts to deny the story and william casey told north what he had to do with the contra aid program a month later the iranian end of the scandal began to break as well a small lebanese magazine al shiraa printed a sketchy article depicting the arms for hostages deals on november 3 us reporters were soon uncovering the details in the month of november north casey and poindexter released false information to the press and to congress they attempted to place blame on the secretary of state who had opposed the deal from the beginning and they suggested that israel had masterminded the entire operation at first administration officials thought that things would blow over if they laid low but it soon became apparent that the media was not letting go reagan in an attempt to improve his image asked attorney general edwin meese to conduct an investigation during the inquiry by meese little was uncovered he took no notes he moved extremely slowly and north poindexter and mcfarlane were able to clean up before the big guns entered the picture north poindexter and fawn hall a nsc secretary supposedly held what they referred to as a shredding party destroying over 5 000 pages of incriminating documents about the operation the enterprise and god knows what else even after meese found a piece of a document that connected the arms sales with 10 to 20 million in funds to the contras he allowed north access to the nsc office the investigation seemed a little too relaxed but poindexter pointed out that meese carried out the investigation as a friend of the president and not as attorney general he went on to say that he did not find it surprising that meese did not take notes reagan eventually held a news conference with meese in which they described the evidence meese had found after suggesting israel take the blame for starting the arms deals and getting a flat out no reply from them reagan made another attempt to save himself he culled the nsc staff by firing north and pushing poindexter into resignation after meese s press conference reagan finally appointed an official investigation committee headed by a former senator john tower to clear everything up he felt that he either owed at least that to the american people or that if he did not he would lose a large portion of his credibility the committee that became known as the tower commission held hearings in which almost all involved in the iran contra affair testified ronald reagan avoided answering many critical questions and often contradicted himself in his testimony john poindexter protected the president by denying any involvement by reagan he said of the iran contra operations the buck stops here with me oliver north took the blame and many others gave false testimony all in all the reagan administration was successful in preserving the teflon image of their president ronald reagan had weathered this storm though turbulent and brutal it was he lied about the war on drugs about the war on terrorism and even ignored congressionally approved foreign policy he violated the very beliefs that many americans held but did president ronald reagan break the law john m poindexter in a statement he made to me nearly ten years after the events said it as well as anyone could first of all with regard to iran contra and contrary to what you have probably read there was nothing illegal about the actions the president took the so called violation of the boland amendment was never charged tried or decided by a jury arms embargoes are the result of executive orders from the president and he can decide to make exceptions and these do not have to be public he can defer reporting matters to the congress until he deems it appropriate the president makes many controversial decisions and his political opponents will often try to cast their differences as the president has violated the law there will always be confrontation between the president and congress as each strives to keep control and that s mainly it

market back to extreme overbought with earnings season in full swing stocks continued to push higher this past week even disappointing earnings from nasdaq nasdaq and nasdaq couldn t keep the bulls down much so far the earnings season has pretty much aligned with expectations as noted by factset overall 56 of the companies in the have reported actual results for q3 2021 to date of these companies 82 have reported actual eps above estimates which is above the five year average of 76 if 82 is the final percentage for the quarter it will mark with the fourth highest percentage of s p 500 companies reporting a positive earnings surprise since factset began tracking this metric in 2008 in aggregate companies are reporting earnings that are 10 3 above estimates which is also above the five year average of 8 4 earnings have indeed been very impressive but as we will discuss this quarter will likely mark the peak of growth for a while the more significant concern however remains the underlying technical condition of the market while the rally has been impressive rising almost 6 from the recent lows the market is now back to more extreme overbought levels trading 2 standard deviations above the 50 dma and breadth remains troubling chart updated through friday as noted last week our money flow buy signal is near a peak and is close to triggering a sell signal with the macd still positive the signal suggests more consolidation than correction however a confirming macd often aligns with short term corrections at a minimum also as shown this entire rally from the recent lows has been on very weak volume which suggests a lack of commitment at the moment the bulls control the and downside risk is somewhat limited however that positioning is getting very aggressive aggressive positioning as noted the current spat of economic weakness combined with rising inflationary pressures doesn t bode well historically for asset markets however the recent 5 correction did little to reverse more aggressive positioning as shown below the naaim index fund manager positioning has surged back levels that have previously aligned with short term corrections or worse such is not surprising given the massive inflows of capital into the market this year alone which have now exceeded 1 trillion chart courtesy of zerohedge furthermore with the window for corporate share buybacks opening in november the primary buyers of equities will return to the market share buybacks are already at a record and could add as much as 90 billion to the total by year end while capital flows certainly support the bullish narrative in the short term such can get easily reversed with a change in sentiment as noted with economic growth weakening and inflation increasing the risk of a reversal is increasing moreover the chart shows that previous spikes in inflation have not been kind to equity returns of course inflation also hurts economic growth which impacts profit margins economic growth weakens in march of this year i penned an article entitled wherein we discussed the economy would run hot and then crash at the time i received a lot of pushback on my dire predictions of economic growth later in the year furthermore i followed that analysis asking if q2 was the to wit was the second quarter the peak of economic growth and earnings if estimates are correct and the year over year base effect fades such suggests risk to current earnings estimates the chart from a utilizes the atlanta fed s current estimates for q2 2021 gdp the full year estimates are from jp morgan notably the economy quickly slows to 2 heading into 2022 at that time we estimated less than a 4 growth rate for the economy with the atlanta fed well above 6 on thursday the initial release of q3 came in well below even our lowered expectations of just 2 real gross domestic product gdp increased at an annual rate of 2 0 percent in the third quarter of 2021 table 1 according to the advance estimate released by the bureau of economic analysis in the second quarter real gdp increased 6 7 percent bea notably the advance estimate is derived from a sampling of economists estimates as actual data gets factored into the gdp calculation during the next two months the growth estimates will get revised as discussed in the weakness in the economic data suggests those gdp revisions will be lower the implications of weak economic growth are broad consumer sentiment will remain weak as inflationary pressures undermine consumption furthermore the negative impact on earnings seems to elude investors currently earnings expectations way ahead of reality despite economic growth weakening as inflation increases liquidity reducing and profit margins under pressure analysts continue to increase their earnings estimates currently estimates for the q4 2022 are 207 share according to s p as shown that level will exceed the historical 6 exponential growth trend that contained earnings growth since 1950 currently earnings expectations exceed the annual exponential growth trend by one of the most significant deviations on record the only other two periods with similar deviations are the financial crisis and the dot com bubble with analysts extremely exuberant there seems to be little concern for investors however i would caution against such complacency the chart below is the economic output composite index the index comprises the cfnai chicago pmi ism composite the fed surveys markit economic index markit pmi nfib tipp confidence and the lei in other words this indicator is the broadest indicator of the u s economy there is the last complete set of data is through september notably the index peaked at the second highest level on record when october gets fully accounted for the index will decline further there are two critical takeaways from the eoci index 1 the stock market tends to either correct or fall into a bear market during reversals and 2 there is a high correlation between the index and the annual change in earnings as we have noted previously with the fed beginning to taper bond purchases the risk to investors continues to rise as earnings peak and profit margins contract portfolio update while anything is possible in the near term complacency has returned to the market very quickly as noted while investors are very bullish there are numerous reasons to remain mindful of the risks earnings and profit growth estimates are too high stagflation is becoming more prevalent weak economic growth and rising inflation inflation indexes are continuing to rise economic data is surprising to the downside supply chain issues are more persistent than originally believed inventory problems continue unabated valuations are high by all measures interest rates are rising furthermore as noted above there is limited upside as the annual rate of change in the market declines so what do you do as discussed recently we believe additional equity exposure gets warranted due to the bullish case however the longer term dynamics are more bearish for now we remain optimistic about the markets due to liquidity seasonality and bullish sentiment as such we maintained our equity exposures again this week however we are beginning to hedge risk slightly heading into the fed meeting next week with extremely extended we rebalanced energy stocks back to model weights we also started building a position in volatility to hedge our long equity holdings against a sudden decline what could cause such a decline no one knows however everyone seems to believe it can t happen that is usually just about the time it does

dubai ever wondered why some currencies fluctuate and why do some turn more volatile than others while some currency rates are jumping to all time highs others plunge to record lows exchange rates are constantly fluctuating but what exactly causes a currency s value to rise and fall it is true that with 180 currencies around the globe no country s currency value remains static and when pegged with other currencies the value of money changes every moment however why some currencies fluctuate more than others is the same reason why international online shops sometimes list prices in us dollar or euro or when you go on an overseas holiday certain services are priced in a non domestic currency some currencies are stronger or more stable than others before we know why exactly that is and to understand why some countries witness unpredictable movements in exchange rates in the global foreign exchange market known as currency volatility foreign exchange or fx volatility let s first see which currencies are more volatile than others indian pakistan rupee philippine peso among most volatile asian currencies particularly those of india pakistan bangladesh sri lanka and the philippines have consistently been more volatile compared to more stable currencies like the us dollar the european euro the swiss franc the japanese yen or the british pound sterling in the last decade the indian rupee inr has devalued against the us dollar usd by about 60 per cent implying that in these years the inr has become weak compared to usd countries like kuwait bahrain oman jordan which see lot of usd coming in in form of investments sees its currency getting stronger analysts evaluate factors that make currencies of developing countries more volatile than their developed counterparts include comparatively lesser influence practiced by the countries economies not being as diversified as developed ones and regulations being more restrictive than others why developing countries currency fluctuates currencies can be loosely categorised as hard and soft the former being seen as reliable widely accepted and a store of financial value there is no defined list of them but the more developed a country is the more it s assumed to be one that holds a hard currency developing countries have a volatile or a soft currency international trade also gets priced in hard currencies over soft currencies which in turn adds to the steadiness of the top currencies and to the volatility of the weaker ones let s next look at why this is flux stems from uneven supply and demand although there is no single indicator that explains exactly why a currency has fluctuated or predicts with certainty what its price will do understanding the science of supply and demand and other factors relating to it will help you gain a better grasp of why this happens simply put currencies fluctuate based on supply and demand for a given currency most of the world s currencies are bought and sold based on flexible exchange rates meaning their prices fluctuate based on the supply and demand in the foreign exchange market a high demand for a currency or a shortage in its supply will cause an increase in price a currency s supply and demand are tied to a number of intertwined factors including the country s monetary policy the rate of inflation and political and economic conditions which we will explore in detail further below so why does a currency fluctuate currency prices for any economy are determined by two ways floating exchange rate and a fixed exchange rate floating exchange rates or flexible exchange rates are determined by market forces without active intervention of central governments the floating exchange rate is determined by the supply and demand in the forex market as practiced by most advanced economies that allow their currencies to freely float in the market the fixed exchange rate on the other hand is predominantly determined by the governments of countries like china currency fluctuations are a natural outcome of floating exchange rates which is the norm for most major economies a currency s exchange rate is typically determined by the strength or weakness of the underlying economy as such a currency s value can fluctuate from one moment to the next effects of a fluctuating currency the level of a currency relative to another has ramifications on a country s ability to import and export a weak currency allows it to export more through increased competitiveness but it then results in the import of goods becoming more expensive generally a weaker currency stimulates exports and makes imports expensive constant currency fluctuations can also affect the market adversely causing it to become volatile and affecting both local and foreign trade for instance due to heavy imports the supply of the currency may go up and its value fall in contrast when exports increase and dollar inflows are high the currency strengthens what s the perfect exchange rate to remit here is a checklist picture used for illustrative purposes image credit gulf news archives economic factors that force a currency s value to fluctuate monetary policy many countries central banks attempt to control the demand for currency by increasing or decreasing the money supply and or benchmark interest rates the money supply is the amount of a currency is printed and in circulation as a country s money supply increases and the currency becomes more available the price of borrowing the currency goes down the interest rate is the price at which money can be borrowed with a low interest rate people and businesses are more willing and able to borrow money as they continually spend this borrowed money the economy grows however if there is too much money in the economy and the supply of goods and services does not increase accordingly prices begin to inflate rate of inflation another variable that heavily influences the value of a currency is the inflation rate the inflation rate is the rate at which the general price of goods and services are increasing while a small amount of inflation indicates a healthy economy too much of an increase can cause economic instability which may ultimately lead to the currency s depreciation a country s inflation rate and interest rates heavily influence its economy if the inflation rate gets too high the central bank may counteract the problem by raising the interest rate this encourages people to stop spending and instead save their money it also stimulates foreign investment and increases the amount of capital entering the marketplace which leads to an increased demand for currency therefore an increase in a country s interest rate leads to an appreciation of its currency similarly a decrease in an interest rate causes depreciation of the currency political and economic conditions the economic and political conditions of a country can also cause a currency s value to fluctuate while investors enjoy high interest rates they also value the predictability of an investment this is why currencies from politically stable and economically sound countries generally have higher demand which in turn leads to higher exchange rates markets continually monitor the current and expected future economic conditions of countries in addition to money supply changes interest rates and inflation rates other key economic indicators include gross domestic product unemployment rate housing starts and trade balance a country s total exports less its total imports if these indicators show a strong and growing economy its currency will tend to appreciate as demand increases similarly strong political conditions impact currency values positively if a country is in the midst of political unrest or global tensions the currency becomes less attractive and demand falls on the other hand if a market sees the introduction of a new government that suggests stability or strong future economic growth a currency may appreciate as people buy it based on the good news why some currencies fall more than others developing countries like the ones mentioned earlier and also brazil indonesia and turkey among others have become favoured destinations for international investors over the past decade attracting capital to their fast growing industries and delivering a boost to the global economy but unlike the us uk japan and increasingly china developing or markets have an inherent weakness few investors are willing to stockpile their currencies if cracks are detected in an economy investors will dump the local currency and extract dollars leaving behind devalued reals rupiahs and liras this dynamic has caused decline driven crises in several regions over the past decades currency crises which many economists define as a swift decline of more than 20 per cent of a local currency against the dollar have hit dozens of developing countries over the past three decades and have occasionally triggered regional recessions like the latin american debt crises in 1982 and the asian financial crisis in 1998 picture used for illustrative purposes can currencies crash currency declines typically follow a series of political economic and market forces that combine to pressure the exchange rate countries in crisis tend to run persistent current account deficits importing more than they are exporting or borrowing capital from foreign lenders often with short term maturities to finance public budget deficits and long term projects capital flows can be unsteady and after years of inflows from foreign investors market sentiments can suddenly shift and dollars are sucked out of a developing market driving down exchange rates as currency value falls it creates a panic that leads to mass sell offs of currency and investments which further induces depleting reserves in a country raising domestic interest rates and sometimes triggering recessions why understand currency fluctuations currency fluctuations have a significant impact on us for example buying a foreign car might get more expensive if your country s currency depreciates which means that you might end up paying more money to get an item of the same value on the other hand a stable currency allows us to buy more when you travel overseas one of the routines you become accustomed to is exchanging your currency for the local currency many people get surprised by the different amounts of local money they have once their currencies are turned in clearly fluctuating global currencies are a constant in volatile international capital markets consequently there can be plenty of ways to capitalise on the wide swings of currencies uae dirham viewed as the most stable uae dirham is viewed as among the world s most stable currencies in terms of exchange rate stability the reason for this is the country has imposed what you call a fixed exchange rate system which is where the price of a currency is fixed with respect to another currency all the gcc countries excluding kuwait have their currencies pegged to the us dollar the uae dirham has been fixed at a rate of 3 6725 to 1 since 1997 the kuwaiti dinar is pegged to basket of currencies after scrapping its dollar peg in 2007 how a declining currency benefits you now that we have understood what causes currency fluctuations we can look at how we can utilise a declining currency the pakistani rupee for example has historically been on a downward trend and is known to benefit overseas pakistanis working in the uae and other countries as they will be able to remit more money a weaker rupee will also increase the buying power of overseas pakistanis when it comes to investing back home rupee depreciation would increase the country s competitiveness and exports from pakistan would become cheaper the pace at which the rupee is depreciating will have an effect on inflation levels in pakistan even from the side of a uae based businessman this is good news the rupee s decline is good for uae based businessmen because its weakness will make imports cheaper from pakistan the businessmen who let s say import vegetables and fruits and other food items from some of the major cities in pakistan even after inflation adjustment prices are almost still the same but they will be sending less dirhams now to purchase stuff from there another benefit is in india for example where remittances are one of the significant contributors to the foreign exchange reserve and makes up nearly 25 per cent of total foreign exchange reserves in the country the depreciation of the indian rupee always has a positive impact on the remittances

with arizona s big donor addict kyrsten sinema has been forcing joe biden and the democrats congressional leadership to make nonstop cuts in their proposed new dealish social safety net program has complained that it would create an entitlement society so let s get rid of social security and medicare west virginia is arguably the nation s leading entitlement state the commerce department reports that about 32 percent of west virginians personal income last year came in government transfer payments in the form of retirement and disability benefits medical benefits welfare payments veterans benefits unemployment compensation and education and training assistance this is the highest such percentage in the country the next most entitled state is also deep red mississippi at 30 percent both those states and most other red states have populations that are poorer and sicker than most blue states that s in part because of underfunding of education health care physical infrastructure etc in order to keep taxes low for the plutocrats who run the states for their own benefit they are adept at promoting pols who use such social issues as guns for everyone and abortion sometimes aided by ignorant and or money grubbing preachers wielding the weapon of their versions of biblical literalism to distract the voters and keep them voting against their own socio economic interests and keep public education as lousy as possible so the populace won t know enough to challenge the 1 percent unfortunately that s bad for the states overall economy especially as higher knowledge and skills are required for more and more jobs whatever as i ve written before the dems would have done better to have only pushed through this year the very popular and somewhat bipartisan 1 1 trillion physical infrastructure bill roads bridges trains electric grid etc which could have been easily enacted months ago before pressing their social safety net expansion that too big and complicated package started at 3 5 trillion but has been greatly shrunken to less than 2 trillion the physical infrastructure bill if enacted could help the dems gain enough congressional seats in the 2022 elections to then be able to get much of their social program passed i don t agree with everything in that program but some of it would indeed advance economic and social fairness and that the bill would seriously address the menace of catastrophic global warming is admirable but among other things there should have been incentives to revive the stabilizing and wealth creating force of families with two married parents perhaps by the time that you read this written last thursday the president and the congressional leadership will have pulled enough rabbits from hats to have gotten through a substantial part of their social program but if they had postponed that they would by now have been the political beneficiaries of the very popular job creating and overall economy boosting physical infrastructure program which is long overdue anyway i wonder if the current covid connected supply chain and inflation problems would have been less if something like biden s physical infrastructure bill had been enacted a few years ago then there s the matter of taxes to pay for biden s new deal the idea of a wealth tax has been floated in this time of ever expanding income inequality in which fewer and fewer people have more and more economic and political power tempting but it s far too complicated to measure and tax assets whose value of course is always changing an administrative nightmare the idea was that people with 1 billion in assets or 100 million in annual income for three consecutive years would be taxed on how much such tradeable assets as stocks appreciated even if these folks don t actually cash in realize in financial jargon these gains but that idea apparently died late last week better to stick with raising income tax rates and going after the hundreds of billions in unpaid taxes owed by various very rich people because of a mix of tax fraud evasion and taking tax loopholes to legally dubious extremes addressing this would require giving more staff and other resources to the irs meanwhile let s note that certain american billionaires have far more economic and political power than almost all our elected officials view larger the duopoly of the republican and democratic parties has led to corruption because of their ties to favored big business lobbyists and their primary elections increasingly favor the more extreme candidates and hence those less likely to compromise to get policies enacted america would do well to move toward a true multiparty system that would encourage coalition building and compromise in public policies and move us away from the paralysis that besets national government this would include ranked choice voting this refers to any voting system in which voters use a ranked or preferential ballot to select more than one candidate or other alternative being voted on and to rank these choices in a sequence on the scale of first second third etc the fear of being primaried by zealots who increasingly dominate primary elections in many states has led many otherwise responsible and competent candidates to cynically and cowardly express extremist views or to get out of politics entirely in disgust even the very popular to the general public successful and competent massachusetts gov charlie baker an old fashioned new england style republican has to worry about being primaried as so much of the national republican party gopq falls deeper and deeper into neo fascism lies bigotry and conspiracies meanwhile some democrats all too often fall into extreme identity politics which turns off many independents view larger a trump backed regulation in 2017 made it easier for big internet service providers with massive lobbying operations to engage in the paid prioritization of service for the benefit of big corporate customers at the expense of small ones but politicians and other officials in some states including massachusetts are looking to get around this via new state laws the proposed bay state law would bar that favoritism and be good for the economy the internet is more important in the techno and business start up rich bay state than in most states state sen james eldridge noted this was really a

by aaron renn in governing magazine about how poor neighborhoods with lots of owner occupied dwellings provided a springboard for people to enter the middle class it sure beats massive impersonal and often crime ridden public housing projects an example would be those new england neighborhoods of three deckers in places like south boston the owners often live on just one floor and rent out the rest of the building a way to start gaining middle class wealth but as i ve noticed in the u s cities where i ve lived boston new york philadelphia and providence public policies and changing social attitudes have eroded the benefits of this starter housing for years among mr renn s observations the rise of zoning and ever stricter building codes played a role especially in recent years preventing the construction of traditional starter neighborhoods changing zoning regulations to create more affordable neighborhoods in some of america s most expensive cities would help establish platforms for upward mobility but other factors played into making these old neighborhoods what they were they were high in social capital characterized by intact married families and populated with people who possessed the skills needed for building maintenance these exist today in some immigrant communities but less so in society at large ah yes the collapse of marriage and the stability that

the company reconnaissance energy africa known as reconafrica has a plan objectionable to virtually everyone except its investors and namibian and botswanan government partners who have granted permits for exploratory tests it promises to unleash untold levels of pollution destruction of water supplies and farmland permanent harm to animals including endangered species and the eviction of residents from their land reconafrica s rush for what they are calling largest oil play of the decade is nothing short of devastating profit fueled extraction with strong echoes of africa s colonial past yet big oil is on the ropes pushed by mass resistance and calls for climate justice oil gas and mining companies are facing an unprecedented crisis environmental activists have long denounced extractive industries for their climate destroying capabilities demanding a transition to sustainable energy sources and that fossil fuels be left in the ground since the passage of the paris agreement on climate change in 2015 calls for governments and multinational corporations to take urgent action have accelerated as this article was going to press in june 2021 a series of major statements and rulings compelling a curb on fossil fuel production have shaken the industry to its core in this context with the contradictions of destructive extraction laid bare how can we understand this aggressive push by reconafrica into one of the largest protected wildlife regions on the globe part of the answer lies in the solutions on offer claims of a path to net zero put forward by major firms such as bp and shell paper over a global contradiction achieving net zero on their terms means that ordinary people of the global south will pay the price as nations of the global north export their carbon footprints this struggle cannot be seen more clearly than in the fight for the future of okavango reconafrica drilling at any cost in 2014 representatives of a canadian junior oil company called reconnaissance energy africa signed a lease to a 13 000 square mile 8 75 million acre area approximately the size of belgium in namibia and botswana according to the company s website they hold a 90 interest in the 6 3 million acre namibian section with the national oil company namcor holding the remaining 10 and a full 100 of 2 45 million acres in adjacent botswana reconafrica secured extremely favorable terms from the namibian government a 5 royalty fee and 35 corporate tax if the oil exploration is commercially viable the company is entitled to a 25 year production license after a series of delays reconafrica obtained permits to explore raising enough capital to drill three exploratory wells with an ipo of 23 million in 2020 and beginning drilling in january 2021 in kawe kavango east in an elephant habitat the company has long predicted a major find up to 31 billion barrels of oil upon the april 15 announcement that the first of a three well drilling program provides clear evidence of a working conventional petroleum system in the kavango basin their stock prices surged company statements brim with enthusiasm for this last great oil find with geological conditions ostensibly similar to the texas permian basin we know we have discovered a new sedimentary basin it s up to 35 000 feet deep and it s a large and very expansive basin every basin of this depth in the world produces commercial hydrocarbons it just makes sense reconafrica co founder craig steinke told cnn drilling in the second well was underway in mbambi also in kavango east as new politics went to press it s difficult to overestimate the destructive potential in reconafrica s plans investigative journalists area residents and activists have accumulated a vast body of evidence of the dangers to okavango demolishing the company s claims to adequate safety measures as a result resistance to the drilling plan is growing national geographic launched a series of articles in the fall of 2020 condemning the immense threats posed to the wildlife livelihoods and environment in the region among the most serious is the potential for water contamination in an area with scarce water supplies the okavango is a wetland fed by an inland delta the region s major water source as the magazine describes any contamination to the aquifer will be all but impossible to contain and clean up reconafrica s license to explore lies adjacent to the main river of the okavango delta and exploratory drilling is being carried out 160 miles upstream critics of the project have raised serious concerns about the lack of analysis in the environmental impact assessment eia of the impact on ground and surface water especially given the vast amount of water that drilling requires the dangers posed to the water supply actually affect roughly half the population of namibia a mainly arid country as the okavango river supports the water security of more than one million people namibia has already experienced frightening degrees of warming at a rate outpacing that of other regions the national geographic series has laid out in painful detail the danger posed to the area s wildlife the okavango region is home to the largest herd of african elephants left on earth and myriad other animals african wild dogs lions leopards giraffes amphibians and reptiles birds and rare flora including important migratory routes for the world s largest remaining elephant population wild animals use the entire region which is why angola botswana namibia zambia and zimbabwe have created the kavango zambezi transfrontier conservation area or kaza for short bigger than italy it s the largest conservation area on the continent reconafrica s licensed areas overlap with this huge international park the region is also home to six wildlife conservancies and is typically described as the largest terrestrial transfrontier conservation area in the world shockingly while recon africa has a license to explore as critics have pointed out not all required permits were obtained for the testing of the wells the company has made a series of promises and claims that have failed to materialize they pledged to line pits for the safe disposal of well water yet photos clearly show that that promise has been broken reconafrica claims that they are using water that is organic and 100 safe to the environment for drilling yet waste from drilling fluids is extremely hazardous and potentially radioactive namibia s ministry of agriculture water and land reform has stated that the company wasn t consulted on permitting likewise as activist ina maria shikongo of the organization fridays for future windhoek pointed out permits were never granted for the road building to the second drill site conducted by reconafrica despite the immense pollution and noise disruption to residents and wildlife caused by the construction these serious questions notwithstanding the drilling of boreholes has gone ahead it s called greenwashing said shikongo describing company misrepresentations in an interview this should be a crime the danger that the company could frack in the okavango looms large reconafrica has not received a license to frack from the namibian government and earlier references to the possibility of using unconventional methods i e fracking have disappeared from their website now company spokespeople insist fracking is off the table yet a number of senior executives made their reputations by fracking such as ceo scot evans formerly of halliburton drilling operations are headed up by none other than the geologist credited with developing the fracking method nick steinsberger described by an industry publication as one of the men who made the american shale boom happen in an interview steinsberger captured the hubris of drilling at any costs that characterizes the project i am honored to have been responsible for completing the first 25 horizontal shale wells ever drilled in shale patch this is indeed where modern day fracking began now i m hoping for something just as exciting in namibia s kavango basin i could have gone pretty much anywhere but we all want something big the next big find and they don t happen very often these days at least not onshore we re looking for the next american shale boom and africa s got the most potential south african geologist jan arkert believes however that fracking will be required to extract the oil from the soil and that harmful emissions will inevitably be released into the atmosphere despite the dangers company representatives joyfully declare the potential for 120 billion barrels of oil equivalent numbers potentially laughable because they are so high but it s not only the exploratory glee that mimics the tone of colonial adventurers of over a century ago reconafrica public relations spin comes with promises for the people of namibia and botswana and supposed improvements in their way of life including jobs but as with many extractive projects drilling is not labor intensive so the project is not expected to lead to many new jobs and the skilled jobs onsite are mainly held by workers from canada and the united states in fact jobs for residents in the region have been mainly limited to short term manual labor and in some cases workers have been fired after a brief stint and pay withheld according to shikongo when the labor commissioner went to investigate he himself was slapped with a lawsuit by the company in fact reconafrica has taken pains to emphasize their ostensible strong social license and eagerly talk up their efforts at community engagement through a series of public meetings in the region but as a number of accounts have described their outreach was fraught with problems public notices were only distributed in english a language not spoken by a majority of the residents and the sessions themselves limited due to covid related restrictions only included a small number of people the company s behavior has been so egregious that a lawsuit has been brought by the family of andreas sinonge in mbambi whose farm is located near the second borehole according to national geographic over 600 working farms lie within reconafrica s exploration area some irrigated with water from the okavango river intending to bring the company and several government ministries before the namibian high court they argue that they never consented to the drilling and that reconafrica is squatting illegally the law is clear in its intent communal land is not to be turned over to private companies for the sake of profit seeking we already had land rights and were in occupation of that piece of land by the time recon came and started drilling for oil and gas extraction we were forcefully and unlawfully evicted from our land stated the filings other reports assert that the area wasn t included in the original eia and eports of bullying of community leaders who have spoken out against oil drilling have surfaced the right to free prior and informed consent and the right to say no are recognized global principles for local residents in the face of community destroying extraction and reconafrica to date has in practice trampled on this fundamental notion indigenous resistance and community organizing in the face of this corporate aggression the indigenous san people of the okavango have mobilized and spoken out in protest a statement to the namibian and botswanan governments from the san people explained that we note that as the custodians of this land for thousands of years and the rightful current inhabitants and custodians of this land we have never been consulted nor have we given the go ahead to any entities to prospect for oil and gas in this our lands we depend on the presence of the animals for food as well as to attract tourism from which we derive an income in this way we will be prevented from hunting and gathering food collecting medicine and performing our cultural practices and sacred rituals in short it will prevent us from being san they argue that the area should be protected under unesco commitments to the cultural landscape accompanying its designation as a world heritage site further they continue the exploration violates the united nations declaration on the rights of indigenous people and the commitments to protect the environment enshrined in the namibian constitution as a result of protest against the violation of the site reconafrica was compelled to accept an exemption for the tsodilo hills of the unesco designated area a victory but a small section of the exploration area activists have been moving into action both locally and internationally fridays for future windhoek frack free namibia and botswana the kavango alive activist network and saving okavango s unique life soul among others have grown their resistance over the past year through a series of marches on unesco offices the parliament and government ministries in april 2021 on earth day and on the heels of u s president joe biden s leaders climate summit protesters in windhoek delivered letters to the u s and german ambassadors the letter read in part we are gravely concerned with developments in northern namibia specifically in the region of the kavango basin where the fossil fuel industry s desperate last gasp of air threatens to destroy one of africa s last lifelines and home to a truly magnificent and unique ecosystem reconafrica a petroleum exploration company headquartered in canada is currently engaging in oil and gas exploration in the kavango basin the watershed of the famed okavango delta this very delta home to the last great herd of african elephants recently confirmed to be dangerously close to extinction is protected by us public law known as the defending economic livelihoods and threatened animals act or the delta act when president biden said yesterday we have to move we have to move quickly to meet these challenges surely this meant stopping even the slightest damage to one of the world s most delicate and magnificent surviving eco systems especially in the name of dirty energy the struggle to save the okavango is gathering steam internationally with a march 2021 protest by extinction rebellion at reconafrica s now shuttered vancouver office and mobilizations in south africa belgium and the united kingdom a petition drive calling on canadian prime minister justin trudeau has gained wide support in the face of activist assertions of their right to say no the regional governments have instead insisted upon their right to explore notwithstanding strong environmental protections in the namibian constitution and the fact that both namibia and botswana are parties to the paris agreement aspirations for resource nationalism on the part of both have remained firm in a joint government company press release namibian minister of mines and energy thomas alweendo extolled the initial drilling results as a great period for the people of namibia hinting at hypocrisy in the idea that the global south should be denied any developmental potential extraction offers meanwhile activists critical of the government s actions are branded as outsiders and hostile to the opportunities on offer for indigenous people said ina maria shikongo reconafrica for their part has welcomed the government as one of the friendliest regimes for explorers an investigative piece by the globe mail has revealed close ties between a company consultant and namibia s president hage geingob extraction in africa and the net zero era the oil industry is in a race against time the calls for net zero emissions and curbs on fossil fuel exploitation have created contradictions where the world s oil companies face urgent demands to transition to sustainable fuel sources at the same time as oil is becoming profitable again during the pandemic prices crashed globally because of a glut in supply even dipping into negative territory in the early stages of the crisis today a new oil boom could be around the corner with prices creeping upwards but even in the downturn of 2020 consumption still averaged 91 million barrels a day more than the world consumed daily in 2012 the world s largest banks have provided 3 8 trillion to fossil fuel companies since 2016 when the paris agreement took effect global banks provided 750 billion in financing to coal oil and gas companies in 2020 alone at the same time costs for a sustainable transition are enormous where energy investment will need to rise to 5 trillion a year by 2030 to achieve net zero from 2 trillion today these tensions exert contradictory pressures on the fossil fuel industry in a number of directions a product of a wider capitalist economy inextricably tied to competition and profit how to invest in new technologies while maintaining a way to profit through extractive industries these tensions are currently unfolding on a global scale with the struggle over the transition and who will pay setting companies on a competitive crash course likewise global powers claiming the mantle of net zero aspirations are embarking on a new period of green imperialism these are the dynamics of the sustainable transition and activist forces and the left must understand this new terrain as one we are compelled to fight on reconafrica is on a no holds barred drive to extract profit for as long as that window of opportunity remains open and because of mounting pressures on the industry their tendency to cut regulatory corners as reported by environmentalists and activists no matter the cost to communities and wildlife will only intensify on the one hand a small junior oil company like reconafrica cannot go it alone as the company itself has stated they will need the bigger resources of an oil major to step in and pull off the exploration success they claim lies in the okavango given these pressures when national geographic revealed on may 21 the existence of a whistle blower securities and exchange commission sec complaint against the company citing more than 150 instances of false and misleading statements to investors the news was shocking but not entirely surprising in response reconafrica hurriedly filed 22 amendments with canadian securities regulators and lashed out at the magazine for running false statements and a hit piece on the other hand in the net zero landscape big oil needs wildcatters like reconafrica small companies willing to take risks in unexplored territory who can continue to deliver a return on investment in fossil fuels in less heavily regulated regions of the world in this context oil majors might be more compelled to sell off their assets to producers more willing to buck the pressures towards greening their enterprise in late may 2021 an avalanche of change from stockholder rebellions at shell exxon and chevron to a ground breaking court ruling in the netherlands compelling shell oil to slash emissions by 45 by 2030 compared to 2019 levels are only the latest developments for high profile companies like bp and shell who had already made net zero commitments the fossil fuel industry is fighting for its future in okavango and other extraction hot spots across the continent extraction continues under the guise of these new finds by companies like reconafrica opting to violate regulations and human rights with historically weaker regulatory enforcement countries of the global south will be likely destinations for these last great discoveries as francois engelbrecht of the university of witwatersrand in south africa explained to cnn the big risk is that the global north makes the transition and that africa becomes the dumping ground for the world s fossil fuel technologies the last place where this kind of energy is being pursued a 2020 study for example found that european oil exported to nigeria exceeded eu pollution limits by as much as 204 times ina maria shikongo describes the stakes well you cannot be talking about cutting emissions on your side of the planet but then you are coming to release 1 4 billion tons of co2 on our side how is it that you can literally put our lives before this company people need to understand that reaching these targets globally is that companies are coming to africa to cause more emissions and it s not fair more climate refugees will be created more crimes against humanity and for what so we can continue feeding this greed it s slavery on another level it s a continuation of colonialism the transition has to be about saving lives so everyone has a fair share we have all of the raw materials but we live in poverty but it s an imposed poverty conclusion on may 18 the international energy agency iea an organization representing rich countries dropped a bombshell declaration in their net zero by 2050 report all new fossil fuel extraction needs to halt after this year to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and investors must not take on any new projects in this unprecedented call for change the iea insisted that current targets are insufficient to avert the climate emergency the number of countries which have pledged to reach net zero has grown but even if their commitments are fully achieved there will still be 22 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide worldwide in 2050 which would lead to temperature rise of around 2 1c by 2100 well above the 1 5ₒ c aspirational goal of the paris agreement while big oil and governments of the global north advocate for market based net zero so called solutions to the crisis front line struggles underscore the actual stakes the oil industry super majors and junior operators alike will not leave the fossil fuel world stage quietly fortunately the global resistance continues to grow accelerated in no small part by struggles like the one in okavango that is helping to reshape the terms of this fight beyond its borders the coalitions knitted together to stop reconafrica in namibia and botswana both put the worst most outrageous abuses on full display in

as the world braces up to normalise following a year and a half of severe battering from the covid 19 pandemic the after effects of the malady on the global economy continue to emerge in different forms while the early days of the pandemic saw major world economies impose lockdowns close borders and reduce business activities the latest problem concern a disruption in the global supply chain of a majority of commodities many of these items are also of daily use one year ago the breakthrough in development of a covid 19 vaccine renewed hopes putting an end to the pandemic by the mid of the ongoing year however one year later the world economy continues to suffer despite widespread vaccination campaigns in many countries including pakistan one of the major after effects of the pandemic has been the disturbance in the global supply chain which has slowed down the global recovery from the pandemic speaking to the express tribune cotton trader saad ahmed said that the supply chain crisis was being faced due to a cascading impact of covid 19 we all know that the pandemic hit china much earlier than the rest of the world he said however due to stringent lockdowns and strict mobility restrictions chinese economy began recovering much earlier than the rest of the globe as well uneven recovery the cotton importer stated that last year beijing recorded a nationwide recovery in the beginning of the second quarter april june of 2020 while the earliest rebound witnessed in many other countries including pakistan was in the middle of third quarter july september right after the economic revival was evident china began producing merchandise for the world however demand was low so it was able to supply commodities to the rest of the world at the same time scarcity in demand of a number of non essential items forced major logistics and transportation companies to scrap their containers and carriers the shipping companies began selling their fleets and containers due to which congestion at the scrap yard mounted he said the plunge in demand was seemingly long term therefore the companies had no incentive to pay wear and tear of their assets without utilising them moreover majority of these companies were on the brink of bankruptcy due to virtually no business hence they decided to sell few of their containers and carriers to keep the business afloat towards the end of 2020 a breakthrough in vaccine trials partially turned the market sentiment around and signaled an end to the pandemic in early months of 2021 in addition in order to stimulate a turnaround in the economy a handful of first world countries announced relief for their residents the us for instance paid a cumulative 2 000 in two installments of 1 200 and 800 to its citizens this liquidity injection coupled with the upbeat newsflow of discovery of covid 19 vaccine significantly boosted the demand of all products across the globe at this moment people began spending ahmed said most of the people were still working from home so they bought a lot of a new stuff including home renovation products technology gadgets such as laptops and other essential products the demand in the global economy began recovering but bear in mind that at the same time the supply was limited port problems due to covid 19 restrictions ports were not fully functioning at that time he said ahmed added that many ports were still taking less traffic but a lot more ports had restrictions in place towards the end of 2020 and the start of 2021 in the initial months of 2021 a handful of unprecedented events further aggravated the situation occasional outbreak of the virus in china hindered the production process the spread of delta variant saw most countries impose stringent lockdowns again and majority of the carriers were shipping covid 19 vaccines to the nations he said at such a point the ever given obstructed the suez canal and paused the flow of logistics from one of the most important shipping routes in the world the giant ship go stuck in the suez canal on march 23 and blocked the movement of any traffic from the route till march 29 2021 during this time an estimated 9 6 billion worth of trade was lost moreover us began experiencing conflicts at its ports he said the ports of los angeles and long beach are highly desired routes from asia to continental us and these two placed began recording a huge influx of ships that they were unable to handle he said the port companies began implementing wait times for incoming ships which has now growth to 10 days the average wait times which was non existent before the pandemic surfaced in the world and stood at 7 5 days in august 2021 there were hundreds of ships lined up to offload their containers however ports are unable to process them despite the fact that they have implemented round the clock operations earlier ports had set timings during which they operated stated the importer he detailed that a port consists of main area where ships are docked and there is a separate area known as outer anchorage where they wait for being berthed outer anchorage in ports in most parts of the world has been filling up because while there was no notable expansion in shipping lines the scrapping of containers and carriers contracted this segment today the global supply chain is far from normal because suppliers are unable to meet demand due to a host of factors other than the ones already mentioned other factors the official stated as soon as lockdowns began easing and the recovery of global demand began the freight companies jacked up prices partly to erase the losses borne during lockdown and partly because of the huge influx of export and import orders arif habib corporation managing director and ceo ahsan mehanti said that covid 19 is still raging in many parts of the world and lockdowns are in effect in a few countries the manufacturing sector in these countries is working at half or reduced capacity due to the pandemic induced restrictions said mehanti low amount of workforce translates to drop in production while demand is stable this has created a wide gap between the demand and supply of products in the world few days back china shut a terminal for two weeks due to rise in virus infections he said this took place in the world s third busiest port and this was the second time in 2021 when the operations at the port were suspended on one hand some countries are unable to absorb the traffic on the port while on the other hand frequent closure of port operations is being witnessed this has also alleviated the supply crunch he said these are the after effects of the pandemic mehanti said furthermore the clearance of goods is also consuming a large window of time compared to the pre covid era moreover many countries are not issuing business visas either which can help resolve this issue to some extent during business to business meetings with their foreign counterparts traders ink agreements to switch trade routes to less congested passages that could reduce traffic at busy ports moreover cross border trade is also blocked in many areas giving the example of pakistan he said trade is largely suspended with afghanistan and india input scarcity the supply chain crisis has lately evolved into a raw material shortage for the global manufacturing sector what was termed as a temporary phase is not expected to improve for a long time few months ago the world witnessed a shortage of semi conductors that threatened entire digital manufacturing base as well as automobile production now this problem has evolved further alpha beta core ceo khurram schehzad said that the outbreak of covid 19 forced suppliers to limit production because there was no demand for their products back in march 2020 the malady was expected to continue for a few years and demand was not projected recover over the next one to two years he said in april 2020 oil fell below 0 which signaled excess supply and virtually no demand this dampened sentiment of producers because up till that moment oil was considered a necessity and was supposed to remain unaffected by any crisis he said keep the oil price dip in view producers had little incentive to continue on with production therefore inventories of factories shrank and now the world faces a deficit of inputs for the production process even for essential commodities sometime an input has to undergo manufacturing process to act as raw material for manufacturing of another product such as semiconductors they undergo massive manufacturing processes only to act as inputs for automobiles laptops mobiles and other digital gadgets now raw material for daily use items such as cooking oil and ghee is also in a deficit and this has triggered a crisis for factories all across the world world demand is recovering and the supply is not ample to fulfill demand therefore prices of commodities and raw material are soaring he said inflationary pressure while the supply is limited on one hand and prices are rising the logistics industry also has a deficit of containers therefore their rates are also surging the global supply chain is experiencing a multifaceted challenge the number of containers with logistic firms remained limited hence the companies were unable to absorb the sudden rise in demand as a result they raised the per container cost said schehzad right now the demand is high and a shortfall is being witnessed in raw material commodities inputs transport and logistics one can say that world does not have enough supply to meet the recovering demand even if logistic and transport issues are resolved coal and oil prices are soaring primarily due to reopening of economies and jump in energy demand stemming from planned revival of manufacturing base resultantly the energy prices are skyrocketing as well the cost of finished products and intermediary goods is climbing due to hike in input costs prices of metal particularly steel is on the rise he said a massive chunk of world demand came from china as it opened schehzad said that china is dependent on coal and while australia is huge exporter of the fossil fuel beijing refrains to buy from it due to geo political problems hence change in geo political situation is also contributing to global supply crunch he said china has supply of products but most western countries refrain from trading with it holiday season cotton importer saad ahmed said that holiday season is kicking in around the world and demand for all products ticks up during october to december every year there is not doubt that things have started to improve in many countries but the world has a long way to resolve the supply crunch issue us and latin and america are facing shipping problems but things are improving in other nations he said us port congestion is not expected to normalise atleast until march 2022 it can prolong far more than that but march is the earliest estimate ideally the port condition of us is expected to normalise at the beginning of 2023 this has created a huge export backlog for companies all around the world and shipping firms are taking back empty containers with them he detailed that earlier the containers would be filled with merchandise destined for other parts of the world importers and export oriented industries in europe and us are operating below capacity he said railway trucks and air cargo have no capacity either to facilitate exporters in delivering merchandise by the deadline he was of the view that there were low chances of resolution of the problem in the short run how is pakistan faring ali who supplies raw cotton to textile mills in pakistan revealed that raw cotton imports to the country are facing delays and the problem is expected to persist until the middle of 2022 raw material is a bit harder to secure right now and due to this the domestic cotton prices are at a historic high he said freight rates applicable on valued added exports have soared as well the gap between receipt of export orders and final delivery has expanded to six months he detailed that when the orders were registered the rise in freight costs was not taken into account and the sudden hike in fares is mounting losses for exporters according to him shipment delays were being experienced on the export side as well which has sparked liquidity issues among exporters the working capital cycle for exporters has risen from one month in pre covid times to two to three months now furthermore the global supply chain disruption has triggered a slowdown in pakistan s exports at present the textile sector has the capacity to fetch 1 8 1 9 billion per month in exports however it is only able to bring in 1 5 billion in revenue under this head he said overall due the supply crunch profits of companies have been impacted and costs have risen therefore they have jacked up prices and this is impacting the overall competiveness of the country in the export arena he revealed that pakistan s export share is increasing amid us china trade war while the country also managed to secure a massive amount of export orders in the previous months as the malady battered the regional economies an import dependent nation schehzad stated that pakistan was facing grave spillover effects of the global supply crunch because the country is dependent on imports energy commodities in pakistan are mostly imported and prices of oil coal and lng are scaling new peaks he said on the other hand machinery worth millions of dollars is being imported by businessmen of pakistan under the state bank of pakistan s temporary economic refinance facility terf the facility aimed to boost expansion of companies and plants to accelerate economic activity with freight costs surging around the world the imports under terf will become more expensive said schehzad he lamented that for every 1 earned through export by pakistan 3 were spent on imports mehanti noted that pakistan depended on export earnings for foreign exchange however 60 of the inputs in local exportable merchandise were imported the increase in freight prices amid covid 19 has significantly surged the input cost as well he said our import volume has declined but not import bill because of uptick in raw material prices due to low imports the exports of pakistan are declining on the other hand they have turned expensive as well and the country is not getting as many export orders as it did in previous months he regretted the supply crunch is also impacting rupee and triggered volatility in local currency against the us dollar import substitution when asked whether it was a good opportunity to steer import substitution in the economy mehanti was of the view that foreign investment was needed for it and investors were not moving around due to travel curbs the supply crunch has impacted our fdi as well he said however our relations with middle eastern nations are improving and we can ink oil facilities on deferred payment basis to reduce fuel price inflation qatar saudi arabia and uae can help pakistan in this regard this however is a short term solution he stated in the long term the investment environment has to improve and tax incentives have to be offered to foreigners to steer local production schehzad stated that pakistan had a golden opportunity to steer import substitution however there were a lot of structural issued that were difficult to resolve the governance is weak and provincial and federal governments are not cooperating he lamented hardcore reforms are needed the state owned entities are denting public finances of the country while pakistan s inclusion in the financial action task force fatf grey list is discouraging foreign investors to build plants in the country he criticised the economic managers for not importing energy when it was being offered on cheap rates in 2020 views of global agencies the international monetary fund has stated that supply chain disruptions have become a major challenge for the global economy since the start of the pandemic shutdowns of factories in china in early 2020 lockdowns in several countries across the world labour shortages robust demand for tradable goods disruptions to logistics networks and capacity constraints have resulted in big increases in freight costs and delivery times suppliers delivery times in the united states and the european union have hit record highs since late 2020 the recent sharp drop in the delivery times reflects surging demand widespread supply constraints or a combination of both during such times suppliers usually have greater pricing power causing a rise in prices moreover these supply chain delays can reduce the availability of intermediate goods which combined with labor shortages can slow down production and output growth once the number of new covid 19 cases starts to decline capacity constraints and labour shortages should ease taking some of the pressure off supply chains and delivery times however some experts believe that there is unlikely to be swift relief from supply chain disruptions elevated demand during the holiday season in some of the world s largest economies another wave of new covid 19 cases and extreme weather events if they materialise could cause further supply chain disruptions the world economic forum said that as the coronavirus crisis is wearing off in many parts of the world supply chain troubles are increasing once more for many companies mainly concerning the us and the eurozone supply chain disruptions have developed during the pandemic spiking in early 2020 and picking back up over the course of 2021 as the new normal causes all types of goods to become more sought amid a more permanent reopening the supply chains in china and emerging markets on the other hand are less affected still reeling from lockdowns and restrictions as well as the loss of manpower due to illness or travel restrictions many suppliers had to restrict their production and were no longer able to meet their delivery obligations in full and as even a single missing supply part can quickly affect production processes in a massive way the complex structure of global supply chains can quickly fold according to the imf supply chain disruptions together with increasing raw material prices are also a reason for the rise of consumer prices the imf expected this global inflation to reach its peak at the end of 2021 and return to pre crisis levels in many countries by the middle of 2022 on the other hand a recent report from the european central bank stated that shipping disruptions and input shortages are leading to considerable bottlenecks in global supply chains during the recovery phase of the covid 19 pandemic households increased their purchases of certain products such as electronics and home improvement equipment which caused a stronger than expected surge in demand especially in some sectors it said this rise in demand coupled with events beyond the reasonable control of suppliers owing to force majeure such as coronavirus outbreaks in ports accidents at plants and adverse weather conditions led to bottlenecks in the transport sector and caused shortages in specific inputs such as plastics metals lumber and semiconductors as inventories fell at the onset of the pandemic owing to the running down of stocks and shortages of inputs resulting from closures and conservative inventory policies companies struggled to keep up with the swift rise in demand and the replenishing of depleted stocks this demand and supply imbalance is evidenced by the unprecedented lengthening of suppliers delivery times especially in sectors relying on transportation and inputs from sectors experiencing shortages namely computer and electronic equipment machinery and equipment wood products motor vehicles and chemicals shipping volumes have recovered since the trough in mid 2020 in the first half of 2021 temporary disruptions such as the suez canal incident in march led to severe strains in global shipping but did not halt the positive growth dynamics as reflected in the global total and european north range ports throughput indicators european air cargo traffic was more severely affected by the pandemic as a result of the unprecedented reduction in passenger flights which decreased cargo capacity however by the start of 2021 air cargo traffic had once again reached its pre crisis level thanks to firms partly switching from sea freight to air transport the shipping routes experiencing the most severe strains are those from asia to north america and from asia to europe leading to extraordinary increases in shipping costs shipping capacities on the asia to north america route rebounded more strongly from the pandemic than on the asia to europe route partly on account of increased capacity driven by the robust recovery pattern observed in the united states given the relatively inelastic supply of shipping capacity and disruptions in the transport sector spot short term container freight rates for asian outbound routes have soared to record levels particularly for routes to north america this has also led to a redirection of capacity towards this more lucrative route at the expense of other routes the shipping business relies mainly on fixed long term contracts in the current environment the negotiation of new long term contracts has probably been affected resulting in a remarkable albeit less strong increase in freight rates for long term contracts than for contracts based on spot rates eu countries are among those countries most affected by the shipping and input related bottlenecks suppliers delivery times remained lengthy in almost all countries in august with eu countries the united states the united kingdom and taiwan being particularly affected in the euro area export sectors that experienced the fastest recovery are facing higher supply shortages in particular exports of motor vehicles electronics and fabricated metals which had expanded considerably up to the first quarter of 2021 compared with the first quarter of 2020 were affected by supply constraints which slowed the continued expansion of these sectors this underlies the role played by strong demand in the lengthening of suppliers delivery times the delays also extended to the machinery sector which relies on electronic equipment and fabricated metals as inputs

hong kong october 31 ani amid national security concerns the us revoked china telecom s licence to counter possible infiltration of its key networks by chinese companies the decision was made by the us federal communications commission fcc and it comes at an important time shortly after us president joe biden and his chinese counterpart xi jinping vowed to rebuild communication channels after years of rising tensions it is clear that even the current administration is not helping china anymore reported the hk post according to the fcc china telecom is subject to control influence and exploitation by the chinese communist party ccp government and it is highly likely that it will be forced to comply with the chinese government s illegal requests to acquire data this could be a huge security concern for the us with china s 2017 national security law in place us actions can only be said to be justified reported the hk post this law was passed on june 27 2017 and it came into effect the very next day on june 28 2017 it gives the communist party of china sweeping powers to control and mine data from companies under its purview most of which have an international presence the regulator further said that ownership and control of the said entity by the chinese government raises significant national security and law enforcement risks by providing opportunities for the company and the chinese government to access store disrupt or even misroute us communications continuing to give china telecom access to usa s market would be equal to inviting espionage china is known to steal trade secrets and other confidential business information reported the hk post in fact the fcc also added that china telecom america s conduct with it and other us government agencies also demonstrated a lack of trustworthiness and reliability even the department of justice had said that china telecom made inaccurate statements about where us records were stored reported the hk post with its licence revoked china telecom has 60 days to discontinue its us services this news alone was enough to send us listed chinese tech stocks to go down sharply china telecom america s spokesperson responded by saying that fcc s decision was disappointing and that it would pursue all available options china telecom is known to provide services to chinese government facilities in the us the fcc had warned previously that it may shut down us operations of three state controlled chinese telecommunications companies based on the risks assessed and raised by us security agencies the firms in question were china telecom americas china unicom americas pacific networks corp and its wholly owned subsidiary comnet usa llc just two months back a senator from the philippines accused china telecom of espionage china telecom had recently bought shares in dito telco which according to the senator was undertaken deliberately to conduct espionage within the country reported the hk post last year the fcc designated huawei technologies and zte corp as national security threats to communications networks a declaration that stopped us firms from tapping into a usd 8 3 billion government fund to purchase equipment from these companies ani
many facebook employees felt their own company helped instigate and organize the mob that stormed the u s capitol on jan 6 haven t we had enough time to figure out how to manage discourse without enabling violence one worker wrote afterward we ve been fueling this fire for a long time and we shouldn t be surprised it s now out of control an enormous trove of internal documents leaked to the press by a former facebook employee frances haugen make the answer to that question crystal clear it is no facebook has not figured out how to encourage free speech a bedrock principle of american democracy while discouraging the use of its platform to undermine that same system many factors contributed to the poisonous polarization that erupted on jan 6 including treacherous leaders like donald trump but facebook was a prime co conspirator as haugen told congress facebook s products harm children stoke division and weaken our democracy the company s leadership knows how to make facebook and instagram safer but won t make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people congressional action is needed they cannot solve this crisis without your help the case against facebook boils down to two points one the company has been far too slow to restrict the reach of figures like trump and his toadies who use the platform to spread damaging disinformation the election was rigged vaccines are dangerous climate change is a hoax etc two facebook doesn t just tolerate disinformation the company employs powerful and secret algorithms to amplify its impact by promoting posts that trigger anger and outrage these emotional reactions lead users to spend more time on facebook which in turn makes them far more valuable to advertisers that s what haugen means by putting profits before people at the core of this debate is the harm principle articulated by the 19th century british philosopher john stuart mill the nonprofit ethics centre defines it this way the harm principle says people should be free to act however they wish unless their actions cause harm to somebody else the harm done by facebook abusers is obvious disinformation about vaccines for example can cost countless lives therefore limiting how those abusers are free to act is certainly justified but here s the problem who gets to define harm what standards are used in reaching that judgment and how is that definition applied to real life situations none of the answers are easy but they are critical to the functioning of a healthy democracy overly harsh restrictions on free speech can be even more detrimental than overly timid ones so what are the options platforms like facebook could regulate themselves but as haugen notes her former employer has largely failed to do that the profit motive is simply too powerful and in fact the company s maximum leader mark zuckerberg who controls more than half of facebook s stock largely agrees with her facebook hosts nearly 3 billion monthly users and zuckerberg has often said that he and his brainchild should not be the arbiters of truth amen to that every day we make decisions about what speech is harmful what constitutes political advertising and how to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks he has written but if we were starting from scratch we wouldn t ask companies to make these judgments alone i believe we need a more active role for governments and regulators but is that really the answer call me old fashioned but i kind of like the first amendment which says pretty bluntly congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech there oughta be a law is not always the right answer to a public policy crisis in fact it often is not should the partisan politicians who run the government have the power to define what counts as harmful speech and therefore dilute it one promising third option is the oversight board created by facebook a panel of 20 independent experts who are empowered to make critical decisions for zuckerberg co but that concept has flaws too the board recently issued a report accusing facebook of not being fully forthcoming about its policies toward prominent platform users another reasonable alternative legislation that would force facebook to be far more transparent about the algorithms it employs which can spread so many toxic falsehoods so quickly as policymakers grapple with how to apply mill s harm principle to the digital space they should remember another version of that idea contained in an adage often preached to young doctors first do no harm photos remembering waterloo s sloane wallace stadium sloane wallace stadium 1 sloane wallace stadium 2 sloane wallace stadium 3 sloane wallace stadium 4 sloane wallace stadium 5 sloane wallace stadium 6 sloane wallace stadium 7 sloane wallace stadium 8 sloane wallace demolition 4 bringing down the house sloane wallace demolition 6 sloane wallace demolition 3 sloane wallace demolition 2 sloane wallace demolition 1

bolsonaro keeps domestic agenda in mind while in rome for g20 summit 31st sunday october 2021 08 27 utc full article it is up to the g20 to make additional efforts to produce vaccines said bolsonaro who will not take any of them brazil s president jair bolsonaro was harshly critical saturday of the recent brazilian stock exchange movements and said he had a plan b in case the lower house does not agree on budget proposals recently put forward by the executive i am a parachutist i always have a spare parachute with me he declared those who reason and have intelligence always have a plan b he added without specifying what his alternative was bolsonaro made those remarks in front of the brazilian embassy in rome where he is attending the g20 summit the head of state was referring to budget adjustments put forward by his administration to increase subsisides and social aid to families and groups who have lost their sources of income due to restrictivbe measures imposed as a result of the covid 19 pandemic but voting on these issues has been postponed time and again by the legislature even if it manages to get through the house of deputies it is unclear whether the budget bill would make it through the senate hence bolsonaro s need for an alternative plan brazil did its homework spared no effort to assist those most in need bolsonaro told his g20 colleagues and now the goal is to invest in the recovery of the economy the president insisted investors needed to understand that if the country is bad they will be bad too also at the g20 bolsonaro called on world leaders for additional efforts in the production of covid 19 vaccines although he insisted he would not be taking any drug he has also been accused of spreading fake news about the disease and its possible treatments for brazil the efforts of the g20 should be focused on combating the current pandemic which continues to devastate many countries we believe therefore that it is up to the g20 to make additional efforts to produce vaccines medicines and treatments in developing countries bolsonaro pointed out however bolsonaro has since the beginning of the pandemic criticized covid 19 vaccination in addition to promoting large gatherings rejecting the use of face masks and recommending drugs not endorsed by the world health organization to treat the disease also saturday bolsonaro held an informal talk with turkey s president recep tayyip erdogan during which the south american leader claimed he had a very large popular support back at his home country which as brazilian media were quick to point out did not match recent opinion polls bolsonaro also told erdogan through a translator that the state run oil company petrobras was a problem he also pointed out he was under permanent attack from the press and underlined that his country s economy was coming back pretty strong according to a poderdata opinion poll released last week rejection of the bolsonaro government is at 58 while datafolha rated it at 53 in september in both polls support for bolsonaro is only 20 of the population
source bigstock the week s most fleeting cheating and trick or treating headlines gay bash gay bashed blacks and gays come across as two southern gentlemen slapping each other in the face with dueling gloves for all eternity even after last week s failed tranny walkout lgbtblts are continuing to pressure netflix to renounce and remove dave chappelle s stand up special because of the comedian s transphobic jokes not sure why it s a phobia to say men aren t women sound more like a fact even though the manwomen at netflix have so far failed to get chappelle s special removed from the streaming service high profile gays like george i miss the communal bathrooms in tule lake takei and poet saeed jones author of ode to a grecian glory hole are working hard to promote boycotts of netflix because you have offended mah honor sah slap gays slap blacks at the same time however blacks have successfully torpedoed the boston pride parade one of the oldest gay pride events in the country what was supposed to be boston pride s 50th anniversary has turned into boston pride s epitaph not only has the parade been called off but last week the entire boston pride organization disbanded willingly of its own accord because black protesters convinced the leadership that boston pride was too white too lgb but not enough t too bourgeois and too welcoming of gays who don t think police should be defunded the tolerance parade was too tolerant so in the name of tolerance the tolerant leaders declared the parade intolerant in order to create more tolerance figure that one out in the end the boston pride leaders simply grew tired of blm protesters blockading the parade route as has happened every time over the past six years so they surrendered no more parade ever blacks slap gays it s like watching the three stooges if curly were a ghetto thug and moe was transitioning to monique it s the great pumpkin surly browns and on the topic of canceled parades blacks followed up their victory over the beantown buggerers by quashing some squash benjamin franklin day elementary school in seattle always took pride in its annual halloween pumpkin parade children marching with pumpkins while parents take photos and think what a magic moment as the kids wonder when they ll get to the part where they eat candy alas the parade has now been ended for good because school admins decided that the event was racist the exact quote from school officials the parade marginalizes students of color who do not celebrate the holiday admins claimed that students of color specifically african american males have requested to be isolated on campus while the event took place the administrators seem to be saying that black boys are skeered o pumpkins we can t let black males see pumpkins because they faint from shock yeah that s way more racist than a parade and unfounded too the school offered no evidence that a single black male student skedaddled stepin fetchit style upon viewing a jack o lantern this is yet another example of the inversion of 1980s dynamics during the period of the born agains and televangelists it was the evangelicals who protested halloween events and school administrators resisted because halloween is fun for kids and always has been but now woke leftists cancel halloween events in the name of blacks who are likely not complaining in the first place especially not when free candy is involved woke leftists cancel halloween events in the name of blacks who are likely not complaining in the first place if this catches on pumpkins might join the ranks of nooses and confederate flags as things that warrant a hate crime charge if displayed publicly poor linus formerly mocked for his misplaced faith now prosecuted as a genocidal kkk insurrectionist soros you magnificent mile bastard certain things in life defy rational explanation ufos paranormal sightings and of course dane cook s former popularity but the most fascinating unexplained mystery of the moment is the great shoplifting epidemic why are once glorious shopping districts now plagued by rampant robberies to the extent that stores are choosing to shutter due to massive stock losses as an example there s chicago s magnificent mile once known as the crown jewel of american retail the magnificent mile is now the maaaaaan ificent mile beset by smash and grab shoplifting attacks and muggings of shoppers what used to be a draw for tourists is now an ugly pastiche of vacant boarded up storefronts and for sale signs anchor stores like macy s and disney have fled the latter realizing that diversity might be fine in movies but when it comes to neighborhoods hi ho hi ho it s off to the suburbs we go last week the chicago pd or what s left of it after defunding issued a warning to stay away from the magnificent mile due to the roving bands of extras from death wish when asked by cbs chicago if the fleeing businesses are ever likely to return robb karr of the illinois retail merchant s association did his best impression of the falconer from the simpsons according to cbs with the fancy shoppes on the formerly magnificent mile emptied and shuttered the thugs are now targeting 7 elevens slim jims the consolation prize for looters who missed out on the good stuff of course the mystery remains what s causing this shoplifting epidemic cbs is outta answers could it be soros funded das who refuse to prosecute property crimes combined with politicians who defund cops naw that s pure superstition it s likely alien pod people or demon possession because the most convoluted explanation is usually the best one that s george soros fock em s razor and it s chicago canon the bruthas gib nobody likes being in chicago but let s hold our noses and stay for one more story the city s mayor sentient halloween prop lori lightfoot has proposed a monthly guaranteed universal basic income program for the city s poor under her scheme the huddled masses yearning to thieve free will receive 500 a month which coupled with all those slim jims ain t too bad a deal now you d think the chicago city council s powerful black caucus would be jumping the broom for joy over the proposal but no funny enough while the council s whites and jews are totally on board the black caucus is the primary force opposing the free cash giveaway what gives did the black caucus members get hit on the head by a crate of thomas sowell books are they being blackmailed by candace owens for that one night of indiscretion in burnham park nope the council s blacks are opposing the universal basic income scheme because it s universal it s income based not race based and the caucus members don t want none of that free green going to no beaners jason ervin chairman of the black caucus told a local black newspaper that until the city makes a deal on reparations for the descendants of enslaved people there s no way in hell we can support direct payments to anybody else so git yo salvadoran ass back to salvadoria pedro illinois might ve never been part of the confederacy it might ve never been a slave state but damned if illinois taxpayers are gonna pay for the income of some lettuce picker before they pay for the descendants of people who were enslaved in states that are pretty damn far from illinois and besides what s 500 a month anyway most of the black caucus members constituents make double that from stolen slim jims slurpees and take a penny trays hbcu more like hbpee yew black americans never seem to catch a break they finally find a safe space from whitey only to be persecuted by blighty howard university is what s known as an hbcu historically black college and university although considering the role of hbcus in procuring victims for a certain celebrity rapist it could also stand for helping bill cosby unload intended as a haven for black scholars howard has sadly become a haven for something much worse mold mice cockroaches bedbugs and other vermin it s howard u s good times experience all the fun of living in a 1970s sitcom dilapidated housing project dyn o mites to protest the unlivable conditions in student dorms 150 howard attendees have taken over the blackburn student center occupying the building as their new sleeping quarters jeez one wonders why these black students saw property appropriation as their best recourse where could they have possibly absorbed such a message but surely the school admins will admire this act of civil disobedience right surely they ll cheer the aggrieved youngsters for taking up space and being heard because their lives matter nope the administration has shut off water air and wi fi to the occupied building and last week the university s president released a statement ordering the young freedom fighters out or else there may be areas where we agree to disagree that s the nature of a vibrant community however there is a distinct difference between peaceful protest and freedom of expression and the occupation of a university building that impedes operations and access to essential services and creates health and safety risks

why this governor s race is shaping up as a referendum on the biden presidency scott knuth was dwarfed by the 16ft x 10ft flag that he waved to and fro on a street corner in arlington virginia trump won it falsely proclaimed save america but donald trump was not coming to town instead his successor joe biden was about to take the stage in a campaign rally at a dangerous inflection point in his young presidency related biden s agenda remains unrealized as democrats fail to close deal again advertisement advertisement biden was speaking on behalf of democrat terry mcauliffe who this tuesday takes on republican glenn youngkin to become governor of virginia but he was keenly aware that the race will represent the first referendum on his white house tenure and a potential preview of next year s crucial midterm elections for congress the virginia contest also takes place against the backdrop of biden s ambitious would be historic legislative agenda stalling in washington as his democratic party goes to bitter war with itself over a huge social and environmental spending bill the president reportedly told democratic members of congress on thursday i don t think it s hyperbole to say that the house and senate majorities and my presidency will be determined by what happens in the next week with his approval rating sagging after a coronavirus surge and chaotic retreat from afghanistan biden is badly in need of a win or two failure in virginia where no democrat has lost a statewide election for 12 years and continued paralysis on capitol hill would represent a crushing double blow advertisement advertisement protesting outside last tuesday s mcauliffe rally in arlington trump supporters were eager for signs of weakness and confident of a republican fightback carrie johnson 45 a merchandiser clutching a stars and stripes flag said the biden presidency has been an absolute dumpster fire our borders are wide open inflation is running wild he s trying to strip us of our freedoms his approval rating is falling by the day if the mcauliffe campaign has one message in this race it is that the republican candidate glenn youngkin for all his his fleece jacket suburban dad demeanor is a mini trump and therefore anathema to the most liberal state in the south photograph anna moneymaker getty images about 2 500 people attended the rally according to the white house far fewer than a typical trump event supporters of mcauliffe 64 were aware that the closely and bitterly contested race has national implications advertisement advertisement lisa soronen 46 a lawyer who brought with her eight year old daughter sasha despite the evening chill said if mcauliffe loses it will be seen as a victory for donald trump whether it is or not a lot can happen between now and the midterms but this is seen as the bellwether evidently aware of this biden used an 18 minute speech to directly compare his record against that of his predecessor on coronavirus vaccinations the stock market and jobs growth then he sought to tie trump to youngkin a 54 year old businessman and political neophyte terry s opponent has made all of his private pledges of loyalty to donald trump biden told the crowd but what s really interesting to me he won t stand next to donald trump now that the campaign is on think about it he won t allow donald trump to campaign for him in this state and he s willing to pledge his loyalty to trump in private why not in public what s he trying to hide is there a problem with trump being here is he embarrassed indeed if the mcauliffe campaign has one message in this race it is that youngkin for all his his fleece jacket suburban dad demeanor is a mini trump and therefore anathema to the most liberal state in the south in one of the democrat s ads trump is heard endorsing the candidate then youngkin says trump represents so much of why i m running no further comment is required advertisement advertisement republicans insist the effort is doomed patti hidalgo menders president of the loudoun county republican women s club in ashburn said donald trump is no longer in office i think that s a lost cause for mcauliffe for his part youngkin has relentlessly pushed a culture wars message that virginia s schools are under existential threat from critical race theory the fact that critical race theory an analytic framework through which academics discern the ways that racial disparities are reproduced by the law is not taught in virginia does not seem to matter to him one youngkin ad features a mother who once sought to ban beloved a classic novel by the african american author toni morrison from classrooms her effort led to state legislation that would have let parents opt out of their children studying classroom materials with sexually explicit content it was vetoed by mcauliffe when he was governor democrats seized on the issue to accuse youngkin of trying to ban books and silence black authors terry mcauliffe is attempting to whip up enthusiasm among an election weary electorate including by drawing on the star power of barack obama photograph win mcnamee getty images what these very different campaign pitches have in common is a laser focus on the suburbs where trump fared poorly against biden in last year s presidential election but where parental anxiety over school curriculums and virus precautions is seen as ripe for exploitation both parties are monitoring closely which message will prevail as they prepare to campaign for the november 2022 midterms advertisement advertisement the virginia election may well be won and lost in the suburbs of the state capital richmond once the seat of the slave owning confederacy where a statue of gen robert e lee was last month removed after 131 years yard signs for both mcauliffe and youngkin are visible in the suburb of short pump which has a lively shopping mall well regarded restaurants and excellent government schools resident beth o hara 46 a lawyer said i think the suburbs are really going to make the difference and there are people i know who really distrusted trump and did not vote for his re election but are planning to vote for youngkin that tells me people view him in a much more moderate way but o hara will vote for mcauliffe it s difficult for me to imagine after some progress over the last couple of years in virginia going back to a place where we have a republican governor who has at least suggested further restrictions of abortion i m kind of done seeing us backslide on that particular issue seventy miles away is charlottesville where a white supremacist march in 2017 galvanised biden to run for president in what he called a battle for the soul of the nation now charlottesville will render its own verdict mcauliffe has acknowledged that biden s dip in the polls and democrats inertia in washington could hurt his campaign advertisement advertisement larry sabato director of the center for politics at the university of virginia in charlottesville said this is going to be a test case that republicans will use in 2022 whether youngkin wins or not because it s clearly going to be close the fact that he could turn a 10 biden state with biden s help and the congressional democrats help into a close contest tells you that some of the social and cultural issues however outrageous they are are working sabato added critical race theory doesn t even exist in this state we don t teach it i just can t tell you how many people come up to me in stores and gas stations and so on and say why are we teaching this race thing i tell them it s not taught they say well that can t be because i heard mr youngkin talk about it he talks about it every day about 10 times you can create an issue out of nothing democratic voters in charlottesville are appalled by youngkin s reversion to dog whistle politics in a state that has been trending democratic in recent years with strict gun laws loose abortion restrictions protections for lgbtq people the abolition of the death penalty and the legalisation of marijuana for adult recreational use andrea douglas executive director of the jefferson school african american heritage center said if virginia becomes a republican state all of the work that we have done over the course of the last few years in charlottesville and just generally trying to move virginia towards being a progressive state all of that will be turned back advertisement advertisement seeing the kind of work that has been done in the state to re engage our students with african american history in the face of critical race theory backlash the last thing we need is a republican governor from the perspective of not just being a person of color but being a woman of color he is a dangerous dangerous person his positions on abortion his positions on education youngkin has been walking a political tightrope seeking to play down his links to trump in democratic held cities while embracing the former president in his old strongholds in the hope of reactivating his base of support glenn youngkin has sought to exploit anxieties of suburban voters about education repeatedly raising critical race theory even though it is not taught in virginia photograph anna moneymaker getty images meanwhile mcauliffe has rallied with vice president kamala harris and former president barack obama in an attempt to whip up enthusiasm in an election weary electorate one of the biggest challenges facing democrats is apathy from young voters and voters of color disenchanted by biden s failure to deliver on promises on the climate crisis immigration reform racial justice in policing and voting rights advertisement advertisement there is also frustration over his stalled legislative agenda this week biden announced a pared down social and environmental spending package worth 1 75tn which was half his original proposal and dropped paid family leave lower prescription drug prices and free community college as the president flew off to europe for cop26 and meetings with boris johnson and other world leaders it remained unclear whether progressives in the house or the conservative democratic senators joe manchin and kyrsten sinema would explicitly back the new framework this could leave biden in a damaging limbo with republicans likely to claim a moral victory even if they narrowly lose virginia paving the way for success in the midterms and then for another trump presidential run in 2024 democrat juli briskman a district supervisor in loudon county who is campaigning for mcauliffe said if we don t win unfortunately that will give the right their playbook because they have been trying hard to confuse parents and confuse voters with false narratives over our school system and false narratives over our voting system if those false narratives succeed then that gives them a playbook for the 22 and 24 elections she warned we are the testing ground we are the proving ground and we just simply have to hold the line view comments
the uk presidency has set a target for the meeting to consign coal to history and has been pushing for the goal at g 7 and g 20 meetings this year with mixed success so far but coal is still a massive part of the energy mix and the recent surge in energy prices has forced countries into even greater reliance on the fuel china is ordering miners to dig up as much as they can and in the us a key lawmaker from coal rich west virginia is getting in the way of biden s plans the signs from the g 20 suggest sharma s target may be out of reach

by tim kelly and ju min park tokyo reuters an unprecedented election pledge by japan s ruling party to double defence spending underscores the nation s haste to acquire missiles stealth fighters drones and other weapons to deter china s military in the disputed east china sea the liberal democratic party ldp included a goal of spending 2 of gdp about 100 billion or more on the military for the first time in its policy platform ahead of a national election this month experts don t expect new prime minister fumio kishida to double spending anytime soon given japan s debt saddled public finances and a pandemic stricken economy but it is a sign that the pacifist nation could over time abandon a commitment to keep military budgets within 1 of gdp a number that for decades has eased concern at home and abroad about any revival of the militarism that led japan into world war two ldp conservative leaders want the party to give it up said yoichiro sato an international relations professor at ritsumeikan asia pacific university referring to the de facto spending cap which he called sacrosanct for japanese liberals they are setting the direction that is what conservatives want to do he added the united states has been pushing key allies to spend more on defence an increase to 2 of gdp would put japan in line with pledges by north atlantic treaty organization nato members the hawkish notes from the ldp come as japanese public sentiment shifts away from concerns about rearming to growing alarm over china s military assertiveness in asia particularly toward taiwan in a survey of 1 696 people conducted by the business daily at the end of last year 86 of respondents said china posed a threat to japan more than the 82 who expressed concern about nuclear armed north korea putting this in the manifesto is a recognition of the need to garner public support for required defence policy changes said robert ward a london based researcher at the international institute for strategic studies the direction of travel is now set southwest theatre japan s military strategy is focused on defending territory along the edge of the east china sea where tokyo is locked in a dispute with beijing over a group of uninhabited islands the okinawan chain taiwan and islands stretching down through the philippines form what military planners dub the first island chain a natural barrier to chinese operations in the western pacific with an additional 50 billion a year japan could buy more american equipment including f 35 stealth fighters osprey tilt rotor utility aircraft and surveillance drones as well as domestically made equipment such as amphibious landing craft compact warships aircraft carriers submarines satellites and communications gear to fight a protracted war the self defence force is well trained and well equipped but its sustainability and resilience is one of the most serious problems former maritime self defense force admiral and fleet commander yoji koda told reuters japan s defence ministry also wants money for an indigenous stealth fighter and missiles that can strike enemy ships and land bases more than 1 000 kilometres 621 miles away the country is also building up cyber space and electromagnetic warfare capabilities japan wants to acquire very sophisticated capabilities in a variety of areas thomas reich the country manager for bae systems otc plc said during a briefing on tuesday what s in the budget and where it s going are the things that really attract us britain s biggest defence company is part of the consortium led by lockheed martin corp nyse that builds the f 35 fighter carrying abe s torch the speed at which once dovish kishida has fallen in line with the national security agenda of conservatives has surprised some observers but he is carrying on policies pursued by former prime minister shinzo abe and supported by conservative lawmakers who helped him win the party leadership election last month by pursuing a policy of similar small steps abe enacted security laws to allow japanese troops to fight on foreign soil ended a ban on military exports and reinterpreted the country s war renouncing constitution to allow missile strikes on enemy territory for now however the ldp defence spending pledge does not say how any extra money would be spent or indicate when the 2 goal would be reached the real question is whether japan can absorb another 50 billion in a way that measurably improves japan s defence said chuck jones a former defence industry executive familiar with japan s military policy the concern is that large sums will be wasted on programs and projects doomed to failure or irrelevance the lack of detail gives the ruling group room to alter course analysts say there is opposition even inside the ldp said tetsuo kotani a senior research fellow at the japan institute of international affairs we are going to have an election and we will see if the general public supports the ldp s proposal
hong kong october 31 ani amid national security concerns the us revoked china telecom s licence to counter possible infiltration of its key networks by chinese companies the decision was made by the us federal communications commission fcc and it comes at an important time shortly after us president joe biden and his chinese counterpart xi jinping vowed to rebuild communication channels after years of rising tensions it is clear that even the current administration is not helping china anymore reported the hk post according to the fcc china telecom is subject to control influence and exploitation by the chinese communist party ccp government and it is highly likely that it will be forced to comply with the chinese government s illegal requests to acquire data this could be a huge security concern for the us with china s 2017 national security law in place us actions can only be said to be justified reported the hk post this law was passed on june 27 2017 and it came into effect the very next day on june 28 2017 it gives the communist party of china sweeping powers to control and mine data from companies under its purview most of which have an international presence the regulator further said that ownership and control of the said entity by the chinese government raises significant national security and law enforcement risks by providing opportunities for the company and the chinese government to access store disrupt or even misroute us communications continuing to give china telecom access to usa s market would be equal to inviting espionage china is known to steal trade secrets and other confidential business information reported the hk post in fact the fcc also added that china telecom america s conduct with it and other us government agencies also demonstrated a lack of trustworthiness and reliability even the department of justice had said that china telecom made inaccurate statements about where us records were stored reported the hk post with its licence revoked china telecom has 60 days to discontinue its us services this news alone was enough to send us listed chinese tech stocks to go down sharply china telecom america s spokesperson responded by saying that fcc s decision was disappointing and that it would pursue all available options china telecom is known to provide services to chinese government facilities in the us the fcc had warned previously that it may shut down us operations of three state controlled chinese telecommunications companies based on the risks assessed and raised by us security agencies the firms in question were china telecom americas china unicom americas pacific networks corp and its wholly owned subsidiary comnet usa llc just two months back a senator from the philippines accused china telecom of espionage china telecom had recently bought shares in dito telco which according to the senator was undertaken deliberately to conduct espionage within the country reported the hk post last year the fcc designated huawei technologies and zte corp as national security threats to communications networks a declaration that stopped us firms from tapping into a usd 8 3 billion government fund to purchase equipment from these companies ani
