on june 8 the canadian dollar was worth us 80 today it s worth just 73 cents that s a nine per cent decline in just three months the reason is clear the federal reserve us central bankers have taken the bit between their teeth and launched a to the death fight with inflation they have told the world that they will not stop raising interest rates until something is broken that message is really for americans to get them to understand that unemployment has to go up the fact that something may break outside of the united states is only in their peripheral vision believe it or not the canadian dollar is the best performing g10 currency against the us dollar its decline is despite a better performing economy a current account surplus the best terms of trade on record and our own bank of canada s determination to vanquish inflation the british pound is at all time lows against the greenback as is the euro both china and japan have intervened in foreign exchange markets to keep their currencies from falling further everything including gold is falling in value against the mighty us dollar this makes everyone s economic situation worse for canadians it means it s harder to fight inflation everything we buy from america is more expensive snowbirds who customarily go south for the winter are going to find it much more expensive if they have not yet exchanged their loonies for greenbacks the bank of canada and the us fed are now a tag team in the race to slay the inflation dragon next rate hikes canada october 26 us november 2 after that canada december 7 us december 14 and so it goes for the european union the world s third largest economy after the us and china the problems are a little more intense the eu is made up of more than two dozen countries with varying degrees of economic health germany with the strongest economy and most influential has been instrumental in keeping eu interest rates low so that weaker counties in europe s south such as italy france spain and portugal could finance their debts and deficits but soaring bills for electricity fuel and gas have weakened businesses and individuals spending power and sent inflation to eight per cent or more with the euro at a 20 year low against the us dollar the european central bank has been forced to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade the impossible dilemma is that rising rates make borrowing costs disproportionately higher for the weaker countries as investors demand a bigger premium to hold their debt and it is constitutionally verboten for germany to guarantee their debts this has been causing chaos across the eu and warnings about possible country bankruptcies the situation is most ominous in italy where the september 25 election results are the culmination of excessive debt political instability a declining standard of living widespread voter disillusionment and questions about italy s future within the european union it won t be known for a while whether giorgia meloni the hard right leader of a party descended from post fascist roots will form a stable government she campaigned against gay rights european bureaucrats and illegal migrants ms meloni if she is named prime minister by the president of the republic would also make history as the first woman to lead italy there is a lot at stake the future direction of italy the stability of the eu itself and the counter reaction of the us fed and bank of canada when what s in their peripheral vision comes into central focus between now and then strap in for a bumpy ride in both the stock market and the economy dian cohen c m o m economist cohendian560 gmail com subscribe now for full story and others
scientists have discovered a bat in russia carrying a virus that is similar covid 19 washington state university researchers have been studying it pullman wash researchers at washington state university are raising concerns over the discovery of a virus with some of the same characteristics as covid 19 at the same time they hope that the discovery will lead to more progress in vaccine prevention the covid 19 pandemic has done an astronomical amount of damage blamed for more than 6 5 million deaths and counting worldwide while the pandemic is not over it has slowed this year meanwhile researchers are learning more and more about the virus that causes covid 19 there s a focus on finding and studying similar viruses in asia and beyond the good news according to wsu virologist and assistant professor michael letko most of the viruses found outside of asia don t have the ability to use the human receptors or use the human cells letko said this means humans are not currently in danger from them but he and his colleagues have studied two viruses found in russian bats and one of them does raise some red flags the researcher said this virus has some of the same properties as covid 19 and can infect human cells and it has proven to be resistant to current covid 19 vaccines but that alone is not conclusive so we re not necessarily worried about this virus transmitting over to people there are so many factors we don t particularly know what kind of animals these bats are in contact with how prevalent this type of virus is in these animals said letko that said letko believes it is important that researchers continue to investigate to help develop more tools for prevention that may be needed the big take home is we know these viruses now exist and we can now use this information to try to make vaccines and actually there are already groups working to include viruses like this in the vaccines the study authored by letko and others can be found in the journal plos pathogens

africa the organization for economic co operation and development oecd africa50 the united nations development programme undp the us international development finance agency international monetary fund imf world bank and world leading universities so also was the choice of senior director africa investment forum aif afdb chinelo anohu as the keynote speaker according to the moderator monde muyangwa former wilson centre s africa programme director anohu has a long track record in formulating investment strategies and brings extensive knowledge of institutional investment practice and experience in attracting new capital expertise in the development of innovative asset classes spanning pension funds swfs private equity and private family wealth fund monde now assistant administrator africa united states agency for international development usaid recalled that anohu had served as the dg of the national pension commission of nigeria for five years before joining the afdb and played a pivotal role in the reform of nigeria s pension industry including the enactment of the nigerian pension reform act of 2004 which established the national pension commission and introduced the contributory pension scheme she also championed a further reform of the industry ten years after culminating in the pension reform act 2014 why the focus on african swfs underscoring the essence of the high level meeting president and ceo of wilson centre ambassador mark greene said the covid 19 pandemic and the russo ukrainian war had caused economic challenges that have negatively affected development and the wellbeing of the citizens in africa and around he world therefore this is a crucial moment for all to think about how to pursue the opportunities including those in swfs that will take africa and the world through these challenges as government owned investment funds swfs serve as critical tools for stabilising economy promoting development and transferring wealth to future generations in 2021 swfs managed 9 1 trillion representing 10 per cent of global gross domestic product gdp this high level meeting will seek to reflect on and share lessons learnt about the impact of global turbulence on the government and performance of these swfs in africa how can swfs adapt to these changing times and what roles can they play in stabilizing economies in creating vibrant economic growth that is so key to the continent s future it will show lessons on achieving profitability while also promoting social responsibility in environmental sustainability it will explore strategic avenues for facilitating and expanding intra african and international partnerships to strengthen the role of swfs in the international financial system and how multilateral organisations can best support swfs he stated founder and executive chairman of brown capital management mr eddie brown regretted that africa does not nearly get the attention it deserves and too often that attention is focused on its challenges not on its opportunities he said the spotlight on swfs was to provide a forum where key stakeholders could gather to share experiences collaborate to advance swfs agendas africa s swfs landscape the first sovereign wealth fund in africa was established by botwana in 1994 since then 22 other african nations have established swfs while more nations are considering or in the process of establishing one according to the market and consumer data firm statista asia topped the swf table as of july 2022 with 4 97 trillion asset under management aum middle east and north africa came second with 3 91 trillion europe came third with 1 67 trillion oceania came fourth with 418 billion north america came fifth with 337 billion while sub saharan africa and latin america came a distant sixth and seventh with paltry 55 billion and 27 billion respectively even in the middle east and north africa regional mapping only libya has a substantial aum of 66 billion going by the global sovereign wealth fund data of the 17 individual nations with the largest swfs 15 are major oil and gas exporters regrettably nigeria for instance can only boast of a marginal 3 billion in the nigeria sovereign investment authority nsia despite the high oil prices in the international market on the contrary norway which exports 1 2million barrels of oil per day has over 1 3 trillion in savings in her government pension fund global also known as the oil fund saudi arabia boasts of about 1 trillion in savings ditto the uae others are kuwait 738 billion qatar 450 billion russia 191 billion kazakhstan 133 billion iran 91 billion brunel 60 billion and azerbaijan 42 billion need to tap domestic swfs the keynote speaker chinelo anohu called for stronger strategic partnerships and greater involvement of african swfs build the continent s economies back and better following the covid 19 pandemic according to her the pandemic has had unequalled and debilitating effects on growth prospects across africa further exposing the weaknesses of africa s physical and social infrastructure and the fragility of its largely poor population especially the youth and women 40 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty in sub saharan africa alone while two decades of development gains in achieving the sdgs have been eroded thus in the face of the current low investments rate elevated debt levels and risks in the continent and increased cost of borrowing due to rising inflation in the world s major economies local institutional investors particularly the swfs are needed more than ever to channel both longer term domestic savings and resources to productive uses which can help drive more sustainable macro economic growth since the coronavirus pandemic struck swfs have increasingly focused on investing at home according to the data from the international forum of sovereign wealth funds in 2020 swf funds brought about 12 7 billion in new investments directly into companies and projects in their domestic economies more than triple the amount made in 2019 in africa this trend of looking inward for swf investment brings new opportunities for financing critical infrastructure and human capital projects further development and appropriate regulation of local swfs can potentially enable these financial institutions to evolve and become important sources of longer term finance including for infrastructure financing africa s ambitious development agenda calls for an enhanced role for african swfs as strategic investors who will support the rise of local and regional financial markets the financing of the large scale regional projects and the industrialization agenda of the continent she stated she however lamented that african swfs were being held back by several factors swfs are often held back from investing optimally in infrastructure and other critical asset classes this is partly due to the fact that their mandates are not fully aligned with innovative structures that have emerged and they may lack the familiarity and skills needed to identify and evaluate quality projects she observed aif bridging the gap however as a multi stakeholder multi disciplinary platform anohu assures that the aif an initiative of the dr akinwumi adesina led afdb and their founding partners africa 50 africa finance corporation afreximbank development bank of southern africa european investment bank islamic development bank and trade and development bank stands ready to fill the gap she said that aif s ability to leverage the convening power of the afdb and other founding partners and the ability to crowd in public and private sector financing for transformative projects with developmental impact puts it in a vantage position to help african swfs gain volume traction and impact during the pandemic aif and its founding partners initiated a unified covid 19 response under which 13 projects across 5 relevant sectors these projects have a collective value of 3 68 billion and each will help advance africa s self sufficiency and resilience against future shocks aif has curated over 300 deals screened 188 deals valued at approximately 170 billion and attracted investment interest for about 116 6 billion in this year s aif virtual boardrooms alone 136 originated deals were screened while 41 deals valued at 57 8 billion were successfully curated for the boardroom presentation these deals have drawn 32 8 billion in confirmed investment interests for co investment opportunities the aif presently offers projects across 32 african countries spanning all critical sectors besides return on investment the aif emphasises projects that result in the biggest developmental impacts ensuring that the investments do not only benefit the investors but also the end users from our 2021 boardroom deals alone around 3 8 million jobs are expected to be created both direct and indirect with a million jobs specifically targeting women and women entrepreneurs aif also provides international investors a safe entry point for their in africa investment despite evidence of strong economic growth on the continent investing in africa is often deemed risky due to the challenging political and security environment in some markets in this regard the aif capitalises on the vast expertise provided by its seven founding partners and provides a one stop shop for global investors offering quality pre cleared projects as well as superior business intelligence to unlock bottlenecks where they exist she explained citing the 15 billion lagos abidjan highway deal which was featured in aif s march 2022 virtual boardroom meetings anohu maintained that it was necessary for african to start to promote big ticket deals by pooling together expertise and resources all said a lot can no doubt be achieved by mobilsing domestic resources such as the african swfs to catalyse and build up african economies and it is up to the africa her development partners investors and stakeholders to take action

coastal areas are under mandatory evacuation orders with county officials recommending others in low lying areas leave their homes as well on monday morning people waited for hours to fill sandbags at a city run site in south tampa a community where streets can turn into rivers after just a few hours of rain if ian pushes more water in from the coast it could cause serious damage stephanie colombini wusf public media crowds of people flocked to a sandbag filling station in south tampa on monday morning in the hopes of protecting their homes from any flooding hurricane ian may cause the surge is definitely our biggest concern storm surge said davis island resident lissie zimmerman the second grade teacher stood in line holding a glass case crawling inside was a yellow and brown critter the class pet she took home when area schools closed for the next few days this is princess sophia the leopard gecko she is evacuating with us said zimmerman who said she planned to stay with family in south florida where she thinks she ll be out of harm s way zimmerman was living on the island five years ago when hurricane irma threatened tampa but changed paths at the last minute we were lucky we got very lucky for irma so hoping for the same luck with ian she said stephanie colombini wusf public media elementary school teacher lissie zimmerman is helping her class pet a leopard gecko named princess sophia evacuate from the storm morgan molinari who lives right on tampa bay was hoping for similar fortune for irma her family evacuated to orlando and she expected to do the same this time we re used to it but this one s scaring us a little more than usual and i have a baby this time so it s a little different she said charles dunn was still figuring out where to go but said once he finished prepping his home he was going to head east possibly to orlando or west palm beach i lived in south florida for awhile so i m used to it more over there than over here he said live blog latest updates on hurricane ian across the tampa bay area it s been years since tampa had a direct hit from a hurricane and with thousands of people moving to the area each year many residents are dealing with this for the first time charles michaels moved to south tampa from los angeles earlier this year and said he had to ask a young woman in line for help with prep i said what do you do for these sort of things and she taught me how to fill a sandbag which i didn t know how to tie a sandbag and she said you know this isn t my first rodeo and i said this is my first rodeo he said michaels

residents should consider these a last resort they are not comfortable places they could be crowded and they could be noisy and you could be in a shelter for days again that could be for days she said

family in wesley chapel unless that too was deemed dangerous stack has only lived in the tampa area for about a year but is no stranger to storms she lived in mississippi when hurricane katrina hit her community in 2005 and chose not to evacuate that time to stay with her grandparents homes in stack s neighborhood suffered severe damage she said and being stuck there for days without power after

the fence about whether he would stay at his house or crash with friends who live in high rise apartments for now he was focused on getting prepared mentally just kind of meditating and stocking up on ice mostly so everything stays frozen in the fridge in case we lose power people planning to shelter in place have been clearing store shelves of water and non perishable goods gov ron desantis said

when federal reserve chairman jerome powell talked about a housing reset in june it sent shockwaves around the country because it sounded so ominous in the most recent fomc meeting held last week powell finally clarified what he meant by that term and what a housing reset means to the fed however a housing reset isn t the only pressing issue we now also have to think about a worldwide global recession to put it as simply as i can the strength of the u s dollar is causing too much pain worldwide and traditionally something breaks when this happens china is in a mess europe has an energy crisis and the wild card of russia s war in ukraine is still unresolved all while the fed is aggressively hiking rates savagely unhealthy is no longer just a term for the u s housing market it now applies to the world economy as i noted during my recent podcast on housingwire things are getting sloppy in the markets and when chaos happens you can t ever be sure how bad the damage is going to be over the weekend raphael bostic president of the federal reserve bank of atlanta said we are going to do all that we can at the federal reserve to avoid deep deep pain it s never a good thing when you have to qualify pain like that what a housing reset means let s take chairman powell s words from the fomc s q a session on sept 21 and discuss what a housing reset means powell so when i say reset i m not looking at a particular specific set of data or anything this isn t true just look at his next statement below he really wants the bidding wars to end and for total inventory to grow and regain balance i can understand this mindset as you can see below on the nar total inventory chart we didn t have a seasonal push in inventory in 2020 which left us vulnerable to price growth that was above the historical norm powell what i m really saying is that we ve had a time of a red hot housing market all over the country where famously houses were selling to the first buyer at 10 above the ask before even seeing the house as you can see powell quickly outlines precisely what he doesn t want to see massive bidding wars for housing he wants to see balance this is something i have talked about on housingwire for some time we lost balance in the housing market and an unhealthy housing market became savagely unhealthy in 2022 powell so there was a big imbalance between supply and demand and housing prices were going up at an unsustainably fast level so the deceleration in housing prices that we re seeing should help bring sort of prices more closely in line with rents and other housing market fundamentals and that s a good thing home price growth was way too hot to start the year and home prices falling is sticky unless you have a massive increase in supply and forced selling home price growth in 2022 is cooling down from 2021 levels but it will still be positive and higher than i would like to see the s p corelogic case shiller index is coming out this week this data line lags the current market but expect a cool down in price growth data here powell for the longer term what we need is supply and demand to get better aligned so that housing prices go up at a reasonable level at a reasonable pace and that people can afford houses again and i think we so we probably in the housing market have to go through a correction to get back to that place now my personal working thesis is that the housing market can functionally work once total inventory data can get between 1 52 1 93 million once we hit the top end number of 1 93 million i can remove the savagely unhealthy theme any parts of the u s already into the 2019 inventory range are already out of the savagely unhealthy housing market because they have choices while this isn t a 2022 story for national inventory levels the last report of the nar showed a decline from 1 31 million to 1 28 million levels we are still going to start 2023 in a better place with inventory than what we started 2022 in powell there are also longer run issues though with the housing market as you know we re it s difficult to find lots now close enough to cities and things like that so builders are having a hard time getting zoning and lots and workers and materials and things like that but from a sort of business cycle standpoint this difficult correction should put the housing market back into better balance this is almost useless the housing market has already gone into a recession and the builders are done building anything new until they get rid of the excess supply they already have new home sales are coming this week and the monthly supply data is too big to have any new construction being built we have 10 9 months of housing supply with 9 84 months in construction the builders will take their time finishing these homes and ensuring they sell them at a price that is useful for their business model powell i think that shelter inflation is going to remain high for some time we re looking for it to come down but it s not exactly clear when that will happen so it may take some time so i think hope for the best plan for the worst so i think on shelter inflation you ve just got to assume that it s going to remain pretty high for a while some data lines show that the growth rate is cooling off the cpi shelter inflation data will show this in 2023 not this year the fed knows this here is a clip of my take on cnbc on this subject look for shelter inflation data to cool down in 2023 that was my take on the housing reset housing correction or whatever the fed calls it next we need more supply and growth rate of pricing to cool powell also talked about the mbs market when asked whether housing market conditions might affect the fed s plans for mbs powell answered powell so we what we said as you know was that we would consider that once balance runoff is well underway i would say it s not something we re considering right now and not something i expect to be considering in the near term it s just it s something i think we will turn to but that time the time for turning to it has not come and is not close in code this means rates are already up a lot so we don t feel the need to sell mbs don t overthink this one they know they re wreaking havoc on housing and don t need rates to go much higher than they re today when rates fell back to 5 they were very upset about that some fed speakers talked about selling mbs to scare the market into higher rates i believe they re happy with where the rates are at the effect on world markets now let s consider the effect of the fed s rate hike on the world markets with the dollar getting stronger and stronger world markets are falling into chaos mode this traditionally isn t a good thing but it s the world we live in remember the fed wants higher unemployment they believe that is the most effective way to deal with inflation and the growth rate of wages with my six recession red flags up and global economies and markets in chaos i will say the fed is making sure that we do see higher unemployment here and around the world the way the world markets are reacting shows me that the fed has lost some control here which wasn t the case in the past few months will they adjust to this current reality and stay the course time will tell however for me the fed s focus is getting people unemployed as soon as possible so the data lines to track now are job openings which are still over 11 million jobless claims came in at 213 000 an extreme low historically these two data lines are what the fed is focusing on and as long as they re healthy they will continue to push the higher unemployment rate to bring down wage inflation and inflation in general this is despite the havoc created by stronger dollar around the world with the dollar getting stronger we are exporting inflation at a time when the world is also fighting inflation this is what we call a double whammy it s great for those people who want to vacation in london now however the financial markets around the world are stressed as financial conditions are getting tighter this question was asked to powell neil irwin thanks neil irwin with axios a number of commentators have come to the view including over at the world bank that simultaneous global tightening around the world is creates a risk of a global recession that s worse than is necessary to bring inflation down how do you see that risk how do you think of coordination with your fellow central bankers and is there much risk of overdoing it on a global level powell so we actually my colleagues and i a number of my fomc colleagues and i just got back from a one of our frequent trips to basel switzerland to meet with other senior central bank officials from around the world we are in pretty regular contact and we exchange of course we all serve a domestic mandate domestic objectives in our case the dual mandate maximum employment price stability but we regularly discuss what we re seeing in terms of our own economy and international spillovers and it s a very ongoing constant kind of a process so we are very aware of what s going on in other economies around the world and what that means for us and vice versa our the forecast that we put together that our staff puts together and that we put together on our own always take all of that try to take all of that into account i mean i can t say that we do it perfectly but it s not as if we don t think about the policy decisions monetary policy and otherwise the economic developments that are taking place in major economies that can have an effect on the u s economy that is very much baked into our own forecast and our own understanding of the u s economy as best we can it won t be perfect so i don t see it s hard to talk about collaboration in a world where people have very different levels of interests rates if you remember there were coordinated cuts and raises and things like that at various times but really really we re all we re in very different situations but i will tell you our contact is more or less ongoing and it s not coordination but there s a lot of information sharing and we all i think are informed by what other important economies economies that are important to the united states are doing as you can read above powell tries to assure people that the fed does talk to their counterparts all around the world and are keeping up on things after the fed s press meeting the pound collapsed to all time lows over the weekend and the markets have gotten much worse after the fed meetings if we are to hold powell to his word the fed has to be on the phone with their counterparts to see what can be done to try to calm markets down when mortgage rates fell recently from 6 25 to 5 bond yields fell and stocks rallied the federal reserve was upset about this outcome because it made financial conditions easier and gave some hope on the economy this isn t what the federal reserve wants so they pushed a campaign out to talk the markets down and get people on board that a recession is needed to cool down inflation which means higher rates for longer now that the u s housing market and other economies across the globe are feeling the pain the fed is getting its wish by pushing us closer and closer to a recession to join the world economies in a downturn

is now one of just a few large health systems in the country to offer self scheduling for primary and specialty services according to healthleaders magazine about 88 of health systems see patient self scheduling as a top access and investment priority but only about 3 currently have that capability and only a few are actually acting on those plans the magazine reported in july 2022 at ahn we know that exceptional care isn t just about providing outstanding medicine it s about breaking down barriers to care and providing better access and an easier experience for our patients said deborah duffy senior vice president virtual health and access for ahn online self scheduling eliminates a lot of the hassle involved in making a doctor s appointment in other words less time on the phone with call centers or reception desks when patients visit ahn org s find care portal findcare ahn org and search for a primary care provider or a specialist the search will return a list of providers many of those provider bios now feature a make an appointment button beside the provider s name by clicking on the make an appointment button patients will be taken to the provider s online scheduling tool which shows the provider s short term availability and next available appointment from there the online booking tool directs the patients to a decision tree and asks them a series of questions reason for visit date of birth and a few others related to insurance coverage and then asks them to select an available appointment window lastly the tool asks the patient to confirm the appointment the technology interacts seamlessly with ahn s mychart patient portal after the appointment is confirmed through the find care tool the patient receives an immediate mychart notification patients are telling us they want more autonomy and more tools like these duffy said as a network we are committed to delivering consumer friendly technologies that allow patients to access health care on their own terms caregivers are enthusiastic about ahn s new self scheduling option historically physician practices have been resistant to giving up control of their appointment books but at ahn practices have collaborated with the network s access and it teams every step of the way on this and other access improvement initiatives our physicians understand that providing world class medicine is only one part of the care equation said donald whiting md chief medical officer for ahn ensuring convenient access to our providers allows patients to more easily take advantage of the many medical services that we offer our new self scheduling technology is a game changer for both patients and caregivers ahn has partnered with docasap a leading patient access and engagement platform to

minister for foreign affairs of syria fayssal mekdad addresses the 77th session of the united nations general assembly ap published tue 27 sep 2022 2 02 am some of the west s fiercest critics made their cases in the closing hours of the un general assembly meeting of world leaders as syria and north korea on monday accused the united states and its allies of trying to impose their will on the world syria s top diplomat called for a us led military coalition to get out of his country a north korean ambassador said his nation wouldn t yield to un demands to give up its nuclear weapons programme and both condemned sanctions against their countries if the messages weren t exactly new they carried the extra weight of a once a year chance to speak from the same famous podium as the leaders of other nations including their adversaries us president joe biden addressed the assembly last week making no direct mention of syria but briefly complaining that north korea continues to blatantly violate un sanctions over its nuclear activities north korean un ambassador kim song retorted on monday that biden picked on us and kim shrugged off his message to put it clearly we have never recognised such resolutions of the united nations that impose pressure because north korea views them as us aims given an international imprimatur kim said we will not recognise them in the future either he added he said relations were potentially heading into a much more dangerous phase potentially the shakiest since world war ii because of the high handedness and arbitrariness of some countries that he said were trying to overwrite the international system with western values syria foreign minister faisal mekdad also took aim at sanctions which the us some other countries and the european union have imposed on his country s government oil industry and more he said his country has been economically besieged by powers bent on getting their way and retaining their wealth the war against syria ultimately was an attempt by the west to maintain control over the world he said the civil war began in 2011 with anti government protests demanding that president bashar assad s government make democratic reforms but the situation quickly escalated into fighting that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions amid the chaos the daesh militant group took over significant parts of syria in 2019 the group lost the last sliver of land its fighters controlled but its sleeper cells are still active to syria s frustration hundreds of us troops are stationed in the country s east to help the kurdish led syrian democratic forces to fight the militants mekdad said the coalition s presence contradicts international law and should end immediately without conditions fighting terrorism does not happen through an illegitimate international coalition that violates syria s sovereignty and destroys towns and villages he said arguing that battling terrorism can t work without coordination with assad s government syria also wants compensation for 107 billion in direct and indirect losses in its oil and gas sector during the war mekdad said the american forces and the sdf currently control much of the oil fields in eastern syria the us didn t immediately respond to the remarks from mekdad and kim they spoke on the closing day of the annual debate that brings presidents monarchs premiers and cabinet ministers to the assembly s podium russia s war in ukraine has taken up much of the discussion this year but the six days of speeches still formed a mosaic of global issues national priorities regional rivalries and don t forgets monday was no exception mauritanian foreign minister mohamed salem ould merzoug called for debt cancellation for african countries his canadian counterpart melanie joly told the world s women that her country would speak up for your rights and dignity no government no politician no judge no one can take that away from you bhutan s foreign minister tandi dorji said he overhauled his speech after getting a letter from a 7 year old girl in his himalayan homeland she worried that her small community would be flooded by melting snow and glaciers in a warming world he said reading from the letter i would request your excellency to kindly convey this small message to the world leaders and big and rich nations to help and save our tiny village from global warming she wrote i am sure if we all come together we can not only save our tiny village but also make our earth safe for all living beings the high profile speeches began last week with countries that sent heads of state and government by monday foreign minister and ambassador level speakers were taking the podium and the colossal security cordon around the united nations headquarters had been largely dismantled on the final day many speakers still spoke emphatically about how important the global organisation remains in a fragmented world we need more of the un not less joly said as the last country to weigh in nauru took stock of a world that has been buffeted by the ukraine war the coronavirus pandemic and climate change all at once but diplomat josie ann dongobir closed with hope that this year allows us to be open to the transformation we seek

synthetic biology company has been growing revenue through sales of consumer products at sephora and through its ingredients line of business in an exclusive interview with marketbeat portfolio manager randy baron said his models show the company will have a run rate of 1 billion in revenue by q4 2023 baron expects the company to post net income in 2024 biotech amyris nasdaq amrs appears

series on walter schloss in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q2 2022 hedge fund letters conferences and more california based amyris which went public in 2010 is focused on a business called synthetic biology it develops manufactures and markets patented ingredients from reusable sources such as sugar cane the company s molecules are already used by beauty products manufacturers including biossance jvn rose costa brazil and pipette while these brands aren t as well known as larger grooming and cosmetics manufacturers like procter gamble nyse pg or estee lauder nyse el they are popular with younger consumers who place importance on natural ingredients amyris revenue has been growing at uneven rates as data compiled by marketbeat show in its most recent quarter the company recorded sales of 65 2 million up 25 from the year earlier quarter revenue growth declined in the previous two quarters but increased at double or triple digit rates in late 2020 through mid 2021 the company has not been profitable but the company s strategy of targeting consumer brands has helped it weather a storm that other synthetic biology firms couldn t in addition to shaky fundamentals amyris longer term chart action is nothing to brag about despite a recent rally amyris trending higher recently the stock is down 43 81 year to date but the picture is a little brighter on a three month basis where there s an uptick of 41 40 on a one month basis amyris is up 16 92 not surprisingly it crumbled the week ended september 23 as the broader market also collapsed over interest rate and recession worries amyris shares finished friday at 3 04 down 14 12 for the week trading volume was lighter than normal the company was formed in 2003 and went public in 2010 which is actually a long time to be unprofitable even in the notoriously unprofitable world of bioscience amyris growth has been aided by its focus on a product called squalene which is naturally acquired through shark livers more than two million sharks are killed each year to harvest squalene the ingredient is utilized in products including cbd absorption makeup shampoo and moisturizers amyris manufactures squalene from sugar cane which is abundant and can be renewed easily avoiding disruption to the marine ecosystem as happens with shark based harvesting of squalene as with many industries shark harvesting of squalene uses fossil fuels so that s another advantage of using a lab based system according to marketbeat data on institutional ownership 143 institutional buyers purchased shares in the past 12 months greater than the number of sellers this manager has conviction in the stock one portfolio manager who has conviction about the stock is randy baron of pinnacle associates headquartered in new york in an interview with marketbeat baron explained that amyris got its start as a maker of synthetic petroleum but the problem is it s small batch production think of it like brewer s yeast baron said that business plan was derailed by the shale revolution which lowered the cost of oil from around 100 per barrel to 20 while other synthetic biology companies went bankrupt as business conditions changed amyris pivoted baron said that as part of its process of developing synthetic petroleum amyris discovered the carbon chain that led to synthetic squalene when you go to sephora one of the fascinating little secrets is squalene it s in products made by loreal estee lauder shiseido baron said he adds that amyris has been so successful in replacing shark derived squalene that its products now account for 60 of the global market for the chemical the fastest growing product at sephora is a brand called biossance that s 100 owned by amyris brand no product of biossance is less than 50 squalene baron said consumer business attracts ingredients buyers he added that amyris has two business lines the first is the consumer products such as biossance and jvn developed with tv personality and hair care entrepreneur jonathan van ness both brands are sold at sephora that line of business is designed to attract interest from other personal care product makers who then approach amyris to buy ingredients baron gave marketbeat a prediction about amyris prospects this is a company that s going to have a run rate of 1 billion in revenue by the fourth quarter of next year one year from now he said he added in my model it will have net income by 2024 he compared amyris position in its industry today to where the internet was in 1993 people care about this now a lot more than they did he said when you talk with young people today this is the no 1 thing they care about in these products clean chemistry should you invest 1 000

the portland based company turns spent grain a byproduct of beer production into treats for dogs portland ore the pdx based portland pet food company has made some big strides in the world of pet products their latest innovation is delicious dog treats made of brewers waste the flavored snack bites take advantage of a readily available byproduct in portland spent grain for anyone unfamiliar with how beer is brewed it usually involves the fermentation of grains like barley which produce alcohol however once the beer has been tapped brewers are typically left over with a sludge of spent grain which has little to no use in the brewing business with both a commitment to sustainability as well as improving the health of pups the portland pet food company capitalized on this cheap and nutrient rich source of fiber while the mash of soppy grain hardly looks appetizing to humans the mixture is already being fed to farm animals such as cattle and hogs although farmers are quickly catching on a good portion of spent grains generated by breweries in portland are tossed however there is no exact count of how much spent grain goes to waste annually when portland pet food co started cranking out its brew biscuits in 2014 they needed about a bucket of those spent grain per batch now using a mixture of spent grains and natural flavors the company processes multiple pallets of waste at a time the biscuits are available in stores like whole foods nationwide and cost around 10 for a five ounce bag portland pet food co used as much as 13 000 pounds of brewers waste in 2021 this year they re aiming to more than double that number by upcycling 30 000 pounds of spent grains for reference 30 000 pounds of grain is enough to produce 17 000 gallons of beer or 136 000 individual pints

instead of pinning your hopes on a stock split focus on chipotle s competitive advantages chipotle mexican grill s cmg 0 71 high stock price may send mixed signals to investors while the high price is a sign of success it has also put it on stock split watch as small investors hope that the shares become more affordable nonetheless a nominal stock price actually holds much less meaning for a stock than growth earnings and other metrics investors should focus on three factors that took chipotle stock higher before and will likely do so in the future 1 its role in pioneering healthy fast food from the beginning chipotle has stood out among fast food restaurants for its health oriented food sourcing practices it does not serve food with artificial colors flavors or preservatives it also forbids the use of can openers and freezers and has committed to responsibly raised meat with no added hormones a usda study found that in the u s organic farming was one of the fastest growing segments in agriculture so it stands to reason that chipotle s approach would appeal to consumers moreover amid food inflation chipotle has demonstrated its pricing power as rising prices have not deterred sales additionally other companies have copied this model outside of the mexican food category canada based freshii focuses on salads and wraps while tokyo joe s seeks to emulate this concept in the japanese food realm still neither of these companies has gone public or grown to the size of chipotle 2 chipotle s expansion potential also with more than 3 000 restaurants chipotle s expansion prospects have gained significant attention it operates in 48 u s states and washington d c since nearly 99 of its locations are in the u s this has led to questions about its expansion nonetheless ceo brian niccol stated on a recent earnings call that the company could operate 7 000 locations in north america chipotle has noted success in small town locations which adds to its addressable market the company expects to open between 235 and 250 restaurants in 2022 including 10 15 relocations so it continues to expand steadily moreover north america includes canada since canada only has 28 chipotle restaurants the expansion potential is significant it has also opened 12 u k locations and a small number of takeout only restaurants in france and germany if its concept succeeds with other cultures the expansions will probably continue for a long time to come 3 continuing revenue and earnings growth but no matter what it plans on the expansion front few can question chipotle s growth amid challenging conditions its digital ordering system became popular during the pandemic and now accounts for 39 of all food and beverage sales and even as stores have reopened chipotle s pricing power has helped the company fight inflation for the first six months of 2022 its 4 2 billion in revenue rose 16 compared with the same timeframe in 2021 chipotle was able to limit expense growth below the increase in revenue allowing net income to grow 33 over this period to 418 million analysts predict it can maintain the 16 revenue growth rate for the year this may help explain why its 12 month stock performance closely matches the s p 500 s however it has built a long track record of success a factor that may explain its lofty price to earnings p e ratio of 62 this comes in well above those of other restaurant stocks such as mcdonald s at 31 times earnings but investors should also remember that chipotle has rarely sold for less than 50 times earnings over the last five years hence it might not be as expensive as it might appear consider chipotle stock admittedly many investors probably want chipotle to split its stock but even if it never splits chipotle s healthy fast food concept is clearly a winner with consumers as long as it can continue adding restaurants and capitalizing on its pricing power chipotle stock can continue rising even with a high p e ratio
united nations ap some of the west s fiercest critics made their cases in the closing hours of the u n general assembly meeting of world leaders as syria and north korea on monday accused the united states and its allies of trying to impose their will on the world syria s top diplomat called for a u s led military coalition to get out of his country a north korean ambassador said his nation wouldn t yield to u n demands to give up its nuclear weapons program and both condemned sanctions against their countries if the messages weren t exactly new they carried the extra weight of a once a year chance to speak from the same famous podium as the leaders of other nations including their adversaries u s president joe biden addressed the assembly last week making no direct mention of syria but briefly complaining that north korea continues to blatantly violate u n sanctions over its nuclear activities north korean u n ambassador kim song retorted monday that biden picked on us and kim shrugged off his message to put it clearly we have never recognized such resolutions of the united nations that impose pressure because north korea views them as u s aims given an international imprimatur kim said we will not recognize them in the future either he added he said relations were potentially heading into a much more dangerous phase potentially the shakiest since world war ii because of the high handedness and arbitrariness of some countries that he said were trying to overwrite the international system with western values syria foreign minister faisal mekdad also took aim at sanctions which the the u s some other countries and the european union have imposed on his country s government oil industry and more he said his country has been economically besieged by powers bent on getting their way and retaining their wealth the war against syria ultimately was an attempt by the west to maintain control over the world he said the civil war began in 2011 with anti government protests demanding that president bashar assad s government make democratic reforms but the situation quickly escalated into fighting that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions amid the chaos the islamic state militant group took over significant parts of syria in 2019 the group lost the last sliver of land its fighters controlled but its sleeper cells are still active to syria s frustration hundreds of u s troops are stationed in the country s east to help the kurdish led syrian democratic forces to fight the militants mekdad said the coalition s presence contradicts international law and should end immediately without conditions fighting terrorism does not happen through an illegitimate international coalition that violates syria s sovereignty and destroys towns and villages he said arguing that battling terrorism can t work without coordination with assad s government syria also wants compensation for 107 billion in direct and indirect losses in its oil and gas sector during the war mekdad said the american forces and the sdf currently control much of the oil fields in eastern syria the u s didn t immediately respond to the remarks from mekdad and kim they spoke on the closing day of the annual debate that brings presidents monarchs premiers and cabinet ministers to the assembly s podium russia s war in ukraine has taken up much of the discussion this year but the six days of speeches still formed a mosaic of global issues national priorities regional rivalries and don t forgets monday was no exception mauritanian foreign minister mohamed salem ould merzoug called for debt cancellation for african countries his canadian counterpart mÃ©lanie joly told the world s women that her country would speak up for your rights and dignity no government no politician no judge no one can take that away from you bhutan s foreign minister tandi dorji said he overhauled his speech after getting a letter from a 7 year old girl in his himalayan homeland she worried that her small community would be flooded by melting snow and glaciers in a warming world he said reading from the letter i would request your excellency to kindly convey this small message to the world leaders and big and rich nations to help and save our tiny village from global warming she wrote i am sure if we all come together we can not only save our tiny village but also make our earth safe for all living beings the high profile speeches began last week with countries that sent heads of state and government by monday foreign minister and ambassador level speakers were taking the podium and the colossal security cordon around the united nations headquarters had been largely dismantled on the final day many speakers still spoke emphatically about how important the global organization remains in a fragmented world we need more of the u n not less joly said as the last country to weigh in nauru took stock of a world that has

contact high be it via marijuana stocks etfs or another vehicle next generation investors who believe in cannabis having a major legal presence going forward have plenty of options to get involved we definitely think that the time of the politician falling on the knife to legalize cannabis is beyond us now we actually think it s going to be more of a critical mass thing erdely said while moderating a panel called the cannabis industry how to invest for the future during day three of the future proof festival as erdely spoke on a side stage at the unorthodox event the panel attracted a healthy crowd of 20 and 30 somethings from the wealth management fintech and venture capital industries fitting for this discussion but present at least a dozen others throughout the festival the unmistakable smell of the investment being discussed hung in the air during the talk necks craned and grins cracked as attendees in sunglasses and floral printed button ups searched for the source meanwhile the panel of experts on stage sparked up and passed around a broad selection of topics during the 40 minutes they were allotted yulia kalk chief operating officer of san francisco s gordian compliance solutions kicked off the compliance conversation she said while her firm does not specialize in cannabis consulting it works to make sure wealth managers with clients interested in the space avoid problems related to investments or managing investments in the cannabis industry kalk believes the main complexity related to investing in cannabis is the understanding of what regulation applies from the investment standpoint and much like each state has its own rules for weed the same goes for state level investment regulation she said then we have finra on the broker dealer side and the sec on the registered investment advisor side so understanding how you navigate the investment space without crossing the compliance lines becomes very important kalk said and the truth is there are no specific rules for investing in cannabis therefore regular rules apply she added that she examined a number of recent disciplinary actions to see what regulators have done in terms of punishing people for violating rules related to cannabis investments the results were run of the mill with matters like failure to disclose conflicts of interest and due diligence failures leading the way so the punishment comes down not because it s the cannabis industry but because wealth managers violated some other rule and that s how the regulators are looking at it she said so if the rules are the same why is compliance such a big problem for the devil s lettuce kalk compared it to investments in cryptocurrency saying because regulators don t fully get it they keep a closer eye on it making those run of the mill issues easier to spot which always makes it very dangerous for funds to invest in something that regulators don t fully understand will be your no 1e target she said i would say to make sure that your compliance is really tight and clean around those investments and that is probably the no 1 way of defending yourself key investment partners founing partner tiby erdely grassdoor ceo zack ein katalys co founder matt stein sweet leaf madison capital chief financial officer kevin bush and gordian compliance solutions chief operating officer yulia kalk speak during a future proof panel justin l mack financial planning kevin bush chief financial officer of denver s sweet leaf madison capital a special lender that provides debt capital to operators in the cannabis industry said the need for proper due diligence is also increased because of the industry his firm occupies our biggest challenge is that cannabis is a bit like the wild west you ve got all types of characters he said with a smile so we want to make sure we re not lending money to people doing it illicitly bush pointed out that the fight for funding for cultivators processors and dispensaries isn t easy that s because marijuana s federal designation means big banks and other federally chartered institutions are off limits so they have to come to specialty finance people like us to finance them bush said it s a shortage of capital in a very capital intensive business in terms of timing erdely says investors interested in getting involved can do so before the next big legal cannabis boom much like the pre pandemic wave of recreational use legislation that pushed through states he sees a near future where 44 or 45 states are marked as legal on the ncsl map erdely said when that happens expect a federal change to follow and strong returns to flow as companies in the cannabis industry climb in valuation marijuana has also proven to be a pandemic proof commodity it s being legalized very quickly it s one of the reasons we got involved in the first place and this is an industry that s extremely capital constrained he said but it s all being driven by a grassroots movement at a state level future proof organized by advisor circle and ritholtz wealth management attracted more than 2 200 people to huntington beach california for its inaugural event officials said the guest list included more than 1 000 financial advisors 220 speakers and nearly 100 sponsors financial planning was a sponsor of the event dates for future proof 2023 have already been announced the event is

martha c white america s seniors are facing a lot of hard choices after the federal reserve s latest rate hike the combination of climbing prices on everything from food to gas to utilities and ever higher borrowing costs is making the finances of americans on fixed incomes increasingly precarious overall they have an increase in daily living expenses because of the economy right now said ella thomas executive director at the thea bowman center a cleveland community center that provides food assistance and other services it s definitely a problem thomas said many seniors the center serves who own their own homes are at risk of falling behind on property taxes and often don t have enough money to perform crucial repairs and upkeep being able to keep those homes up is a struggle for most of them she said this is how catherine powell a lifelong clevelander said she came to find herself back in the workforce at the age of 62 taking a part time job at the center helping other seniors apply for benefits such as the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap when you re younger you can afford to get things fixed powell told cnn business when you re younger you can go out and get two or three jobs you can hustle but when you re a senior it s tough to pivot powell left a federal government job 17 years ago to be a full time caregiver for ailing family members i took an early retirement because the people in my family started to get old i didn t want to put anybody into a nursing home she said unfortunately i didn t make plans for the long haul the financial reality is that people can t afford to retire on just a monthly social security check said vivian nava schellinger director of partnerships and network activation at the national council on aging social security comes up short by at least 1 000 in many locations that s a lot of money for an older adult she pointed out but many older americans especially lower income people of color and women who are more likely to work less or not at all in order to take on unpaid caregiving roles have no other dependable sources of income in their later years according to data from jobs site indeed the percentage of previously retired workers rejoining the labor force has climbed over the past year most of that increase has been driven by people in the 55 to 64 year age group said nick bunker indeed s director of economic research health problems compound economic pain workers sidelined by illness or injury don t even have the opportunity to keep ahead of inflation by increasing their income poor health saps the ability to stay employed particularly as people age but if they can t afford to eat well and get the medical care they need their health will decline further reducing the likelihood that they will be able to recover physically or financially you can connect health outcomes and financial outcomes because they are completely linked in so many ways said emily allen interim president and senior vice president of programs at the aarp foundation john harriger a resident of chilhowie virginia suffered a disabling back injury in 1994 and relies solely on social security for income harriger 66 said he counts himself lucky that he lives in a family home with no mortgage although paying for taxes utilities and insurance is a struggle more expensive gas means that he rarely goes out anymore except to physical therapy appointments and church services just a couple months ago i had to file bankruptcy harriger said i get about 1 800 a month but when gas and groceries started going up i couldn t make it any more we were using our credit cards to buy our gas and our food harriger who is eligible for snap said his benefits were recently increased to 23 a month we ve had to switch our meal plans a lot i miss my steak and burgers that s for sure he said on the menu now sparse dinners of green beans and cornbread i like a good pot of beans with fatback but gosh fatback s high too he said no margin for error older adults on fixed incomes must completely recalibrate what they thought their lives were going to look like in retirement said allen what we re hearing directly is often individuals saying gee i thought i was managing my finances ok but then there s this financial shock and they re struggling she said debbie sites a 73 year old widow who was forced to give up a nursing career because of a neurological disorder and suffers from celiac disease said she is watching both inflation and the federal reserve s most recent attempt to tame it with a super sized interest rate hike this week with a sense of alarm sites who relies wholly on social security for her income said she worries what will happen when the mortgage on her home near asheville north carolina resets i have an adjustable rate mortgage that goes up in 2024 and that s pretty scary she said although she is paying a rate below 4 now she said the loan terms allow for it to rise to as high as 9 over the course of a few years social security increases won t be enough social security recipients are on track to get a historically high cost of living adjustment or cola next year the senior citizens league projects an 8 7 increase which would equal an additional 144 10 on the average monthly benefit but the increase will be too little too late for struggling seniors advocates warn social security s inflation adjustment is backwards looking said alicia munnell director of the center for retirement research at boston college as inflation picks up it takes a while for the cola to pick up making matters worse recent stock market gains have withered on the vine as investors brace for an economic downturn munnell said there were enormous gains in 2020 and 2021 and in some ways this is taking away those gains and of course millions of people don t even have the financial cushion a retirement plan provides munnell pointed out this whole 401 k system works very well for the top third of workers but leaves millions behind she said us census bureau data found that as of 2020 more than 40 of americans between the ages of 56 and 64 don t have any retirement accounts the figures are even lower for women and non whites 56 5 of working age women don t have a retirement account nor do 63 2 of black working age americans and 71 7 of hispanic working age americans this has a pass through effect on the financial security of older americans another census bureau report found that while the number of people living in poverty as defined by the supplemental poverty measure fell between 2020 and 2021 the number of people over the age of 65 living in poverty rose from 9 5 to 10 7 compared to other rich nations poverty rates among older adults are higher said beth truesdale a research fellow who studies work and aging at the w e upjohn institute for employment research the reason that the current inflation pinches so hard for so many older adults is so many

here is what saga partners has to say about redfin corporation nasdaq rdfn in its q2 2022 investor letter the portfolio first bought redfin in q2 21 redfin s competitive advantage stems from its ability to integrate the demand aggregated from their web portal with full time salaried agents because redfin agents do not have to prospect for demand they are more productive than traditional agents providing redfin with a lower cost per transaction compared to traditional real estate brokerages the two other major real estate web portals zillow and realtor com have different business models where third party agents advertise on their website the web portals do not help agents become more productive but simply generate leads and therefore are part of the advertising costs of the

kuala lumpur the ringgit yesterday surpassed the psychologically important mark of rm4 60 to the us dollar this brings the currency closer to its all time historical low of 4 885 per us dollar in 1998 during the asian financial crisis and just prior to when the then prime minister tun dr mahathir mohamad announced capital controls and also the rm3 80 peg on the ringgit the ringgit ended the day at rm4 601 to the us dollar yesterday weakening by 0 52 throughout the day its decline is also in tandem with the risk off sentiment seen in other global currencies such as the british pound socio economic research centre executive director lee heng guie told starbiz that pressures on the local exchange rate will continue in the near term until the us federal reserve fed has completed its monetary tightening cycle which is expected in the first half of 2023 any moves to impose capital controls or to peg the ringgit again by the government to stem the slide could prove futile and counter productive as well as cause detrimental ramifications on the ringgit domestic equity and bond markets he added lee further noted capital controls and re pegging of the ringgit would result in more capital outflows and accentuate further sliding of the ringgit lee said the local currency which operates under a flexible exchange rate regime will have to absorb the volatility of capital flows and investors preference towards higher yielding assets as in this case the us dollar assets such as the us 10 year treasury investors look to buy currencies with higher interest rates as it creates an additional rate of return on their currency exchange the ringgit along with other regional currencies have been subjected to the strong us dollar backed by the fed s aggressive monetary tightening to kill inflation even it means inflicting a recession on the us economy lee said he noted that bank negara s press release which was issued last week on the ringgit is a testament that the central bank will ensure the domestic foreign exchange market will continue to function orderly and domestic liquidity remains ample to support the economy it is important now for the country to continue enhancing its economic and financial resilience including implementing key reforms to strengthen the fundamental support for and longer term confidence on the ringgit lee pointed out to do this he suggested that the country sustains the inflows of dependable long term investment inflows the continued accumulation of trade surplus and build a war chest of foreign exchange to strengthen the defenses for the ringgit meanwhile estimates among analysts vary but on a more optimistic note stated that global inflation could start ebbing from as early as the end of this year but among the more conservative estimates by analysts and economists put inflation as beginning to only ease in the second half of next year the potential easing in inflation will strengthen the case for global central banks such as the fed and the european central bank to slow down their rate hikes although the risk is that rate hikes will still continue in the near term this will also then reduce the pressure on bank negara to raise interest rates moving into the second half of 2023 prices may start to taper off mainly due to a potential normalisation in global supply chains coupled with back to back interest rate hikes by major central banks nevertheless the current combination of high inflation and slow economic growth raises the risk of a stagflationary episode kenanga research said it noted that the annual headline inflation rate in the united states in august at 8 3 and the united kingdom at 9 9 eased marginally due to a fall in petrol prices however underlying price pressures as measured by core inflation continued to trend higher highlighting that inflation may continue to remain high and would not return to the 2 inflation target anytime soon despite global central banks aggressive rate hikes the research house added it noted that the russia ukraine war may continue to push food prices higher in the near term due to the slow pace of grain and fertiliser exports from russia it also said electricity bills may continue to climb in europe as the indefinite shutdown of the nord stream 1 pipeline continues to exacerbate europe s energy crisis meanwhile lee said inflation back home may moderate from 2023 due to the projected slower economic growth and domestic demand as well as the high base effect nevertheless domestic policy measures such as subsidy rationalisation on fuel food and electricity tariff could inflict upward price pressures both direct and indirect impact of the weakening ringgit are also at play he noted on this front he said global crude oil and commodity prices remain the wild card we estimate the consumer price index to increase by 3 5 in 2022 and an estimated 2 5 to 3 in 2023 lee said meanwhile ambank group s economists anthony dass azri azhar and muhamad farid anas johar said in their latest report that malaysia s inflation numbers for august which was at 4 7 is equivalent to 0 2 on a month on month increase the slowest pace in four months this brings inflation year to date to 3 we revise our inflation outlook to 3 6 this year with an upside surprise of 3 8 and a downside of 3 2 said dass

fifty years since ferdinand marcos sr s declaration of martial law his only son is now president the marcos family s efforts to return to power have culminated in marcos jr s election with many filipinos believing that martial law was a golden age an era of peace and progress given their promotion of how great the period was it was a bit strange that president ferdinand marcos jr chose not to be in the country to celebrate it and to seal with marcosian pageantry the myth his campaign had spread to win voters that martial law was a benevolent period in philippine history his working visit to the us could have been postponed his speaking during the annual opening of the united nations general assembly the sounding of the opening bell at the new york stock exchange even the chat with president joseph biden all could all have been delayed for later when he has adequately warmed the presidential seat and yet he rushed away for what turned out to be pretty humdrum ceremonies although in the company of his wife sons and cousin a family affair the philippine daily inquirer correctly pointed out that marcos had no comment on martial law s 50th anniversary nor was there any official statement from the palace in his absence the inquirer recalled that in 2017 then president rodrigo duterte had declared september 21 as a national day of protest with enough newsrooms still waiting for government s lead to set their own coverage some reporters let the day pass without notice ignoring the protest actions of those who still remember that period of peril the countless lives lost the many disappeared and the unrecorded deaths on the part of government and family senator imelda josefa imee marcos felt obliged to observe the day for the purpose of repeating the family narrative by holding a press conference in her san juan residence to defend her father s declaration of martial law she said martial law was necessary to combat communism and that according to her father even former united states presidents had approved of it she then lassoed a certain ka peter mutuc who introduced himself as a former guerilla of the new people s army npa and apologized for taking up arms media particularly broadcast covered this press conference without questioning senator marcos claims to support this feeble gesture perhaps the family s political allies in the senate jinggoy estrada and robin padilla did their own presser to say that it was time to move on and that the sins of the father were not passed on to his son media did not pick up the dissonance in the message as the marcoses have been adamant about restoring the honor of their father s name as though the father had been blameless and without sin in a hearing by the house committee on constitutional amendments juan ponce enrile who served marcos sr and is now legal counsel of jr talked about the supposed need to adopt the 1935 constitution which did not have the provisions in 1987 that make it difficult to declare martial law only abs cbn countered the idea citing framers of the 1987 constitution who given the experience of martial law wisely included provisions that enable the legislature to counter the dictatorial tendencies of an elected chief executive some journalists made some effort to help filipinos who were too young or were not even born yet to learn the truth about what happened fifty years ago after all history can be a most reliable source of current news unfortunately editors and reporters are moving away from their role as watchdog and seem content to report only what government sources are saying cmfr notes that only a handful of news organizations produced exceptional pieces tv5 and news abs cbn com produced explainers based on research introducing the audience to the background of the times and the context which marcos sr used to justify the declaration of martial law both reports recalled the immediate arrests of political figures and the forced closures of media organizations following the declaration the inquirer s print edition picked up on the simultaneous and complete closure of the media featuring a very personal account of a veteran journalist who experienced firsthand marcos shuttering of his newsroom the inquirer s online counterpart produced an in depth article that challenged the move on call of the marcoses and their allies the report presented data on victims and survivors of the marcos regime many of whom remain unrecognized and undocumented inquirer net added that not all survivors have received reparations as mandated by law meanwhile philstar com listed five legacies of martial law which have undermined the fundamental rights of citizens 1 the exportation of human resources or ofws 2 the country s current lack of good leaders as many of them died in their youth 3 the strengthening of the npa as marcos rule served as its top recruiter 4 government control of the press which have led filmmakers to be more creative about the use of subversive content and 5 the monopoly over sugar production which caused extreme hunger in negros island a separate inquirer net report presented the economic costs of martial law showing the country s fall into its worst post war recession in the 1980s poverty had worsened as agricultural wages declined amid rising costs of basic commodities tv patrol turned current with its report showing the different ways in which the youth today are preserving martial law history with the guidance of those who survived it the story explored another path for the transfer of historical knowledge and vital information that must be transmitted from one generation to another intergenerational dialogue must do its part given the decline of reading and the difficulty of access to records and the scant availability of books in the country unfortunately journalists refrained from pointing out the irony in the absence of ferdinand marcos jr on the 50th anniversary of martial law a milestone he could have used if indeed that was the point of his campaign that another marcos deserved to lead the country because the first marcos was such a great leader whose martial rule did the country good bongbong marcos claim to be a president for unity requires greater clarity what else could be the basis of national solidarity but truth clearly he did not do anything in new york to build a more solid foundation from which filipinos can move on the present generation of journalists has to work together building solidarity based on truth so that news analysis and interpretation can help filipinos understand the lessons of the past the practice of truth telling cannot be limited to a few journalists it must gain more adherents in the rest of the media otherwise the watchdog s bark will be nothing but fleeting sounds only a few can hear

on friday night but yesterday s session was very different to friday s friday was simply sell everything yesterday was sell resources six sectors closed in the red yesterday and five in the green commodity prices had finally buckled on friday night in the face of global recession expectations and the surging us dollar and that included the one commodity that had recently been very much bucking the trend coal so while a big drop in oil prices was always going to impact on energy it was the rollover in coal which led the sector down 6 3 recent superstar new hope corp nhc led the damage in

on the day were tech stocks the fifth being rea group rea in comm services the signs are there that investors are looking for a bottom possibly helped by the s p500 coming off its lows in friday night to hold the june low the s p last night closed below the june low and commodity prices are all down sharply once more but our futures are up 17 points this morning currency crisis at least one us fund manager called last night for a coordinated central bank intervention to restore stability in currency markets the pound tanked again last night sending the us dollar up another 0 8 in the wake of the

taking it to the next level alex harring investors have limited viable alternatives to stocks making a rebound less likely investing strategist says a rebound is less likely as investor exposure to equity remains noticeably higher than in previous periods when a bear market gave way to an upswing according to willie delwiche an investment strategist at all star charts the strategist said that s because investors have limited viable alternatives to stocks which makes pulling away from the stock market more difficult than in previous bearish periods he said you have people holding on tight to their equity exposure even though they re feeling bad part of it that doesn t get a whole lot of attention is that in most environments if people are feeling bad and they don t like stocks there s a place that can go said delwiche who noted bonds gold and cash as the typical safe havens but those alternatives are also taking hits as bond yields rise precious metal values slide and the dollar s conversion rates change there isn t that safe harbor that investors can go to he said they re kind of stuck holding equity even though they don t like it and then they pay the price for it alex

500 hitting new lows once growth slows peak hawkishness may provide some relief but the impact of slowing growth to corporate earnings will follow in other words the first leg down in equity markets was largely due to multiple compression the next is likely to be downward earnings revisions goodwin said in a note to clients with so much recent volatility investors have been asking if bad news isn t already priced in i d argue that the market reaction to early earnings releases suggests that slowing economic activity is nowhere near priced in earning estimates are likely to continue their decline until we see a bottoming in leading economic indicators we are not there yet suggesting volatility ahead for risk assets she said jesse pound there is now plenty of value for stock pickers bmo capital markets says there are buying opportunities for stock pickers even with markets in turmoil according to bmo capital markets we believe it is also important to note that while there is still

near term bounce for stocks and a medium term bounce is not assured either according to ned davis research chief global investment strategist tim hayes said in a note to clients on monday that ned davis was switching to underweight in equities and raising more cash while the s p 500 breaking through its previous low for the year could signal more short term pain for stocks hayes said that investors should start considering a more long term issue in the market with the market s failure to form a bottom top of mind an increasingly common client question we ve been getting is whether equities have entered a secular bear market comparable to the 1929 1942 1966 1982 and 2000 2009 periods of negative real returns in equities hayes wrote the high interest rate environment and growing length of this bear market could signal that stocks are moving into a structurally different environment according to hayes it s too soon to answer the secular question definitively but the secular bear possibility warrants close attention given the changing investment environment this year he added jesse pound dow reverses a 398 point gain as tuesday s bounce attempt fails the three major

able to execute on the first critical projects primarily the remaining two dike crossings required to access the en zone we believe that taking a careful phased approach to restarting the mine removes some of the bottlenecks the operation has faced in the past and will facilitate a rapid ramp up to nameplate capacity once the mill restarts in mid 2023 we are looking forward to completing the capital projects and bringing the underground mine up to full operations so that we can turn our attention to development of the large open pit project i continue to appreciate the ongoing commitment

consumption as a percentage of household expenditure food loss and waste protein quality agricultural import tariffs dietary diversification agricultural infrastructure volatility of agricultural production public expenditure on agricultural resource and development corruption risk of political stability and even the sufficiency of supply in short anything goes advertisement 3 story continues

other countries around the world since we are ranked 7th globally same as last year not bad the united states is 13th in terms of food access which measures agricultural production farm capacities and the risk of supply disruption canada ranks 6th which is not too surprising despite our recent episodes of empty shelves and stockouts food abundance is certainly something canada can boast about we produce a lot and we are also part of a fluid north american economy focused on cross border trade all of this allows for better food access another pillar focuses on sustainable development the environment and climate adaptability this pillar assesses a country s exposure to the impacts of climate change its sensitivity to risks related to natural resources food waste management and how the country adapts to these risks in this regard canada is ranked 29th far behind norway and finland who are first and second for this category food waste remains canada s achilles heel as we waste more

year and sits at 25th in the world australia singapore and holland top the list for affordability given the resources and food access we have canada should do better since july 2021 food inflation has always exceeded general inflation in the country and everything is already costing more these days higher food prices at the grocery store over the past year have been difficult for many of us to accept canada needs a food autonomy policy a stronger food processing sector and better logistics domestically and with winter coming coupled with our dollar visibly weakening against the u s dollar we could see significant price jumps again especially in the produce and non perishables sections as wages stagnate and food prices rise it s hard to predict when canada will do better in terms of

what is going to be brothers of italy stance with the eu and are its members experienced enough rome italy it was never in doubt as pollsters had predicted throughout a chaotic election campaign italy is set to be led by its most hard right government since world war ii far right leader giorgia meloni a largely peripheral figure in italian politics up until a few years ago emerged triumphant in sunday s election the 45 year old is now expected to become prime minister leading a right wing coalition that garnered more than 43 percent of the vote if we are called upon to govern this nation we will do so for all italians with the aim of uniting people rather than dividing them to make them proud of being italians to wave the italian flag meloni said in the early hours of monday in a brief speech after the first projections result you chose us and we will not betray you she said visibly emotional campaigning under the slogan of god family and homeland meloni ran an aggressive campaign calling for the preservation of christian identity and the traditional family and of a country populated first and foremost by italian patriots critics warn that such a vision is one of exclusion and that a meloni led government will be one where civil rights are at risk especially for the gay community where access to abortion will be restricted and where the lives of refugees and migrants both new arrivals and those living already in italy will be increasingly hampered the far right leader has also pledged to impose a naval block and push back masses of illegal immigrants while putting italians interests above everything in the european union her approach to the eu reflects years of bad blood founded in 2012 brothers of italy seized on a growing popular discontent triggered by the eurozone s debt crisis for which it blamed european bureaucrats and financial markets the tone is now more sober but the substance remains the same according to critics her international allies reflect her extreme right political vision which will make it difficult to maintain good ties with european institutions said pieri ignazi professor of political science at bologna university referring to hungary s viktor orban france s marine le pen and spain s vox party that hopes to win the same success in next year s elections her position is to limit the process of integration of the european union and give back power to each nation he added ignazi points to the refusal last week by meloni to join the eu parliament in condemning hungary for democratic violations such protective behaviour with orban shows an acceptance of what he did in terms of rule of law limitations and of freedom of expression he said while other far right politicians in europe like french ultra nationalist eric zemmour and vox party leader santiago abascal have rushed to congratulate meloni on her victory more mainstream leaders have been more cautious french president emmanuel macron said he respected the democratic choice of the italian people adding that as neighbours and friends the two countries would continue to work together while prime minister elisabeth borne said france would keep a close eye on abortion and human rights in italy the european commission said it hoped for a constructive relationship with italy s next government the election was an unprecedented victory for the brothers of italy considering it polled at just 4 percent in 2018 but questions are now being asked about how the party whose members mostly have experience only in local politics will be able to find candidates able to fill the shoes of ministers this is a party that is used to standing outside the system which hasn t had many occasions to grow its leadership said gregory alegi professor of history and politics at luiss university now that it has reached the government by skipping an intermediate step is going to be a problem he said an issue that could emerge even further at the eu level where politicians need to know how to navigate often complicated negotiations alegi said the party will essentially be learning on the job but at the same time as italy is preparing to go into winter amid a biting energy crisis and high inflation the new leadership will need knowledge alegi said but also the support of the eu especially as the country is receiving the biggest chunk of an eu recovery fund washington is also watching closely meloni has been clear over her support for ukraine and sanctions against moscow but her coalition partners have openly expressed sympathy for russian president vladimir putin salvini a longtime admirer of putin has repeatedly insisted sanctions should be reconsidered former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for his part has struck up a personal friendship with the russian leader and the two have even taken holidays together the 85 year old said on thursday that putin only wanted to replace ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy with a government made up of decent people but he met unexpected resistance on the ground we are ready to welcome any political force able to show itself more constructive in relations with russia kremlin spokesperson dmitri peskov said following the elections before the campaign meloni got her coalition partners to agree on support for ukraine and the relatively poor performance in the election of salvini s league compared with the brothers of italy has strengthened her position experts say the risks for italy in departing from its decade long transatlantic alliance are simply too high considering italy s interests and interconnections there is no tactical advantage in running outside the western alliance alegi said i don t expect a u turn in the midst of a highwayman the political price would be too high

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video the species was thought to be extinct for decades colorado usa greenback cutthroat trout the state fish of colorado have naturally reproduced in their native waters for the first time since an intensive stocking program designed to bring the species back from extinction began six years ago colorado parks and wildlife said they discovered adult fish and fry in herman gulch which is part of the south platte river drainage fry are young fish that have developed to the point of feeding themselves our team of field technicians literally high fived right there in the stream when we captured that first fry that was spawned this year said boyd wright an aquatic biologist out of fort collins when moments later we captured a one year old fish produced in 2021 we were truly beside ourselves the video above shows wildlife biologists stocking the trout in 2021 in 1937 the greenback cutthroat was thought to be extinct due to the species being wiped out by pollution from mining pressure from fishing and competition from other trout species decades later in 2012 colorado parks and wildlife discovered a population of greenbacks in a small creek on the southwest edge of colorado springs the trout species is not native to that area so biologists think the fish were brought there in the late 1800s for a tourist fishing enterprise for years the 3 1 2 mile stretch of bear creek was the only place known to have naturally reproducing greenback cutthroat trout that led to a massive effort to protect the water that was holding these fish as well as bring them back to their native water cpw crews hiked into bear creek to capture the fish fertilized greenback eggs in labs and hatcheries and stocked fry in water where biologists thought they might reproduce the first greenback fry were brought to herman gulch in 2016 and this is the first time colorado parks and wildlife has been able to confirm they are naturally reproducing in that area other streams in the south platte river drainage have also been stocked with greenback in the years since but it has not been long enough for those fish to reach adulthood and start reproducing while we will continue to stock greenback trout from our hatcheries the fact that they are now successfully reproducing in the wild is exciting for the future of this species gov jared polis said in a release cpw s staff and our partner agencies have worked for more than a decade to restore this beloved state fish and s news truly highlights the success of the work
