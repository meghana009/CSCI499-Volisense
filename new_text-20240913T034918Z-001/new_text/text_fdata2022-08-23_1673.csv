bloomberg it s no coincidence that us stocks began their worst retreat in two months right around the time when an estimated 2 trillion of options closed out in a widely watched market event in the telling of charlie mcelligott a cross asset strategist at nomura securities international friday s options expiration has triggered a big shift in market positioning whereby dealers are now causing an increase in volatility after previously helping to suppress price moves before the event known as opex these market makers were stuck in long gamma positions that left them needing to go against the prevailing equity trend to maintain a neutral market exposure with derivatives contracts rolling off dealers are now mired in a short gamma stance that requires them to sell stocks when they fall and buy them when they rise the dynamics may have underpinned monday s selloff with the s p 500 poised for its first back to back drop of 1 since mid june along the way the index gave up on 4 232 a level that marked the midpoint of the 2022 bear market and was earlier cheered by bulls as a sign for portending more gains ahead the anticipated post opex gamma unclench arrives and is allowing us equities a larger trading distribution thereafter mcelligott wrote in a note monday that has seen the market break below some notable technical levels the view is the latest example of a controversial narrative that suggests that the stock market has effectively become a derivative of its own derivative one that upends the traditional relationship between options and their underlying assets the s p 500 s return during the opex week has been negative in 16 out of the last 20 instances with no obvious reason behind the market s tendency to fall around the event according to chris murphy co head of derivatives strategy at susquehanna international group outside opex murphy says there are plenty of catalysts for the market to pull back this time the s p 500 failed to surpass its 200 day average a key trendline that many see would point to a sustained rally hedge funds were reloading on short sales federal reserve officials kept warning that the central bank is far from being done with rate hikes just ahead of jackson hole symposium where chair jerome powell is expected to deliver a speech on monetary policy the fed hawkish comments are finally getting some traction shorts have largely been covered sentiment back to neutral equities were overbought murphy said maybe some investors used higher volumes during expiration as a source of liquidity and took advantage to sell a bit whatever the cause the two month rally that restored 7 trillion in equity values has come to a sudden halt the cboe volatility index or vix jumped almost 3 points to 23 48 as of 1 10 p m in new york options dealers are likely to remain in the short gamma regime as long as the s p 500 stays below 4 200 according to brent kochuba founder of analytic service spotgamma september has a very large options position as its a quarterly opex and those positions are currently put heavy he said so the risk here is that if we slide lower and implied volatility increases it could push dealers to start shorting then there really isn t anything to create relief until jackson hole not only that a worsening market trend could turn one of the biggest equity buyers since mid june into sellers warns nomura s mcelligott after betting against equities during the first half rout rules based money managers such as trend followers and volatility control funds have been forced to unwind their short positions snapping up more than 110 billion shares the firm s estimates show further turmoil would force these computer driven traders to load up on shorts again for instance a drop in the the s p 500 below 3 989 would trigger a sell signal for commodity trading advisors who usually take long and short bets in the futures market the benchmark index dropped around 2 to as low as 4 141 37 monday we see those systematic and mechanical buy flows either largely spent or at risk of actually becoming supply a few weeks out if vol was to reset higher here for a sustained period of time mcelligott wrote 2022 bloomberg l p

urges company to actively pursue strategic alternatives and sale of the company new york aug 22 2022 prnewswire owl creek asset management l p owl creek on behalf of its affiliated investment funds today sent a letter to the cano health inc cano or the company nyse cano board of directors strongly encouraging the company to pursue strategic alternatives by engaging with investment bankers and other advisors to pursue a sale to a strategic buyer the full text of the letter follows august 22 2022 dr marlow hernandez chairman of the board and chief executive officer cano health inc 9725 nw 117th avenue miami florida 33178 dear dr hernandez and other members of the board of directors i write on behalf of investment funds managed by owl creek asset management l p owl creek or we which as of august 19 2022 own 8 685 171 shares of cano health inc representing 3 745 percent of the class a equity of the company to share concerns we have with the company s current trajectory while we believe in the company s business model and management s ability to execute the post de spac business plan the past year s roller coaster of accounting issues has shaken our confidence we feel that cano s continued growth will require a larger and stronger vertically integrated partner with access to the capital needed to execute the company s business plan so we were encouraged to hear on the second quarter earnings call that you are open to considering all strategic alternatives to accelerate value creation we strongly encourage you to actively pursue these strategic alternatives by engaging with investment bankers and other advisors to pursue a sale of the company to a strategic buyer owl creek participated in the private placement that took place concurrently with your de spac transaction and since then has acquired significantly more shares in the secondary market we did so because we saw and continue to see an enormous opportunity to generate considerable economic value by delivering superior healthcare more efficiently your investor day quantified this opportunity as we learned that that the cohort of ma patients among the 26 000 members that joined in the first half of 2019 saw three year medical costs decline at a 3 compounded annual rate versus an expected 10 increase cano has exceeded the guidance outlined in the march 4 2021 investor presentation in terms of membership revenue and adjusted ebitda even excluding the contribution from direct contracting entities dce including dce which we believe to be an enormous opportunity both financially and strategically cano is close to achieving its 2023 targets a year early we believe that these results validate our view on the market opportunity and the company s ability to capture a meaningful portion of it unfortunately cano has consistently traded at a discount to its peers due to its spac heritage its hybrid model owned and operated medical centers along with affiliates and heavy concentration in the south florida market one could argue for some discount due to one or more of these factors but the valuation discrepancy between cano and peers is highly punitive clearly the recent back and forth on the ebitda moving from one year to the next also is not helping and will foreclose any thoughts of share sales at reasonable prices to fund growth the best known company in the owned and operated medical center segment and the first to go public oak street health inc oak street has an enterprise value that is nearly 3 2 times the high end of its 2022 revenue guidance of 2 145 billion one of the leaders in the affiliate space agilon health inc agilon also has an enterprise value more than three times the high end of its 2022 revenue guide of 2 635 billion despite cano guiding to 2 85 billion to 2 90 billion of revenue for the year which is higher than both oak street and agilon the company trades at under 1 3x the low end of the revenue guide with the company needing capital to compete with its peers and achieve the growth available in current and new markets its depressed valuation leaves two choices sacrifice growth or sell equity at highly dilutive levels both are unattractive options in our view given the persistent and wide gap between where cano shares trade and the valuation of comparable companies we believe there is ample room to come to terms with a strategic buyer that maximizes value for shareholders and provides the company a platform for future growth the industry is ripe for consolidation with large health care companies looking to grow recent transactions support this assertion and the willingness of buyers to pay a meaningful premium to where cano s stock has traded for much of this year for example as recently as july amazon com inc amazon announced that it was buying 1life healthcare inc better known as one medical for 3 9 billion amazon is paying well over three times this year s expected revenue of one medical in line with where both oak street and agilon are valued as we know from one medical s merger proxy filing dated august 9 2022 there was interest from another company besides amazon referred to as party a in the proxy it is widely speculated that party a is cvs health corporation cvs which has been very vocal in its interest in primary care centric value based care vbc providers in fact cvs has stated since late last year that they have well over 10 billion in capital to deploy towards strategic initiatives with vbc at the top of the list when asked on their first quarter earnings call on may 4 2022 as to why they have yet to announce a deal cvs cfo shawn guertin said we ve evaluated a range of assets in and around the care delivery space i ll remind you most of these assets aren t up for sale and so that dialogue starts a process they may have started the process with one medical but amazon finished it on their second quarter earnings call on august 3 2022 cvs ceo karen lynch in response to the first question specifically referencing the one medical deal stated we can t be in primary care without m a cvs and the other managed care companies are clearly prime candidates with which to discuss alternatives cvs has also been named as a suitor for signify health and it was reported late yesterday that amazon unitedhealth group and option care health are interested in the home health services provider if cano had an enterprise value equal to three times this year s expected revenue like oak street health and agilon do or one similar to what amazon is paying for one medical that would increase the valuation by more than 4 5 billion equating to a share price of approximately 14 owl creek invested in cano because we saw the massive opportunity in which primary care providers can bend the medical cost curve through preventive medicine and disease management delivering better clinical care more cost effectively your management team has achieved strong growth in membership medical centers and geographic markets to date however we believe that maximization of the company s long term potential will require a strategic transaction with a well funded entity such a transaction would not only result in meaningful appreciation in the current share price but also improve patient health by delivering primary care medical service to as many people as possible we look forward to your response and hearing about your proactive efforts in pursuing a strategic suitor for this highly valuable and attractive asset sincerely jeffrey a altman owl creek asset

the mass culling of the human herd is now under way here s exactly how it s being accomplished to achieve mass extermination globalists see humanity as cattle or sheeple to be exploited for as long as needed then culled like cattle herds when they are no longer useful as globalist advisor yuval harari is now saying paraphrased the age of humans is coming to an end on planet earth and globalists have activated a multi faceted plan to cleanse the planet of all human beings if someone were to have some sick twisted desire to kill off a herd of cattle they could simply shut off the water and the food death would come in a matter of days or weeks at most the same is happening right now to humans the water supply is being cut off via geoengineering causing global droughts and widespread crop failures entire cities like los angeles and los vegas are being threatened with a terminated water supply in the years ahead the food supply is being decimated by cutting off fertilizer supplies and causing diesel fuel prices to go sky high while also attacking the supply chain that supplies agricultural equipment parts the result both the water supplies and food supplies are being cut off the human herd is being culled in some of the same ways a herd of cattle might be eliminated vaccines are designed to kill the gullible billions and starvation will get the rest vaccines represent another kill vector for global depopulation because vaccines are voluntary they are intended to easily kill off the gullible masses who are so ill informed that they actually believe big government and big pharma wants to save their lives in reality of course the vaccines are biological weapons designed for infertility and depopulation a huge percentage we don t yet know the final number of those who have already taken the vaccines will die from self assembling clots that we now know contain high concentrations of conductive elements such as aluminum tin and sodium those who resist the vaccines are harder to kill because they don t line up and beg for death injections like the vaccine zealots do globalists intend to starve them to death with global food scarcity right now we already know there isn t enough food in the pipeline to feed the world throughout 2023 it simply isn t getting planted and harvested in sufficient quantities to feed 8 billion people continued government attacks on the food supply such as the netherlands ordering ranchers to cull their herds are designed to worsen food scarcity and accelerate mass starvation relatively few people are getting prepared with backup food supplies when the shelves are empty they will panic store plug the health ranger store will be releasing a few thousand ranger buckets during our labor day event starting sep 1 these are certified organic laboratory tested food supplies containing no msg no soy no textured vegetable protein no yeast extract no refined carbohydrates or sugars no artificial colors etc you can enter your

back in stock globalists know a massive civilian uprising is just months away in today s situation update podcast below i explain that the globalist vaccine depopulation scheme has failed to kill off billions of people in the short amount of time that was intended with food scarcity energy scarcity and water scarcity now reaching critical levels mass uprisings are mere months away western europe in particular is going to see civilian revolts this coming winter as millions find themselves freezing and starving the globalists know that worldwide food scarcity is already baked in they also know the mass uprisings will commence as starvation and scarcity worsen thus there is a countdown timeline in play that cannot be rescheduled as a result they are in a huge hurry to kill off billions of human beings before the uprisings get out of hand and snowball beyond the ability of these governments to contain this is the real purpose behind the recruiting and arming of 87 000 new irs agents who are being told they will need to use deadly force against the american people in france the ministry of the interior is hiring thousands of green police who will join armed brigades to supposedly prosecute environmental crimes yet the real purpose of all these armed government agencies in the usa france uk germany canada australia etc is to carry out mass executions of civilians as the government s war on humanity kicks into high gear the purpose of having a rogue fbi armed irs agents armed with a massive new cache of ammunition and firearms armed atf agents etc is to have a private army that answers to the executive branch of government and that doesn t fall under the jurisdiction of the us military which cannot legally wage war on us soil federal agencies however can and will wage war against the american people they are already doing it with atf agents now going door to door demanding civilians surrender gun parts they legally purchased for example it s going to be up to state governors to defend their residents against these federal tyrants and that will spark regional warfare with states literally going to war with rogue federal agencies run by the illegitimate fake resident in chief joe biden democrats media and government are preparing to call for mass executions of all christians and conservatives even right now democrats government and the media are claiming that all conservatives are terrorists implying they all deserve to be exterminated as everett piper writes in the washington times this past tuesday democrat adviser kurt bardella called all republicans a â domestic terrorist cell â msnbcâ s tiffany cross agreed and said there should be no distinction between republicans and â right wing extremists â at the same time peter wehner a contributing writer for the atlantic likened the republican party to a â dagger pointed at the throat of american democracy â all this while the fbi director christopher wray added that any american flying the gadsden â â donâ t tread on meâ â flag is suspect of violent extremism does it concern you that a group of democrats holding power is now defining all republicans as being â right wing extremistsâ and a â threat to american democracy â democrats government and the media are gearing up to try to morally justify their purge of all conservatives christians gun owners pro lifers and trump supporters remember these democrats are the same people who mutilate the genitalia of their own children in the name of transgenderism if they will mutilate their children what do you think they will do to their perceived political enemies especially if they can convince themselves that their enemies represent a threat to democracy to the skeptics who say ignorant things like the irs is going to use those guns and ammo on the american people we ask who else would they be planning to use it on of course it s intended to use on americans anyone who hasn t yet come to realize that simple fact is probably not going to survive the next year in america other vectors of depopulation being accelerated if you re wondering what can kill billions of people faster than mass starvation and crop failures think grid down scenarios any western government can sabotage their own domestic power grid and blame the russians for cyber attacks when the power grid is down the financial system grinds to a halt chaos ensues mass looting and violence in the streets cops bug out civilians who are left behind get murdered robbed and raped this will happen in nearly every blue city in america within just a few months of a grid down scenario up to 90 of the population is dead from violence starvation exposure or disease understand that heating and air conditioning will not function municipal water systems won t work meaning there will be no tap water cell towers will not function if you need to charge an electronic device you ll need solar panels and a solar generator if you want to enjoy communications you ll need a satellite phone or satellite text messaging device like the bivy stick from our sponsor sat123 com if you want to eat you ll need stored food if you don t want to die from dehydration you ll need a water filter and a water source that you can safely and frequently access you ll also need lots of containers for storing and transporting water because you ll need far more water than you think figure 10 gallons per person per day as an absolute minimum understand that the globalists have only just begun to deploy their weapons against humanity there s much more they can unleash as needed and if they don t get the kill rate they re wanting they will just crank up the chaos until a sufficient number of billions are dead humanity is being culled like cattle those who don t see it will be among the first to be exterminated by it but those who prepare have a realistic chance of making it through the genocide and participating in the rebuilding of human civilization

measures are not recognized measures under international financial reporting standards ifrs do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies rather these measures are provided as additional information to complement those ifrs measures by providing further understanding of the company s results of operations from management s perspective accordingly these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of the company s financial information reported under ifrs the non ifrs measures referred to in this press release are adjusted ebitda and fleet adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is used by management as a supplemental measure to review and assess operating performance management believes adjusted ebitda most accurately reflects the commercial reality of the company s operations on an ongoing basis by adding back non cash expenses additionally the rent related adjustments ensure that studio related expenses align with revenue generated over the corresponding time periods adjusted ebitda is calculated by adding back fixed asset depreciation right of use asset depreciation under ifrs 16 asset disposal and share based compensation expense to ifrs operating income then deducting straight line rent expenses3 net of lease abatements ifrs operating income is revenue less cost of sales gross profit additionally adjusted for general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense the company also uses fleet adjusted ebitda to evaluate its fleet performance this metric is calculated in a similar manner starting with talent revenue and adjusting for non fleet talent revenue and cost of sales further adjusted by fleet sg a and finally subtracting the same straight line rent expense used in the full company adjusted ebitda as the fleet holds all real estate leases the company believes that this metric most closely mirrors how management views the fleet portion of the business the following table reconciles adjusted ebitda to net loss for the periods indicated for fiscal quarter ended

livestock marketing has come on in leaps and bounds with the internet opening up a global audience for bulls and sales moving online we speak to three breeders about their marketing strategies see also rival breeders collaboration sees angus bull sales treble rob havard phepson angus droitwich worcestershire a regenerative system with practically no inputs other than a salt and mineral lick and electric fencing has been a major attraction for a growing number of customers of rob havard s phepson angus herd mr havard bought his first pedigree angus in 2013 and first sold bulls in 2017 he stresses it is still early days and sees what he is doing as a 30 year project to breed cattle that thrive on such low inputs expecting to calve 100 cows this year and oversubscribed two or three times for bulls and females already phepson angus is growing its herd through a collaborative agreement with three other breeders a further two herds are ready to join next year starter herds have been sold to like minded farmers and bulls are bought back from these breeders each year but rather than paperwork and contracts the agreement is based on good working relationships and aligned systems and aims says mr havard breeder q a do you sell anything online no just farm to farm sales last year every bull was valued at 3 750 what s your unique selling point the system we run here is a huge marketing feature we calve outdoors it s zero input holistic mob grazing with a compact native type angus all cows and bulls get is pasture and bales of hay we have used bulls and females from a variety of native type herds cattle go back to bulls such as evesund of dupplin betro of classlochie and dunlouise gypsy earl eddisbury genetics have also worked well line breeding means slightly suppressed growth and performance for us at home but offers a genuine outcross for our customers bringing greater heterosis and performance for them do you attend society sales no we rely on developing relationships with like minded farmers interested in our system do you advertise we had a stand at groundswell this year to target the progressive regenerative arable farming market we ordered branded hawaiian shirts and handed some out on the stand it worked really well and was a change from caps or a branded gilet any embryo or semen sales we ve sold kaiser straws across the uk and into the netherlands with 2 000 straws recently sold to argentina for their grass fed market we are interested to see how this market develops in the coming years how much showing do you do currently none do you have an online presence yes we put most things on twitter and took over the farmers of the uk twitter page earlier this year we also have a website phepsonangus com is the herd performance recorded at calving we record fertility calving ease udder and foot score any cows that cause a problem or need intervention are marked for culling but we don t performance record with breedplan ben harman chesham and silver charolais herds buckinghamshire a conscious effort to produce functional easy calving short gestation bulls for suckler farmers has opened up the dairy market for the harman family at chesham bucks ben harman is targeting the dairy artificial insemination ai market with silver oakman at about 5 straw depending on volume but a 500 royalty fee is charged to limit pedigree interest balthayock musketeer is targeted at the pedigree market 30 straw with a 30 royalty fee about 15 20 bulls are sold annually about half of which are sold off farm with straw sales roughly equivalent in value to selling one bull each month one buyer is acquiring most of the 40 cow herd second calvers and older this october bulls are penned on value a b and c and picked out by breeders no haggling is done better bulls are taken to welshpool and the cream are sold at stirling breeder q a do you sell anything online other than getting bulls into stud no we sell in the auction ring or privately we try to deliver every bull ourselves personally what s your unique selling point i am lucky as we are the oldest british charolais herd i have my grandfather and father s shoulders to stand on we ve also been able to buy in great genetics such as thrunton fairfax he really clicked with our cows and then balthayock musketeer worked well on top of fairfax do you attend society sales yes stirling welshpool and occasionally carlisle do you advertise advertising is mainly through word of mouth and the fact we are well established repeat custom is a delight to have any embryo or semen sales yes silver oakman and balthayock musketeer how much showing do you do pre sale shows and local shows and i am fortunate to be asked to judge cattle too do you have an online presence i talk about the cows a lot on my own personal facebook page but it s a soft sell is the herd performance recorded yes through breedplan with the society we breed short gestation easy calving stock with the growth estimated breeding values ebvs the breed is known for we need docile shapely cattle john douglas ervie line one herefords stranraer one of the uk s few on farm bull sales takes place each february at mains of airies where buyers travel to south west scotland to buy hereford bulls from the douglas family low birthweights 32kg 42kg short gestation uniformity and forage based genetics from a linebred system attracts black baldy breeders suckler farmers and dairies the first on farm sale took place in 2010 when 18 bulls were sold on the day now the family sells about 80 bulls annually with half sold at the farm sale conducted by harry begg c d auction marts the farm runs up to 230 cows although 100 were sold in 2020 and 90 will be marketed this year through a racehorse style sale over two days 12 14 october with online bidding and in person bids and a buy now price on all animals a production sale of the farm s texel ewes will be held on 23 september at dumfries mart which will also be streamed on a webcam every sale has been successful but john douglas his wife alexandra and their four daughters rosie ellen olivia and kristina say there are always nerves beforehand and huge relief afterwards breeder q a do you sell anything online yes we have used the livestock link which is a website run by in laws in the us for two years we sold 11 bulls online in february the upset price starts at 1 900 some breeders buy off figures our reputation and a 30 second video of the bull s locomotion videos are important to give an honest representation of the animal what s your unique selling point we have imported line one herefords which come from a herd in montana that are linebred 35 inbred in a very low input system in a harsh environment cows are linebred at ervie which means lower performance because of a lack of heterosis at home but greater heterosis and hybrid vigour for commercial customers do you attend society sales historically at hereford perth and stirling but not for 25 years do you advertise yes we advertise in the farming press and we send postal leaflets to customers sometimes tailoring them to beef or dairy farms we send a reminder a month before the sale and another a week before any embryo or ai sales we have marketed ervie classic s30 through cogent and into ireland how much showing do you do we are not focused on the showring although we have enjoyed local shows in the past do you have an online presence limited 4g signal means we don t do twitter but the herd is on facebook we always try and link to our website ervieherefords co uk so people can read up in detail about what we do is the herd performance recorded yes since the 1970s and now using the breedplan system although the imported us genetics take two years to prove themselves so figures look artificially low

wall street is starting to have less confidence in the idea that the fed will soon pivot to a more dovish posture i think jay powell can afford to be a little less ruthless with the rate hikes here

video fighting near the russian occupied zaporizhzhia nuclear plant europe s largest has stoked alarm in recent days credit credit david dee delgado reuters as united nations officials pleaded for inspection and demilitarization of a battle scarred nuclear power plant caught in russia s war on ukraine the two countries traded harsh accusations at a security council meeting and a path forward to avert a nuclear disaster remained unclear fighting near the zaporizhzhia nuclear plant europe s largest has stoked alarm in recent days amid fears that the transformation of the plant into a theater of war could lead to the risk of a catastrophic nuclear accident the security council held an emergency meeting on tuesday at the request of russia to discuss the situation around the plant and despite contradictory narratives about responsibility for the escalating threat russia and ukraine each blame the other the council was unanimous in its alarm about the risks to the plant and calls for an end to the fighting rosemary dicarlo the u n s top chief for political and peace building affairs addressed the council and urged russia and ukraine to provide secure and immediate access to inspectors from the u n s nuclear watchdog the international atomic energy agency or i a e a agreement is urgently needed to reestablish zaporizhzhia as purely civilian infrastructure and to ensure the safety of the area ms dicarlo said we must be clear that any potential damage to zaporizhzhia or any other nuclear facilities in ukraine leading to a possible nuclear incident would have catastrophic consequences not only for the immediate vicinity but for the region and beyond to paraphrase the secretary general s blunt warning any potential damage to zaporizhzhia is suicidal she added the russian military took control of the site in march but ukrainian technicians still operate the facility fighting has continued near the plant including recent shelling that fell dangerously close to the reactors the russian ambassador vassily nebenzya described a series of artillery and drone attacks on the plant that he claimed had been carried out by ukrainian forces noting that some of them had involved american made weapons accusations that ukraine has called ridiculous mr nebenzya held up a photo he said showed destruction at the plant he said western diplomats were in a parallel reality when accusing russia of attacking a nuclear plant its own military was protecting he said russia would support an i a e a inspection of the nuclear plant and that russia expected the mission would take place in the near future so the experts can confirm the real situation the deputy u s ambassador to the u n richard m mills said people are terrified of living near the plant and blamed russia for pushing the world to the brink of nuclear disaster russia created this risk and only russia can defuse it he said calling on moscow to heed the call by the u n to withdraw its troops and create a demilitarized zone around the plant he added why on earth is a nuclear facility being used as a staging ground for war image emergency rescue teams wearing radiation protection suits during a disaster drill last week in zaporizhzhia the site of a contested nuclear power complex credit david guttenfelder for the new york times hours before the u n meeting started ukrainian military intelligence said russia has been shelling ash pits near the zaporizhzhia facility raising clouds of toxic dust and causing radiation levels in the area to rise it did not offer details on how much the levels had spiked or whether the dust presented a health threat ukraine s ambassador to the u n sergiy kyslytsya said the council had wasted more than an hour to listen to a slew of fictitious sound bites from russia and denied allegations that ukrainian forces were shelling the plant he said that given the country s traumatic experience with the chernobyl accident it would not attack a nuclear facility on its own territory mr kyslytsya said while ukraine supported the u n inspectors visit to the plant it was concerned that the team would be subject to russian theater and an effort by russia to coerce the ukrainian staff which he called hostages to say and show what russia wants to the inspectors as u s intelligence agencies warn that russia may redouble attacks to coincide with the six month anniversary of its invasion on wednesday which is also ukraine s independence day the fighting around the nuclear plant looms as one of the gravest risks in the prolonged conflict hostilities in the south are intensifying as russia aims to fortify its defensive positions in lands it has seized and ukraine tries to muster a counteroffensive antónio guterres the secretary general of the united nations has said the situation around the zaporizhzhia facility is critical and warned of a catastrophic nuclear accident if the plant and the area surrounding it are not demilitarized the i a e a has requested secure access for its inspectors since at least june on tuesday the i a e a issued a statement cataloging some of the damage ukraine has reported to the agency in recent days saying it demonstrated the urgent need for inspectors to visit the i a e a s director general rafael mariano grossi said a visit could take place within the next few days if negotiations with russia and ukraine over access succeed the security council will meet again on wednesday to mark six months of the war in ukraine mr guterres is expected to brief diplomats on his recent visit to the country and provide an update on the u n s diplomatic efforts to help i a e a inspectors gain safe access to the nuclear plant

measure to review and assess operating performance management believes adjusted ebitda most accurately reflects the commercial reality of the company s operations on an ongoing basis by adding back non cash expenses additionally the rent related adjustments ensure that studio related expenses align with revenue generated over the corresponding time periods adjusted ebitda is calculated by adding back fixed asset depreciation right of use asset depreciation under ifrs 16 asset disposal and share based compensation expense to ifrs operating income then deducting straight line rent expenses3 net of lease abatements ifrs operating income is revenue less cost of sales gross profit additionally adjusted for general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense the company also uses fleet adjusted ebitda to evaluate its fleet performance this metric is calculated in a similar manner starting with talent revenue and adjusting for non fleet talent revenue and cost of sales further adjusted by fleet sg a and finally subtracting the same straight line rent expense used in the full company adjusted ebitda as the fleet holds all real estate leases the company believes that this metric most closely mirrors how management views the fleet portion of the business the following table reconciles adjusted ebitda to net loss for the periods indicated for fiscal quarter

t he idea that implicit or explicit sanctions of russian oil would lead to higher prices was not entirely unfounded prices shot up after the united states and canada banned new imports in response to the invasion of ukraine and western oil companies dealing legally in russian crude found themselves issuing apologies for doing so but life or uh oil finds a way in this case it found its way east with asian countries happily snapping up russian barrels at a discount to the global price of oil consequently oil prices have fallen to below where they were on the eve of the russian invasion crude oil prices fell to below 90 on wednesday and were 91 on thursday well below the 100 or over that many wall street banks anticipated early this year with morgan stanley forecasting 130 a barrel for brent crude oil a related oil benchmark that currently sits at around 97 per barrel there were many reasons to believe the fall in oil prices couldn t happen while outside the united states many countries never formally adopted an embargo against russia there were fears that self sanctioning would remove millions of barrels per day from the world oil market 2022 was also supposed to be the year the world economy recovered from covid 19 bringing oil demand back up to 2019 levels and in north america especially where no new refineries had been built since the 1970s capacity had shrunk as some refineries shut down in 2020 but across the country the average price at the pump is 4 04 a gallon which while not exactly low is much lower than the over 5 price tag in june how did we get here in short many of the fears of late may and early june when prices spiked turned out to be short lived for good and ill russia s ability to produce and export oil although not to the u s and canada remained persistent and the market responded to extremely high oil and gas prices in the spring and early summer first are the macroeconomic drivers of the market for crude oil which is then refined into gasoline or other products like diesel or jet fuel oil markets had anticipated that some two to four million barrels a day of russian oil would disappear when instead russia continued to export oil at an even pace albeit at a discount to the world price according to gregory brew an oil historian at yale university simultaneously brew explained recession worries in the u s and economic troubles in china suggested depressed future demand which put further pressure on prices rory johnston founder of commodity context a commodities research service explained that moscow has been redirecting exports from areas that are explicitly sanctioning russia such as the united states and canada and implicitly sanctioning like some countries in europe those barrels are flowing to china and india johnston concluded according to data from reuters the chinese and indian share of russian oil shipments has doubled from around 20 percent to over 40 percent compared to a year ago as valero chief commercial officer gary simmons said in july s quarterly call with analysts as time has gone on it appears that the russian oil has continued to flow and it s a change in trade flows not less russian oil on the market but it wasn t just russia pumping out more barrels unexpectedly that led to a decrease in oil prices in late march president biden ordered 1 million barrels a day to be released from the strategic petroleum reserve for six months that brew said supplied a lot of additional crude to the oil market which meant inventories were fuller than anticipated and then there s gas while oil prices have fallen around 30 percent since their twin peaks in march and early june gas prices have fallen 20 percent since their peak in june what was supposed to be a summer where refineries buckled under the strain of americans driving everywhere and of a nasty hurricane season knocking out the gulf coast refinery complex hasn t materialized at least so far americans are driving plenty but still at a little below 2019 levels as for hurricane season it has been modest so far with no hurricanes and the last named storm petering out in early july in a note to clients morgan stanley energy analysts said that the seasonal increase in u s gasoline demand has been particularly lackluster still tracking well below pre covid levels in fact refineries are routinely running at over 90 percent capacity all the while inventories of gasoline actually grew in the united states and the margins refineries were able to extract from processing crude fell there was more gasoline than needed johnston said what actually happened is that everyone flipped into production mode and swamped gasoline market this is the most oversupplied quarter since the second quarter of 2020 when the world shut down johnston added but just because oil and gas prices have fallen doesn t mean they will continue to do so just this week the energy information administration reported that stocks of crude oil and gasoline declined indicating that while prices have decreased the fundamental supply and demand dynamics of the oil and gasoline markets are still tight meaning the price of

adjustment dlocal defines adjusted ebitda margin as the adjusted ebitda divided by consolidated revenues although adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin may be commonly viewed as non ifrs measures in other contexts pursuant to ifrs 8 operating segments adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are treated by dlocal as ifrs measures based on the manner in which dlocal utilizes these measures nevertheless dlocal s adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin metrics should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income for the periods presented under ifrs dlocal also believes that its adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin metrics are useful metrics used by analysts and investors although these measures are not explicitly defined under ifrs additionally the way dlocal calculates operating segment s performance measures may be different from the calculations used by other entities including competitors and therefore dlocal s performance measures may not be

power is the return of valkyrie who we last saw crowned as the king of new asgard in avengers endgame tessa thompson announced at sdcc that valkyrie would be looking for her queen in thor 4 meaning that the character s lgbtq comic book roots will be addressed in this film we love to see it as for thor himself the last we saw of the god of thunder he was off on a spacefaring trip with the guardians of the galaxy thor was also massively overweight after his dark period in avengers endgame but chris hemsworth was spotted looking more bulked than ever on the thor 4 set so it seems we ll see him undertake a fitness journey thor also has his hands full with a new enemy gorr the god butcher gorr has a personal vendetta against the gods which doesn t bode well for our mate the god of thunder according to the official synopsis we ll see thor on a journey of self discovery the film finds thor on a journey unlike anything he s ever faced a search for self discovery but his retirement is interrupted by a galactic killer known as gorr the god butcher who seeks the extinction of the gods to combat the threat thor enlists the help of king valkyrie korg and ex girlfriend jane foster who to thor s surprise inexplicably wields his magical hammer mjolnir as the mighty thor together they embark upon a harrowing cosmic adventure to uncover the mystery of the god butcher s vengeance and stop him before it s too late waititi confirmed that thor 4 is so over the top in the very best way considering how ragnarok turned out it seems thor love and thunder is ready to take things even further who is in the cast as expected plenty of familiar faces are returning for thor s fourth adventure the holy trinity of chris hemsworth natalie portman and tessa thompson returns as thor jane

by zhong zhengsheng zhang lu and chang yixin china daily updated 2022 08 22 09 34 a clerk counts cash at a bank in haian east china s jiangsu province in july the people s bank of china the country s central bank recently lowered the rate on 400 billion yuan 58 89 billion of one year medium term lending facility loans to some financial institutions by 10 basis points to 2 75 percent it also conducted 2 billion yuan of seven day reverse repo operations at an interest rate of 2 percent down from 2 1 percent it was an unexpected cut in interest rates in china s second quarter monetary policy report the pboc strengthened its focus on refraining from adopting a deluge of strong stimulus policies the market expects liquidity to remain ample as for the 10 bps interest rate cuts by the central bank we understand they were carried out mainly for the following three reasons first there is a rising need for cutting interest rates to support the real economy growth of some key economic data slowed in july from june which does not augur well for a strong economic recovery in the third quarter and points to a deep seated lack of growth momentum on the one hand demand declined owing to unsolved real estate problems and given the increased risk of recession in europe and the united states the sword of damocles is still hanging above the slowing export growth rate despite exports short term resilience on the other hand overall market expectations are weak during the three year covid 19 pandemic some have been suffering deteriorating balance sheets hampering consumption recovery meanwhile enterprises still face problems like disruptions to production and logistics as well as insufficient demand and enterprises do not have a strong willingness to use tax credit refunds to recycle into expanding investment second credit and social financing declined in july limited improvements in business and consumer confidence failed to boost demand for loans to the real economy so far this year social financing data have fluctuated greatly as a result it is still necessary to further reduce interest rates to stimulate loan demand third inflation and exchange rates reduced their role of acting as constraints and it is time for a more discretionary monetary policy in terms of internal inflation growth rates of the consumer price index and the producer price index for july were both lower than market expectations and the growth in core cpi also slowed in july meanwhile the proportion of pork prices in the cpi slipped from 2 3 percent in early 2021 to 1 3 percent in july 2022 based on the laspeyres price index therefore subsequent inflation levels due to rising pork prices may be less drastic than previously thought as for external constraints the latest us july consumer inflation data came in weaker than forecast indicating a peak in overseas inflation the market altered its expectations for the us federal reserve to raise interest rates in september the us dollar index fell and the renminbi exchange rate rose steadily international capital flows are expected to achieve marginal improvements due to domestic economic recovery and lower expectations for overseas central banks to hike rates therefore we may interpret the exchange rate to be adhering to bottom line thinking as written in china s second quarter monetary policy report which better allows for two way fluctuations in the exchange rate and lets the exchange rate play its role as an internal and external balance regulator under the new situation of an improved external environment and international capital flows liquidity has continued to ease this year since early april and the rate cuts sent a positive policy signal on the one hand the seven day reverse repo rate averaged only 1 56 percent in july and dropped to 1 34 percent since the beginning of august far below the policy rate of 2 1 percent on the other hand the cost of bank liabilities fell quickly according to a news conference on financial statistics in the first half the interest rate on newly absorbed time deposits was 2 5 percent in june 16 bps lower than that of the same period last year in addition the cost of interbank liabilities fell sharply just as the money market interest rate did and the spread between the issuance interest rate of one year interbank certificates of deposit and mlf loans expanded which averaged 27 bps in the first quarter and expanded to 60 bps in july and 81 bps since the beginning of august the main reasons for the contraction of mlf loans are that banks have insufficient demand for high cost mlf funds and the divergence between policy rates and market rates is huge reducing the leading effect of mlf policy rates on the cost of bank liabilities so there is a great need for convergence between policy rates and market rates in order to employ monetary policy to support the real economy it is urgent to maintain the stability of total credit against the backdrop of advance issuance of government bonds we need to pay more attention to the growth rate of aggregate financing to the real economy excluding government bonds we expect to see some monetary policy tools in the second half this will increase medium and long term lending in the fields of technological innovation and green development if funding is not as expected it can be optimized by improving financial support in relending or extending the scope of funding applications in the field of traditional infrastructure policy related and developmental financial instruments are combined with an 800 billion yuan increase in policy banks lending quotas to fund infrastructure projects thus leveraging infrastructure financing also there is a need to fully meet the credit needs of micro and small businesses real estate and enterprises affected by the covid 19 pandemic it is advisable that the pboc considers lowering relending rates for the agriculture sector and small businesses once more by 10 to 25 bps in addition there is a need to stimulate demand for lending by improving the market reform mechanism for deposit rates and further lowering deposit rates so the over five year loan prime rate may be reduced notably meanwhile the pboc could cut the reserve requirement ratio by 0 25 to 0 5 percentage point when necessary which would lead to a reduction in lpr by 5 bps what needs to be emphasized is that according to current cuts in policy interest rates and lending rates monetary policy is extending more support to the real economy which is comparable to the period when the covid 19 pandemic broke out in 2020 however the current economic recovery is clearly weaker than at that time so monetary policy easing will continue the writers are zhong zhengsheng chief economist at ping an securities co ltd and director of the china chief economist forum and zhang lu and chang yixin analysts at ping an securities their views don t necessarily

affordability and great employment opportunities the diverse housing options locally ranging from attainable existing homes to luxury new homes allow buyers of different income levels and lifestyles to generally find what they want says ali wolf zonda s chief economist the building community has been working quickly to get more homes built in response to the solid demand with zonda data showing a 132 increase in units under construction in indianapolis compared to 2019 down 14 8 from the same quarter last year vacant developed lots sit at 6 463 while quarterly housing starts increased 4 3 over

slowing new home construction san diego is outperforming neighboring metros new and existing homes are selling faster than los angeles or the inland empire with the lowest relative supply of new homes and existing homes selling in a week zonda advisory vice president stephen carr says its strength is due to san diego s healthy job market with an unemployment rate of roughly 3 constrained supply with only 60 actively selling new home communities in the county and the median new home closing price being less than the median resale closing price the average new home list price in the county is on the rise but when we look at project level data we can see that san diego is not fully immune to changing market conditions we have seen some instances of price adjustments and higher incentives but low supply has insulated many builders he shares new home sales for the metro area increased 7 year over year to an annualized rate of 3 425 units in june over the past 12 months 1 549 were attached units and 1 876 were detached the number of available vacant developed lots sits at 1 480 which is down 2 1 from the same quarter last year quarterly housing starts increased 58 over a year ago as the market s supply demand balance is 0 75 oversupplied san diego will not be immune to forces slowing the housing market nationwide however strong job growth constrained supply and desirability will help san diego weather the storm better than most markets across the country we expect to see some softening in terms of pricing and sales over the next six to 12 months but fundamentals remain strong in the long term carr adds looking ahead carr doesn t foresee a time where san diego will be overbuilt and notes that the main risk factor for the market will be affordability adobe stock seanpavonephoto 3 charlotte north carolina for the charlotte metropolitan area the housing market has remained steady even as the risk of correction grows while among the

good value for housing mild weather and relatively low taxes the number of vacant developed lots is down 5 2 from the same quarter last year sitting at 11 319 while quarterly housing starts decreased 11 3 from a year ago the market is very slightly oversupplied at 0 02 to remain strong mccutcheon says that home builders should avoid exceeding demand prices will come down and sales could slow which would hurt the builders from the consumer s perspective an increased supply of for sale housing units and apartments could mean lower rents and lower monthly payments which would be a relief given the rising interest rates and inflation that have been very painful in 2022 4 huntsville alabama our data is showing that single family and multifamily permits are at record levels in both charlotte and huntsville even higher than the housing boom in the mid 2000s mccutcheon shares the zonda residential economic report for huntsville forecast permit activity for 2022 near 4 601 single family homes while price appreciation has risen it is not to extreme levels like charlotte compared with october 2021 it is estimated that the new home sales will rise from 20 to 157 for october of this year and from 518 to 1 102 for resales the short term outlook is choppy as buyers react to rising home prices and rising interest rates builders are reacting with increased incentives including rate buydowns

months were made up of 5 647 attached units and 3 175 detached with an eye on affordability homes priced under 400 000 experienced the most closing activity according to zonda s market report the

a trader works on the floor of the new york stock exchange nyse in new york the united states on april 26 xinhua sinopec china life insurance aluminium corp of china chalco petrochina and a separate sinopec entity sinopec shanghai petrochemical co ltd on august 12 announced they would be applying for the voluntary delisting of their american depositary shares ads from the new york stock exchange nyse some read the delisting announcement as a symbol of accelerated china u s decoupling the china securities regulatory commission has denied this pointing out that listing and delisting are normal movements in the capital market and china respects their choice based on their respective situations labeling the delisting from the nyse as decoupling is a stretch too far but the fact is that these five are only a handful of the chinese stocks listed on american exchanges that have been forced to delist since 2020 due to pressures from u s securities regulators that year the u s house of representatives passed the holding foreign company accountable act hfcaa which requires foreign issuers and their accounting firms to release their audit papers for inspection proving they are not under any foreign government ownership or control foreign companies risk being delisted if they fail to submit their audit papers to the public company accounting oversight board for three consecutive years although the hfcaa is applied to all foreign companies listed in the u s the act is widely believed to mainly target chinese companies by late july this year 159 chinese stocks listed in the u s had been put on the provisional list the e commerce giant alibaba is also on the provisional list it could end up being the biggest chinese firm to be delisted in the u s if it does not meet the legal requirement chinese companies have managed to get listed on american exchanges by conforming to all the rules and regulations of the u s capital market but since the donald trump administration adopted an array of policies to contain china s economic growth through the trade war the u s has doubled down on these regulations the hfcaa s politicization of economic issues serves to recruit it as yet another pawn in the u s strategic game to contain china china respects all efforts by foreign regulators to strengthen inspection to improve the quality of audit papers but opposes the politicizing of securities inspection the chinese government in the spirit of openness and cooperation always stands ready to conduct an open dialogue with the related accounting oversight bodies on auditing inspection cooperation however the voluntary delisting of five chinese companies reveals that cooperation in auditing inspection leaves much to be desired a large number of audit papers of u s listed chinese companies contain classified information related to china s business environment and even national security for example basic internet infrastructure consequently this u s requirement for disclosure is unacceptable if no consensus is achieved on the inspection of auditing firms in 2022 chinese companies on the provisional list may have to delist from american exchanges in 2023 yet the five companies voluntarily delisting do not represent the prevailing sentiment among chinese corporations given many of them are only listed on u s stock exchanges and nowhere else they aren t eager to jump ship just yet what s more the u s market still has the upper hand when it comes to supporting startups particularly tech startups and so many companies are trying to raise funds there as the biggest capital market in the world the u s is generally still hailed as the most welcoming and tolerant a lister of all but its reputation is slowly being tarnished by political interference in the capital arena if chinese companies are forced to delist under the hfcaa that may land the market on the d list copyedited by elsbeth van paridon

and the city was pure gold like unto clear glass and the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glass revelation 21 18 21 the year was 1896 and nebraska senator william jennings bryan campaigning for the nomination of the democratic party stood and addressed his party s convention in chicago railing against the gold standard that he complained only benefitted the idle holders of idol capital he famously declared you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold the speech became a sensation and one of the most famous in american history today over 125 years after bryan s famous speech then as now americans particularly those without idle capital are struggling inflation is soaring squeezing lower and middle class families to their breaking point as prices of everything from gas to grain rise ever higher nothing in the economy seems stable anymore the stock market has put the world s most intense

last year five us professors opened two brokerage accounts and placed identical orders to test an algorithm the next day one was down by 150 the other was up 12 they discovered it wasn t a one time anomaly over more than five months the academics used their own funds to execute 85 000 trades in 128 different stocks and made what they consider an important discovery they were getting significantly different prices to buy and sell shares depending on which brokerage handled the trade extrapolating from the results they estimate it costs small time us investors as much as 34 billion a year said christopher schwarz the finance professor at the university of california irvine who wrote the study along with four colleagues the paper indicates there are hidden costs to the day trading that s proliferated along with no fee brokerage accounts that s because even though trades are funneled through a handful of wholesale market makers including citadel securities and virtu financial inc the pricing can vary according to the paper and those small discrepancies can have a large impact overall brokers are getting very different execution quality at the same market center schwarz said in an interview based on the data market centers have an incredible power over brokers the overall cost figure is an estimate of what investors would save if their orders were executed by the best performing of the five brokers in the study instead of the fourth best it estimates that some 20 billion of execution costs would be saved if trading costs were cut by 0 10 in their experiment the professors placed their trades simultaneously with five different brokers all of which offered zero commission trading only some of them had payment for order flow deals with market makers an arrangement that allows large trading firms to buy orders from retail intermediaries such arrangements have drawn scrutiny since the start of the pademic s meme stock frenzy because the interests of brokers and markers can be aligned potentially at the cost of investors but the study found it had little impact there was however a very large variation in prices achieved from buying and selling stocks at different brokers with the execution of some trades costing 10 times more as measured by the basis point spread that was charged when made through one intermediary than with another out of the six market makers that handled the orders in the experiment more than 60 of all orders eventually went to citadel securities and virtu a spokesperson from virtu declined to comment joe mecane head of execution services at citadel securities said the paper shows that payment for order flow has no impact on the prices investors pay he also said it shows that investors get good execution because they get better prices than the benchmark for bid ask spreads across exchanges schwarz said the study results suggest that some brokerage firms have managed to negotiate better terms with major market makers than others resulting in vastly different outcomes for clients he said that suggests there should be heightened scrutiny of the market makers that dominate an industry that executes the roughly 28 trillion worth of us retail stock orders each year to be sure some degree of pricing variation is normal in any market differences can arise because of changes in liquidity volatility and market conditions as well as the kind of order sent to the exchange the study authors also said their analysis was limited to one aspect of brokerage trading the execution price there are other qualities in a brokerage that customers may prioritize such as the range of securities available research and trading tools the contracts negotiated between brokers and market makers are private but robinhood markets inc s december 2020 settlement with the securities and exchange commission shed some light on the conflicts of interest between brokerages and their clients according to the sec s settlement order unidentified market makers told robinhood that they would have to provide worse prices if the broker wanted to get a larger share of overall profits from the trades it routed through the firms schwarz said regulators should demand clearer disclosures about the costs investors pay and how the agreements between brokers and market makers affect them it should be easier to figure out the costs than for me and my friends to do this with our own money he said we d never have been able to figure out these costs based on public disclosures and this needs to change

new york a sober warning for wall street and beyond the us federal reserve fed is still on a collision course with the financial markets stocks and bonds are set to tumble once more even though inflation has likely peaked according to the latest bloomberg mliv pulse survey as rate hikes reawaken the great 2022 selloff ahead of the jackson hole symposium later this week 68 of respondents see the most destabilising era of price pressures in decades eroding corporate margins and sending equities lower a majority of the more than 900 contributors who include strategists and day traders reckon inflation has topped out still a whopping 84 say it may take two years or longer for the jerome powell led central bank to bring it down to the official long term target of 2 in the meantime american consumers will cut spending and unemployment will climb over 4 these bearish sentiments come amid deep scepticism in the face of an unexpected us 7 trillion rm31 4 trillion equity rebound of late while stocks fell last week the s p 500 has still trimmed its 2022 loss to 11 versus the 23 decline through its mid june nadir this is a bear market trap said victoria greene of g squared private wealth inflation is the big bad boogie man even if there really is a sustained decrease in inflation it could take a while before prices actually come down significantly the survey results spell trouble for dip buyers who have re emerged after the horrendous first half driven by bets on a less hawkish monetary tightening cycle in turn shares around the world have clawed back some of the worst losses while the 10 year treasury yield has fallen back to around 3 from the peak of near 3 5 earlier this year mliv respondents for their part reckon bond prices are set to dip again over the next month with fed chairman powell having an opportunity to renew hawkish market expectations at the gathering this week in jackson hole wyoming fed funds futures currently show traders are betting the central bank will stop hiking after raising the benchmark to 3 7 and will start cutting as early as may 2023 yet even the doves are pushing back with minneapolis fed president neel kashkari recommending a 4 4 rate by the end of 2023 it s hard to overstate why all this matters the fast pace of monetary tightening and the resulting economic fallout is the biggest risk for money managers all over the world with interest rates being a key driver of corporate valuations the bad news per survey participants is that inflation will deliver a meaningful blow to margins pushing stocks lower while inflation s effect on profit margins is very much an open question the majority of mliv readers appear closer to the bearish spectrum of a heated wall street debate on where stocks are headed consumers are likely to buy fewer goods in the next six months according to a majority of respondents as long as high prices persist that s in line with warnings from the world s largest retailer walmart inc that soaring inflation is forcing shoppers to pay more for essentials at the expense of other discretionary items consumer spending cuts would be a clear drag on profits reported by s p 500 companies which are also dealing with higher wages rising inventories and ongoing supply chain issues in china while the s p 500 s margins peaked a year ago the trough may not come until the fourth quarter according to bloomberg intelligence since the start of the earnings season consensus estimates for net income margins have fallen by about a half percentage point for both the third and fourth quarters with communication services health care and consumer sectors among the weakest according to the data pulse contributors also reckon unemployment is likely to rise above 4 but not higher than 6 a worrisome level that s higher than what policymakers are anticipating but lower than in previous severe economic downturns that offers some comfort that any recession would be short lived providing a dip buying opportunity for risk assets it s rare for the fed to aggressively tighten policy without causing market volatility said john cunnison chief investment officer at baker boyer bank stocks aren t wildly cheap right now but they re not as expensive as they were six months ago especially for growth companies bloomberg

hatewatch obtained emails surrounding the deal which the city council tabled on july 18 amid public scrutiny through a public information request the emails shed light on opd s relationships with far right business owners who have ties to law enforcement nebraska activists tell hatewatch they fear the swap between opd and 88 tactical a large gun range and store on the outskirts of omaha where civilians as well as law enforcement and military personnel train is evidence of police willingness to work with organizations that have ties to the far right update omaha city council takes action on proposed equipment swap hatewatch attempted to contact 88 tactical for comment on this article but they did not respond however 88 tactical founder and former law enforcement officer shea degan released a video after hatewatch sent the request for comment saying his business is not racist degan decried bullies who hate the first amendment the second amendment and cops opd and 88 tactical agreed that police would give 88 tactical 28 expired ballistic helmets and 28 expired rifle plates a value of roughly 45 000 if purchased new in exchange for 120 coyote ar magazines 60 glock 17 magazines and 30 orange glock magazine base plates all worth about 3 100 melody vaccaro executive director of grassroots nonprofit nebraskans against gun violence nagv told hatewatch she and other nebraskans were immediately concerned about the trade given 88 tactical s history of bringing an anti muslim speaker to nebraska hatewatch first covered 88 tactical in 2017 when it and the anti muslim global faith institute invited anti muslim ex fbi agent and author john guandolo who bills himself as a national security consultant to nebraska the global faith institute is an organization that pushes unfounded conspiracy theories about the alleged threat muslims pose to the u s similarly guandolo has authored several books about the supposed threat to america posed by sharia law and warning of a jihadi generation 88 tactical has also hosted former president donald trump s son donald jr and carlos and eduardo bolsonaro the sons of far right brazilian president jair bolsonaro both are far right politicians in brazil who push anti leftist conspiracies professional relationship the emails between opd and 88 tactical detail the deal s origin opd lieutenant jacob ritonya emailed 88 tactical founder degan with details of the swap on may 18 2022 at 12 40 p m cdt degan may 18 2022 2 42 p m cdt i see no reason why wouldn t do this deal with you guys as it benefits everyone as always i appreciate you thinking of us brother ritonya may 18 2022 4 14 p m cdt thanks so much for the consideration we appreciate everything 88tactical has done for opd swat have a great night jake opd spokesperson lieutenant neil bonacci told hatewatch the emails characterize a strictly professional relationship between opd and 88 tactical similar to many of our relationships with other businesses in our city bonacci also said he was unaware of any relationship between 88 tactical and any far right or anti muslim groups or individuals he added if we were aware of said relationships we would not do business with them hatewatch sent bonacci reports on 88 tactical working with the global faith institute bonacci did not respond by publication time nagv and local activists have also accused tactical 88 of including nazi messaging in its branding something the company adamantly rejects nagv called 88 tactical a gun business with disturbing nazi branding in its press release about the swap it noted that 88 is a code used by neo nazis for heil hitler the nazi salute h is the eighth letter of the alphabet degan has regularly denied this accusation degan says the 88 references the nebraska police code for situation secure a code familiar to him as a former law enforcement officer and to others in the state vaccaro said it s not a mystery to him that people conclude that 88 is a nazi reference even if he thinks it s unfair and that rings hollow by how insistent he is on its continued use regardless of degan s intentions in selecting the name neo nazis have noticed the name in 2012 88 tactical offered training courses about living out of a bunker learning how to survive and neutralize opposing forces which it called the aftermath series the courses appealed to the conspiracy laden doomsday prepper movement degan appeared on the discovery channel s doomsday bunkers that year the episode featured the training neo nazis on stormfront noted in a 2012 thread the 88 and that everyone he was training was white the neo nazis later discuss the meaning of 88 in nebraska police code another screenshot of the inside of 88 tactical s shooting range shows an elevation map with the highest point at an elevation of 1488 feet but according to peak bagger a website that tracks elevations omaha s highest point is around 1 270 feet frequently linked to white supremacy the numerical combination 1488 combines code for heil hitler and the 14 words a white nationalist saying that extremist david lane coined the 14 words refers to securing a future for white children after locals pointed out the number s use in white supremacist circles 88 tactical said on twitter the map was a stock image and the choice of an outside designer the gun range said they removed the map once the public brought to their attention the meaning of 1488 88 tactical also denounced white supremacy in the tweet anti islam views despite the company s rejection of white supremacy a former 88 tactical assistant instructor whose tenure lasted one year told hatewatch he frequently observed racism and white nationalism from the senior instructors at the gun range such views may be pervasive among other partners of 88 tactical as well activists shared with hatewatch anti muslim images that 88 tactical senior instructor and opd officer devin crinklaw has posted on social media crinklaw who has worked for opd for 19 years runs in extremis tactical group a business that offers firearms and training to civilians and law enforcement in cooperation with 88 tactical the aforementioned former instructor did not know crinklaw and made no claims about his conduct one of crinklaw s posts shows a painting depicting a north african attack on a u s ship during the barbary wars of 1801 05 the image shows text that reads muslims attacking america since 1801 crinklaw also shared an image of a shooting target in the shape of a man in traditional muslim garb raising a weapon crinklaw captioned that post would somebody shoot this guy please another post features a photo of an assault rifle leaned against a wall adorned with the jerusalem cross crinklaw captioned it good combination old mission modern tools in extremis logo is the jerusalem cross a symbol of christendom associated with the kingdom of jerusalem which crusaders first established in the 11th century after defeating muslim rulers in the levant far right figures have adopted crusader imagery as part of their self stylized modern day war against islam anders breivik the far right islamophobe who killed 78 people in norway in 2011 viewed himself as a christian knight fighting islam breivik wore the maltese cross a symbol of the crusader knights templar whom the kingdom of jerusalem employed in their war with islamic kingdoms whether crinklaw is aware of this history is unclear he did not respond to a request for comment conflict of interest the emails show opd lieutenant jacob ritonya first tried to arrange the swap on april 29 ritonya s first choice for the trade was omaha tactical an omaha based firearms dealer that opd officer kenner hatfield runs bernard in den bosch omaha s deputy city attorney said in a may 5 email the trade would run afoul of the city charter which states no city employee can have a financial interest in contracts deputy chief scott gray informed ritonya gray may 5 2022 11 43 a m cdt we will not be able to do a trade with hatfield because he is a current city employee you ll have to see if another vendor can offer something this particular proposal is denied scott omaha tactical does business with other companies linked to opd including in extremis in extremis posted on nov 27 2021 that one of their employees participated in a shooting competition using the in extremis tactical group combat carbine proudly built by kenner hatfield of omahatactical com a nebraska state patrol document listed crinklaw as a concealed handgun permit instructor and gave 88 tactical s address in his contact information hatewatch was unable to find statistics on the frequency of such trades between police departments and private businesses though crinklaw works with 88 tactical both in den bosch and frank daley the executive director of the nebraska accountability and disclosure commission told hatewatch the agreement would not violate city or state conflict of interest laws in den bosch said if a city employee does not have an interest that is specifically benefited by the contract then there should not be an issue there is no question that we do have to rely on the entity with whom we contract to ensure that there is no violation of the city charter or state law since we have no way of knowing who has a financial interest if we become aware that the city charter or state law is being violated we will act to void the contract he continued photo illustration by splc

for years you ve been diligently turning off the faucet each time you brush your teeth you ve replaced harsh cleaning chemicals with more natural alternatives and even installed a low flow showerhead what more can you do to preserve our planet s finite supply of water although the aforementioned individual efforts are laudable household usage accounts for just 11 of global water withdrawals each year the real culprits i e those that can contribute most to preserving our water resources are companies although there are many reasons that corporations should evaluate their water management practices we re focusing here on the financial risks of poor water stewardship without further ado here are three that may well rain on investors parades reduced or costlier production capabilities and supply chain disruptions which have the potential to dramatically impact companies across all industries after all water is essential for the cultivation and production of raw materials the manufacturing process and the distribution of products in fact the far reaching effects of climate change induced water scarcity can already be observed in europe where a summer of severe droughts has threatened livestock production and crop yields vital waterways such as the rhone danube and po rivers are drying up hampering transportation of goods and impeding nuclear energy production the timing arguably couldn t be worse for a continent that s already grappling with soaring inflation and energy shortages following russia s invasion of ukraine earlier this year but nature waits for no one and the effects of our collective procrastination are now yielding notable economic effects in the form of elevated shipping costs supply shortages and likely production cuts some economists have warned that dry conditions in germany long considered mainland europe s economic powerhouse could stall the country s overall economic growth by as much as half a percentage point this year legal action and reputational damage as companies are taken to task for their roles in excessive water usage or contamination recent research has indicated that half of the united states waterways are now so polluted they are considered impaired meaning they are unsafe for swimming fishing or drinking among the contaminants garnering increased public attention are per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas commonly referred to as forever chemicals because they don t break down easily these man made substances which have been linked to a variety of negative health impacts in humans and animals are now so ubiquitous that they can be found in even the most remote areas of the world as awareness of pfas grows so too do efforts to hold companies accountable for releasing these harmful chemicals into surrounding waterways more than 1 200 pfas related lawsuits were filed in the united states last year corporate defendants could subsequently find themselves embroiled in protracted litigation spending considerably on legal defense settlements judgments and crisis management communications for some companies the financial risks are formidable well known chemicals manufacturer 3m devoted 15 entire pages in last year s annual report to its pfas linked legal exposures stranded assets in water stressed regions often emanating from inaccurate projections regarding water availability and access failure to implement appropriate risk mitigation and stewardship plans and or unfavorable regulatory responses stranded assets in case you were wondering are those that no longer generate revenue for a company they often transpire as a result of adverse environmental conditions yes that includes drought or significant disruptions in terms of consumer demand regulatory activity and technological innovation again this isn t a hypothetical scenario some major publicly traded companies have already seen their assets become albatrosses as a result of water related events one particularly prominent example is that of mining behemoth barrick gold which spent two decades and billions of dollars attempting to get its once touted pascua lama mining project underway this andean project straddling the borders of chile and argentina was met with dogged and unrelenting opposition from environmental groups and local stakeholders concerned about its destruction of nearby glaciers as well as depletion and contamination of local water supply these concerns were seemingly not unfounded and in 2013 upon determining that barrick gold did not have adequate protocols in place to prevent water pollution a chilean court imposed a 16 million fine and ordered that the company suspend construction on the project cue class action lawsuits from irate investors last month drawing a line under the sorry saga chile s supreme court ratified the definitive closure of pascua lama project far from being a cash cow pascua lama has become a cautionary tale for other companies and its fate now hangs in the balance barrick gold is currently exploring whether the argentine side of the mine remains viable but for now the project represents an extremely expensive thorn in the company s side what is the role of financial advisors in addressing the water crisis financial advisors who are well positioned to help their clients identify and manage water risks in their portfolios given the politicized and polarized nature of recent dialogue surrounding environmental social and governance esg investing some advisors might be hesitant to raise such issues with their clients however regardless of clients political inclinations there s a chance they are already experiencing the day to day effects of prolonged prevarication on water issues droughts might be affecting their livelihoods water pollution may be impacting their ability to enjoy much loved hobbies such as fishing scuba diving or boating they might even have good reason to doubt that their home water supply is safe for consumption importantly advisors wishing to help clients target the encroaching water crisis are not merely limited to esg funds which have contributed to skepticism of the broader sustainable investing movement particularly when it comes to a lack of transparency concerning these funds underlying selection criteria direct indexing solutions instead allow advisors to customize portfolios to clients specific values financial preferences and tax situations many such platforms also afford investors the flexibility to decide whether divestment or engagement is their preferred impact approach indeed some independent shareholders have been lending recent support to proposals that urge disclosure and mitigation of water risks the time to act is now the water crisis is not a nebulous theoretical concept it s here and it s already having profound social and economic impacts as other industry participants have observed by failing to account for water security in financial decision making financial markets are contributing significant financial flows that are increasing exposure and vulnerability to water related risks across the global economy advisors shouldn t be afraid to discuss this financially material issue with clients it s part of their fiduciary duty emma smith is director of communications at ethic ethic is an independent provider of personalized direct indexing strategies for financial intermediaries its scalable technology platform enables advisors to create custom portfolios tailored to clients unique values financial goals and tax preferences

we must approach the challenge of meeting food security needs by increasing imports in the coming years and by combining it with strategic planning there was an extraordinary heatwave in march in northern india which caused wheat yields to go down the heatwave in northern europe was much worse and has also affected wheat output as a result of the heatwave and collapse of exports from ukraine the world may be short by around 14 million tonnes this has caused wheat prices to spiral there are frantic efforts by major importers both diplomatic and commercial to ensure adequate supplies including those from last year s crop stored in silos india s prime minister had made an assurance that the country could feed the world since we had a bumper crop but a reassessment after the march heatwave led to a hastily imposed export ban on wheat something that dismayed the farmers eyeing windfall gains due to high international prices but by now the situation may be grimmer this year s output could be 10 lower than last year thanks to lower procurement combined with higher allocation both to the public distribution system pds and to the pradhan mantri gareeb kalyan anna yojana pmgkay the current stocks are less than adequate between pds and pmgkay free food grain scheme the total annual requirement is around 32 million tonnes add to it a minimum buffer stock of 8 mt that must be maintained for contingencies emergencies and price stabilisation unfortunately the current stock which includes carry over stock from the last year and a fresh procurement of 20 mt falls short this possible shortfall has been denied by the department of food and public distribution however the best indicator of any impending shortage is conveyed by prices wheat inflation is running at 12 traders anticipate an annual production of only 95 mt sharply down from 111 mt last year even an independent assessment by the united states agriculture department pegs india s production this year at 98 mt the pmgkay commitment was recently extended for a sixth time to the end of september 2022 the in kind transfer of free food grain has not only ensured some amount of food security but also protected the recipients from food inflation that is because the benefit was given in kind rather than in cash the total incremental outlay for the sixth phase is around 80 000 crore the government can consider tapering down the benefits of pmgkay which had begun during the first wave of covid 19 but the termination of pmgkay should not be abrupt in this context it is worth emphasising that the import of wheat is not a national embarrassment nor should it be politicised india has been proudly self sufficient in food grains for several decades after the initial success of the green revolution and of policies of public procurement which gives production incentives to farmers but over the years many distinct changes in consumption patterns of indians are discernible firstly there is the transition from coarse cereals like jowar and bajra to fine cereals like wheat and rice secondly the increase in consumption of meat dairy and poultry these require higher production of food grains including corn and soya as animal feed in fact the demand for animal feed has gone up sharply and so has the cost causing high inflation in milk the third trend in changing consumption patterns is more food being served as ready made food in restaurants and community kitchens that too is likely on a net basis to lead to increase in the demand for food thus if we extrapolate the demand for food grains taking into account changing consumption patterns and rising incomes and prosperity it is clear that domestic availability will not be enough at the current rate of growth of productivity and yields and acreage hence sooner or later india has to plan for food security which has a significant linkage with imports or encouraging indian companies to own food production in other land abundant countries like australia or ethiopia even as india has to plan for food imports due to looming domestic inadequacy due to changing consumption patterns the current situation of food insecurity is grim the recently published state of food security and nutrition in the world report states that 40 6 of india s population suffered from moderate or severe food insecurity during 2019 21 the proportion of those who are severely food insecure has risen from 20 3 in 2018 20 to 22 3 the world average is much lower at 10 7 thus more than one third of the world s hungry and undernourished people are in india which is alarming and embarrassing if not shameful india s rank in the global hunger index also has dropped to 101 out of 116 countries the ghi score has been improving in the last few years but the latest score of 27 5 is still considered serious even sub component scores for stunting wasting and child malnutrition are worrisome the ghi is computed using three dimensions of child mortality children malnutrition and food supply adequacy in another aspect of its food economy india has very high dependency on imported edible oils even in pulses a crucial source of proteins the production has not kept pace and imports of pulses make up 10 15 of total consumption that could go up in the future milk production is the highest in the world but per capita consumption needs to go up substantially to come up to the world average for that to happen milk production requires much higher production of animal feedstock like corn this too implies pressure on increasing agricultural production at a faster pace it is thus clear that in the near future india s dependence on food imports will rise this by itself is neither a matter of national prestige nor embarrassment we are after all big importers of energy which we hope to reduce with greater use of renewable energy in a similar way we have to approach the challenge of meeting food security needs by increasing imports in the coming years and combining it with strategic planning and coordination technology will also play a role in increasing productivity and ensuring crop diversification but till we meet the challenge of food security needs till we have higher technology to increase yields and diversify crops till we combine strategic planning and coordination in imports the large scale import of wheat will be necessary to ensure food security and domestic price stability in india the billion press the writer is a noted economist

by michael if half of the firms in the entire country really do cut jobs over the next year what will our economy look like afterwards all over america companies are anticipating that a major economic downturn is coming in 2023 and a lot of them are already planning to shed workers in order to cut costs of course this sounds so much like what we went through back in 2008 and 2009 millions of americans lost their jobs during the great recession and it was truly a very dark time in our history so are we right on the verge of seeing a repeat let hope that isn t the case unfortunately a brand new survey that was just released has discovered that 50 percent of all u s companies plan to eliminate jobs within the next 12 months the following comes from cnbc meanwhile 50 of firms are anticipating a reduction in overall headcount while 52 foresee instituting a hiring freeze and 44 rescinding job offers according to a pwc survey of 722 u s executives fielded in early august these are executives expectations for the next six months to a year and therefore may evolve according to bhushan sethi co head of pwc s global people and organization group can those numbers be accurate i knew that things were bad because i write about this stuff on a daily basis but i didn t think that half of the firms in the entire nation were already looking to cut workers wow at this moment i am at a loss for words it s going to get bad out there if you have a good job right now try to do whatever you can to hold on to it sadly some of the biggest names in the corporate world have already started to lay off workers for example ford motor just announced that it will be laying off roughly 3 000 white collar and contract employees ford motor confirmed monday it is laying off roughly 3 000 white collar and contract employees marking the latest in its efforts to slash costs as it makes a longer range transition to electric vehicles ford sent an internal email monday to employees saying it would begin notifying affected salaried and agency workers this week of the cuts the email was viewed by the wall street journal wayfair has also decided that now is the time for mass layoffs home goods company wayfair decided to cut approximately 870 workers to help manage operation costs and realign its investment priorities following the coronavirus pandemic the associated press ap reported this week i thought that wayfair was doing quite well i guess not in a desperate attempt to stay afloat peloton has also chosen to lay off hundreds of workers seeking to cut costs and end a flood of red ink peloton is planning to raise prices on key products shutter stores and lay off hundreds of workers according to a memo from ceo barry mccarthy and even groupon is getting in on the act 500 of their workers will now be updating their resumes we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us chicago based groupon today laid off more than 500 of its employees 15 of its 3 416 person headcount according to posts from former employees on social media the reduction impacted workers in teams including merchant development sales recruiting engineering product and marketing other big names that have announced layoffs in recent weeks include best buy hbo max shopify re max and walmart unfortunately this is just the tip of the iceberg as this new economic downturn deepens countless more americans will lose their jobs and as that happens all of a sudden there will be vast numbers of people that can t pay their mortgages or make their rent payments and that will make our new housing crash even worse we are now very clearly past the peak of the housing bubble and the ride down is going to be really painful last year at this time the housing market in california was extremely hot but now the numbers are definitely heading in the other direction sales volume of single family houses sfh in california plunged by 14 in july from june seasonally adjusted and by 31 from a year ago the 13th month in a row of year over year declines according to the california association of realtors sales volume of condos plunged by 18 in july from june and by 36 from a year ago prices eventually follow volume the median price of single family houses dropped 3 5 in july from june down for the second month in a row slashing the year over year gain to just 2 8 if you are trying to sell a house right now i would encourage you to try to get that done as quickly as possible before prices fall precipitously speaking of declines the dow was down another 643 points on monday the dow jones industrial average fell sharply monday in its worst day since june as the summer rally fizzled out and fears of aggressive interest rate hikes returned to wall street the dow fell 643 13 points or 1 91 to 33 063 61 the s p 500 dropped 2 14 to 4 137 99 and the nasdaq composite tumbled 2 55 to 12 381 57 respectively it was the worst day of trading since june 16 for the dow and the s p 500 i think that a lot of people want to get out of the market before the summer ends needless to say there are many out there that are anticipating that the last few months of this year will not be kind to the financial markets on september 29th 2008 the dow jones industrial average plunged 777 points that was a brand new record at that time and it was a spark that set off mass panic on wall street could we see something similar once summer is over only time will tell but what we do know is that the u s economy is really starting to implode and the stage is being set for the sort of historic economic meltdown that i have portrayed in my books at this point everyone should be able to see that really hard times are on the horizon those that are prudent will do what they can to get prepared in advance

the arrival of sergio massa in the ministry of economy created significant movements in the economic power base shaken by the decision of frente de todos to fire his predecessor and technical staff martín guzmán for giving power and management to a politician most entrepreneurs have known for years but that wart ain t cool to walk through the red circle rather there is a path that combines support some strong disapproval and many enigmas that depend on the effectiveness of its management and this doll tame areas that skillfully handle times of betrayal on the current map massa maintains a well armed national bourgeoisie that was already with him have multiple businesses daniel villa and jose luis manzano and banker jorge brito current owner of banco macro and president of river in addition the trio along with the other ceos almost preach the minister s word brito also comes from a very cold relationship with guzmán which turned into an improving bond today manzano meanwhile the former minister of menem and the current head of several companies including the energy and investment fund took a strong role in the assembly of teams from the secretariat led by dario martínez it was he who asked most for federico bernal who went into hydrocarbons the second more well known fact is that salta s current energy secretary flavia royan worked for more than ten years at the bermejo refrigerator owned by the brito family the other strong change in trend occurs in the industrial association uia there the production secretary josé ignacio de mendigueren rebuilds the links and damaged terminals with tequint and the president daniel fuens de rioja the latter interacts directly with massa who puts several on the phone to order storm fronts recent history also suggests that after the arrival of massa paolo rocca techint owning to began to spread the idea that it was not so clear that mauricio macri whom he sees as almost the only opposition team has the technical ability to rule in the next round he was not alone a high ranking business leader said so at a recent meeting in favor of no extra frills or goals massa got the establishment thinking another case is that of carlos achetoni president of the agrarian federation faa who in a private meeting asked him not to be a candidate in 2023 in the final hours in an interview with futurerock a member of the contact table assured that the opposition does not contribute to the betterment of the people and believed that it could do so if massa was not a candidate rockefeller negroponte and stanley this support from the uia was strongly felt last week the way massa was armed at a meeting of the council of america at the hotel alvier there he interacted with the presidents of the group of six uia chamber of commerce construction stock exchange national bank and rural society but the council left massa with few visible signs of how certain regions would play out from the team of the us ambassador mark stanley he followed his request for politics to be armed not before the election but before the election weighing in on the call that the opposition was directed more than anything else but beyond massa s lines with the united states a businessman present there described him perfectly the united states is neither bad nor good it is the united states this proverb proves that the minister does not have the place he bought the one visible face to the council is susan sehgal christina kirchner historical connection with organizing a visit to houston in 2012 for former minister amado boudou to know why argentina had nationalized the ypf but segal who has been leading the council since 2003 and a director of companies such as miguel galuccio s oil company mercado libre scotiabank and vista oil is at the forefront of one of the world s two most important us lobby polls and plays along here are some statistics with the politics of that country the council of america is the brainchild of banker david rockefeller who knew how to conduct coups across the region segal has another man of great weight the reference is to john dimitri negroponte the london born oil businessman has been working in foreign affairs for the united states government since the 1970s and is a former cia in the 1970s and 1980s where he was ambassador to honduras he led part of the contras operations in nicaragua then after the attacks on the twin towers in 2001 george bush jr deported him to iraq anecdotal data suggests that the council along with the america s society is much more than a commercial representation therefore whatever happens in this context should not be read as an isolated gesture and it s also a fact that reflects the relative management of warts in the united states landscape region and new businessman chat the council of trade and production sisip has become one of the most important trading centers today until a few weeks ago it was chaired by fuens de rioja and previously by former uia miguel acevedo and eduardo ernecion corporation america but now massa will have trouble there the new president is marcos pereda born the vice president of rural society there s going to be a turning point said someone who knows cloth pereda is one of the hardliners in the anti peronist camp and he was the most important financier of former governor maria eugenia vidal s campaign pareda bourne rural came to power at the hands of former minister macri luis miguel echevehair and is part of the region that does not want to negotiate with the government a tribune that would be hard to minister on the other hand when the whatsapp group nuestra woz was hacked another of a special nature arose sources that are partially stated page i12 which is called constitution and brings together ceos who believe that it is time to promote the values of the national constitution those values that exist there according to him are economic and political freedom some of its creators still play together for change among them the former fiat cristiano ratazzi gonzalo tanoira from citricola san miguel ricardo dickie smith estrada meat producer and director of sra and agustin otero monsegur

many schools have programs that could wipe out your tuition bill if you are planning to fund with a 529 plan some thoughts about that as well example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video texas usa the average tuition and fees at a public university in texas costs an estimated 10 129 per year if you are a parent or a self funding student those numbers can be intimidating but if your household makes under a certain amount of money students from that household may be eligible at many texas universities for free tuition and possibly free fees and even free room and board there are need based programs that cover costs leftover after other financial aid has been applied to what you owe let s start with the programs in dallas county and tarrant county for students who have graduated from any one of dozens of high schools they help fully cover educational expenses at several universities that each program partners with these are the ones included in the dallas county program and these are the ones in the tarrant county program free tuition programs at texas universities additionally many universities in texas have their own free tuition and fee programs again your household has to make under a certain amount to qualify a few schools require that your household income is less than 30 000 a year a few others say you can qualify if your household makes under 85 000 a year most of them offer free tuition for households making less than 65 000 but that is adjusted gross income agi so even if your gross income is slightly higher than these limits you may still be eligible just check your agi on your most recent income tax returns also some schools have tuition discount programs for students coming from some households that make too much to qualify for free tuition there are deadlines and there are different rules and requirements for each program here are the links to the programs at individual texas universities 529 plans if you are saving for college with a 529 plan it has probably gotten pretty beaten up in the market over the last year if your balance has been badly knocked down remember you can alter your plan investments twice a year some of the choices in the texas plan like the capital preservation option have done a lot less badly than others this year it is probably a good idea to have a financial advisor look over the options there because as you invest you want to be looking ahead not just reacting to what the market has already done if your child graduates high school in the more distant future your continued contributions now are buying stocks at cheaper prices ideally your 529 plan will get a much nicer bounce when the market recovers

a mother of two who re mortgaged her home and started a business from her spare bedroom is celebrating after her company turnover topped 1m charlotte mills had always dreamed of becoming a fashion designer and in 2014 re mortgaged her home while working full time to set up a business in her spare room her aim was to create a wedding shoe brand with a difference after previously working for companies such as river island she failed to get a government loan or any money from the bank and had to keep her new business a secret from her employer in case it folded spending every waking moment outside work trying to get it off the ground but after seven years of hard work and a disaster that saw her plunged into debt her company turned over 1m in 2021 making more than 400 000 in profit with this year s sales so far up by 30 per cent from a working class family in the small town of failsworth in oldham charlotte was the first in her family to head to university she studied at the london college of fashion alongside the likes of sophia webster and alumni jimmy choo and her interview to get a place was the first time she d visited the capital although she didn t achieve the a level grades she was meant to the prestigious university let her in but she always felt like an outsider i love london now and have the best time when i go but moving there as a student was difficult and lonely charlotte told the mirror image charlotte mills i was coming home a lot at weekends because i was so homesick being a northerner in london i was really intimidated by all the other girls in my class they all had posh accents and had been to boarding school and i just felt like a little commoner from manchester she laughed after graduating she went to work for danielle group a manchester firm specialising in imported clothing including footwear for high street shops such as river island charlotte spent eight years there and travelled the world including visiting factories in china and worked her way up to design manager she had always had the idea for her own bridal shoe collection and presented designs for her final year degree show however it wasn t until she spent time at a footwear factory in spain that she could truly imagine her vision becoming a reality i thought this is how shoes should be made she recalls from her visit everyone there was so passionate about it and so skilled there was leather everywhere i just had this feeling image catherine booty desperate to make her dream a reality charlotte re mortgaged the cottage she had bought in her hometown aged 25 to release equity and start the business she then secured a grant from a local businessman who invests in oldham entrepreneurs armed with a 20 000 loan combined with a bunch of credit cards she set up the brand over the space of a year in 2014 with about 60 000 in the beginning i was getting one or two orders a week on the website i used to go out on my lunch break and visit bridal shops to see if they wanted to stock the shoes she said as her wedding shoes started appearing in magazines charlotte came clean to her boss happily they recognised there wasn t a direct competition and she continued to work for them for the following 18 months slowly reducing her days as the brand grew in popularity inspired by her own wedding where her friend s mum gave her a sixpence as her something old that she kept in her shoe her handcrafted designs reference tradition with the old english rhyme engraved into the soles of the shoes each pair which resembles the something new has an embossed sixpence in the insole as a nod to something old with blue lining for something blue and for something borrowed each shoe box comes with an envelope that brides post back with a photo of their wedding day charlotte officially launched charlotte mills at a trade show in london i was so excited and thought everyone was going to go crazy she remembers but i didn t sell one pair i sat in my car sobbing my heart out afterwards she attained 50 stockists before deciding to open up her own boutique in manchester s northern quarter with a pop up shop in the capital in chelsea following later but in 2017 charlotte almost lost it all when she decided to launch a disaster fashion line which saw her indebted to her own mother and gran while she had celebrities like fearne cotton donning the collection she had invested 80 000 into her usual clientele which she says will save up for a pair of her shoes for their special day didn t buy into it it was a vanity thing i thought charlotte mills needed to be this big brand the shoes were fun but it was an absolute disaster she says i had all this money to pay back and it got to the point where i had to start asking my family to loan me money just to cover the running costs of the business which was quite difficult i m from a working class family so that was everyone s savings really that was a really hard time i had staff to pay a lot of the employees were friends that had come on board then there was the factory workers i took a step back and focussed on what we were really good at which was wedding shoes and i learnt to not see that as not important it s so important to people and that is the business following a struggling 18 months the business was back on track before skyrocketing in the 2020 lockdown brides to be had no option but to browse for wedding shoes online and with many big days postponed there was more time to save up for their dream pair to walk down the aisle in the business went nuts charlotte says people had to go online and discovered new brands so it went crazy we had hundreds and hundreds of shoes on pre order and couldn t meet the demand people were waiting three or four months for their shoes charlotte admits that while a 1m turnover was her goal eventually she didn t foresee it actually happening the business has gone from a team of three including herself and her mum to 11 and is expanding its offering with jewellery and matching handbag launches customers are based across the uk and globally particularly in australia ireland and america where a new website and warehouse will be set up charlotte the mum of margo four and billie one is also in the process of creating a new hq in a converted church in saddleworth to house their offices as well as an experience zone for brides to be to try on shoes including a bar recently returning from her second maternity leave the businesswoman adds i m really proud of everything i ve achieved and i ve got such an amazing family
