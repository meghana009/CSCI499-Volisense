cbs is still employing ian metrose the senior network executive who in 2017 acted as a go between for an lapd captain accused of leaking confidential information about sexual assault allegations filed against then ceo les moonves thewrap has learned metrose a 20 year veteran of the network who serves as svp of talent relations and special events was one of a handful of cbs executives named last week in a report by new york attorney general letitia james but the only one still working there the report is the basis for a 24 5 million settlement that paramount global and moonves agreed to pay to cbs shareholders over moonves 2018 ouster after the sex abuse claims finally came to light according to james report metrose was an intermediary between a now retired lapd captain and senior cbs executives to obtain unredacted confidential police reports which they used to suppress news about the accusations against moonves for weeks and which they had no legal right to see in the first place a rep for the network declined to comment beyond confirming that metrose is still a cbs employee as of friday a source close to the network said that metrose was put in an untenable situation by his superiors at the time in november 2017 as the metoo movement was hitting its crescendo metrose was contacted by the lapd captain later identified as cory palka who had worked for moonves as a bodyguard at the grammy awards from 2008 to 2014 the lapd last week confirmed an investigation into palka a former captain of the hollywood division according to the new york attorney general s report palka left metrose a voicemail just hours after moonves female accuser filed her report hey ian it s i know we haven t talked in a while somebody walked in the station about a couple hours ago and made allegations against your boss regarding a sexual assault it s confidential as you know but call me and i can give you some of the details and let you know what the allegation is before it goes to the media or gets out so all right talk to you after a while bye the woman s police report was officially marked as confidential meaning the accuser affirmatively did not want any of its details distributed publicly or privately but through metrose via palka the unreacted document with all the details including the accuser s identity were soon in the hands of top cbs executives including moonves communications gil schwartz who died in 2019 and head of hr anthony ambrosio using code words and secretive text messaging apps the inner circle at the network schemed for weeks to keep the allegations out of the press according to the report which said metrose brokered an in person meeting between moonves and palka and at one point had telephone conversations with the officers directly investigating the case moonves was ousted as cbs ceo in september 2018 months after two bombshell reports by ronan farrow in the new yorker in which a dozen women accused the mogul of sexual assault and or harassment ambrosio was was ousted in november of that year for his own involvement with a 6 million golden parachute james report and the settlement it generated were related to securities fraud and insider trading it said that the attempted concealment of the allegations which executives knew would harm shareholder value and the authorized sale of nearly 8 5 million of cbs stock by schwartz before the allegations became public violated new york state s blue sky laws last week lapd chief michel moore announced an investigation into palka for allegedly leaking the documents to cbs brass which is a direct violation of california s constitutional confidentiality laws what is most appalling is the alleged breach of trust of a victim of sexual assault who is among the most vulnerable by a member of the lapd chief michel moore said in a statement this erodes the public trust and is not reflective of our values as an organization on thursday leah remini tweeted a long thread that named palka as the officer who handled a missing person report says she filed for shelly miscavige wife of scientology leader david miscavige in 2013 remini said palka had her report closed within hours and without explanation but on friday evening a twitter account for the lapd s public information officer sent a news release saying officers had located shelly miscavige determined that she was alive and safe and had closed the case the release also said palka was not involved lapd news lapd responds to comments made by leah remini pic twitter com ri6ryp53r5 lapd pio lapdpio november 12 2022 thom geier contributed to this report
while elevated mortgage rates sluggish home sales and high inflation have taken a significant toll on the housing industry it s unlikely that these issues will cause home prices to drop next year at least according to national association of realtors nar chief economist lawrence yun in fact we may see a further uptick in home prices in 2023 even if mortgage rates stay at or near 7 yun said yun who analyzed the current state of the residential market offered his 2023 market outlook on friday at the nar conference in orlando for most parts of the country home prices are holding steady since available inventory is extremely low yun said some places are experiencing price gains while some places most notably in california are seeing prices pull back while the unprecedented uptick in mortgage rates led to a lack of demand from buyers it has also acted as a deterrent for homeowners who are hesitant to list their homes for sale in a tough market in turn purchase inventory levels have stayed low in most markets the housing market conditions are also fundamentally different than they were during the great recession according to yun as such it s unlikely that there will be a significant increase in distressed property inventory on the market or a subsequent decline in housing prices in the near future here s how home price appreciation impacts taxes and what that means for servicers real estate prices and home appreciation have been on a tear over the past few years but sooner or later all this good fortune will translate into higher assessments and tax increases here s what servicers should be doing to anticipate tax issues this year presented by lereta housing inventory is about a quarter of what it was in 2008 yun said distressed property sales are almost non existent at just 2 and nowhere near the 30 mark seen during the housing crash short sales are almost impossible because of the significant price appreciation of the last two years plus there are signs that mortgage rates have topped out at 7 yun noted one such example is the october consumer price index which showed that inflation is rising less than expected but while yun expects to see an increase of 1 in the national median home price next year he noted that some markets will experience price gains while others will experience price declines yun also expects home sales to decline by 7 in 2023 however he expects 2024 to result in a strong rebound for home sales with a projected increase of 10 in home sales and a 5 increase in the national median home price while the 2023 outlook was positive overall yun did express concern over the spread between mortgage rates and the federal funds rate the gap between the 30 year fixed mortgage rate and the government borrowing rate is much higher today than it has been historically yun said if we didn t have this large gap mortgage rates wouldn t be 7 they would be 5 8 a normal spread would revive the economy if inflation disappears then we d see less anxiety within the financial markets and lower interest rates which would allow owners to refinance he also noted that this year s housing market downturn has had an outsized impact on the nation s overall economic performance the slide in sales and home building has down gdp yun said if the housing market was stabilizing and not declining gdp would be positive some other forecasts expect home sales to fall in 2023 including goldman sachs whose economists expect home prices to fall by 5 to 10 next year

california is poised to reduce payments to homes and businesses that go solar for clean electricity they supply to the power grid a landmark shift in how the state promotes a crucial technology for fighting climate change the public utilities commission s proposal would keep the payment rates higher at least for a few years than a previous plan that faced sharp criticism from the solar industry and climate activists advertisement but it could still have dramatic ripple effects in the burgeoning rooftop solar market as the golden state struggles to phase out planet warming fossil fuels while avoiding blackouts and keeping electricity bills from spiraling out of control and it s sure to spark a bitter fight in sacramento as rooftop solar installers monopoly utility companies and labor unions whose members build large scale solar farms duke it out over the best way for california to confront the climate crisis already the new plan is generating criticism from both the solar industry and a group backed by southern california edison and other utilities the utilities say low income households are being forced to subsidize wealthier solar customers advertisement the california solar storage assn estimated that new solar customers would be paid a base rate of 5 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity that they don t use at home sending it to the larger power grid down from as much as 30 cents now newsletter your guide to our clean energy future get our boiling point newsletter for the latest on the power sector water wars and more and what they mean for california enter email address sign me up you may occasionally receive promotional content from the los angeles times bernadette del chiaro the trade group s executive director said in an email that the new plan would protect utility monopolies and boost their profits while making solar less affordable and delaying the goal of 100 clean energy advertisement california needs more solar power and more solar charged batteries not less she said but in a change likely to benefit the rooftop solar industry new solar customers wouldn t have to pay an 8 per kilowatt monthly fee that was part of the previous proposal a charge that would have amounted to 48 per month or 576 per year for a home with a six kilowatt system workers with the nonprofit grid alternatives install solar on a low income home in watts in 2021 gary coronado los angeles times and for most solar homes the reduced payment rates would be supplemented by additional incentives during the first decade of a rooftop system s operation higher incentives than contemplated under the previous proposal that money would be available to households that go solar for the first five years after the decision is adopted an increase from four years in the previous plan advertisement homes that go solar earlier in the five year window would lock in higher incentives the state s investor owned utility companies edison pacific gas electric and san diego gas electric a sempra energy subsidiary have pushed state officials to slash incentives for rooftop solar panels which undercut their lucrative business model and they weren t happy with the changes proposed thursday in a written statement the affordable clean energy for all campaign which is funded by the three monopoly utilities said the new proposal fails to make the meaningful reform necessary to ensure that all electricity customers those with rooftop solar and those without pay their fair share of the costs for maintaining the electric grid it is extremely disappointing that under this proposal low income families and all customers without solar will continue to pay a hidden tax on their electricity bills to subsidize rooftop solar for mostly wealthier californians said kathy fairbanks a spokesperson for the utility backed campaign advertisement the failure to finally eliminate the growing cost burden carried by non solar customers in california is particularly troublesome given the billions of dollars in new federal clean energy subsidies that will ensure continued growth and healthy profits for large solar corporations for the next decade she added the rooftop solar industry was similarly frustrated by the proposal del chiaro urged gov gavin newsom and his appointees on the utilities commission to make further adjustments to help more middle and working class consumers as well as schools and farms access affordable reliable clean energy better than ridiculously awful is hardly something to cheer she added via text referring to the previous proposal advertisement support our journalism your support helps us deliver the news that matters most subscribe to the los angeles times subscribe another trade group the national solar energy industries assn issued a disappointed but less fiery written statement the group s president abigail ross hopper applauded state officials for dropping the previously proposed monthly fee on solar customers but said that additional work is needed to ensure a more gradual transition so that all californians including schools farms and low income residents can adopt solar and storage congress just passed the inflation reduction act which is the largest clean energy investment in our nation s history she said our progress now depends on states taking the baton and advancing policies to rapidly deploy clean energy and decarbonize the grid california should be at the front of the pack advertisement wind turbines in the tehachapi mountains supply the los angeles department of water and power irfan khan los angeles times homes and businesses that already have solar panels wouldn t be affected by the changes to california s net metering incentive program neither would utility customers who add solar panels within the first few months after the new rules are adopted the changes would affect only edison pg e and sdg e customers homes and businesses served by the los angeles department of water and power and other city run electric utilities would continue to have access to existing solar incentives advertisement david hochschild who leads another state agency the california energy commission described the proposal as a haircut for the rooftop solar industry he said the plan is vastly improved from the previous version and would ensure that newly built homes which are required to have solar panels would still save money in the long run that was very much in jeopardy with the last decision and our team has looked at that and found that s not an issue here hochschild said in an interview a vote by the five member utilities commission is expected as soon as next month california needs all the climate friendly power it can get power plants fueled by natural gas generate more than one third of the state s electricity even as solar and wind energy continue to grow gas plants are especially valuable on hot summer evenings getting hotter as the planet heats up when people come home from work and crank up their air conditioners even as the sun goes down and solar panels stop generating california has had trouble keeping the lights on some of those evenings advertisement solar panels paired with batteries are one solution enabling households to stay powered with clean electricity generated during the afternoon without straining the power grid more than 1 5 million homes businesses and other utility customers in california have gone solar an increasing number are installing batteries too as prices begin to drop last december s proposal from the public utilities commission was met with fury from climate activists and solar companies who said the changes would undermine a successful renewable energy program and crash the solar industry they pressured newsom to lean on his appointees which he did prompting the utilities commission to reconsider its decision several major environmental organizations weren t fully satisfied by the changes unveiled thursday advertisement the center for biological diversity said in an emailed statement that the new plan abandons the hefty solar tax from last year s proposal but still threatens to put affordable renewable energy out of reach for most communities environment california s state director laura deehan criticized the proposal as risky saying in an email that state officials need to make rooftop solar as affordable and accessible as possible so that every household with solar potential can realistically make the choice to go solar sachu constantine executive director of advocacy group vote solar thinks the utilities commission made the right move by eliminating new monthly fees but he said the new proposal doesn t do enough for low income households although it would establish higher incentives for homes enrolled in low income utility discount programs that would cover only families below 200 of the federal poverty line and miss millions of homes that might need help to afford solar panels and batteries they are legitimately low and middle income families constantine said in an interview critics of current rooftop solar incentives including ratepayer advocates and a handful of environmental groups say the net metering program as it exists now could actually make it harder for the golden state to fight climate change advertisement california s climate ambitions require getting more people to drive electric vehicles rather than gas guzzling cars and trucks and persuading them to replace their natural gas burning furnaces and stoves with electric heat pumps and induction cooktops chef bridget bueche one of a growing group of evangelists for induction cooking demonstrates in the snyder diamond showroom in van nuys al seib los angeles times the more electricity rates rise the more expensive it will be for californians to invest in those technologies and rates are rising spurred in part by edison pg e and sdg e spending billions of dollars to stop their electric lines from sparking wildfires advertisement the cost of rooftop solar incentives is just one more factor driving up electric rates and making life harder for all but the wealthiest families some experts say and also making it harder for them to afford electric cars heaters and stoves uc berkeley energy economist severin borenstein said that the public utilities commission s new proposal wouldn t do nearly enough to address the cost shift the amount of money being transferred from non solar households to their net metered neighbors the commission s internal ratepayer watchdog estimates that cost shift will amount to 4 6 billion this year even with new solar customers getting paid less for electricity they send to the grid there would still be a massive cost shift during the first few years of the new program as payment rates slowly decline to give the industry time to adjust advertisement you look at the growth rate of rooftop solar right now this isn t even putting a band aid on the bleeding this is starting to walk to the cabinet to find a band aid borenstein said borenstein thinks rooftop solar ought to be evaluated on a level playing field with other clean energy technologies including large solar farms and wind turbines both of which generate electricity at a lower cost due to economies of scale net metering he believes has given the rooftop solar industry an unfair leg up as california races toward 100 clean electricity by 2045 within hours of the public utilities commission releasing its new proposal stock prices for leading rooftop solar installers surged sunrun inc shares closed 27 higher while sunpower corp and sunnova energy international inc both rose nearly 20 advertisement solar installers and many climate activists contend that the idea of a cost shift onto lower income households is a farce they say utility companies and state regulators have undercounted the savings that rooftop solar brings to all californians by limiting the need for expensive new power plants and transmission lines plus the health benefits of less pollution from burning fossil fuels and the environmental benefits of not needing to pave over as much wildlife habitat to build large solar farms in the desert they also say the technology is not exclusively for the wealthy even though solar customers are still mostly higher income new data from lawrence berkeley national laboratory show that 12 of california solar adopters in 2021 had incomes below 50 000 and that an additional 28 had incomes between 50 000 and 100 000 up from 9 and 24 respectively in 2010 advertisement the public utilities commission said in a written statement that its new proposal continues to support the solar industry while it pivots to a solar plus battery storage marketplace which will bolster the local green energy economy the agency pointed to changes to electricity rate structures that it said would incentivize more californians to pair their solar panels with batteries and to operate their systems in a way that would support the larger power grid on the hottest summer days a surfer heads for the water as solar advocates finish writing a 200 foot message in the sand in huntington beach near the site of an october 2021 oil spill the message gov solar not oil was meant for gov gavin newsom urging him to protect the rooftop solar incentive program known as net metering allen j schaben los angeles times advertisement state officials also noted that low income households would receive higher incentive payments for solar power that they send to the grid and 900 million allocated by state lawmakers in this year s budget will enable additional upfront incentive payments for solar panels paired with battery storage systems with two thirds of that money being set aside for low income homes the commission will hold oral arguments on the new proposal next week state officials have had a difficult task in reevaluating rooftop solar incentives state law requires the public utilities commission to balance the costs and benefits of the net metering program while also ensuring that rooftop solar installation continues to grow sustainably the definition of sustainable growth has been a key sticking point in the debate advertisement in its new proposal the commission said it was targeting a nine year payback period the amount of time it takes the average solar customer to make back their upfront investment through lower electric bills payback periods currently hover around five years the utility companies had proposed incentive changes that could increase them to roughly 20 years for homes and businesses that install batteries along with solar payback periods under the new program could be less than nine years in its previous proposal the commission had aimed for 10 year paybacks for californians installing solar with storage in another change to its earlier plan the agency says homes and businesses that already have solar would get to stay on their current incentive plans indefinitely previously existing solar customers would have been switched to the lower incentive rates 15 years after their systems were installed or 20 years for low income homes advertisement

as inflation persisted and stocks wobbled the past three months hardly seemed like cause for investors to grow more optimistic and yet according to recent research that s exactly what s happened a new study by the global investment bank ubs shows that from july to october this year investor optimism actually jumped by 15 the study surveyed 900 investors and 500 business owners in the u s all of them with at least 1 million in assets or revenue from july 5 to oct 17 at the beginning of that time frame just 37 felt optimistic about the stock market s short term future but by the end that number had risen to 52 what s driving this boost in optimism investors pointed to a number of reasons almost half 49 cited the strong demand for goods and services 42 pointed out that employment remains high and another 42 felt the country was returning to normal from the covid 19 pandemic but according to one advisor at ubs there could be another reason a sense that the bear market may be ending soon i think they re becoming a little more optimistic short term because they probably think we re closer to the end of this than we are to the beginning said brad bernstein the managing director of ubs financial services we re probably closer to the seventh or eighth inning of this judging by u s stocks performance in october that optimism appears to have been well founded the s p 500 rose 8 the dow jones industrial average jumped 14 and even the nasdaq which has had a terrible year rebounded by 4 and ubs isn t the only group that s noticed the change of mood cnn s fear and greed index measures investor sentiment on a 100 point scale from extreme fear to extreme greed less flattering words for pessimism and optimism by studying movements in the market from july 1 to oct 31 cnn found that investors moved from a score of 25 reflecting extreme fear to a 62 solidly in greed territory i think they think the market is looking more attractive right now than it has in a long time bernstein said that s not to say investors are optimistic on all fronts outside of the stock market ubs found that 63 were concerned about inflation 56 were worried about the risk of recession and another 56 were anxious about the national debt but in some ways bernstein said bad news for the broader economy is good news for the stock market as the fed pummels the economy with higher and higher interest rates many investors fear this could cause a recession but that may be what it takes to get inflation under control and once that happens investors expect the fed to ease up the economy is going to get worse before it gets better and in a contrarian way i think the stock market is looking for that to happen bernstein said on wednesday evidence emerged that this turning point may be in sight the latest consumer price index showed that year on year inflation has eased dropping from 8 2 in september to 7 7 in october stocks jumped at the news with the s p leaping 5 5 it s still far too early to say whether the economy has turned a corner but the optimism of american investors dovetails with a larger global trend in addition to its u s study ubs conducted a parallel survey of investors around the world while 50 of them were optimistic about the stock market in july by october that number had climbed to 59 how can the average investor take advantage of this rising tide bernstein offered a few answers starting with the simplest no 1 don t sell he said he also recommended shifting portfolios back to a 60 40 balance of stocks and bonds if they re not there already and for taxable accounts making sure to harvest one s losses but most of all he urged investors to talk with their financial advisors it s critical to be educated about how the market works so you don t react the wrong way bernstein said and 2022 is certainly a year when you need help

this aptly sums up the eurozone east asian us relationship in short us hegemony suffice it to say that of all people leon trotsky writing in war in the international 1933 opined that prior to ww2 the us was europe s debtor but now europe was relegated to the background the united states is the principal factory the principal depot and the central bank of the world us ascendancy in the 20th century this much was self evident and true enough but in any case america s hegemony over europe long pre dated ww2 and actually later grew larger with the addition of ex eastern european states which had been formerly part of the soviet sphere of influence western europe had willy nilly long since been subordinated to the usa a while later 1946 the americans gave the british short shrift reminding them that they would have to adjust to the post war realities and take the medicine the american loan as michael hudson explains in effect the sterling area was to be absorbed into the dollar area which would be extended throughout the world britain was to remain in a weak position in which it found itself at the end of ww2 with barely any free monetary reserves and dependent on dollar borrowings to meet its current obligations the united states would gain access to britain s pre war markets in latin america africa the middle east and far east this first loan on the post war agenda which president truman announced in forwarding it to congress would set the course of american and british economic relations for many years to come truman was well aware of the change of fortunes for the uk for the anglo american loan agreement spelled the end of britain as a great power 1 sometime later and under the changed geopolitical and economic conditions president richard nixon and his economist acolytes placed their chief diplomat henry kissinger in charge of arrangements to put in place a policy to keep the europeans subordinate and while they were at it to simultaneously endeavor to put a limit on japanese expansion then came the big game changer gold was officially delinked from the us in august 1971 nixon s currency reforms were designed among various other decisions and also generally aimed at european and japanese interests it should be noted that japan did not play any political role at all but simply followed in america s wake as she invariably did in economic and even political matters since suffice it to say the europeans and a fortiori both the japanese and south koreans had since become thoroughly americanized and house trained most pathetically in the case of japan s geographical position which successfully made it into a long term prisoner of the united states this unilateral decision by the americans to deprive paper money from convertibility into gold was enough to tip the europeans into disorder and turbulence for all their protestations of loyalty in europe the leaders of each country feverishly groped for an outcome that answered their own interests however still licking their wounds and for all their weakness the europeans still constituted a new and serious although declining rival for god s own people american capitalism imperialism which says a lot about how far the former had slid down the slippery slope nixon conferred the job of curbing his partners newly aroused appetites and steering them towards their own backyard to his man and enforcer henry kissinger kissinger was to read the riot act and inform these uppity euro elites that it was the us which was taking centre stage whilst the europeans were just the supporting artists kissinger didn t mince words with his global minions the us has global interests and global responsibilities the enforcer strategist declared our allies have regional interests having thus put the europeans in their place kissinger acknowledged that the us interests diverged with the new weight and strength of our allies but he firmly advised these allies that the gradual accumulation of sometimes petty sometimes major economic disputes must be ended a new equilibrium must be achieved in trade and monetary relations then he called upon the leaders of both europe and japan to subordinate their economic interests to these political considerations organized and directed of course by the usa under the pressure of these scarcely veiled american threats the europeans were meant not just to bury the hatchet over a potential trade war but were in addition and above all expected to share the ballooning costs of global hegemony 2 in the popular vernacular of the time kissinger socked it to the europeans suffice it to say the europeans and a fortiori both the japanese and south koreans had since become thoroughly americanized and house trained most pathetically in the case of japan s geographical position which successfully made it into a long term prisoner of the united states the success of japan s industrial development and export drive so impressive at the time of comparison with competition with europe and the united states did not in any way guarantee that it would move into a hegemonic position investment in japan s trade surplus in the us always struck the reader as being rather overvalued and in a somewhat geopolitical weak position japan economic giant political pigmy certainly the east asian producers and to a lesser degree the eu are still in a position of american dominance both politically and strategically to the united states and most everyone knows this in point of fact the us economy lives like a parasite on its partners in the global system with virtually no national savings of its own the world produces whilst north america consumes the advantage of the united states is that of a predator whose deficit is covered by what others agree or are forced to contribute washington uses various means to make up for its deficiencies for example repeated violations of the principles of liberalism arms exports and the hunting down of oil super profits which involves the periodic felling of the producers one of the real motives of the real war in central asia and iraq but the fact is that the bulk of the american deficit is covered by capital inputs from europe and japan and even china and the global south including rich oil producing countries and comprador classes from all regions including the poorest in the third world to which should be added the debt service levy that is imposed on nearly every country in the periphery of the global system the american super power depends from day to day on the flow of capital which sustains the parasitism of its economy and society the vulnerability of the us therefore represents a serious danger to the american project 3 it should be understood that the american possession of the us can enable them to simply finance their imports by issuing us paper dollars or us treasuries not gold that job goes to the man at the gold window of the fed who will simply give you more paper assets treasuries and dollar bills when you trade in your surplus dollars or gold a neat trick and very successful this exorbitant privilege as was articulated by the french politician valery giscard d estaing was a rent free arrangement between the us and its allies sic this long century has been a period of a long term geo political dominance by the atlanticist bloc led by the united states and its global institutions the international monetary fund imf and world bank wb which has been a fait accompli these two institutions were initially set up during the bretton woods conference in 1944 principally by the us but with the uk in tow these two world economic pillars were to serve as vehicles to open up trade and financial markets to us exporters and to enable us investors to buy control of natural resources and industry this set the rules for europe and other regions to subsequently join these two institutions leaving no practical alternative means of organizing world trade and investment the world bank s policies included opposing land reform and organizing loans mainly to create infrastructure linked largely to exports not to create self sufficiency the aim was to lock in foreign dependency on us farm exports and other essentials the role of the imf has been to all intents and purposes a financial vehicle which due to its organizational structure and an inbuilt voting system which guarantees a majority on every occasion has been a stranglehold of voting power over its allies and also is able to withhold credits from recalcitrant countries dollar credit is used as a lever to indebt foreign countries and force them to adopt free market deregulation and tax policies which serve us interests the broadest step in this strategy of underdevelopment is to use imf pressure to turn public infrastructure into privatized monopolies by forcing their sell off to raise money to settle trade and balance of payments deficits 4 this was broadly in step with the classical phase of imperialism 1800 1950 based upon the division between industrialized cores and non industrialized peripheries and a related tendency to reduce the latter to a colonial or semi colonial status and 5 the post war phase 1950 1980 involved the victory of national liberation movements china vietnam in south east asia and the middle east still ongoing enabled the peripheries to impose a revision of the old asymmetrical terms of the global system and to enter into the industrial age this period of negotiated globalization was exceptional and it is interesting to note that the world then experienced growth that was the strongest known in history as well as the least uneven in terms of the distribution of what was produced and distributed but whisper it softly there has occurred a slow geopolitical burn which is now not easily snuffed out and which goes from strength to strength this emerging bloc of independent eurasian states led in the main by russia and china and organized in the brics brazil russia china india southafrica and shanghai corporation organization sco represent an alternative system to the glaring global level of inequality and stands out like a beacon of light against the parasitism and orthodoxies of laissez faire extractive capitalism imperialism in more general terms michael hudson lays out a precis of a choice between the two alternatives as follows finance capitalism is de industrializing the us economy and that of its allied nato satellites the destiny of civilization explains that the resulting international diplomacy is not a competition for markets as the western economies are already deindustrializing as a byproduct of financialization and capital s war against wage labour nor a conflict between democratic freedom and authoritarianism but rather a conflict of economic systems juxtaposing the rentier economics of debt deflation and austerity to socialist state subsidized growth protecting the 99 by keeping the 1 in check 6 appendix i would go further into the work of friedrich engels in his description of condition of the working class in england 1844 where he writes of his journey particularly in manchester in the north of england as well as other cities a horde of ragged women and children swarm about here as filthy as the swine they thrive upon the garbage heaps and in the puddles in short the whole rookery slum housing furnishes such a hateful and repulsive spectacle as can hardly be equaled in the worst court of the irk the sub human race that lives in these ruinous cottages behind broken windows mended with oilskin sprung doors and rotten door posts or in the dark wet cellars in measureless filth and stench in this atmosphere penned in as if with a purpose this race must have nearly reached the lowest stage of humanity but what must one think when he hears in at each of these pens containing at most 2 rooms a garret and perhaps a cellar where on the average twenty human beings live that in the whole region for which 120 persons one usually inaccessible privy toilet and that in spite of all the preachings of the physicians and also in spite of the wretched conditions into which the cholera epidemic which plunged the sanitary police engels goes on and on until it becomes virtually impossible and painful to read further yet this is the condition of those poor wretches in today s third world who live among the conditions in bangladesh or the cameroons or bolivia or liberia or senegal or wherever the world has a long way to go notes 1 super imperialism

cbs is still employing ian metrose the senior network executive who in 2017 acted as a go between for an lapd captain accused of leaking confidential information about sexual assault allegations filed against then ceo les moonves thewrap has learned metrose a 20 year veteran of the network who serves as svp of talent relations and special events was one of a handful of cbs executives named last week in a report by new york attorney general letitia james but the only one still working there the report is the basis for a 24 5 million settlement that paramount global and moonves agreed to pay to cbs shareholders over moonves 2018 ouster after the sex abuse claims finally came to light according to james report metrose was an intermediary between a now retired lapd captain and senior cbs executives to obtain unredacted confidential police reports which they used to suppress news about the accusations against moonves for weeks and which they had no legal right to see in the first place a rep for the network declined to comment beyond confirming that metrose is still a cbs employee as of friday a source close to the network said that metrose was put in an untenable situation by his superiors at the time also read lapd investigating captain accused of leaking les moonves sexual assault accusations to cbs in november 2017 as the metoo movement was hitting its crescendo metrose was contacted by the lapd captain later identified as cory palka who had worked for moonves as a bodyguard at the grammy awards from 2008 to 2014 the lapd last week confirmed an investigation into palka a former captain of the hollywood division according to the new york attorney general s report palka left metrose a voicemail just hours after moonves female accuser filed her report hey ian it s i know we haven t talked in a while somebody walked in the station about a couple hours ago and made allegations against your boss regarding a sexual assault it s confidential as you know but call me and i can give you some of the details and let you know what the allegation is before it goes to the media or gets out so all right talk to you after a while bye the woman s police report was officially marked as confidential meaning the accuser affirmatively did not want any of its details distributed publicly or privately but through metrose via palka the unreacted document with all the details including the accuser s identity were soon in the hands of top cbs executives including moonves communications gil schwartz who died in 2019 and head of hr anthony ambrosio using code words and secretive text messaging apps the inner circle at the network schemed for weeks to keep the allegations out of the press according to the report which said metrose brokered an in person meeting between moonves and palka and at one point had telephone conversations with the officers directly investigating the case also read leslie moonves and paramount to pay cbs shareholders 24 5 million to settle insider trading sexual misconduct claims moonves was ousted as cbs ceo in september 2018 months after two bombshell reports by ronan farrow in the new yorker in which a dozen women accused the mogul of sexual assault and or harassment ambrosio was was ousted in november of that year for his own involvement with a 6 million golden parachute james report and the settlement it generated were related to securities fraud and insider trading it said that the attempted concealment of the allegations which executives knew would harm shareholder value and the authorized sale of nearly 8 5 million of cbs stock by schwartz before the allegations became public violated new york state s blue sky laws last week lapd chief michel moore announced an investigation into palka for allegedly leaking the documents to cbs brass which is a direct violation of california s constitutional confidentiality laws what is most appalling is the alleged breach of trust of a victim of sexual assault who is among the most vulnerable by a member of the lapd chief michel moore said in a statement this erodes the public trust and is not reflective of our values as an organization on thursday leah remini tweeted a long thread that named palka as the officer who handled a missing person report says she filed for shelly miscavige wife of scientology leader david miscavige in 2013 remini said palka had her report closed within hours and without explanation but on friday evening a twitter account for the lapd s public information officer sent a news release saying officers had located shelly miscavige determined that she was alive and safe and had closed the case the release also said palka was not involved lapd news lapd responds to comments made by leah remini pic twitter com ri6ryp53r5 lapd pio lapdpio november 12 2022 thom geier contributed to this report also read leah remini wants lapd to investigate ties between scientology and officer who helped les moonves
by now it is no secret that the innocent facts we learned about thanksgiving in grade school could not have been further from the truth this has pushed many americans to rethink their holiday celebrations or even boycott thanksgiving all together other concerns surrounding thanksgiving s ethical implications have also come into question over the last decade i mean an estimated forty six million turkeys are slaughtered each year for the holiday festivities alone that s a lot of sad gobbles so many have moved towards hosting more sustainable holiday dinners the most obvious way to do this is by cutting out the former star of your meal turkey and replacing it with a meat alternative plus it s not like there is any shortage of new and creative meat substitutes on the market on top of that thanksgiving is arguably already the easiest holiday to be a vegetarian or vegan you can simply skip the turkey and any meat alternatives completely and chow down on dozens of traditional and ethical side options such as potatoes green beans yams salads squash soup and corn nonetheless if you are like most americans you might still want to commemorate your thanksgiving dinner with a beautiful bird but if you also want to respect turkeys in the process you are in luck because there are still plenty of ways to shop for your turkey sustainably

we prepared the following article about the growth stocks in george soros 13f portfolio 4 months ago we don t have to wait 4 months to figure out what would happen if we imitated george soros growth stock picks the original article will be presented in quotations whereas our new comments will be in regular paragraphs george soros is an american investor and the founder of soros fund management whenever george soros makes an investment decision the market notices it in q1 2022 the value of the billionaire s us stock holdings saw a decrease of about 2 billion the decline was driven by a lowering of his stake in rivian automotive inc nasdaq rivn and the closing of some of the major holdings such as ihs markit ltd george soros was right about trimming his market exposure dumping his ihs position whose stock lost 40 of its value and cutting his stake in rivian automotive rivn which lost a quarter of its value keeping in view the current economic situation george soros discouraged investors from investing in china as the country s real estate boom was dying down as reported by cnn in february soros stated that the unsustainable model had enticed many to invest in property and real estate companies at a time when china was finding itself in the middle of an economic crisis to support his perspective the billionaire discussed the case of evergrande a real estate group in china that is struggling to repay its liabilities due to stringent national policies george soros was also right about chinese stocks as chinese heavyweights like alibaba baba lost a third of its value since the end of the first quarter despite the economic certainty soros fund management has not taken refuge in defensive stocks like most investment firms in q1 2022 instead the hedge fund has initiated new positions or increased its holdings in growth stocks that have been outperforming the broader market the fund s chief executive and chief investment officer dawn fitzpatrick stated that even though inflation is rising at a faster rate than the increase in wages us consumer still has enough money to settle their credit card debts in an interview with bloomberg fitzpatrick appeared unfazed by the inevitable recession and added that rate increases will slow the economy and will impact inflation but this economy has some shock absorbers built in fitzpatrick was proven right over the last 6 months we haven t seen any increase in unemployment rate and the us consumers are still very strong yet the inflation rate finally started to come down on the other hand growth stocks haven t been doing well since the end of the first quarter out of the ten stocks covered in this article soros fund management has increased its stake in eight stocks either by initiating a new position or adding to its previous holdings unlike warren buffett who believes in value investing in entities with strong fundamentals and financials with a long term investment horizon soros is a contrarian and speculative investor who relies on short term movements in the market some of the notable names included in soros q1 2022 portfolio are alphabet inc nasdaq goog amazon com inc nasdaq amzn and

the list comprises the best publicly listed investment ideas across every sector of the economy the company has a bright outlook as it has been reported that the cupertino california based tech giant

aptiv plc nyse aptv is expected to be a beneficiary of faster ev adoption aptiv plc nyse aptv was mentioned in the q1 2022 investor letter of clearbridge investments here s what the firm said the acceleration in electrification of transport should support electric vehicle ev related stocks like aptiv nyse aptv which came under pressure in the quarter on concerns the auto cycle is past its peak aptiv provides a range of solutions for the auto industry including autonomous driving technologies safety technologies components and wiring the large exposure of aptv to evs should lead to long term value as evs continue their growth boosted by their relative attractiveness as prices at the pump hit near historic highs aptiv plc nyse aptv was held by 48 elite funds at the end of q1 2022 7 intuit

14 7 intuit inc nasdaq intu is a palo alto california based software corporation that specializes in developing financial software on may 25 brad reback at stifel gave intuit inc nasdaq intu stock a buy rating with a price target of 465 the analyst highlighted that the company delivered strong q3 fy22 results despite a weak tax season the impact of the weak tax season was countered by the strong performance of the company s two brands credit karma and mailchimp during the earnings calls the management reiterated several times that the business is not getting impacted by economic uncertainty however intuit inc nasdaq intu is still exposed to a slowdown in the overall economy despite the size and diversity of its offerings ranging from mint quickbooks and turbotax following the quarterly results intuit inc nasdaq intu also raised its fy22 eps guidance baron funds discussed its stance on intuit inc nasdaq intu in its q1 2022 investor letter here s what the firm said at the company specific level with 59 of our holdings posting double digit declines during the quarter we had no chance to hold up against the index that was down less than 5 the good news is that for the most part this draw down did not result in a permanent loss of capital and in many cases we believe fundamentals have remained robust or improved even though stock prices declined one example is intuit nasdaq intu the leading provider of accounting software and our second largest detractor in the quarter the stock lost 25 of its value or over 45 billion due to a miss in quarterly revenues which was driven by a slower start to the tax season leading the company to miss consensus estimates for consumer revenues by about 190 million the slower start to the tax season is of course insignificant to the intrinsic value of the business as everyone knows there are only two certainties in life and one of them is taxes and so naturally intuit reaffirmed its annual projections moreover results in other segments were ahead of expectations ceo sasan goodarzi explained the outperformance during its quarterly conference call by saying we have a nearly 300 billion addressable market driven by tailwinds that include a shift to virtual solutions an acceleration to online and omni channel capabilities and digital money offerings this combined with the team s excellence and execution is contributing to the strength of our performance more specifically intuit is gaining market share in tax filings we are on track to gain share overall again this season continues expanding its quickbooks online offering which was up 35 year over year and is seeing strong synergies from its credit karma acquisition driven by intuit s lightbox technology which allows better personalization of offerings to customers for example it doubles the average approval rate for members who apply for credit cards on credit karma versus outside of credit karma the bottom line is that our estimates of intuit s intrinsic value were up while the stock price was down and therefore our future expected return has increased overall 82 funds held a stake in intuit inc nasdaq intu at the end of q1 2022 6 indie semiconductor inc nasdaq indi number of hedge fund holders 17 soros fund management s holdings 34 018 000 percentage of soros fund management s portfolio 0 51 stock price as of june 30 6 18 return

exploration development and production of petroleum and natural gas in thailand and in turkey and is pursuing further inorganic growth in southeast asia oil and gas advisories contingent resources disclosed in this announcement are based on an independent evaluation conducted by the independent petroleum engineering firm netherland sewell associates inc nsai with an effective date of march 31 2022 the nsai estimates of resources were prepared using guidelines outlined in the canadian oil and gas evaluation handbook and in accordance with national instrument 51 101 standards of disclosure for oil and gas activities the contingent resources estimates disclosed in this announcement are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated contingent resources will be recovered contingent resources contingent resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated as of a given date to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under development but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies contingencies are conditions that must be satisfied for a portion of contingent resources to be classified as reserves that are a specific to the project being evaluated and b expected to be resolved within a reasonable timeframe contingent resources are further categorised according to the level of certainty associated with the estimates and may be sub classified based on a project maturity and or characterised by their economic status there are three classifications of contingent resources low estimate best estimate and high estimate best estimate is a classification of estimated resources described in the canadian oil and gas evaluation handbook as the best estimate of the quantity that will be actually recovered it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate if probabilistic methods are used there should be at least a 50 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate the project maturity subclasses include development pending development on hold development unclarified and development not viable all of the contingent resources disclosed in this announcement are classified as either development pending or development unclarified development pending is defined as a contingent resource where resolution of the final conditions for development is being actively pursued development unclarified is defined as a contingent resource that requires further appraisal to clarify the potential for development and has been assigned a lower chance of development until commercial considerations can be clearly defined chance of development is the likelihood that an accumulation will be commercially developed conversion of the development pending contingent resources referred to in this announcement to reserves is dependent upon a final investment decision for the oil development of the rossukon field the major positive factors relevant to the estimate of the development pending contingent resources are the successful appraisal of the rossukon field through existing drilled and tested wells and the existing thailand government approved development plan which is economically attractive at current product prices and capital cost estimates the major negative factor relevant to the estimate of the contingent resources is the pending nature of a finalised development plan and a final investment decision required to proceed with development if these contingencies are successfully addressed some portion of these contingent resources may be reclassified as reserves the nsai estimates have been risked using the chance of development to account for the possibility that the contingencies are not successfully addressed due to the early stage of development for the development unclarified resources nsai did not perform an economic analysis of these resources as such the economic status of these resources is undetermined and there is uncertainty that any portion of the contingent

roses or any number of days or weeks for the reds again all these decisions are based on the terroir the conditions of the grapes the clones and the style of wine that is to be made then there is the

crypto regulation in the u s has been hard to navigate and regulators have so far failed to provide a workable framework for how these services can be offered in a safe transparent way argues coinbase ceo brian armstrong this spurs crypto operations to set up shop outside the u s where regulation and enforcement are often weaker ftx until recently one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world declared bankruptcy friday after revelations about its business practices led to a surge of customer withdrawals without sufficient funds to fulfill those withdrawals coinbase doesn t have any material exposure to ftx but i have a lot of sympathy for everyone involved in the current situation it s stressful any time there is potential for customer loss in our industry and a lot of people are losing a lot of money as a result of ftx s struggles it s also important to be clear about why this happened and what needs to change if we want to prevent something like it from happening again get tri state area news and weather forecasts to your inbox sign up for nbc new york newsletters ftx s downfall appears to be the result of risky unethical business practices including conflicts of interest between deeply intertwined entities and decisions to lend customer assets without permission it s worth noting that these activities happen in traditional financial markets as well and in fact blockchain technology will make it easier to track and prosecute over time in the wake of this week s events we re already seeing calls for more regulation of the crypto industry with tighter restrictions on access and innovation the problem is that so far u s regulators have refused to provide clear sensible regulations for crypto that would protect consumers crypto regulation in the u s has been hard to navigate and regulators have so far failed to provide a workable framework for how these services can be offered in a safe transparent way this means that a swathe of crypto based financial products including lending margin trading short selling and other tools that are fully legal and regulated in traditional financial markets are all but outlawed in the u s entrepreneurial teams building new decentralized products are afraid to build out of the u s for fear of litigation they don t want to break the rules and right now they don t know what the rules are as a result american consumers and advanced traders alike have been engaging with risky offshore platforms outside the jurisdiction and protection of u s regulators today more than 95 of crypto trading activity happens on overseas exchanges part of the reason ftx was able to do what it did was because it operates in the bahamas a tiny island country with very little regulatory oversight and ability to oversee financial services businesses did regulators force ftx to conduct itself in the way it did no but they did create a situation where ftx could take dangerous risks with no repercussions instead of putting in place clear guidelines for crypto u s regulators have focused on regulation by enforcement going after u s based companies for not following the rules without actually establishing what those rules are coinbase itself fell victim to this practice earlier this year when the sec accused the company of listing unregistered securities a charge that we strongly deny it s bad for u s competitiveness and bad for americans who lose money when overseas firms collapse all of this helps explain why more heavy handed regulation would just make the problem of crypto companies and crypto users going overseas worse instead we need smarter regulation that protects consumers and makes the u s a more attractive place for crypto companies to operate despite the prevailing notion that crypto companies don t want to be regulated many if not most companies have been working with policymakers for years those of us who care about the future of crypto want to create sensible regulation for centralized exchanges and custodians in the u s and other regions over the long term the crypto industry has an opportunity to build a better system using decentralized finance and self custodial wallets that don t rely on trusting third parties like exchanges instead customers will be able to trust code and math and everything can be publicly auditable on the blockchain until then however regulators need to establish clear rules that bring crypto back on shore encourage innovation and protect consumers the u s has always prided itself on being at the vanguard of new technologies and industries with more than 200 million global crypto users and countries beginning to pilot digital currency programs and accept bitcoin as legal tender crypto s time has come now the u s has a choice take the lead by providing clear business forward regulation or risk losing out on a key driver of innovation and economic equality brian armstrong is the ceo and cofounder of coinbase

washington ap the u s will buy 100 000 rounds of howitzer artillery from south korean manufacturers to provide to ukraine washington ap the u s will buy 100 000 rounds of howitzer artillery from south korean manufacturers to provide to ukraine a u s official said thursday in a deal the two governments have been working on for some time the agreement comes as ukrainian leaders press for more weapons and aid to take advantage of a counteroffensive that is pushing russian forces out of some areas they had taken over earlier in the war and it relieves concerns within the u s military particularly the army and the marine corps who are worried that persistent transfers of the pentagon s howitzer ammunition to ukraine are eating into their stockpiles other defense officials confirmed the broad outlines of the contract and said it would help with stockpile pressures specifically involving the howitzer ammunition which ukrainian forces have been using at a high rate last week a defense official briefing reporters said ukraine was burning through as many as 7 000 rounds of ammunition a day while russia was firing as much as 20 000 rounds daily the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the deal had not been made public south korea s defense ministry in a statement acknowledged ongoing talks over exporting an unspecified number of 155 millimeter artillery shells to shore up diminishing u s inventories however the ministry said the negotiations were proceeding under the presumption that the u s would be the end user of those rounds and that seoul maintains its principle of providing only non lethal support to ukraine the south korea agreement provides a sharp counterpoint to u s accusations earlier this month that north korea was covertly shipping artillery to russia it s not immediately clear whether the deal opens the possibility of south and north korean artillery being fired against each other in ukraine north korea has aligned with russia over the war in ukraine while also blaming the united states for the crisis insisting that the west s hegemonic policy has forced russia to take military action to protect its security interests however pyongyang has repeatedly denied u s claims that it has been sending large supplies of artillery shells and other ammunition to russia accusing the biden administration of a smear campaign experts say north korea has the potential to become a major source of munitions for russia considering the interoperability of their weapons systems based on soviet roots they say that the north which has used the distraction created by the war to ramp up missile tests to a record pace could seek to receive in return russian fuel and technology transfers to further advance its military capabilities as it pursues more powerful missiles and nuclear warheads until now south korea had previously limited its support for ukraine to non lethal equipment and supplies in april ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy pressed south korea to provide lethal arms after russia s attack on mariupol seoul s defense ministry confirmed at the time that it had rejected the ukrainian request for anti aircraft weapons citing the south korean government s principle of sending only non lethal aid international security experts have said both north korea and south korea maintain vast stockpiles of ammunition due to the decades long tensions along their heavily fortified and militarized shared border in a statement army lt col marty meiners a pentagon spokesman said the u s government has been in discussions to buy ammunition from south korea s non government defense industrial base the ammunition would not come from south korean military stocks he declined to provide details meiners said any potential sales always take into account the south korean military s readiness and requirements and will not detract from our defensive posture or readiness to respond against regional threats he added that south korea s defense industry regularly sells military equipment and weapons systems to allies and partners including the u s south korea has also inked several recent arms deals with european countries eager to bolster their defenses in the wake of russia s invasion of ukraine including almost 9 billion in multiple contracts with poland to provide f 16 fighter jets training aircraft tanks and howitzers the ammunition deal was first reported by the wall street journal meiners said he could not provide information on how quickly the ammunition could get to ukraine he said the pentagon has regular conversations with south korea and other allies around the world about how best to support ukraine in the war the revelation of the agreement came as russia said it was beginning to withdraw its forces from the key city of kherson ukrainian officials acknowledged moscow s troops had no choice but to flee kherson yet they remained cautious fearing an ambush kherson was the only provincial capital moscow captured after invading ukraine in february a russian withdrawal would mark a serious setback for moscow while giving ukraine a critical launching pad for supplies and troops to aid its effort to win back other lost territory in the south including crimea which moscow seized in 2014 ___ ap writer kim tong hyung contributed to the story from seoul

rep chip roy r texas demanded that congressional republicans be bold in their use of power during the 118th congress as the gop appears poised to reclaim the house in an op ed for the washington post titled leadership is not a title it s an action roy called for his party to use all the tools at their disposal to check president joe biden s white house roy was happy enough with the projected outcome of the midterms the results of which seem likely to put republicans back in the majority after four years away this majority roy wrote offers oversight power and a powerful check currently absent in congress on an administration recklessly wielding executive power roy blasts mccarthy mcconnell still the results fell short of gop expectations where republicans expected a red wave one senior house aide who asked to remain anonymous freely told the epoch times that gop leadership delivered a red trickle republicans should take the meaning of their worse than expected performance to heart roy said in his op ed he echoed sentiments that the results were the result in part of tepid leadership why that happened is not just an academic question for cable news talking heads it s central to charting our next steps he wrote roy also blasted the optics pushed by both senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky and house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif mcconnell roy wrote refused to offer an agenda even panning the effort by sen rick scott r fla to do so and committing the senate to running on an anti biden platform roy here is referencing a feud between mcconnell and scott the chairman of the national republican senatorial committee nrsc as nrsc chairman scott is in charge of gop fundraising and electioneering efforts in the position scott bumped heads with mcconnell over optics with scott pushing an 11 point plan replete with 128 specific policy proposals mcconnell criticized several proposals put forward by scott and instead encouraged republicans to focus on opposition to biden s america little better can be said for mccarthy roy wrote the house leadership play roy said was to offer an eleventh hour tepid and weak commitment to america which few people knew about much less cared about and which said both everything and nothing roy is referencing mccarthy s commitment to america plan which included a litany of policy promises on various issues around the same time roy unveiled his own plan that focused on more populist policies than mccarthy s did the leadership failed to produce the kind of concrete plan and bold strategy the moment required roy added a new approach instead roy said republicans need to take a new approach from the way they ve run things in the house the people s house was designed by our founders specifically to speak for the people that s why we are limited to two year terms and vested with the power of the purse he wrote for us to earn the people s support requires more than the pursuit of money power and reelection for the sake of it roy said that in the past republicans have been unwilling to use all tools at their disposal to fight democrats and the biden white house this roy insisted has to change words are not enough we have to stand for something we have to fight for something fighting for something and moving away from business as usual roy said requires a willingness to take on real political risk to fight for the people republicans should take notes from desantis such a risk was taken by florida gov ron desantis roy said and voters repaid him republicans should take notes roy suggested desantis who won a 20 point landslide victory over democrat charlie crist crushed his democratic competition because he was willing to take such risks roy said congress has been less bold he continued we congressional republicans have taken no such political risk thus far roy contended our leadership has not demonstrated the willingness to use all the tools at our disposal to check a radical white house and fight for the people suffering from its policies he listed a litany of gop concerns including vaccine mandates rampant spending a series of blank checks to ukraine the unprecedented rate of illegal immigration via the southern border and the fentanyl epidemic all of these roy said have not been opposed adequately by the party roy said that now that they seem set to take the majority in the lower chamber it s time for republicans to lead whatever the shortcomings of the returns in the midterms roy wrote these unforced errors need not define us now we have an opportunity to paint with bright bold colors and lead it s time it s time we demonstrate resolve to restore common sense to national leadership and demand that we actually change the broken ways of washington it s time to get back to basics embrace expansive federalism and radically empower the people so that we can agree to disagree and not constantly be at each other s throats one part of the way to do this roy said is to make certain changes to the way congress has legislated in the past he called for congress to only address a single issue in bills to limit the length of those bills some democrat legislative packages have exceeded 2 000 pages during the 117th congress and to balance the federal budget policy proposals roy laid out a series of policy proposals for republicans to take up during the 118th congress among these roy called for changes to the rules about congressmen buying and selling stocks we should restore trust in congress by restricting in particular members buying of securities and stocks roy wrote the issue has grown in prevalence during the 117th congress particularly amid questions about the trading habits of speaker of the house nancy pelosi d calif and other lawmakers roy also said that republicans have to put an end to democrats spending habits during the 117th congress democrats have spent several trillions of dollars three bills alone the 1 9 trillion american rescue plan the 1 2 trillion infrastructure investment and jobs act and the 740 billion inflation reduction act round out to nearly 4 trillion out of taxpayers wallets we must stop spending money we do not have period roy wrote it s causing inflation weakening our security and selling out our children s inheritance it s funding a federal bureaucracy that strains our differences worsens our tensions and erodes our god given liberties we can t just promise it we have to stop it republicans also must do more to counter the department of justice doj and fbi roy contended in a recent 1 050 page report republicans on the house judiciary committee laid out a litany of offenses by the fbi and doj that they said suggested that the department has been weaponized against conservatives investigating and chastising attorney general merrick garland particularly in light of the fbi s unprecedented raid on former president donald trump s mar a lago home has become a top gop priority we must end the politicization and weaponization of government against americans in advance of radical woke ideology roy wrote roy also called for republicans to restore sovereignty and the rule of law by securing the border though border security is largely handled by the executive branch republicans do have tools to force concessions from biden particularly the power of the purse by which republicans could refuse to fund crucial executive departments like the department of homeland security until changes are made roy also said that republicans ought to work to end the assault on reliable american energy in the irrational pursuit of unreliable energy since president joe biden took office in january 2021 the cost of gasoline and other energy sources to consumers has already seen a substantial uptick though biden managed to wrangle prices down a bit by pulling from the united states strategic reserves of oil prices remain substantially higher than they were a year ago republicans have placed the blame for rising costs squarely on biden s anti american domestic energy policies while in office biden made extensive changes to the energy policies of former president donald trump who led america to become energy independent for the first time in decades biden who promised during his campaign to transition away from the fossil fuel industry wasted no time in halting construction on the keystone xl pipeline and placing a moratorium on leasing federal lands to natural gas and oil companies existential questions these and other issues roy contended are existential questions that must be addressed for the nation to thrive to be strong and to co exist as a free people addressing these questions will require more than mere oversight hearings probes and investigations the texas republican wrote we must have large scale church committee style hearings to expose brazen abuses of power from nih to fbi and everywhere in between by so many in this administration he said but he added we must not just expose that abuse of power we must address it oversight alone he wrote is not enough republicans must in addition take full advantage of their power of the purse during the 118th congress it is our duty to use the power of the purse boldly to force the biden administration to the table to make changes roy said wrapping up his op ed roy said in sum we must only support leaders who trust us to do our jobs as elected members of congress are clear about where they wish to take us and who have demonstrated the resolve to take us there leadership is not a title it s an action it s something demonstrated and followed at the time of publication the epoch times projects that republicans have locked down control of 210 house seats to democrats 195 seats 30 seats remain uncalled of those republicans are leading in 11 races while democrats are leading in 19 if these leads hold the house is looking at a composition of 221 republicans and 214 democrats these are concerning numbers for mccarthy who would need to sway all but three members of his caucus to achieve his goal of becoming the next speaker of the house and roy is not the only one who has expressed some reservations about mccarthy s ambitions for the gavel rep andy biggs r ariz spoke for one wing of the republican party in calling not to barrel ahead with mccarthy as

crypto regulation in the u s has been hard to navigate and regulators have so far failed to provide a workable framework for how these services can be offered in a safe transparent way argues coinbase ceo brian armstrong this spurs crypto operations to set up shop outside the u s where regulation and enforcement are often weaker ftx until recently one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world declared bankruptcy friday after revelations about its business practices led to a surge of customer withdrawals without sufficient funds to fulfill those withdrawals coinbase doesn t have any material exposure to ftx but i have a lot of sympathy for everyone involved in the current situation it s stressful any time there is potential for customer loss in our industry and a lot of people are losing a lot of money as a result of ftx s struggles it s also important to be clear about why this happened and what needs to change if we want to prevent something like it from happening again get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters ftx s downfall appears to be the result of risky unethical business practices including conflicts of interest between deeply intertwined entities and decisions to lend customer assets without permission it s worth noting that these activities happen in traditional financial markets as well and in fact blockchain technology will make it easier to track and prosecute over time in the wake of this week s events we re already seeing calls for more regulation of the crypto industry with tighter restrictions on access and innovation the problem is that so far u s regulators have refused to provide clear sensible regulations for crypto that would protect consumers crypto regulation in the u s has been hard to navigate and regulators have so far failed to provide a workable framework for how these services can be offered in a safe transparent way this means that a swathe of crypto based financial products including lending margin trading short selling and other tools that are fully legal and regulated in traditional financial markets are all but outlawed in the u s entrepreneurial teams building new decentralized products are afraid to build out of the u s for fear of litigation they don t want to break the rules and right now they don t know what the rules are as a result american consumers and advanced traders alike have been engaging with risky offshore platforms outside the jurisdiction and protection of u s regulators today more than 95 of crypto trading activity happens on overseas exchanges part of the reason ftx was able to do what it did was because it operates in the bahamas a tiny island country with very little regulatory oversight and ability to oversee financial services businesses did regulators force ftx to conduct itself in the way it did no but they did create a situation where ftx could take dangerous risks with no repercussions instead of putting in place clear guidelines for crypto u s regulators have focused on regulation by enforcement going after u s based companies for not following the rules without actually establishing what those rules are coinbase itself fell victim to this practice earlier this year when the sec accused the company of listing unregistered securities a charge that we strongly deny it s bad for u s competitiveness and bad for americans who lose money when overseas firms collapse all of this helps explain why more heavy handed regulation would just make the problem of crypto companies and crypto users going overseas worse instead we need smarter regulation that protects consumers and makes the u s a more attractive place for crypto companies to operate despite the prevailing notion that crypto companies don t want to be regulated many if not most companies have been working with policymakers for years those of us who care about the future of crypto want to create sensible regulation for centralized exchanges and custodians in the u s and other regions over the long term the crypto industry has an opportunity to build a better system using decentralized finance and self custodial wallets that don t rely on trusting third parties like exchanges instead customers will be able to trust code and math and everything can be publicly auditable on the blockchain until then however regulators need to establish clear rules that bring crypto back on shore encourage innovation and protect consumers the u s has always prided itself on being at the vanguard of new technologies and industries with more than 200 million global crypto users and countries beginning to pilot digital currency programs and accept bitcoin as legal tender crypto s time has come now the u s has a choice take the lead by providing clear business forward regulation or risk losing out on a key driver of innovation and economic equality brian armstrong is the ceo and cofounder of coinbase

black panther wakanda forever advanced ticket sales passed 45 million in the u s with expectations for much higher numbers when it opens this weekend at the same time disney s stock slumped after its head bob chapek reported in a q4 call meager earnings and missed estimates this week though disney added 12 million subscribers streaming has proven to be expensive to maintain and challenging to plan profit outlook kim masters and matt belloni look into what those numbers mean for disney plus warner bros discovery wants to make a new harry potter movie but faces financial and logistical challenges of its own this conversation has been edited for concision and clarity can disney be profitable again kim masters certainly disney lost over 1 billion in the quarter on streaming is really expensive and i don t think anybody has figured out how to make it work where you don t lose money chapek said this is big loss and after that it s not going to be the same and we re going to be profitable fairly soon but i m not sure how attainable that is matt belloni you re not alone the market is certainly not sure how attainable that is because the stock dropped 10 on this earnings and chapek has set a very aggressive goal he said that disney will be profitable by the end of 2024 that s not that far away it s two years from now disney is walking on a tightrope belloni they ve got a big deficit there to contend with because they ve sunk more than 8 billion into this streaming service now and they have not gotten the return on that and the revenue per user of these subscribers is extremely low compared to the competitors that they re in this business with there s many reasons for that they have all these subscribers in india that don t pay very much bob iger priced the service very low in order to get market share very quickly because that s what the stock market was valuing at the time there s been a complete about face on that now they re looking at profitability and disney is stuck here with tons of subs but people not paying very much that s going to change in the u s very soon because they are raising the price of disney it s going from 8 to 11 if you don t want advertising with it they think that the people who stay at that 8 price and want to take the ads are give them another revenue stream which can hopefully help this service get to profitability but it is a tightrope they are walking at least for right now the market does not seem to believe that chapek is going to get to that other side by 2024 masters it is indeed a tightrope that any legacy media company with a streaming service is walking the old businesses that threw off money are fading like broadcast networks and in many cases theatrical windows meanwhile this streaming thing is not really paying and it s really expensive to keep coming up with those original programs that keep people from turning out problem not exclusive of disney masters this is a problem that also afflicts warner bros discovery they also reported earnings their stock has been so low that company is just strapped with debt and in a very difficult time when this transformation is happening the old stuff is fading and the new stuff paying but it s actually leading to losses zaslav wants another harry potter movie masters i was struck when david zaslav the head of warner bros discovery talked about we want to do another harry potter movie he s putting a lot of emphasis on wanting to do theatrical and get the benefit of all the windows that you make money off of when you release a movie theatrically he mentioned i d love to do one if j k rowling is interested that stopped me he gave some numbers about how long it s been since there been a harry potter movie which weren t really correct and he erased the fantastic beast movies which i think did not do anything to help the harry potter franchise belloni if you look at the performance of the fantastic beast movies i think a lot of people would like to forget them because they are diminishing returns and this last one was not very good j k rowling still controls the franchise belloni but j k rowling has been involved in these movies so it s kind of weird to gloss over them this is a very tough situation on harry potter because yes if zaslav could snap his fingers and get a new harry potter movie of course they would do it it s a huge franchise but rowling is still alive and has a huge say and control over what happens to these characters and if she doesn t want to do it she doesn t want to do it masters she s very controversial her views whether trans people are really trans she cannot get off that hobbyhorse so right away there s baggage in addition to whatever was diminished by the fantastic beasts stuff a little too soon to reboot it masters eventually you would want to reboot harry potter but maybe it s just a little too soon and it feels to me the kind of idea that someone who is not necessarily of hollywood zaslav is from discovery but not of this part of the business thinks it sounds great maybe a little more complicated than he imagines belloni absolutely i think he s just looking at the balance sheet and saying oh dc movies do x harry potter movies do x and everything else does a lot less than x so let s do more of x masters yes let s do more of x but it s not so simple

full power tv class a tv lptv and tv translator stations licensed to communities in connecticut maine massachusetts new hampshire rhode island and vermont must file their license renewal applications by december 1 2022 december 1 2022 is the license renewal application filing deadline for commercial and noncommercial tv broadcast stations licensed to communities in the following states full power tv class a lptv and tv translator stations connecticut maine massachusetts new hampshire rhode island and vermont overview the fcc s state by state license renewal cycle began in june 2019 for radio stations and in june 2020 for television stations tv stations licensed to communities in the respective states listed above should be moving forward with their license renewal preparation this includes becoming familiar with the requirements for the filing itself as well as being aware of changes the fcc has made to the public notice procedures associated with the filing discussed below the license renewal application fcc form 2100 schedule 303 s primarily consists of a series of certifications in the form of yes no questions the fcc advises that applicants should only respond yes when they are certain that the response is correct thus if an applicant is seeking a waiver of a particular rule or policy or is uncertain that it has fully complied with the rule or policy in question it should respond no to that certification the application provides an opportunity for explanations and exhibits so the fcc indicates that a no response to any of the questions will not cause the immediate dismissal of the application provided that an appropriate exhibit is submitted an applicant should review any such exhibits or explanations with counsel prior to filing when answering questions in the license renewal application the relevant reporting period is the licensee s entire 8 year license term if the licensee most recently received a short term license renewal the application reporting period would cover only that abbreviated license term similarly if the license was assigned or transferred via fcc form 314 or 315 during the license term the relevant reporting period is just the time since consummation of that last assignment or transfer schedule 303 s application for renewal of tv broadcast station licenses parties to the application some of the certifications an applicant is asked to make in schedule 303 s relate solely to the station and some such as character certifications relate to any party to the application a party to the application is any individual or entity that has an attributable interest in a station this includes all parties whose ownership interest positional interest i e an officer or director or other relation to the applicant confers on that party a sufficient degree of influence or control over the licensee to merit fcc attention for a corporation this typically includes all officers directors and shareholders with a 5 or greater voting interest for an llc its officers and members and for a partnership all partners however each form of entity comes with its own caveats limitations and unique rules for determining attributable interest holders for example limited partners are normally attributable interest holders unless they have been insulated from partnership decisions pursuant to very specific fcc requirements filers should reach out to counsel prior to filing if there are any questions about who the fcc would consider a party in interest to the license renewal application character issues adverse findings and fcc violations pursuant to the fcc s statutory obligation to consider any serious rule violations or patterns of abuse each licensee must certify that neither it nor any party to the application has had any interest in or connection with an application that was or is the subject of unresolved character issues where the applicant is unable to make this certification it must include an exhibit identifying the party involved the call letters and location of the station or file number of the fcc application or docket and describe the party s connection to the matter including all relevant dates the applicant must also explain why the unresolved character issue is not an impediment to grant of the license renewal application applicants must also certify whether the licensee or any party to the application has been the subject of an adverse finding in any civil or criminal proceeding involving a felony a mass media related antitrust or unfair competition charge a false statement to another governmental entity or discrimination the applicant must report adverse findings from the past ten years and include an exhibit explaining the matter in detail and why it should not be an impediment to a grant of the license renewal application note however that a station does not need to report an adverse finding that was disclosed to the fcc in the context of an earlier station application where it was subsequently found by the fcc to be not disqualifying the application form also asks the applicant to certify that there have been no violations by the licensee of the communications act of 1934 as amended or the rules or regulations of the commission during the preceding license term the instructions to the form make clear that this question is only asking the applicant to certify that there have been no formal findings of a violation by the fcc or a court such as a notice of apparent liability notice of violation or similar finding of a rule violation applicants should not use this section to self disclose any violations not previously identified by the fcc foreign ownership and control the applicant must also certify that the licensee has complied with section 310 of the communications act regarding foreign influence over the station section 310 generally prohibits the fcc from issuing a license to an alien a representative of an alien a foreign government or the representative thereof or a corporation organized under the laws of a foreign government it also prohibits a license being issued to an entity of which more than 20 of the capital stock is owned or voted by aliens their representatives a foreign government or its representative or an entity organized under the laws of a foreign country or absent a special ruling from the fcc to an entity whose parent company has more than 25 of its capital stock owned or voted by aliens their representatives a foreign government or its representative or an entity organized under the laws of a foreign country station operations the license renewal application also requires stations to certify that they are currently operational as the fcc will not renew the license of a station that is not broadcasting in a similar vein section 73 1740 of the fcc s rules sets forth the minimum operating hours for commercial broadcast stations in the license renewal application stations must certify that they were not silent or operated less than the required minimum number of hours for a period of more than 30 days during the license term if they cannot they must include an exhibit disclosing the relevant details and explaining why it should not adversely affect the station s license renewal stations must also certify as to several statements regarding radiofrequency electromagnetic rf exposure of the public and workers at the transmitter site stations that were previously renewed and which have had no changes at their transmitter site since their last renewal application will generally be able to certify compliance with this statement stations that have had a material change in the rf environment at their transmitter site must assess the impact of that change before certifying rf compliance and may need to submit an exhibit demonstrating the station s compliance with rf requirements related filings and materials other certifications successfully navigating the license renewal application also requires stations to certify that the rest of their regulatory house is in order for example applicants must certify that they have timely made other regulatory filings such as the biennial ownership report on fcc form 323 or 323 e and confirm that their advertising agreements do not discriminate on the basis of race or gender and contain non discrimination clauses applicants must also certify that they have placed all items required to be in the station s public inspection file in the file and that they have done so on a timely basis public file violations have traditionally been a significant cause of fines at license renewal time as the public inspection file is now online stations should be mindful that third parties are able to easily review and confirm the timeliness of public file documents as with all other certifications in the application form stations must accurately respond and be prepared to provide documentation supporting their certifications if later requested by the fcc eeo depending on staff size one of the items stations must certify is that they have timely placed in their public inspection file as well as on their website the annual equal employment opportunity eeo public file report generally a station that is part of a station employment unit that employs fewer than five full time employees is exempt from these requirements however at license renewal time all stations regardless of staff size must file fcc form 2100 schedule 396 the broadcast eeo program report stations in a station employment unit with fewer than five full time employees will only need to complete part of the form before filing it as a practical matter because of the mechanics of the fcc s filing system an applicant will generally be unable to file its license renewal application until it can provide in that form the file number generated by the fcc when the station s completed schedule 396 is filed certifications for full power tv and class a tv stations only while there is significant overlap between the certifications included in both the radio and tv license renewal applications an important portion of the form specific to full power tv and class a tv stations concerns certifications regarding the station s children s television programming obligations the children s television act of 1990 requires commercial full power tv and class a tv stations to 1 limit the amount of commercial matter aired during programming designed for children ages 12 and under and 2 air programming responsive to the educational and informational needs of children ages 16 and under while stations have been required to submit children s television programming reports and commercial limits certifications demonstrating their compliance with these requirements on a quarterly or annual basis the license renewal application requires applicants to further certify that these obligations have been satisfied and documented as required over the entire license term and to explain any instances of noncompliance stations can find additional information on the children s television programming and reporting obligations in our most recent children s television programming advisory although noncommercial tv stations are not subject to commercial limitations or required to file children s television programming reports such stations are required to air programming responsive to children s educational and informational needs in preparation for license renewal such stations should therefore ensure they have documentation demonstrating compliance with this obligation in the event their license renewal is challenged for class a television stations in addition to certifications related to children s television programming the application requires certification of compliance with the class a eligibility and service requirements under section 73 6001 of the fcc s rules specifically such stations must broadcast a minimum of 18 hours a day and average at least three hours per week of locally produced programming each quarter to maintain their class a status applicants must certify that they have and will continue to meet these requirements post filing license renewal announcements in prior license renewal cycles stations were required to give public notice of a license renewal application both before and after the filing of that application for the current cycle the fcc eliminated the pre filing public notices and modified the procedures for post filing notices these changes modify the timing and number of on air announcements required replace newspaper public notice requirements with an online notice and revise the text of the announcements themselves as a result full power and class a tv stations as well as lptv stations capable of local origination must broadcast a total of six post filing license renewal announcements over four consecutive weeks with at least one airing each week and no more than two airing in any week each of which must air on different days the first such announcement must air within five business days after the fcc has issued a public notice announcing its acceptance for filing of the application on air post filing announcements must be broadcast on a weekday monday through friday between 7 00 am and 11 00 pm local time based on the applicant station s community of license the text of the announcement is as follows on licensee of filed an application with the federal communications commission for renewal of its license members of the public wishing to view this application or obtain information about how to file comments and petitions on the application can visit publicfiles fcc gov and search in public file for those types of stations that do not have public inspection files the on air post filing announcement should instead be on licensee of filed an application with the federal

silent stations these stations should contact counsel regarding how to provide the required public notice certification of compliance within seven days of the broadcast of the last required announcement full power tv station and class a tv station license renewal applicants should complete the statement of compliance linked below and place it in the station s public inspection file lptv license renewal applicants should complete the attached statement of compliance and place it in their station records file online public notice required for tv translator and certain lptv stations tv translator and lptv stations not capable of local origination are not required to broadcast post filing announcements and have typically been required to publish public notices in a local newspaper instead the fcc has eliminated the newspaper publication requirement in favor of online notices requiring such stations to publish written notice on a station affiliated website upon filing a license renewal application a prominently displayed link or tab that reads fcc applications must be posted on the station website homepage and link to a separate page containing the following notice on of filed an application with the federal communications commission for renewal of its license members of the public wishing to view this application or obtain information about how to file comments and petitions on the application can visit this separate page must also include the date the page was last revised the notice and corresponding link to the license renewal application must be posted

30 day period the notice can be removed and if no other applications requiring online notice are pending the webpage should be updated to include the following text instead there are currently no applications pending for which online public notice is required the rules contain specific requirements as to where station applicants that do not have websites should post their announcement these stations should consult with counsel on the proper online notice procedures after publishing the notice the licensee should complete and execute a statement of compliance regarding that publication and place the statement of compliance in its public inspection file while tv translator and lptv station licensees are not required to keep a public inspection file they are required to maintain and make available to fcc representatives a station records file that contains their current authorization and copies of all fcc filings and correspondence with the commission for them the completed statement of compliance should be included in their station records file the full article along with examples of compliance statements can be found at license application renewal reminder note that in 2019 the fcc changed the obligation to file the children s television programming report and place the commercial limits certification in the public inspection file from a quarterly requirement to an annual obligation
wall street rallies for best week since june on rate hopes new york ap wall street piled more gains friday onto its mammoth rally from a day earlier to close out its best week since the summer the s p 500 rose 0 9 a day after soaring 5 5 for its best day in more than two years the dow jones industrial average added 32 points to its surge of more than 1 200 from a day earlier while the nasdaq composite jumped 1 9 markets got a boost after china relaxed some of its strict anti covid measures which have been hurting the world s second largest economy hopes for more growth from china helped not only stocks but also oil prices to rise with u s crude gaining 2 9 to 88 96 per barrel the main reason for this week s euphoria in markets was a report on thursday showing inflation in the united states slowed by more than expected last month that raised hopes the worst of inflation may have passed and the federal reserve can be less aggressive about raising interest rates to get it under control though analysts cautioned high inflation could be slow to fall and some called wall street s big rally overdone what the fed does with rates is crucial for wall street because hikes slow the economy and can cause a recession all while dragging down on stock prices they ve been the main reason for markets struggles this year perhaps just as important as how bad inflation is at the moment is how high u s households see it being in future years that s because too high expectations can trigger a vicious cycle where people accelerate purchases and make other moves that inflame inflation further the fed has said preventing such a doom loop is one of the reasons it s moved so aggressively on rate hikes inflation expectations are currently high relative to history but a preliminary report on friday suggested they re not moving very much the median expectation for inflation in the coming year among households rose to 5 1 from 5 a month earlier according to a survey by the university of michigan expectations for long run inflation meanwhile ticked up to 3 but that s still within the same 2 9 to 3 1 range where they ve been for 15 of the last 16 months high inflation helped knock down the survey s reading for overall consumer sentiment by more than economists expected the consumer is laser focused on inflation and they re feeling it every day said brian price head of investment management at commonwealth financial network i wouldn t expect that we see any upside with regard to consumer sentiment until inflation comes under control the fed has already lifted its key overnight interest rate to a range of 3 75 to 4 up from basically zero in march the likely scenario is still for it to hike further into next year and then to hold rates at that high level for some time the hope for markets is that a softening in inflation could mean the fed will hold the line at a lower less painful level for investors than it would have otherwise they ve been pretty clear all along they were going to front load the interest rate increases price said they need some time to evaluate the data over the next few months traders are increasingly betting the federal funds rate could top out around a range of 4 75 to 5 by early next year according to cme group a week ago they saw a higher ultimate rate as more likely with a sizable chunk expecting something like 5 25 to 5 50 bond markets were closed for trading in observance of veterans day on thursday yields plunged as investors pared back their expectations for how aggressively the fed will raise rates the s p 500 rose 36 56 points to 3 992 93 and its 5 9 gain for the week was its third in the last four and its biggest since june the dow rose 32 49 or 0 1 to 33 747 86 and the nasdaq climbed 209 18 or 1 9 to 11 323 33 both also notched hefty gains for the week the market has routinely reacted with exaggerated swings following each month s inflation data report according to jonathan golub chief u s equity strategist at credit suisse and while thursday s report was clearly a big positive the market s response appears out of sync with the size of the surprise companies that do a lot of business in china and around the region were particularly strong friday following the relaxation of anti covid restrictions wynn resorts rose 8 3 and las vegas sands gained 5 5 tapestry rose 8 7 and ralph lauren rose 9

current house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif was majority leader on oct 8 2015 he walked over to house speaker john boehner r ohio in the cavernous house ways and means committee hearing room on capitol hill house republicans were meeting to select a successor to boehner the ohio republican had abruptly announced he was departing congress after a meeting with pope francis at the capitol a few days before as majority leader mccarthy was in line to succeed boehner the full house would have to elect mccarthy but first the house republican conference needed to settle on its candidate it was thought to be a fait accompli for mccarthy mccarthy whispered something into boehner s ear boehner was surprised and then strode to the microphone with an announcement for the room however no one could hear over the din the hitchhiker s guide to mccarthy s bumpy road to the speaker s suite republican members spilled out into the marble corridors of the longworth house office building the most acoustically challenged location in all of washington a wall of reporters occupied three hallways a bank of television cameras stood tripod to tripod near the foyer of the building between massive columns metal detectors and magnetometers from the u s capitol police beeped at regular intervals as tourists and lobbyists tried to squeeze into the building capitol maintenance workers wheeled by stocks of cardboard boxes on hand trucks gigantic carts rumbled through the hall loaded with office furniture making a ridiculous ruckus nobody could hear a thing least of all the republicans in the room or the reporters in the hallway however a rumor swirled it had to do with what boehner said over the noise in the committee room apparently mccarthy told boehner he was dropping out republicans did not know what was going on but the conference meeting ended without a vote for speaker gossip reigned in the hall future house speaker paul ryan r wisc dashed out of the room with the speed of usain bolt ryan s office then published a statement just as quick to declare that he would not stand as a candidate for speaker congressional republicans reckon with disappointing election results knives are out source says a phalanx of reporters pursued house minority whip steve scalise r la down a spiral staircase asking if he would seek the speakership scalise fixed his gaze on each step so he would not fall and also did not acknowledge the press corps as reporters barked questions whether he would run for speaker some republicans in the rooms were bewildered there were other candidates for speaker in fact there may even be other gopers who would like to have run now that mccarthy was done why didn t the gop just forge ahead with the election however that is not what went down a few days later ryan backtracked after some coaxing ryan announced that he would in fact run for speaker ryan then rode to victory over rep daniel webster r fla many thought mccarthy was a political dead man walking after stepping aside in 2015 to make room for ryan rep jim jordan r ohio even challenged mccarthy for minority leader in late 2018 republicans pointing fingers after weak midterm results direction of party in question something was off however mccarthy s fortunes evolved he brought his rival jordan into the fold there was chatter behind the scenes that scalise may be angling to take on mccarthy mccarthy then had it out on the phone with former president trump as a mob ransacked the capitol on jan 6 2021 mccarthy even said trump bore responsibility for the siege however politics is about reading the room mccarthy quickly recognized that many house republicans heard from constituents who supported the rioters and still embraced the former president mccarthy hustled off to mar a lago posed with former president trump and immediately set about recruiting female and minority republicans for the 2022 midterms mccarthy also knew he had to shore up a schism with the conservative house freedom caucus aligning himself with jordan who used to lead the group was key however there was even a more controversial brand of freedom caucus member on the scene now there were the likes of rep marjorie taylor greene r ga house democrats actually helped mccarthy by giving him a foil the house voted to strip greene and rep paul gosar r ariz from their committee assignments mccarthy then converted their banishments into a cause celebre promising he would reseat greene and gosar on committees if republicans won the house moreover there were suggestions that republicans might return the favor and dismiss democrats like rep ilhan omar d minn from their committees should republicans prevail gop loyalists roared in approval mccarthy also took steps to legitimize greene he took greene on a trip to the border greene was seated prominently behind mccarthy at a september event when house republicans rolled out their agenda for 2023 you reap what you sow mccarthy will soon face pressure from conservatives like greene rep matt gaetz r fla and the gop base to take aggressive action against president biden and members of his administration republicans may be headed for a slim majority in the house once all the votes from tuesday s midterm elections are tallied the entire house will select the speaker and the successful candidate must have an outright majority of the entire house in other words 218 votes out of 435 the house must vote repeatedly until it elects a speaker a vote for speaker has not gone to a second ballot since 1923 before tuesday mccarthy probably had a range of seven to 10 republicans who would not support him for speaker no matter what that number could grow mccarthy may be able to command the votes so long as he can keep jordan in the fold that is to say nothing of former president trump it would not take much for trump to throw mccarthy under the bus especially considering the gop s tepid success on tuesday however there is a reason mccarthy did not become speaker in 2015 when former speaker boehner resigned mccarthy announced on fox news that republicans empaneled the benghazi committee just to undercut the presidential bid of hillary clinton it was as though mccarthy said the quiet part out loud support for mccarthy to succeed boehner was already shaky and some republicans were already looking for a reason to oppose mccarthy they found it in the benghazi remark and mccarthy was toast in that contest perhaps history could repeat itself after being promised a red wave some republicans may be looking for a reason to dump mccarthy tuesday s weak tea at the ballot box could justify some gop opposition to mccarthy for speaker moreover if mccarthy does become speaker he must veer to the right to accede to the demands of the freedom caucus on a host of issue ranging from impeachments to funding the government to raising the debt ceiling in order to make full use of the slim majority in addition the calling card of house speaker nancy pelosi d calif is passing major bills with the most narrow of margins she has done it for two decades heretofore mccarthy has lacked such an accurate vote counting prowess mccarthy could face instant management problems click here to get the fox news app in fact mccarthy s first challenge could come in mid december that is when a bill to avert a government shutdown comes due if mccarthy does not

the world food import bill is estimated to rise to us 1 94 trillion in 2022 higher than previously expected according to a new report released today by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao the new forecast presented in fao s food outlook would mark an all time high and a 10 percent increase over the record level of 2021 although the pace of the increase is expected to slow down in response to higher world food prices and depreciating currencies against the united states dollar both weigh on the purchasing power of importing countries and subsequently on the volumes of imported food the bulk of the increase in the bill is accounted for by high income countries due mostly to higher world prices while volumes are also expected to rise economically vulnerable country groups are being more affected by the higher prices for instance the aggregate food import bill for the group of low income countries is expected to remain almost unchanged even though it is predicted to shrink by 10 percent in volume terms pointing to a growing accessibility issue for these countries these are alarming signs from a food security perspective indicating importers are finding it difficult to finance rising international costs potentially heralding an end of their resilience to higher international prices the report from fao s markets and trade division warns the food outlook report which breaks down food trade patterns by food groups warns that existing differences are likely to become more pronounced with high income countries continuing to import across the entire spectrum of food products while developing regions are increasingly focused on staple foods in this context fao welcomes the approval by the international monetary fund of a food shock window broadly based on fao s food import financing facility proposal as an important step to ease the burden of soaring food import costs among lower income countries the food outlook also assesses global expenditures on imported agricultural inputs including fertilizers the global input import bill is expected to rise to us 424 billion in 2022 up 48 percent from the year before and as much as 112 percent from 2020 higher costs for imported energy and fertilizer are behind the foreseen increase both are particularly relevant in import bills posing strains for the current accounts of low income and lower middle income countries as a result some countries may be forced to reduce input applications almost inevitably resulting in lower agricultural productivity and lower domestic food availability negative repercussions for global agricultural output and food security are likely to extend into 2023 according to fao food trends issued twice a year food outlook offers reviews of market supply and utilization trends for the world s major foodstuffs including cereals oil crops sugar meat dairy and fish it also looks at trends in ocean freight rates supplies of most of these major commodities are at or close to record levels but multiple factors point to tighter markets ahead world wheat production is forecast to reach a record 784 million tonnes in 2022 23 buoyed by significant harvest recoveries in canada and the russia federation that should push global wheat inventories to record levels although the report notes that the accumulations are expected mostly in china and the russian federation while stock levels are predicted to drop by 8 percent in the rest of the world coarse grain inventories are forecast to fall to their lowest levels since 2013 due to inventory drawdowns in major countries as a result of anticipated declines in production global coarse grain production is forecast to fall by 2 8 percent in 2022 to 1 467 million tonnes while it will likely drop in 2022 23 world rice output is envisaged to remain at an overall average level buoyed by resilient planting levels in asia and recovering output in africa global oilseed production is forecast to rebound and reach an all time high in the 2022 23 marketing year with increased outputs of soybean and rapeseed expected to offset a likely drop in sunflower seed production global sugar production is also forecast to increase buoyed by expectations of a significant recovery in brazil s production and larger crops in china and thailand while consumption is seen growing at a slower pace worldwide outputs of meat and dairy products in 2022 are both expected to increase modestly while total fisheries and aquaculture production is expected to increase globally by 1 2 percent with a 2 6 percent expansion in aquaculture output anticipated to more than offset a slight fall in capture fisheries output source fao

messages in companywide memos he also sent out thursday in one email musk described the dire economic circumstances the company was in and how important he believed its subscription service twitter blue was to its future according to the guardian without significant subscription revenue there is a good chance twitter will not survive the upcoming economic downturn we need roughly half of our revenue to be subscription he reportedly wrote all this comes as twitter continued to hemorrhage both advertisers and top employees on thursday the day began with the resignation of three top security officials chief information security officer lea kissner chief privacy officer damien kieran and chief compliance officer marianne fogarty following those departures roth and twitter s head of client solutions robin wheeler also left the company the guardian noted roth served as the head of safety and integrity and had been in charge of addressing concerns advertisers and users had about the

left hard to overstate how gutted twitter s leadership ranks have become kurt wagner kurtwagner8 november 10 2022 with wheeler in particular gone twitter seemed to be on the verge of collapsing in

senior leaders but twitter owner elon musk persuaded her to stay the people said requesting anonymity to protect personal and professional relationships according to bloomberg plot twist i m told while wheeler did indeed resign earlier today elon convinced her to stay kurt wagner kurtwagner8 november 11 2022 but even with wheeler staying twitter remains stuck on a precarious precipice because of an exodus of advertisers who ve been dropping off left and right in part because of pressure from left wing activists and the establishment press both groups say the platform has become overwhelmed with so called hate speech in the wake of musk purchasing the social media network and vowing to modify its overly strict and unfairly applied moderation policies twitter has had a massive drop in revenue due to activist groups pressuring advertisers even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists musk himself revealed in a tweet

could to appease the activists extremely messed up they re trying to destroy free speech in america elon musk elonmusk november 4 2022 it appears the only way twitter will survive is if musk can accrue enough subscribers convince advertisers to stay or both during thursday s meeting musk reportedly sought to do the latter elon musk laid out more of his plans for twitter in a publicly broadcast meeting wednesday assuring advertisers he had noted their concerns about hate speech and misinformation on the site while saying the platform would continue changing rapidly and that some of its new features would fail the washington post reported he repeated that the company hasn t made any changes to its content moderation policies which attempt to keep rule breaking content off the site but said he believes requiring more people to pay to use twitter through a new 8 verification program would lower the amount of hate speech overall the post added but the new paid 8 blue check

in 2022 latin american and caribbean countries are facing the effects of a series of shocks that have deteriorated their investment and production conditions including the global financial crisis economic tensions between major poles of the global economy the covid 19 pandemic the war in ukraine and the resurgence of inflation in a context in which the environmental emergency is worsening and the technological revolution is accelerating numerous analysts and international organizations talk about a series of cascading crises citing among them the crises related to the climate health employment social matters education food security energy and the cost of living all of which have impacts of varying intensity and characteristics on numerous countries including those in latin america and the caribbean the fight against inflation has toughened global financial conditions and increased volatility in financial markets and risk aversion this has raised the cost of debt service further reducing fiscal space and increasing the risk of a recession in the global economy in 2023 the growth rates estimated for the vast majority of the world s countries in 2023 have been revised downward recently by various organizations in the region the combination of external and domestic factors stemming from the policy decisions made or from the absence of such decisions has reduced the capacity for economic growth and quality job creation and hampered its fight against poverty and extreme poverty its economic and social structures have weakened and have fallen into situations that reinforce the inertia of a weak economic performance faced with this reality eclac advocates for latin america and the caribbean to redouble its efforts to both reactivate its economies as well as to transform countries development models centering these efforts around policies for productive transformation and diversification along with a big public and private investment push which would allow for accelerating structural change and technological and digital transformation to achieve high sustained growth and sustainable and inclusive development in that strategy the sectoral dimension is crucial because that is where company strategies business models and processes of capital formation and job creation are defined although the specific sectors should be defined in each national context eclac proposes ten sectors or areas that are particularly promising the energy transition electromobility the circular economy the bioeconomy the healthcare manufacturing industry and the digital transformation which are at the center of innovation processes while the care economy tourism micro small and medium sized enterprises and the social economy are great generators of employment with the ensuing effects on income and the inclusion of disadvantaged social sectors harnessing the potential in these areas entails transforming the region s development model to create favorable conditions for investment growth inclusion and sustainability transformation of this model requires decisive action in multiple areas development planning in order to coordinate policies improvement in governance and the institutional quality of the institutions in charge of the different areas macroeconomic policies to accelerate growth and tackle inflation the construction of welfare states strengthening care systems as a pillar of a rights based social state guaranteeing the rights of especially vulnerable populations mitigation and adaptation vis √† vis the environmental emergency new governance of natural resources implementation of industrial and technological policies and regional integration in the face of the new geopolitics of globalization this is an ambitious agenda but the reality is that this is not a time for gradual or tepid changes ambitious and transformational changes are needed only by boosting the level of ambition can we respond to this quantity of simultaneous challenges and shocks and to the complexity of our region s economies and societies in order to articulate the proposed strategies and policies and to ensure their effective implementation and adjustments to new realities over time new forms of experimentalist governance are needed based on iterative and participatory processes for policy formulation and implementation in some cases new fiscal productive social and environmental compacts will be necessary to surmount the problems of this current juncture and move in the long term towards societies that are sustainable cohesive and resilient characteristics that entail advancing towards the realization of welfare states in the framework of more efficient and productive economies at this time of action for overcoming limitations and harnessing opportunities eclac will present the analyses and proposals summarized in these lines at its most important biennial meeting the thirty ninth session which will take place on october 24

new york ap wall street is tacking more onto its stupendous surge from a day before putting it on track to close out its best week since the summer the s p 500 was 1 higher friday a day after soaring 5 5 for its best day in more than two years the dow jones industrial average was up 21 points or 0 1 at 33 736 after surging more than 1 200 points a day earlier while the nasdaq composite was 1 9 higher as of 3 05 p m eastern time markets got a boost after china relaxed some of its strict anti covid measures which have been hurting the world s second largest economy hopes for more growth from china helped not only stocks but also oil prices to rise with u s crude gaining 2 9 to 88 96 per barrel thursday s euphoria for wall street came after a report showed inflation in the united states slowed by more than expected last month that raised hopes the worst of inflation may have passed and that the federal reserve can be less aggressive about raising interest rates to get it under control though analysts cautioned high inflation could be slow to fall and some called wall street s big rally overdone what the fed does with interest rates is so crucial for wall street because hikes slow the economy and can cause a recession all while dragging down on stock prices they ve been the main reason for markets struggles this year perhaps just as important as how bad inflation is at the moment is how high u s households see it being in future years that s because too high expectations could trigger a vicious cycle where people accelerate purchases and make other moves that inflame inflation further the fed has said preventing such a doom loop is one of the reasons it s moved so aggressively on rate hikes inflation expectations are currently high relative to history but a preliminary report on friday suggested they re not moving very much the median expectation for inflation in the coming year among households rose to 5 1 from 5 a month earlier according to a survey by the university of michigan expectations for long run inflation meanwhile ticked up to 3 but that s still within the same 2 9 to 3 1 range where they ve been for 15 of the last 16 months high inflation helped knock down the survey s reading for overall consumer sentiment by more than economists expected the consumer is laser focused on inflation and they re feeling it every day said brian price head of investment management at commonwealth financial network i wouldn t expect that we see any upside with regard to consumer sentiment until inflation comes under control the fed has already lifted its key overnight interest rate to a range of 3 75 to 4 up from basically zero in march the likely scenario is still for it to hike further into next year and then to hold rates at that high level for some time the hope for markets is that a softening in inflation could mean the fed will hold the line at a lower less painful level for markets than it would have otherwise they ve been pretty clear all along they were going to front load the interest rate increases price said they need some time to evaluate the data over the next few months traders are increasingly betting the federal funds rate could top out around a range of 4 75 to 5 by early next year according to cme group a week ago they saw a higher ultimate rate as more likely with a sizable chunk expecting something like 5 25 to 5 50 bond markets are closed for trading in observance of veterans day on thursday yields plunged as investors pared back their expectations for how aggressively the fed will raise rates the s p 500 is heading for its third weekly gain in the last four and its rise of 5 9 is on track to be its biggest since june the market has routinely reacted with exaggerated swings following each month s inflation data report according to jonathan golub chief u s equity strategist at credit suisse and while thursday s report was clearly a big positive the market s response appears out of sync with the size of the surprise companies that do a lot of business in china and around the region were particularly strong friday following the relaxation of anti covid restrictions wynn resorts rose 9 1 and las vegas sands gained 6 tapestry rose 9 2 and ralph lauren rose 10 1 to also help lead the s p 500 higher both companies reported stronger profits for the latest quarter

noted honda tuner hondata is working on its modifications for the 2023 honda civic type r before doing that though the company decided to put the bone stock car on its dynamometer to find out how much power it makes from the factory the results are surprisingly good as the new hot hatch makes more power on a dyno owned by hondata which is based in torrance california than it is rated for from the factory according to the tuner the vehicle makes 327 3 hp 244 kw 331 8 ps and 359 53 lb ft 487 4 nm of torque those figures compare rather flatteringly to the ones quoted by honda usa which rates the vehicle at 315 hp 235 kw 319 ps and 310 lb ft 420 nm that amounts to 12 more horses 9 kw 12 1 ps and about 50 more lb ft 68 nm of torque than the automaker estimates more 2023 honda civic type r makes 315 hp goes on sale this fall in the u s as we know different dynos in different locations attached to vehicles operating under different atmospheric conditions will deliver different results this doesn t necessarily mean that honda is deliberately underrating the engine but it is a positive discrepancy that will no doubt please honda enthusiasts and civic type r buyers all the same more to the point however given hondata s records it is able to tell us how much more power the new car makes on its dyno than the last generation civic type r according to the tuner the 2023 model makes about 11 more horsepower 8 2 kw 11 1 ps and 25 lb ft 34 nm of torque more than the 2017 model it tested previously that is close to but greater than the improvement that was officially claimed by honda usa as a reminder the last generation civic type r was rated at 306 hp 228 kw 310 ps and 295 lb ft 400 nm of torque in north america or nine fewer horses 6 7 kw 9 1 ps and 15 fewer lb ft 20 nm of torque than the 2023 model although these dyno results don t vary as widely from the manufacturer s figures as say a bmw it will no doubt be reassuring for buyers to learn that in california at least they will have access to all of the horses they paid for and then some
photo afp embattled cryptocurrency exchange ftx has filed for bankruptcy in the us seeking court protection as it looks for a way to return money to users former boss sam bankman fried has also stepped down as chief executive the company said it is a massive turn of fortunes for the 30 year old who had headed the world s second largest crypto exchange in just over a week his ftx empire has collapsed shaking confidence in the already troubled crypto market i m really sorry again that we ended up here hopefully things can find a way to recover bankman fried nicknamed the king of crypto wrote on twitter on friday i was shocked to see things unravel the way they did 2 i m really sorry again that we ended up here hopefully things can find a way to recover hopefully this can bring some amount of transparency trust and governance to them ultimately hopefully it can be better for customers sbf sbf_ftx november 11 2022 prior to the meltdown bankman fried had been one of the stars of the crypto scene drawing comparisons to investment magnate warren buffett with a net worth estimated at more than us 15 billion as recently as monday but rumours earlier this week that ftx and other firms owned by bankman fried were on shaky financial ground prompted a mass of customers to try to withdraw funds from ftx an exchange used to buy and sell digital tokens facing a cash crunch bankman fried tried to organise a bailout but that failed leaving ftx scrambling to raise billions of dollars and many customers unable to access their money by filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy the company can continue operating while restructuring its debts under court supervision ftx said the goal was to begin an orderly process to review and monetize assets for the benefit of all global stakeholders the ftx group has valuable assets that can only be effectively administered in an organised joint process said new chief executive john j ray iii a lawyer who previously worked at a venture capital firm and has experience with high profile bankruptcy cases in the filing ftx estimated that it had between 10bn and 50bn in assets and liabilities and more than 100 000 creditors the proceeding involves ftx as well as alameda research a trading firm founded by bankman fried and roughly 130 affiliates according to the statement ftx shared on twitter those include ftx s operations in the us which bankman fried had said on thursday were unaffected bankman fried said this doesn t necessarily have to mean the end for the companies or their ability to provide value and funds to their customers chiefly and can be consistent with other routes ultimately i m optimistic that mr ray and others can help provide whatever is best for now thomas culham from kingston said he has been unable to withdraw the 2 000 he had put into ftx a big blow as his funds in ftx were a decent chunk of his investment portfolio it s probably gone the 22 year old said maybe in a few years time i might get some sort of recovery they do have assets they should be able to liquidate them pressure on other firms bankman fried had enjoyed a high profile in the crypto industry and beyond frequently speaking on behalf of the sector before regulators he was a major donor to democrats in the most recent us elections and had gone on an advertising blitz in the country enlisting celebrities such as tom brady and gisele bundchen to convince the public that crypto was a worthy investment but as he became a bigger figure questions were raised about the ties between the different parts of his business empire and potential conflicts of interest between ftx and alameda the troubles at his firms have hurt the rest of the crypto market with currencies such as bitcoin dropping 20 this week and raised pressure on other companies to prove they have the financial strength to stay afloat several companies in the sector had already collapsed or approached collapse earlier this year after a sharp downturn in the

what do bankers need to know about carbon markets blog green finance blog the basic concept of carbon markets carbon markets turn co 2 emissions co 2 e into a commodity by giving it a price these emissions fall into one of two categories carbon credits or carbon offsets which can be bought and sold on a carbon market carbon markets exist under both mandatory compliance markets and voluntary markets because carbon credits are issued by the government or regulators to entities in certain sectors e g aviation and manufacturing in the uk who trade among themselves mostly in the intercontinental exchange ice this market is often referred to as the compliance market voluntary markets however consist of individual organisations or businesses trading carbon offsets compliance markets are created and regulated by national regional or sub regional governments and laws and credits are frequently issued under what is known as a cap and trade program in compliance markets here regulators set a limit on carbon emissions the cap these can be likened to permission slips that allow a company to emit up to a certain set amount of co 2 e that year according to refinitiv the total market size of this market was around 261 billion in 2020 the cap and trade program exists in various countries around the world in the uk this exists as the emissions trading scheme ets program however many other jurisdictions host regulated ets and carbon markets including several asian countries parts of the eu european union 10 u s states including california and new york canada and japan there are also systems being developed or considered in mexico turkey ukraine brazil taiwan and thailand among others voluntary carbon markets function outside compliance markets and let businesses buy and sell carbon offsets to achieve their own goals offsets for carbon operate slightly differently companies that engage in activities that lessen the amount of carbon already present in the environment such as increasing tree planting or utilising renewable energy sources have the option to offer carbon offsets these markets are termed voluntary because the purchase of these offsets is optional however businesses may mitigate measurably the amount of co 2 e they generate even further by purchasing these carbon offsets many businesses currently purchase carbon offsetting to counterbalance the co 2 e they generate and this can be leveraged to enable such entities achieve a carbon neutral status while the voluntary carbon market is largely unregulated and challenging to quantify analysts concur that participation in the voluntary carbon market is expanding quickly according to refinitiv the voluntary carbon offset market is worth around 1 billion however the voluntary carbon market would still fall well short of the amount of investment needed for the world to completely reach the targets set by the paris agreement even at the rate of growth shown above why should bankers care understanding the role of banks in carbon markets there is increasing pressure to develop carbon markets it is generally understood that these markets play a crucial role in driving the net zero transition within various jurisdictions and of course for the world for instance the city uk and pwc report enabling the net zero transition the role of financial and related professional services which seeks to provide guidance on how the financial sector can support and be a part of the transition to net zero highlights the importance of developing carbon markets as crucial to achieving a net zero transition banks typically play a significant role in the compliance markets by offering a liquid market with price certainty and transparency to companies governed by cap and trade programs banks also play a key role in voluntary carbon markets a few banks recently joined the carbonplace project as volunteers to aid in scaling and developing safe infrastructure by the end of 2022 the banks plan to have it completely functioning they want to develop a strong ecosystem to support the offset market and increase the delivery of high quality carbon offset projects among other things in order to give access to a wider range of investors there are also prospects for other capital market solutions such as repackaging carbon credits from regulated markets into structured notes some banks are also looking into capital market instruments that include voluntary carbon credits into sustainability linked loans bonds and derivatives below are some of the major ways in which banks can add value to the carbon market financing project development banks might need to be bold and offer debt financing or blended financing to the project developers creating carbon offsets i e to a greater extent or scale than they do today many carbon projects are relatively small scale with values merely in the hundreds of thousands or low millions of dollars and so would need to grow quickly to meet demand financing capacity development some market experts feel that the market is not ready for financing at the scale offered by banks what is needed are more on the ground project developers beyond financing projects more capital should be channelled into training people to develop projects bridging the information gap banks play an intermediary role between project developers accessing financial support and the market businesses corporates individuals they transact with in their daily operations as such they could help manage the information asymmetry between project developers who look to sell their offsets and the market which constantly seeks more understanding and information about carbon offsets although the point on whether the market is sufficiently developed for banks to efficiently engage remains debateable clearly banks can play crucial roles in developing the current state of the market through core and transformative services in the uk while we anticipate broader market wide changes that would enable banks and other stakeholders to partake in the market we appreciate recent efforts geared towards market advancement we ve recently witnessed the launch of the voluntary carbon market by the london stock exchange which has now established a new market solution to accelerate the availability of finance to projects and support a just transition to a low carbon economy similarly the government has embarked on initiatives committed to building and promoting local and global efficient carbon markets such as the recently held carbon market development roundtable organised collaboratively with the government of ghana despite the benefits of carbon markets credits and offsets it is important to recognise that it should not be entirely relied upon to achieving carbon neutrality more effort from individuals and entities however should be geared towards investing in and promoting efficient processes and technologies that can reduce emissions and produce real change in the economic transition sources what is carbon pricing carbonplace gets more banks to scale carbon trading understanding carbon markets the carbon market a green economy growth tool three banks join initiative for voluntary carbon market platform banks eye opportunities and risks in carbon offset boom uk brings carbon market experts together

treasury secretary janet yellen called october s positive inflation report in the u s a good reading but cautioned against relying too much on one data point janet yellen speaks during her visit to microsoft india development center on nov 11 prakash singh bloomberg core inflation was a lot lower than had been anticipated and that s in spite of the fact that we continue to get high readings on shelter yellen told reporters during a visit to new delhi government data released thursday showed inflation was lower than expected last month the consumer price index rose 7 7 over the past 12 months and by 6 3 when excluding food and energy markets reacted positively to the news assuming it might nudge the federal reserve toward slowing its pace of rate increases after four successive three quarter point hikes treasury yields plunged thursday and stocks gained the most in a day since early 2020 the treasury chief has spoken in recent weeks about seeing signs that inflation would begin to slow but emphasized friday that some sectors would continue to fuel steep price increases in particular housing costs which make up about a third of cpi are expected to add to the pain well into 2023 shelter costs both owners equivalent rent and market rents are going to continue having momentum adding to inflation on the high side for many months she said trade relationships the treasury chief met with reporters just after a set of meetings with india s finance minister nirmala sitharaman to discuss deepening economic and financial ties between the world s two largest democracies part of her message focused on her push to shift critical supply chains serving the u s away from china she noted however that the effort wasn t seeking to simply replace china with another concentrated trade relationship india is a viable alternative to china she said but it s not just about the united states and india it s about more diversified supply chains that will be more resilient and centered in countries that are our friends yellen departs india on saturday to join president biden for the group of 20 leaders summit in bali indonesia biden is scheduled to meet with china s president xi jinping while at the summit a treasury official said yellen will meet with yi gang head of china s central bank to discuss the global macroeconomic outlook and other topics during the summit the meeting was reported earlier by reuters
if you buy through our links we may get a commission read our ethics policy article hero image in the wake of a report about app store data collection by apple a suit has emerged alleging that the company is willfully violating user privacy and monetizing user data without permission plaintiff elliot libman has filed what he hopes will become a class action suit against apple the lawsuit alleges that since apple has some knowledge of what a user is browsing on the app store it is violating a right to privacy that the user holds the suit alleges that research published in november has exposed apple in that it records tracks collects and monetizes analytics data including browsing history and activity information regardless of what safeguards or privacy settings consumers undertake to protect their privacy specifically the suit cites allow apps to request to track and share analytics settings as the main issues that they have with apple apple s practices infringe upon consumers privacy intentionally deceive consumers give apple and its employees power to learn intimate details about individuals lives interests and app usage and make apple a potential target for one stop shopping by any government private or criminal actor who wants to undermine individuals privacy security or freedom through its pervasive and unlawful data tracking and collection business apple knows even the most intimate and potentially embarrassing aspects of the user s app usage regardless of whether the user accepts apple s illusory offer to keep such activities private attorneys we spoke with on friday evening believe that the filer has a tough hill to climb to win the suit it s unclear if the complainant or lawyers who filed the suit understand the distinction between server side data collection and how the settings at the core of the suit work it s also likely that this data that is cited in the suit is collected server side for example video streamer netflix view history is stored server side and tied to an account and collected on the server where the setting for the request not to track does not apply in the case of server side data allow apps to request to track and share analytics settings are irrelevant the part about share analytics is also likely not relevant on its own because app browsing history is user behavior and is not tied to device analytics which are used to determine the state of a device and its internet service when a problem develops and there is prior precedent that app developers and an app store hosting company in this case apple are not one and the same despite the app store being an app the research by mysk that inspired the suit says under ios 14 6 detailed usage data is sent to apple from the app store apple music apple tv and books stocks sent less identifiable information than the other apps the researchers claim the data sent is reportedly associated with an identifier that could identify a user the behavior reportedly persists in ios 16 but the researchers could not examine what data was sent because it was all sent encrypted the researchers did say to gizmodo that similar data was not sent from health and wallet with any combination of privacy settings all data is sent to different servers than icloud s array the suit says there is a cash value to consumers personal information the study cited in the suit is based on sales of data some gathered by hacks and data thefts apple says it does not sell user data and there is no evidence that it does apple is also explicit about how it uses data in its advertising platforms the company is on record saying that its ad platform does not connect user or device data with that data collected from third parties for targeted advertising they also say they do not share user device or device identification with data collection firms the suit alleges that apple has invaded a zone of privacy protected by the fourth amendment and violated dozens of state criminal laws on wiretapping and invasion of privacy the fourth amendment does not seem to apply here it s not clear why data collection by a company that you are doing business with and agreed to data collection in the terms of service of a product in this case both the app store and the iphone itself is a violation of wiretapping laws especially if apple anonymizes or aggregates any data collected by the app store it goes on to cite highly offensive behavior as it pertains to intentional intrusion into internet communications and secret monitoring of private app browsing for apple or any app store to serve data across the internet to a customer as it pertains to app store browsing and purchasing requires at some level the company to know what s being browsed and what s been purchased by any given user much of this comes down to which tech or internet company users trust apple s technology for instance has prevented the filer s isp or wireless carrier from knowing what they re browsing identifiable user data is required for not just the internet to work but paid services like the app store books and music to authenticate and function and support to be given for said services it s clear that the filer does not trust apple in this regard based on the highly offensive color about apple s behavior in the filing as always the suit seeks restitution and all other forms of equitable monetary relief and injunctive relief as the court may see proper a jury trial is demanded it s not clear when or if the case will get heard

niksan defence isn t a name many airgun shooters in the uk will be too familiar with but this company has been going for a very long time in its native turkey niksan began as a small business in the 1970s producing many types of hunting products especially shotguns as well as blank firing signal pistols and fishing products but now it makes multi shot pcps as well the current line up here in the uk thanks to the shooting party includes the elf a bullpup available in either a walnut elf w or synthetic stock elf s the ozark w a buddy bottle fed rifle equipped with a walnut fore stock and a synthetic folding butt stock and the niksan archero s with a name like archero you could be forgiven for thinking this rifle shoots arrows a type of pcp that s very popular in the united states but this pcp definitely fires pellets and it s available in 177 and 22 as the suffix suggests the niksan archero s is clad in a synthetic stock which has an adjustable cheekpiece the rifle features an anti hammer bounce system has an adjustable trigger picatinny rails for mounting a scope and bipod plus a transfer port power adjuster the archero also comes with two 12 shot magazines a set of o rings hex keys gun oil a small cleaning cloth a manual and a test card showing a tight five shot group the package is finished off with the inclusion of a detachable foregrip bipod and a hard case rifle cases are a feature that s often overlooked but this one is nice because it s actually large enough to take the rifle with a scope fitted you might think that all hard cases should be able to do this and you d be right they should but the fact is that some simply don t so kudos to niksan for this and all this for 559 not bad key specification maker niksan uk distributor the shooting party shootingparty uk model archero s price 559 type multi shot pcp calibre 177 tested and 22 action sidelever magazine two drum magazines capacity 12 shots overall length 103cm barrel shrouded with ¬Ω unf thread to fit moderator weight 3 6kg stock synthetic sporter scope rail picatinny length of pull 365mm trigger two stage adjustable trigger pull 3lb safety manual resettable muzzle energy 11 5ft lb additional features hard case and combined foregrip bipod niksan archero s function and form despite its semi tactical looks due to the black synthetic stock the archero is a long slender sporter measuring 103cm from tip to toe length of pull is a little longer than usual at around 365mm this is a feature i love as i have the arms of a gibbon but if you re more slightly built i d advise you to make sure the ergonomics work for you point of balance is roughly half way down the forend making this 3 5kg rifle a tad nose heavy i did try shooting it from various stances but it lends itself best to being shot supported off sticks or better yet from bags off a bench or a bipod when shooting prone talking of bipods as mentioned the shooting party is bundling the archero with a foregrip with a picatinny attachment that features two snap out bipod legs this design is very similar to the type of vertical foregrip that s fitted to some modern battle rifles such as the british l85a3 while a proper bipod would be a better option the shooting party s own adras being a good example the supplied bipod is certainly adequate and it s possible to hold the rifle still in this configuration another thing that s perfectly still is the synthetic stock which is made of a nice rigid polymer the cheekpiece can be adjusted for height by pressing a button on the right hand side of the butt this is another welcome feature but it does make the archero suitable for right handed shooters only as the button sits inside a raised moulding that would dig into your face if you tried to shoulder the rifle on the opposite side having that adjustability is great although the cheekpiece rides on a single pillar and there is a bit of wobble although it steadies itself well when resting your face against it in the aim the forend has a modest amount of stippling and the pistol grip is treated to more of the same neither of which really add very much grip there are no finger grooves on the pistol grip this feature can be a mixed blessing finger grooves that actually fit your fingers can really enhance your hold but if they don t fit your hand properly then they can work against you so niksan s decision to leave them off altogether was probably a wise one the long shrouded barrel sits above a similarly long inline air cylinder there s no lustrous bluing on the metalwork just a dull black but i think that s acceptable for a rifle of this price i m not sure what sound deadening system the shroud has but i found the archero to be reasonably quiet during most of my shooting including shooting indoors with the noise from the action sounding louder in my ear than the bark from the muzzle the shroud is threaded the standard ¬Ωin unf so you can attach a moderator although that will of course add to the length and i decided that i didn t really need one in any case in keeping with many air rifles that are destined for a variety of markets the archero has a power adjuster with the minimum setting delivering just under 7ft lb of muzzle energy i shot it at this level in my garden and found it remarkably quiet and still reasonably accurate out to about 25yds however i used the power setting on maximum which was around 11 5ft lb for the bulk of my testing attaching a scope is pretty easy as the archero has a picatinny rail which although interrupted by the magazine still offers plenty of clamping surface to position your scope for optimum eye relief because the archero is quite a long rifle i decided to fit a suitably long scope and paired the gun with a 6 24 56 sss from professional airgun optics and found the two worked really well together niksan archero s ammo and air filling the rifle up to the recommended 200 bar is achieved using the supplied push in probe the port is protected by a large collar which can be twisted to reveal an access hole alternatively the collar can be pulled off altogether for even easier filling the match style trigger blade can be adjusted using the supplied hex keys but i found the position to be quite good out of the box if you ever find a trigger that doesn t feel right it s definitely worth taking the time to tweak it to your liking as a properly positioned trigger blade is one of the many ingredients that need to be mixed together in order to produce accurate shooting using my lyman digital gauge i measured trigger pull at almost bang on 3lb a little heavier than i would have liked but a safe enough weight for field use there was very little resistance in terms of first stage travel and there was a reasonable amount of second stage creep although it was at least predictable and for a rifle of this price it s unreasonable to expect something like 10m precision rifle performance the safety catch can be applied whether or not the rifle has been cocked which always scores a plus point with me it s a simple rocker catch that s located just above the trigger guard it needs to be nudged forwards for safe and back for fire which can be done with the thumb of the shooting hand provided you re right handed i was impressed by the operation of the catch which was both positive and quiet magazines with increasingly larger ammo capacities are all the rage at the moment and the archero s takes 12 pellets in both 177 as seen here and in 22 to load the magazine the clear faceplate must be rotated clockwise holding it under tension while the first pellet is inserted from the rear the mag can then be flipped back and the remaining chambers filled i tried a variety of pellets and found skirt width rather than pellet length to be the deciding factor i found some pellets would drop all the way in notably webley mosquito express while others like jsb exact needed coaxing with my break barrel pellet seating device once they were satisfactorily seated in the magazine however all types worked well and the magazine which is inserted from the right using a groove to guide it home cycled flawlessly niksan archero s ready for the range the archero has a sidelever operated action which is located on the right and can t be swapped to the left unlike some of its contemporaries the archero s sidelever doesn t have a drop down handle but it probably doesn t need one as the tip sticks out from the side of the action and is easy enough to grab hold of it s spring assisted meaning it will naturally fly back part of the way during the cocking phase and i found only minimal force was needed to complete the cocking cycle like the rest of the rifle i found the sidelever to be fairly sturdy and reliable the test rifle wasn t brand new and as always my first order of business was to give the barrel a thorough clean having zeroed the rifle and carried out some initial accuracy testing with the mosquitos i put a 10 shot string over the chronograph with a variation of 9ft sec from a muzzle energy of 11 5ft lb one thing i appreciated was an added test card showing a five shot group taken by the factory some rifles come with similar test cards showing some impressive groups but these results are rendered near meaningless if the distance the shots were taken at isn t listed as well luckily the niksan test card revealed a pleasing group measuring 7 3mm centre to centre having been shot at 25m while this group could well have been shot with the action out of the stock and clamped in a vice i m pleased to say my own rested shots weren t that far off at 30yds varying between sub 5p piece sized groups and sub 10p piece sized groups depending on the pellet type it seemed to really like the mosquitos and the fickleness of the wind i reckon the archero lets those pellets fly true as an arrow out to medium distances making this rifle a suitable hunting and pest control tool especially if you re taking advantage of a bipod and laying wait in ambush
as exciting developments in australia s behemoth 3 5 trillion superannuation sector go they don t get much more exciting than friday s unveiling by the world s second biggest asset manager vanguard of its new australian super fund offerings three years in the making market watchers have been keenly anticipating the announcement of the fee structure of the low cost investing pioneer putting your super in passive funds such as vanguard s can save you fees in the long run credit dionne gain and on friday we got the answer vanguard will charge fees of 0 58 per cent of a member s balance in its default mysuper offering which will also be a lifestyle product meaning it starts out with a high proportion about 90 per cent of funds invested in growth assets like shares and then from the age of 47 starts to automatically switch you to a higher proportion of more defensive assets like fixed interest and cash vanguard is also offering more traditionally structured products too some with fees as low as 0 56 per cent for someone with 50 000 of super sitting in vanguard s new default offering that works out to a cost of 290 a year

you could say twitter now in its second week of elon musk s reign has had an interesting week that would be an understatement trying to keep up with the unfolding saga that is musk s ownership of the microblogging platform isn t easy since monday several high profile leaders have left the company product changes have been made and rolled back without much apparent internal communication and now the ftc is worried musk s twitter might be ignoring its obligations under a previous settlement against that backdrop musk continues to tweet like his 44 billion investment isn t about to blow up in his face so what the hell is going on over there that was the weekend that was elon may have acquired twitter on october 27 but it wasn t until late last week that things started getting interesting musk initiated a mass layoff at twitter friday november 4 an event described by many employees as chaotic reports circled that people were ejected from their work accounts and twitter systems as early as thursday night some in the middle of meetings and by friday half the 7 500 person company was out a group of five former twitter employees filed a class action lawsuit against twitter saying that the layoffs violated the federal and california state warn acts that mandate a 60 day notification period for qualifying mass layoffs in which twitter s is included musk earlier fired twitter leadership including ceo parag agrawal within days of taking ownership of the company and advertisers quickly began to freeze ad spending on twitter until things settled down which they most definitely did not do by the weekend it became clear to some at twitter that firing half the company wasn t a great idea leading to several dozen people being asked to return to the company for two reasons some were laid off on accident while others were let go before leadership had a chance to realize they were essential to build features musk wanted for the platform reports quickly emerged that twitter engineers being asked back were mostly saying no those that did agree to return allegedly were mostly foreign individuals working on visas who would be forced out of the us without a job letting the musk sink in the beginning of the week was relatively calm on twitter outside of elon being a poor sport about people impersonating him announcing that accounts engaging in parodies without making that explicitly clear would be banned without warning monday also saw musk claim that twitter users were at an all time high possibly in response to the mit technology review publishing research in which it found nearly one million twitter users had deactivated their accounts since musk purchased the platform in late october twitter says it has about 237 million daily users who are monetizable misinformation on twitter also surged earlier this week in the lead up to the us midterm elections which may not have happened had musk not been in charge of the platform on tuesday news emerged that musk had sold 19 5 million tesla shares worth 3 95 billion which the world s richest man has since told twitter employees was necessary to save the company midweek madness one of musks big plans to make more money at twitter something he definitely needs to do emerged as plans to turn twitter blue into an 8 a month service that would earn paid accounts a verification checkmark blue subscribers tweets also appear higher than non subscribers in searches and replies turning twitter into a fee speech platform that paid for blue checkmark would not come with any actual verification process and news of the plan caused blowback as people were concerned about the potential for impersonation like what happened over the weekend that caused musk to ban impersonators on wednesday twitter began using the official account label to differentiate paid verification check marks from those that had earned it but only in certain instances like high profile brands as that news settled over the twitterverse musk and twitter s client solutions leader robin wheeler took to twitter spaces to discuss changes at twitter and the company s plans for earning the trust of advertisers during the call musk revealed that he was also considering turning twitter into a payment platform taking him back to his paypal roots overall the call didn t go great based on what came next wednesday evening and into thursday morning marianne fogarty twitter s chief compliance officer lea kissner twitter s chief information security officer damien kieran the chief privacy officer and yoel roth head of trust and safety all walked out leaving twitter with little in the way of security or compliance leadership rumors were briefly swirling that wheeler had also departed but she has since said she s still with the company the reason for the team s departure may have to do with the ftc s eyes turning back toward twitter which it has been under an agreement with since 2010 when it was found to have shoddy privacy and security practices the ftc also fined twitter 150 million earlier this year for using account security data to sell targeted ads techdirt s mike masnick posted a section of the ftc s agreement with twitter that points out the social media platform has to notify the regulator any time it makes product changes something that perhaps hasn t been done since musk took over not long after the departures an unnamed twitter lawyer posted a letter to the company s internal slack saying that twitter s current head of legal and personal lawyer to musk alex spiro allegedly said of compliance concerns that elon puts rockets into space he s not afraid of the ftc engineers the letter said were being forced to self certify the changes they made for ftc compliance which the lawyer said would put twitter at risk of incurring billions of dollars in fines extremely detrimental to twitter s longevity the lawyer said wednesday was also when musk made his first formal communication with twitter s remaining employees telling them that not only was twitter at risk of bankruptcy but that he was ending the company s long standing remote work policy and would force everyone to be in the office at least 40 hours a week beginning the next day regarding that bankruptcy threat bear in mind twitter made a 513 million profit in the first quarter of 2022 largely from the sale of mopub and a 270 million loss in the second quarter finishing that period with 2 68 billion in cash equivalents president biden also said the foreign investment that made the tesla tycoon s purchase of twitter possible was worth being looked at prince al waleed bin talal al saud and qatar holding as well as oracle s larry ellison and others pitched in funds to support the takeover blue thursday thursday saw the disappearance of the official label and the rollout of the new twitter blue program that allowed people to buy a verified checkmark for 8 a month twitter also said the blue check would remain for users who were verified under the legacy verification system chaos ensued with brands being impersonated politicians being parodied as cannibals and fraud running amuck just as predicted someone with a paid for blue tick impersonated insulin maker eli lilly on twitter to say the drug was now free causing the pharmaceutical giant s stock price to drop six percent after the bogus claim went viral musk also met twitter staff for the first time yesterday reportedly telling them much the same that he said in email communications with staff the day prior twitter s finances are in bad shape the company could collapse and everyone needs to work harder the letter also attempted to answer questions about the state of twitter s compliance with ftc mandates according to musk twitter will do whatever it takes to adhere to both the letter and the spirit of the ftc consent decree anything you read to the contrary is absolutely false musk s own lawyer also reportedly tried to reassure staff saying none of them would be going to jail regarding the situation with the ftc friday fixes and beyond twitter woke up today to find that not only were users unable to sign up for twitter blue but original labels were back on select accounts users who earned blue checks by subscribing to twitter blue reported them missing and app watcher jane manchun wong said she no longer saw twitter blue verified purchasability in the twitter api as of writing the option to subscribe to twitter blue also appears to have been removed from the app whereas earlier today it was present but showed an availability error musk has also threatened to take away verified check marks from non subscribers in the next few months it s reported more than 140 000 accounts had signed up for the latest twitter blue suite of features which nets 13 4 million a year about 420 000 accounts had verified blue ticks prior to musk s takeover twitter s annual revenue was 5 billion in 2021 let that sink in what s next for twitter is anyone s guess in another flippant musk tweet from earlier today the twitter ceo shared a picture of a neon gameover sign saying twitter hq is great the photo which musk said was taken in twitter s video arcade and bar area was tweeted without context before he clarified the location humor aside those sorts of jokes aren t likely to inspire confidence in wary advertisers or eagle eyed government officials one thing is for certain musk s purchase of the company saddled it with 13 billion in debt making twitter responsible for 1 billion in interest payments annually if it seems like musk is flailing those financial obligations and the unhappy banks attached to them might be part of the reason that said a growing risk of insolvency probably won t make the world s for now richest man act in a calm collected manner expect more flailing now who s ready for a nice quiet weekend

the north carolina supreme court left undisturbed a pro consumer decision in a case involving one of the country s largest debt buyers but it did so in a way that will have little impact on future litigation three justices voted to affirm and another three voted to reverse the lower court s decision which found that portfolio recovery associates violated a north carolina consumer protection law in its pursuit of a default judgment against a debtor a pro consumer ruling could have made it more difficult for debt buyers operating in north carolina to file a large volume of lawsuits which often lead to default judgments against borrowers but the split decision means the lower court s ruling can t be used as a precedent in other litigation the north carolina lawsuit began after portfolio recovery associates sued to collect unpaid debt from pia townes who had stopped making payments on a credit card opened in 2006 adobe stock doesn t weaken or strengthen or clarify the consumer protection said nadine chabrier senior policy and litigation counsel at the center for responsible lending the lawsuit began in 2015 after portfolio recovery associates sued to collect unpaid debt from pia townes a former hsbc credit card customer who had stopped making payments on a card opened in 2006 the company obtained a default judgment against townes for 1 866 90 it later dismissed the collection action later townes sued portfolio recovery associates arguing the company had violated north carolina s consumer economic protection act of 2009 by failing to provide an itemized accounting that could reasonably verify the amount townes allegedly owed in 2020 an appeals court sided with townes ruling that portfolio recovery associates failed to comply with several provisions of the act governing attempts by debt buyers to pursue default judgments including providing itemized statements outlining charges and fees and properly authenticating business records that established the amount and nature of the debt portfolio recovery associates a subsidiary of pra group then appealed that judgment to the state supreme court which handed down its ruling last week after charging off debts they have failed to collect consumer lenders often sell the unpaid debt to buyers at a steep discount debt buyers pursue legal action against borrowers sometimes obtaining default judgments that require unresponsive borrowers to pay amounts greater than the debt initially owed in 2015 the consumer financial protection bureau announced a 27 million settlement with portfolio recovery associates including 19 million worth of consumer refunds and an 8 million penalty under the agreement portfolio recovery associates was required to stop reselling debts and to stop collecting debts it couldn t verify because the decision in the portfolio recovery associates case doesn t carry precedential value both sides will likely continue to debate the implications of north carolina s 2009 consumer protection law they re going to continue to fight it out chabrier said the battle will continue and pra is likely to continue what it s doing portfolio recovery associates declined to comment friday

donald trump s own party rivals have tossed every rebuke imaginable at him and it s never stuck crazy a kook a race baiting bigot a russian plant a narcissist amoral a pathological liar a threat to the republic it s never made a dent republican rank and file voters have continued to adore him attend his rallies and punish the few apostates within the party who dare to deride him he d still easily be the front runner for the next republican presidential nomination if he announced his candidacy next week as he s hinting he will at an event nov 15 and yet his heretofore hapless republican critics are testing out a new attack it s perhaps the most dreaded word in trump s vocabulary a 5 letter calumny aimed at convincing fellow republicans that now finally is the time to walk away l o s e r watch knives are out for donald trump republicans blame trump for lack of red wave in midterms duration 2 01 with control of the u s congress still hanging in the balance days after this week s midterm elections many disappointed republicans are putting the blame squarely on former president donald trump it s suddenly spreading on the right the idea that trump s gravest sin the reason to finally dump him is not his role in the jan 6 capitol riot or any of the other stuff he s done but a more practical reason according to them he makes republicans lose elections after winning the white house in 2016 he oversaw a loss in the house of representatives in 2018 lost the white house in 2020 the senate in 2021 and candidates he supported in this week s midterms fared poorly wall street journal he s a loser the l word attack has been prominent throughout the media properties owned by fox news magnate rupert murdoch including on the wall street journal editorial page which usually though not always staunchly defended trump including during past investigations this is a rather stark pivot pic twitter com p1fjvzfdhu maggienyt its editorial headline on wednesday was trump is the republican party s biggest loser this was a day after a disappointingly close midterm election for the republican party where trump s allies struggled case in point georgia trump s chosen candidate herschel walker was forced into a run off meanwhile other non trump republicans republicans the former president detests because they committed the unforgivable sin of certifying the 2020 election cruised easily to re election it was similar in new hampshire where a trump style populist lost a senate race while the more standard issue republican governor was re elected by 16 points the journal went through several examples around the country trumpy republican candidates failed at the ballot box in states that were clearly winnable said the paper mr trump has botched the 2022 elections and it could hand democrats the senate for two more years mr trump had policy successes as president including tax cuts and deregulation but he has led republicans into one political fiasco after another maybe by now republicans are sick and tired of losing trump still draws energetic rally crowds as here in alabama in 2021 marvin gentry reuters lest the point be lost on anyone murdoch s new york tabloid trump s favourite newspaper illustrated it in a front page drawing the new york post ridiculed the former president by calling him the trumpty dumpty who couldn t build a wall had a great fall and left others to put a broken party back together again i could not support him the lieutenant governor of virginia and the chair of the 2020 campaign black americans to re elect president trump was another voice saying it s time to move on from him winsome sears said if trump runs for the republican nomination she won t back him again i could not support him sears told fox business i just couldn t a true leader understands when they have become a liability a true leader understands it s time to step off the stage and voters have given us that very clear message meanwhile georgia s lieutenant governor geoff duncan a persistent trump critic who has called him unfit for office told cnn as the disheartening midterm results rolled in this is truly a pivot point for the republican party this is a time that donald trump is no doubt in the rear view mirror and trump s own former spokesperson is urging him to keep a low profile for a while welp va lt gov winsome sears who was the national chair of black americans to re elect the president in 2020 says i could not support trump if he decides to run for president in 2024 we have a clear mission and it is time to move on pic twitter com q9vuqugbha justinbaragona kayleigh mcenany urged her former boss to delay his presidential campaign announcement for a few weeks why to avoid the possibility of causing republicans to lose the upcoming run off race in georgia that could decide who controls the senate i know there s a temptation to start talking about 2024 no no no no no 2022 is not over mcenany said on fox news i think he needs to put it on pause trump sounded late thursday like he was brushing aside that advice he emailed supporters to confirm he ll make a special announcement at his mar a lago residence next week after previously dropping hints he intends to announce another presidential run next tuesday trump has hinted he ll announce a new presidential run next week and sent this email on thursday night cbc news trump s counter argument to be clear there s no evidence yet that trump is in imminent danger of being dislodged if he seeks the 2024 presidential nomination his allies will argue that he turned out record numbers of republican voters while also turning out record numbers of democrats trump supporters also demonstrated their commitment to him just this year they drove almost every lawmaker who voted to impeach him out of office it also looks like republicans may have won the popular vote in this year s midterms also in a hypothetical 2024 primary matchup he s still easily no 1 in the polls more than 20 points ahead according to one recent survey of his closest republican rival florida gov ron desantis trump s closest presidential nomination rival on the right is ron desantis the florida governor whose stock rose this week gaelen morse marco bello reuters but that gap has narrowed a bit recently some surveys show desantis more competitive against trump on a state by state level and desantis is just coming off a staggeringly large win in the florida gubernatorial race finishing nearly 20 points ahead of his democratic rival on his own social media site truth social trump blasted his critics in a string of posts on the new york post headline he said other republicans in congress failed to deliver the wall with mexico not him he said fox owes its success to him he spread conspiracy theories about the just completed election and he mocked desantis ron defuture some republicans see desantis as a safer alternative staunchly conservative every bit as combative a culture warrior but without the roller coaster of daily drama tied to life with trump suddenly the new york post is running flattering pictures referring to him as defuture along with headlines like desantis shows he s future of the gop and desantis not so secret political weapon his wife casey and an editorial headlined run ron run desantis leads a strong gop bench for 2024 will this stick watch these clues we ll soon know if this is anything more than doomed chatter fresh polling after the midterms may better reveal if there s any weakness for trump but there s another clue too we ll know trump has real troubles if his praetorian guard of media commentators turn on him the fox news prime time tv hosts tucker carlson sean hannity and laura ingraham they haven t yet carlson who tends to be a less consistent trump booster than hannity played both sides of the divide in his post midterm analysis he neither blamed nor absolved trump for the disappointing result calling it was more complicated than that the truth is trump has always been a mixed blessing politically carlson said the downsides are marbled in with the upsides but in this case he s certainly not the single cause of anything republicans suffered a fair amount of down ballot losses in races that had nothing to do with trump in michigan for example whether you like trump or not and many don t and a lot do it s a lot more complicated than just him we ll have a better sense soon as the post midterm dust settles in the meantime trump suddenly feels less inevitable as a 2024 presidential nominee than just a few days ago
