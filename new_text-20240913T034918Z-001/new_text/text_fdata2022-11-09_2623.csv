different from non gaap financial measures used by other companies in addition these non gaap financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles amdocs believes that non gaap financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with amdocs results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap and that these measures should only be used to evaluate amdocs results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures amdocs believes that the presentation of non gaap diluted earnings per

tax effects amdocs management also uses the foregoing non gaap financial measures in addition to the corresponding gaap measures in reviewing the financial results of amdocs in addition amdocs believes that significant groups of investors exclude these items in reviewing its results and those of its competitors because the amounts of the items between companies can vary greatly depending on the assumptions used by an individual company in determining the amounts of the items amdocs further believes that where the adjustments used in calculating non gaap diluted earnings per share are based on specific identified amounts that impact different line items in the consolidated statements of income including cost of revenue research and development selling general and administrative operating income interest and other expenses net income taxes and net income it is useful to investors to understand how these specific line items in the consolidated statements of income are affected

if republicans do end up winning control of at least the house of representatives the reaction from markets could be modest new york election day brought another rise for wall street with stocks climbing tuesday for a third straight day the s p 500 rose 21 31 or 0 6 to 3 828 11 though it flipped between an even bigger gain and a modest loss to get there the dow jones industrial average climbed 333 83 points or 1 to 33 160 83 and the nasdaq composite gained 51 68 or 0 5 to 10 616 20 with americans heading to the polls across the country amid high inflation and worries about a possible recession analysts say investors appear to be making bets for republicans to gain control of at least one house of congress that combined with a democratic white house could lead to little getting done in washington which may be bad for society but could also keep the status quo on economic policy and markets tend to abhor uncertainty if republicans do end up winning control of at least the house of representatives the ensuing reaction in financial markets could be modest according to economists at goldman sachs stocks have already rallied in anticipation of it with two straight gains of at least 1 before election day but a surprise win by democrats could upset the market if it leads investors to expect higher corporate taxes and other policy changes a republican win could also introduce its own risks that show themselves over time one could be that any help for the economy from congress during a possible recession would be less likely to pass and weaker than it would otherwise be under a congress controlled by democrats economists are gaming out what could happen in a recession because something much more impactful than control of the u s senate is dominating the economy as well as markets high inflation and the swift interest rate hikes the federal reserve is pushing through to get it under control that s why the more important milestone for markets this week than election day may be thursday s upcoming report on inflation that data will likely carry much more influence over what the fed does with rates it will continue to be front and center until we are out of the woods from this high inflationary environment said bill merz head of capital market research at u s bank wealth management the fed doesn t even know how far they need to go certainly nobody else does by raising rates the fed is intentionally slowing the economy by making it more expensive to borrow money that in turn should hopefully stamp down inflation which is near its most oppressive rate in four decades the problem for markets is that high rates drag down prices for stocks and other investments while raising the risk of a recession if rates go too high even though the fed has said it may soon pare back the size of its increases it is still warning markets that it may ultimately hike rates higher than expected because of just how stubborn high inflation has been the fed has already hiked its key overnight rate to a range of 3 75 to 4 up from virtually zero in march and more investors are expecting it to top 5 next year a softer reading than expected on thursday could give the fed leeway to loosen up a bit after raising interest rates at a furious pace this year economists expect it to show a continued slight moderation from a peak set during the summer but a worse than expected reading could have the opposite effect the fed has already said it would prefer taking interest rates too high rather than leave them too low that s because it sees a recession as a less bad outcome than punishingly high and enduring inflation the point though is how long does it take to get back to a more normal inflation rate and the longer it takes the more restrictive the fed is compelled to be merz said stocks are also moving on corporate profit reports as earnings season enters its tail end take two interactive sank 13 7 after reporting weaker results for the latest quarter than expected shares of companies entwined with the cryptocurrency economy also fell sharply with coinbase global losing 10 8 and robinhood markets falling 19 they dropped with crypto prices after the world s biggest crypto exchange by daily volume binance said it intends to buy one of its bigger rivals ftx binance is making the purchase to help ftx manage a crunch where users have been pulling money out amid fears about its financial strength it s the latest crisis of confidence to slam the crypto industry this year as prices have tumbled in part on worries about higher interest rates

the penalty is the maximum the ranchers who pumped shasta river water for eight days could face under state law california s water officials plan to impose a 4 000 fine on siskiyou county ranchers for violating orders to cut back their water use during a weeklong standoff last summer state officials and the ranchers agree a 4 000 fine isn t much of a deterrent to prevent illegal water diversions during california s droughts the proposed fine would amount to about 50 per rancher a rural water association serving about 80 ranchers and farmers facing mounting costs from hauling water and purchasing hay to replace dried out pasture turned on their pumps for eight days in august to divert water from the shasta river state and federal officials said the pumping which violated an emergency state order threatened the river s water quality and its salmon and other rare species rick lemos a fifth generation rancher and board member of the shasta river water association said violating the drought order was the cheapest way i could have got by when you re to a point where you have no other choice you do what you have to do he said the alternatives would have cost us collectively a lot more the penalty 500 per day for eight days of pumping is the maximum amount the state water resources control board s enforcers can seek from the group of siskiyou county ranchers under the state s water code the proposed fine requires a 20 day waiting period or a hearing before it is final the small amount and the long delay underscore the limited powers that the state s water cops have to speedily intervene in conflicts over diversions they have declared illegal they obviously don t have much enforcement power because they showed up and told us shut your pumps off right now and we said no said lemos you would think they d get an injunction and shut the pumps off wouldn t they julé rizzardo the water board s assistant deputy director of permitting and enforcement for the division of water rights said the agency s powers are limited unfortunately there are circumstances such as this where the economic gains that folks can get by violating curtailment orders are greater than the potential penalties available to us rizzardo said karuk tribal council member arron troy hockaday was disappointed by the fine the punishment doesn t fit the crime we re fighting for the fish the fish are our life hockaday said the penalty he says sends a message siskiyou county does not have to listen to what you guys have to say we re gonna do what we want and nothing s gonna happen to us in addition the ranchers could face fines of 10 000 a day for future violations under the state s water code fines can be larger than 500 a day only after the water board finalizes a cease and desist order which requires a 20 day waiting period or a hearing in the case of the siskiyou county ranchers lemos and his neighbors shut their pumps off almost three weeks before the penalty would have increased to 10 000 a day we knew that was coming that s why we pumped the water before it happened lemos said jim scala a third generation rancher who is president of the shasta river water association s board of directors said he hopes the association agrees to not pay the fine and fight it instead i don t want to pay them a dime i want to take them to court scala said because if we pay them 4 000 or 10 000 that s like admitting that we were in the wrong the fight began simmering in august 2021 when the water board adopted emergency regulations that allow curtailments of water pumping when flows dip below a certain level to protect the shasta river s salmon facing dry conditions and dwindling flows the state ramped up curtailments in the spring and summer of 2022 in early august the shasta river water association petitioned the board to continue diverting water to fill stock ponds but before the board had responded the ranchers notified state water officials in an aug 17 letter that they planned to violate the curtailment that day the river s flows dropped by nearly two thirds and stayed there for a week until the farmers and ranchers turned the pumps back off a precipitous drop that state officials said could jeopardize the river s fish the state agency said that it recommends the maximum allowable fine due to the significant volume diverted in a short period of time the impacts to the watershed the sensitive timing of this violation before salmon migration and the continued pumping even after a violation notice and a draft cease and desist order were sent the river empties into the larger klamath and is home to key spawning and rearing grounds for fall run chinook salmon and threatened coho salmon the water board s notice friday said that violating the curtailment resulted in lower flows that could exacerbate negative water quality issues and limit fish mobility and survival this action has direct impacts on more senior water right holders and sensitive fisheries that the emergency regulation intends to protect the notice said such skirmishes could flare more often as climate change brings more severe and frequent droughts to the state but experts warn that the state s powers don t match the urgency of stopping illicit water use the system still allows one rogue user to decide to pay a fine rather than comply with the law said jennifer harder a law professor at the university of the pacific s mcgeorge school of law california is a world class economy with world class natural resources the state agency charged with protecting its water resources should be given world class tools rizzardo said the state doesn t have the resources or data necessary to police 40 000 water rights holders particularly during a severe drought we empathize we recognize the hardships we have been out in the field to try to understand the situation more holistically rizzardo said but we also aren t going to ignore the blatant violations calmatters org is a nonprofit nonpartisan media venture explaining california policies and politics watch related federal program helps californians behind on their

if republicans do end up winning control of at least the house of representatives the reaction from markets could be modest new york election day brought another rise for wall street with stocks climbing tuesday for a third straight day the s p 500 rose 21 31 or 0 6 to 3 828 11 though it flipped between an even bigger gain and a modest loss to get there the dow jones industrial average climbed 333 83 points or 1 to 33 160 83 and the nasdaq composite gained 51 68 or 0 5 to 10 616 20 with americans heading to the polls across the country amid high inflation and worries about a possible recession analysts say investors appear to be making bets for republicans to gain control of at least one house of congress that combined with a democratic white house could lead to little getting done in washington which may be bad for society but could also keep the status quo on economic policy and markets tend to abhor uncertainty if republicans do end up winning control of at least the house of representatives the ensuing reaction in financial markets could be modest according to economists at goldman sachs stocks have already rallied in anticipation of it with two straight gains of at least 1 before election day but a surprise win by democrats could upset the market if it leads investors to expect higher corporate taxes and other policy changes a republican win could also introduce its own risks that show themselves over time one could be that any help for the economy from congress during a possible recession would be less likely to pass and weaker than it would otherwise be under a congress controlled by democrats economists are gaming out what could happen in a recession because something much more impactful than control of the u s senate is dominating the economy as well as markets high inflation and the swift interest rate hikes the federal reserve is pushing through to get it under control that s why the more important milestone for markets this week than election day may be thursday s upcoming report on inflation that data will likely carry much more influence over what the fed does with rates it will continue to be front and center until we are out of the woods from this high inflationary environment said bill merz head of capital market research at u s bank wealth management the fed doesn t even know how far they need to go certainly nobody else does by raising rates the fed is intentionally slowing the economy by making it more expensive to borrow money that in turn should hopefully stamp down inflation which is near its most oppressive rate in four decades the problem for markets is that high rates drag down prices for stocks and other investments while raising the risk of a recession if rates go too high even though the fed has said it may soon pare back the size of its increases it is still warning markets that it may ultimately hike rates higher than expected because of just how stubborn high inflation has been the fed has already hiked its key overnight rate to a range of 3 75 to 4 up from virtually zero in march and more investors are expecting it to top 5 next year a softer reading than expected on thursday could give the fed leeway to loosen up a bit after raising interest rates at a furious pace this year economists expect it to show a continued slight moderation from a peak set during the summer but a worse than expected reading could have the opposite effect the fed has already said it would prefer taking interest rates too high rather than leave them too low that s because it sees a recession as a less bad outcome than punishingly high and enduring inflation the point though is how long does it take to get back to a more normal inflation rate and the longer it takes the more restrictive the fed is compelled to be merz said stocks are also moving on corporate profit reports as earnings season enters its tail end take two interactive sank 13 7 after reporting weaker results for the latest quarter than expected shares of companies entwined with the cryptocurrency economy also fell sharply with coinbase global losing 10 8 and robinhood markets falling 19 they dropped with crypto prices after the world s biggest crypto exchange by daily volume binance said it intends to buy one of its bigger rivals ftx binance is making the purchase to help ftx manage a crunch where users have been pulling money out amid fears about its financial strength it s the latest crisis of confidence to slam the crypto industry this year as prices have tumbled in part on worries about higher interest rates

fine art images heritage images via getty images representatives chosen by randomizing machine in the assembly one man one vote stones used as secret ballots special elections for ostracism and exile vita exclusive alamy stock photo in sparta an ancient applause o meter roman elections gave prerogative to the rich mirko tobias schäfer flickr secret ballots and campaigning in the roman republic in athens and rome voting could entail shouting contests secret stone ballots and an election system with built in bias for the wealthy citizens of modern democracies have used a variety of methods and technologies to cast their votes on election day but how did people participate in elections in ancient times historians have pieced together some intriguing details from athens the first and only direct democracy and the roman republic a quasi democracy where the wealthiest classes wielded more influence than the workers in both athens and rome participation in the democratic process the greek word dēmokratia means people power was limited to the dēmos which were free male citizens women and enslaved people did not have a vote there were very few elections in athens because the ancient athenians didn t think that elections were the most democratic way of choosing officials says eric robinson a history professor at indiana university and editor of ancient greek democracies readings and sources for a democracy to give full power to the people to run things and not just the wealthy you had to choose people at random to decide who would serve in the council of 500 the chief governing body of athens athenians used a system known as the sortition there were 10 tribes in athens and each tribe was responsible for providing 50 citizens to serve for one year in the council of 500 each eligible citizen was given a personalized token and those tokens were inserted into a special machine called a kleroterion that used a long lost technology involving tubes and balls to randomly select each tribe s contribution to the council in athens all laws and court cases were decided by the assembly ekklēsia a massive democratic body in which every male citizen had a say of the 30 000 to 60 000 citizens of athens roughly 6 000 regularly attended and participated in meetings of the assembly the assembly met on a natural hilltop amphitheater called pnyx which is derived from a greek word meaning tightly packed together and could hold between 6 000 and 13 000 people the greeks didn t have elections in the sense that we think of them where you either vote by mail or go to a school or church to drop off the ballot says del dickson a political science professor at the university of san diego and author of the people s government an introduction to democracy you had to be physically present that s where we get the word republic res publica is latin for a public place you go and gather with other citizens and you decide the issues before the assembly that day the daily agenda for the assembly was set by the council of 500 but then all legislation and government policies were put to a vote voting was done by raising hands and the winner was determined by nine presidents proedroi athenians were very careful to avoid any possibility of cheating the system for example the nine vote counters were chosen at random in the morning right before the assembly met so it would be really hard to bribe them says robinson there were a few positions in athens that were elected by the assembly the most prominent being the military generals every year 10 generals were elected by a simple thumbs up or thumbs down vote by the full assembly in addition to passing laws the assembly handed down verdicts in all criminal and civil trials in athens instead of a jury of 12 athenian juries contained anywhere from 200 to 5 000 people says dickson also one member of the jury was randomly chosen to serve as the judge not to have the final say but to make sure that the rules and procedures were followed while other types of voting were done in public athenian juries cast their vote using a special kind of secret ballot involving stones as robinson explains each juror was given two small stones one solid and another with a hole in the middle when it was time to vote the juror would approach two urns he would drop the stone with his actual verdict in the first urn and toss the unused stone in the second urn no one watching could tell which was which the ancient greek word for a small stone or pebble is psephos and survives in english as psephology the statistical study of elections and voting patterns in athens if a public figure was disgraced or simply became too popular for the good of democracy he could be exiled for 10 years through a special ostracism election a word that s derived from ostraka the ancient greek word for a shard of pottery in an ostracism election each member of the assembly would be handed a small piece of pottery and told to scratch down the name of someone who deserved to be exiled if at least 6 000 people wrote down the same name the person with the most votes got kicked out of athens for 10 years says dickson one famous example is themistokles an athenian military hero from the battle of salamis against the persians who was ostracized in 472 b c and died in exile there s evidence that the political enemies of themistokles pre etched his name on hundreds or thousands of pottery shards and distributed them to illiterate members of the assembly athens was the largest and most powerful of the ancient greek city states but each municipality practiced its own form of voting and elections says robinson who wrote a book called democracy beyond athens one example is sparta which wasn t a democracy but included some democratic elements one of sparta s highest ruling bodies was the council of elders gerousia which consisted of two spartan kings and 28 elected officials all over 60 years old who would hold office for life to fill empty seats spartans held a peculiar style of shouting election also known as voting by acclamation says robinson each candidate would take turns walking into a large assembly room and people would shout and cheer their approval in another room hidden from view judges would compare the volume of the shouts to choose the winners the roman republic carried over some of the principles of athenian democracy but divided up the electorate by class and created a system that advantaged the wealthy says dickson instead of voting in one giant assembly like athens the romans had three assemblies the first was called the centuriate assembly and this body elected the highest offices in rome including the consuls praetors and censors and was the assembly responsible for declaring war voting in the centuriate assembly started with the wealthiest class and vote counting stopped as soon as a majority of the 193 member body was reached so if all of the rich people wanted a bill to pass or a particular consul to be elected they could vote as a block and sideline the lower classes in latin the privilege of voting first was called praerogativa translated as to ask for an opinion before another and is the root of the english word prerogative in the other two roman assemblies the tribal assembly and the plebeian council voting order was determined by casting lots tribes in both athens and rome weren t based on blood or ethnicity but on the geographic region where you lived in that way the tribal assembly functioned in a similar way as the united states senate where each state has equal representation some aspects of elections in the roman republic are still around today voting in the assemblies started off like the athenian model with each member of the assembly raising their hand and voting publicly but over time it became clear that wealthy sponsors were pressuring roman assembly members to vote a certain way so voting had to be done in secret in 139 b c rome introduced a new type of secret ballot it was a wooden tablet with a sheet of wax on the outside says robinson you d write your vote on the wax sheet and then drop the whole tablet into a ballot box the aristocracy had a snit fit about this because they lost some of their control if you think that campaign advertising is a recent annoyance archeologists have uncovered hundreds of examples of ancient campaign ads and political graffiti scribbled on the walls of pompeii as for official campaigning dickson says that roman office seekers were limited to a one or two week campaign season and most of it was done in person in the public square

note regarding use of non gaap financial measures in this press release to supplement our consolidated financial statements the company presents adjusted ebitda adjusted net income loss and adjusted net income loss per diluted share these measures are not in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and accordingly reconciliations of adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income loss to net income loss determined in accordance with us gaap are included in the reconciliation of non gaap results table at the end of this press release we have included adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income loss in this press release because they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget accordingly we believe that adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income loss provide useful information to investors and analysts in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors our use of adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income loss has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under us gaap in particular many of the adjustments to our us gaap financial measures reflect the exclusion of items specifically interest tax and depreciation and amortization expenses equity based compensation expense and certain other non operating expenses that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future in addition these measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled non gaap financial measures used by other companies

if republicans do end up winning control of at least the house of representatives the reaction from markets could be modest new york election day brought another rise for wall street with stocks climbing tuesday for a third straight day the s p 500 rose 21 31 or 0 6 to 3 828 11 though it flipped between an even bigger gain and a modest loss to get there the dow jones industrial average climbed 333 83 points or 1 to 33 160 83 and the nasdaq composite gained 51 68 or 0 5 to 10 616 20 with americans heading to the polls across the country amid high inflation and worries about a possible recession analysts say investors appear to be making bets for republicans to gain control of at least one house of congress that combined with a democratic white house could lead to little getting done in washington which may be bad for society but could also keep the status quo on economic policy and markets tend to abhor uncertainty if republicans do end up winning control of at least the house of representatives the ensuing reaction in financial markets could be modest according to economists at goldman sachs stocks have already rallied in anticipation of it with two straight gains of at least 1 before election day but a surprise win by democrats could upset the market if it leads investors to expect higher corporate taxes and other policy changes a republican win could also introduce its own risks that show themselves over time one could be that any help for the economy from congress during a possible recession would be less likely to pass and weaker than it would otherwise be under a congress controlled by democrats economists are gaming out what could happen in a recession because something much more impactful than control of the u s senate is dominating the economy as well as markets high inflation and the swift interest rate hikes the federal reserve is pushing through to get it under control that s why the more important milestone for markets this week than election day may be thursday s upcoming report on inflation that data will likely carry much more influence over what the fed does with rates it will continue to be front and center until we are out of the woods from this high inflationary environment said bill merz head of capital market research at u s bank wealth management the fed doesn t even know how far they need to go certainly nobody else does by raising rates the fed is intentionally slowing the economy by making it more expensive to borrow money that in turn should hopefully stamp down inflation which is near its most oppressive rate in four decades the problem for markets is that high rates drag down prices for stocks and other investments while raising the risk of a recession if rates go too high even though the fed has said it may soon pare back the size of its increases it is still warning markets that it may ultimately hike rates higher than expected because of just how stubborn high inflation has been the fed has already hiked its key overnight rate to a range of 3 75 to 4 up from virtually zero in march and more investors are expecting it to top 5 next year a softer reading than expected on thursday could give the fed leeway to loosen up a bit after raising interest rates at a furious pace this year economists expect it to show a continued slight moderation from a peak set during the summer but a worse than expected reading could have the opposite effect the fed has already said it would prefer taking interest rates too high rather than leave them too low that s because it sees a recession as a less bad outcome than punishingly high and enduring inflation the point though is how long does it take to get back to a more normal inflation rate and the longer it takes the more restrictive the fed is compelled to be merz said stocks are also moving on corporate profit reports as earnings season enters its tail end take two interactive sank 13 7 after reporting weaker results for the latest quarter than expected shares of companies entwined with the cryptocurrency economy also fell sharply with coinbase global losing 10 8 and robinhood markets falling 19 they dropped with crypto prices after the world s biggest crypto exchange by daily volume binance said it intends to buy one of its bigger rivals ftx binance is making the purchase to help ftx manage a crunch where users have been pulling money out amid fears about its financial strength it s the latest crisis of confidence to slam the crypto industry this year as prices have tumbled in part on worries about higher interest rates

government coming out of the u s midterm elections that took place tuesday could impact how the federal reserve responds to inflation in the event of a recession said brian gardner chief washington policy strategist at stifel nbc news has yet to determine which party will have majorities in each chamber of congress with key races undecided but gardner said a gridlock in federal government which was widely expected leading up to election day would likely make it harder to pass fiscal policy that could pressure the federal to adjust its policy on interest rate hikes accordingly if a recession takes place he said but he said a gridlocked government could still potentially pass smaller pieces of legislation like expanded unemployment benefits or food stamps the fed could be the only show in

investors are turning their attention back to inflation and the federal reserve s efforts to squash it in terms of what really matters going forward i think is more of the earnings season and then what the fed is doing allianzim s johan grahn said the election itself seems to have been kind of a dud in terms of market reaction and clearly not the the strong wave that was being discussed before investors may experience some relief on the back of election results which could remove some uncertainty and reduce volatility for markets but grahn expects that inflation could stir volatility back up again as market participants look ahead to thursday s cpi report inflation is enemy number one for the fed and if you see the core cpi print creep up i believe that the market would have a negative reaction to that he added sarah min fed s barkin says we are doing what it takes to bring down inflation richmond federal reserve president thomas barkin vowed wednesday that the central bank will not allow inflation to become entrenched in the u s economy in a speech delivered to the top of virginia chamber of commerce the central bank official noted the danger if expectations of higher inflation persist inflation in the 1970s taught that the fed can t let inflation fester and expectations rise if we back off for fear of a downturn inflation comes back even stronger and requires even more restraint he said that s why the fed is not waiting around for things to settle on their own time we know inflation is painful and everyone hates it barkin added we have been mandated by congress to maintain stable prices and we are doing what it takes to get inflation back to our 2 percent target that s one place i can assure you we are headed back to normal barkin is a nonvoting member of the

shows women are feeling the pain more than men and it is the primary money woe keeping ladies up at night research from fidelity investments found that inflation is currently the top financial concern for u s women with upwards of 70 citing it as their main worry respondents listed the costs of essentials as the second biggest stressor 65 and another 58 expressed worries about not having enough saved for emergencies the cost of living has become extremely oppressive and this has greatly reduced the amount of money that americans have available for discretionary spending as a result businesses all over the nation are struggling the nfib s small business optimism index just dropped again and inflation continues to rank as the number one concern according to the national federation of independent business 33 of small business owners cited inflation as their most important problem in october that number is three points higher than was reported in september the nfib s small business optimism index dropped 0 8 to 91 3 in october marking 10 consecutive months it has remained under the 49 year average of 98 as i discussed yesterday 37 percent of all small business owners in the entire country were not able to pay rent last month that is a disastrous number of course many large businesses are experiencing major problems as well just look at carvana just a couple of years ago carvana was really flying high but now it is literally on the verge of collapse in total carvana s shares have plummeted 96 this year after hitting an all time intraday high of 376 83 per share in august 2021 according to cnbc the stock s all time low of 8 14 per share occurred less than a week after it started trading publicly on april 28 2017 the company s previous worst day of trading was a 26 4 decline on march 18 2020 as a result morgan stanley pulled its rating on carvana saying its stock could be worth as little as 1 to 40 analyst adam jonas blamed the decrease in used car sales and an uncertain funding environment for the change while the company is continuing to pursue cost cutting actions we believe a deterioration in the used car market combined with a volatile interest rate adds material risk to the outlook he said via cnbc these factors contribute to a wide range of positive and negative outcomes one of the biggest factors that is depressing sales for the auto industry right now is rapidly rising interest rates the average interest rate for a new vehicle loan climbed to 5 2 in the third quarter while the average rate for a used vehicle loan hit 9 7 according to transunion both are up more than one percentage point compared with the year earlier period the federal reserve should not be aggressively hiking rates just as we are entering a major economic slowdown it is an incredibly foolish thing to do the fed s policies have been absolutely eviscerating the housing industry and now it has become clear that the same thing is starting to happen to the auto industry but they are going to keep raising rates anyway as americans went to the polls on tuesday the economy was the number one issue on their minds and that does not appear to be good news for the democrats a report released friday outlined the problem for washington s current ruling party the university of michigan which releases a closely watched sentiment survey each month asked respondents who they trusted more when it came to the economy and which would better for personal finances the result overwhelmingly republican the survey of 1 201 respondents saw republicans with a 37 21 edge on the question of which party is better for the economy while that left a wide swath 37 of consumers who don t think it makes a difference the disparity of those with a preference is huge at this moment joe biden s approval rating with independents is the lowest that it has ever been all of the numbers seem to indicate that the election results will go a certain way but will that be

highlights thirty six of the 50 states are electing governors in the us midterm elections the vote count is particularly close in pennsylvania nevada georgia and arizona the results carry high stakes for issues such as abortion access and transgender rights the us midterm election results are still being tallied with the control of the us congress hanging in the balance many of the most competitive races uncalled leaving it unclear whether republicans would crack democrats tenuous hold on power in a critical win for president joe biden s party democrat john fetterman flipped a republican held us senate seat in pennsylvania beating republican celebrity doctor mehmet oz and bolstering his party s chances of holding the chamber the mood at the white house improved as the night wore on with once nervous aides allowing smiles to creep onto their faces and saying early signs for democrats were better than expected on twitter mr biden posted a photo of himself happily congratulating some of the democratic winners by phone in the house of representatives republicans remained favored to win a majority that would allow them to halt joe biden s legislative agenda by early wednesday the party had flipped six democratic house seats edison research projected one more than the minimum they need to take over the chamber that number could change only 13 of the 53 most competitive races based on a reuters analysis of the leading nonpartisan forecasters had been decided raising the prospect that the final outcome may not be known for some time the party that occupies the white house almost always loses seats in elections midway through a president s first four year term and mr biden has struggled with low public approval for more than a year but republican hopes for a red wave of victories faded as democrats showed surprising resilience in several key races democrats were projected as the winners in 11 of the 13 close contests that had been decided definitely not a republican wave that s for darn sure republican us senator lindsey graham told nbc in an interview the democratic speaker of the house nancy pelosi said in a statement it is clear that house democratic members and candidates are strongly outperforming expectations around the country voter anger over the supreme court s june decision to overturn the nationwide right to abortion helped democrats to curb their losses a republican majority in the house even a narrow one would be able to block mr biden s priorities while launching politically damaging investigations into his administration and family senate a toss up the senate was still a toss up with pivotal battles in arizona georgia and nevada still in play the georgia senate race could end up in a 6 december runoff possibly with senate control at stake democrats currently control the 50 50 senate with vice president kamala harris able to break any ties thirty five senate seats all 435 house seats and three dozen governors races were on the ballot florida governor ron desantis a leading contender for the republican presidential nomination in 2024 added to his growing national profile with a dominant victory over democratic representative charlie crist edison projected former us president donald trump with his wife former first lady melania trump after voting at a polling station in palm beach florida mr trump has frequently hinted at a third presidential run source getty joe raedle more than 46 million americans voted ahead of election day either by mail or in person according to data from the us election project and state election officials caution that counting those ballots will take time high inflation and abortion rights were voters top concerns with about three in ten voters picking one or the other as their top concern exit polls showed crime a major focus in republican messaging in the campaign s final weeks was the top issue for just about one in ten voters competitive districts both parties notched victories in competitive districts in virginia s 2nd congressional district democratic us representative elaine luria lost to republican challenger jennifer kiggans in a district biden carried by two points but in the state s 7th district which mr biden won in 2020 by 7 percentage points representative abigail spanberger held off a republican challenger local officials reported isolated problems across the country including a paper shortage in a pennsylvania county in maricopa county arizona a key battleground a judge rejected a republican request to extend voting hours after some tabulation machines malfunctioned the problems stoked evidence free claims among republican former president donald trump and his supporters that the failures were deliberate listen to congress in the balance as us midterm votes are cast sbs news 09 11 2022 03 52 play scores of republican candidates have echoed mr trump s false claims that his 2020 loss to biden was due to widespread fraud raising fears among democrats that they could interfere with the 2024 presidential race in pennsylvania republican gubernatorial candidate doug mastriano who sought to overturn the state s election results after mr trump lost was defeated by democrat josh shapiro democratic governors also fended off strong republican challenges in michigan and wisconsin two states likely to remain political battlegrounds in the 2024 presidential race mr trump who cast his ballot in florida has frequently hinted at a third presidential run he said on monday that he would make a big announcement on 15 november economic worries voters in michigan vermont and california approved referendums enshrining abortion rights in their state constitutions a measure that would establish kentucky s state constitution does not protect abortion was too close to call the primary issue weighing on democrats was stubbornly high annual inflation which at 8 2 per cent stands at the highest rate in 40 years the economy is terrible i blame the current administration for that said bethany hadelman who said she voted for republican candidates in alpharetta georgia a reuters ipsos poll this week found just 39 per cent of americans approved of the way biden has done his job some democratic candidates deliberately distanced themselves from the white house as mr biden s popularity languished mr trump s polling is similarly low with just 41 per cent of respondents to a separate recent reuters ipsos poll saying they viewed him favorably in congress a republican controlled house would be able to thwart democratic priorities such as abortion rights and climate change while a republican senate would hold sway over mr biden s judicial nominations including any supreme court vacancy republicans could also initiate a showdown over the country s debt ceiling which could shake financial markets
photo credit hannamariah shutterstock while the housing market has cooled in recent months the last few years have seen a home buying frenzy historically low interest rates government stimulus

from dense city living towards single family homes with more living space both indoors and out as the demand for single family homes grew during the pandemic the supply shrunk in fact the supply of single family homes has been trending downwards for years due to a shortage of new home builds just over 10 years ago in february 2012 there was a 6 8 months supply of single family homes in other words it would have taken nearly seven months for the inventory of homes on the market to sell given demand at that time six months of supply is considered a balanced market between buyers and sellers and tends to be associated with moderate price appreciation anything less than six months is viewed as a seller s market and home prices will increase more quickly single family home inventory dropped further during the pandemic reaching a low of just a single month of supply in december 2021 however single family home inventory has climbed since march of this year as mortgage rates have risen making matters worse for would be home buyers seeking single family homes single family home sales represent a smaller share of total sales than they did before the pandemic in 2019 single family home sales accounted for less than 76 of total sales down from 78 in 2019 at the same time the share of condos townhomes and multi family homes have all increased supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic slowed down home building contributing to the limited supply of single family homes some parts of the country have a greater supply of single family homes than others at a regional level the

farm credit associations paid a portion of the 2022 interest patronage which relates to interest accrued during 2022 and is typically received in the first half of the following calendar year early additionally cash dividends declared on our series c preferred stock increased due to additional stock issuances during and since the prior quarter cash flows from operations for the current quarter

in the amount of cash payments made for interest our estimated nav per share increased by 0 96 from the prior quarter to 16 56 at september 30 2022 primarily due to a decrease in the net fair value of our fixed long term borrowings as a result of increases in market interest rates and valuation increases in certain of our farms that were re appraised during the current quarter partially offset by ongoing capital improvements made on certain of our farms which will not be reflected in the properties fair values until the respective projects are complete subsequent to september 30 2022 equity activity series c preferred stock sold 814 119 shares of our series c preferred stock for net proceeds of approximately 18 5 million sold 814 119 shares of our series c preferred stock for net proceeds of approximately 18 5 million increased distributions increased our distribution run rate by 0 44 declaring monthly cash distributions of 0 0458 per share of common stock including op units held by non controlling op unitholders if any for each of october november and december 2022 this marks our 28th distribution increase over the past 31 quarters during which time we have increased the distribution run rate by 52 7 comments from david gladstone president and ceo of gladstone land despite concerns around the current economic environment we had a very strong quarter from an operational standpoint we got off to a good start with participation rents for the quarter which allowed us to increase our top line revenues while keeping our property operating expenses relatively flat when compared to the second quarter while we have completed over 62 million of new farm acquisitions this year acquisition activity has been slower for us this year and we expect it to remain slow for the rest of 2022 and likely into 2023 we are still in the market should attractive opportunities arise but we continue to act conservatively with our capital and be more selective with acquisitions in light of increased interest rates and overall uncertainty within the economy we were extremely fortunate to have made it through hurricane ian with only minor damage to a few buildings and structures all of which is covered by insurance and we continue to keep those in mind who were negatively impacted by the hurricane we continue to monitor the ongoing drought situation in the west and at this time all of the permanent plantings we own are on farms that have sufficient water however as are many other growers in california we are working with our tenants to take proactive measures to try to secure as much water availability as we can to ensure our farms have enough water should california experience another dry winter to date we have not had any water deficiencies prevent any of our tenants from making their obligated rent payments with over 99 of our borrowings fixed for the next five plus years we believe we are well protected against further interest rate increases and while inflation continues to hover near the highest rates seen in over 40 years the overall food segment and more particularly the food at home segment are both increasing at even higher rates we expect demand for food and crop pricing to continue to stay strong and we believe our current portfolio is poised to benefit from continued high inflation quarterly summary information

it wasn t that long ago that we had an economy that worked for everyone america first policies delivered outcomes that benefitted all americans cheap gas low inflation record low poverty and unemployment and robust economic growth the biden administration reversed course on the policies that delivered these results and americans are paying the price put simply the biden administration s campaign trail commitment to the rapid end of fossil fuels has been perhaps its most defining and most predictably damaging promise to the american people it is difficult to overstate the profound effects of energy in powering every aspect of our nation s economy or the devastating impact when our leaders get energy policy wrong the evidence is in on the biden administration s delusions of climate grandeur and it should be sobering related sanders and carter biden s gimmick solutions only make the energy crisis worse president joe biden s open hostility to american traditional energy production from day one has stifled american energy investment production and innovation from canceling keystone xl and declaring a moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal lands to an all out regulatory onslaught on traditional energy sources and access to capital the biden administration s war on the energy sources that account for nearly 80 of u s and 84 of world energy consumption has had a predictably chilling effect americans are taking stock of the consequences contrary to biden s false assertions gas prices reached historic 5 highs under his watch and still remain 55 higher than when he took office despite sustained price incentives for producers u s oil production is still more than a million barrels per day under its pre pandemic peak diesel prices are up 45 for the year and an ongoing refined products shortage will continue to raise costs across the economy with winter approaching costs are set for increases no matter how you heat your home with natural gas prices anticipated to increase 28 heating oil 27 and electricity 10 worse if we get a colder winter energy inflation is up nearly 41 since biden took office with more half of that inflation occurring prior to russia s invasion of ukraine energy costs are driving the historic 8 2 12 month inflation that is devastating families across america unfortunately rather than drawing a logical conclusion from the evidence and declaring an end to the war on u s energy production the biden administration has chosen a combination of denial deflection and delusional policymaking in response to the ongoing crisis as weak u s energy policy contributed to the high oil prices financing russia s invasion of ukraine the biden administration has added insult to injury with repeated claims of putin s price hike then in an incredible exercise in delusional reasoning the administration claimed in its national security strategy that events like russia s war of aggression against ukraine have made clear the urgent need to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels as americans continue to face the predictable consequences of the biden administration s anti u s energy policies apparently the lesson to be learned is that we need to pursue the same policies that have only served as voluntary energy disarmament with even greater urgency instead of allowing americans to harness the incredible resources under our feet the biden administration plans to accelerate the transition from energy dominance to dependence all while depleting our strategic reserves and begging our adversaries for more oil further the biden administration has punctuated its response to backlash with outright denial and additional scapegoating claiming that its hostile policy approach has not stopped or slowed oil production in the same breath his administration points the finger at oil companies calling them war profiteers the proposed solution is a 95 windfall profits tax on oil companies increasing the cost of production on something you desperately need seems like a lesson president biden could ve learned in econ 101 former president jimmy carter s windfall profits tax could also teach the same it is said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results if the biden administration hasn t learned by now that the answer to the devastating impacts of its war on fossil fuels on the nation its economy and its citizens is not to commit further to its failed policies the definition seems apt fortunately the american people are ready for a return to sanity all of our leaders would do well to listen and to make america first energy policies their number one priority at the next opportunity carla sands u s ambassador to denmark during the

maricopa county ariz officials reported problems with ballot tabulators at some voting sites later in the day officials in the county said they had found a solution an arizona state court judge denied an emergency request from republicans to keep polls open longer washington voting rights advocates reported a generally smooth election day on tuesday as millions of americans cast ballots in the nation s pivotal midterms even as a glitch with voting tabulators in a key arizona county emerged as an issue on the right despite the problems at several dozen polling locations in maricopa county arizona a subtropical storm bearing down on florida and a number of cyber attacks on state election websites election observers said the problems some voters encountered as they made their choices appeared to be isolated routine and manageable for poll workers what we are seeing are things that we usually see on election day susannah goodman director of election security for common cause told reporters there are glitches in the system but election administrators have learned from the past and they have resiliency built in arizona voting machine issues lead to rnc lawsuit among the most high profile problems to emerge an issue with ballot tabulators in maricopa county officials there said the issue affected 20 of voting centers some voters who confronted the problem were encouraged to place their ballots in secure drop boxes for counting after the polls close the arizona republic reported prep for the polls see who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our voter guide a maricopa county superior court judge denied a motion from the republican national committee and the campaigns of gubernatorial candidate kari lake and senate candidate blake masters because he received no evidence anyone was denied the chance to vote by provisional ballot stay in the conversation on politics sign up for the onpolitics newsletter live election updates watchdog groups report routine problems stocks rally fact check false claims of election fraud candidates swirl ahead of 2022 midterms lawyers for the republicans argued the impact of ignoring the issue could be substantial this issue could determine who is our governor for the next four years and the majority control of the united states senate said kory langhofer a lawyer for masters this is a consequential issue but thomas liddy a lawyer representing the county said not one of 223 polling places had been closed for a single minute he argued at the hearing that began a half hour before polls closed he couldn t communicate to election officials to stay open longer even if the court ordered it the relief would be more harmful than the current situation liddy said it would be a recipe for voter fraud superior court judge timothy ryan rejected the request to keep county polls open an extra three hours the court doesn t have any evidence that a voter was precluded the right to vote ryan said the issue became a talking point for some conservatives earlier in the day including former president donald trump who released a video on social media encouraging voters to stay on line and accusing officials of trying to delay you out voting county officials had stressed that ballots continued to be received in affected precincts and would be counted maricopa county home to phoenix is arizona s most populous county and one of the largest in the nation and while it has tended to vote for republican candidates in recent years biden carried it in 2020 the vote there will likely be pivotal to deciding the senate race between democratic sen mark kelly and masters cyber attack on websites the department of homeland security saw no specific or credible threat disrupting election infrastructure or any activity that should cause voters to question the integrity of the election two senior u s cybersecurity officials speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations said late tuesday but the two officials confirmed they were aware of so called distributed denial of service attacks affecting a number of websites for state election offices campaigns and partisan organizations including a sustained effort to take down election related websites in mississippi they sought to reassure voters by stressing that such attacks which flood websites with computer messages would not affect the actual counting of the votes the two officials with the dhs s cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency said that while it is inherently difficult to find out who is behind such attacks they had seen no evidence suggesting they were part of any widespread or coordinated campaign one of the officials said that while they are aware of a russian hacker group claiming responsibility for the attacks on mississippi the u s government requires more evidence to attribute such attacks the officials chalked up issues in individual election jurisdictions including maricopa county arizona to routine election day glitches a polarized nation awaits results democrats and republicans are vying for control of congress the fate of president joe biden s agenda and more than half of the nation s governorships but it wasn t only control of congress hanging in the balance as millions of americans cast their ballots also up for grabs whether a polarized nation increasingly on edge over the threat of political violence could pull off a smooth election on that question voting rights experts reported early results appeared to be positive the relative calm on tuesday was at odds with the run up to the election the first since the jan 6 attack on the u s capitol last year bogus claims of election fraud amplified on social media prompted self appointed election monitors to stake out ballot drop boxes a federal judge in arizona on nov 1 barred the group from taking photos within 75 feet of a ballot box after the league of women voters sued claiming voter intimidation in remarks last week biden warned that election deniers were putting the nation on a path to chaos and echoed a longstanding concern that the fate of the nation was on the ballot his address came just days after an attacker violently assaulted the husband of house speaker nancy pelosi a democrat inside the family s san francisco home despite the tension many voters described orderly experiences at the polls at a los angeles senior center the only obstacle voters faced was rain puddles voting smooth at most polling sites i made a mistake on my mail in ballot that i was going to drop off this morning and i had a little bit of a panic attack about what to do said sara lee 41 who showed up to vote with her 2 year old son so i came in here and it was like they just took my old ballot and i redid a new one super simple super quick lee said she usually votes by mail but she said voting in person was so easy and kind of a more fun experience clark hanley 64 had no complaints after casting his ballot at the same site there was no interference and the machines seemed to work he said charles robinson a retired security guard showed up to a polling site in las vegas voting for the first time in a midterm election robinson said he was relieved to see no interference at the doolittle community center in north las vegas a historically black neighborhood no armed poll watchers no protesters no police presence in georgia following months of controversy and litigation over a law signed last year by republican gov brian kemp that barred distributing food and water to voters the groups engaged in that effort appeared to be adapting one non profit group georgia stand up simply moved the effort across the street away from the voting in the parking lot of an atlanta auto parts store the group handed out bags that included water potato chips a candy bar a rain poncho handwarmers and voting information there was a dj hot dogs and folding chairs for voters who struggled to wait in line we can t give it to them so they come get it said chandra gallashaw with the group isn t that a great idea but the election on tuesday like those before it wasn t entirely free of problems at a baptist church in central phoenix carol harder told the arizona republic that one of the tabulators at issue tuesday wouldn t count her ballot election officials tried some 20 times before issuing her another ballot which also couldn t be counted she said she was told to go to another location at that location she said she was told the system showed her vote had already been counted she returned to the church and cast a provisional ballot now i have to trust that part of the system harder said i totally have no faith in this the problem printers at the locations were not producing dark enough timing marks on the ballots according to maricopa county officials technicians changed the printer settings and that appeared to be fixing the problem at some sites the county said sharon willocks ended up sitting on the ground while waiting to vote near biltmore fashion park in phoenix she s a cancer survivor who has had spinal surgery which has left her with a bad back it would have been nice to have some chairs she said usually willocks votes by mail but she did not get the paperwork in on time this year she said she waited at least 20 minutes in line too much for her back to take once inside willocks had an easier time poll workers gave her a chair in another room so she could sit while filling out her ballot she said without that it would have been really really tough she said in detroit election officials reported a problem in some precincts with a system used to check in voters that system according to the detroit news was flagging some voters who came to cast in person ballots as having already voted absentee election officials in the affected precincts appeared to have found a workaround for the problem forecasters predicted that subtropical storm nicole was expected to begin affecting eastern florida late tuesday the elections watchdog group campaign legal center sent a letter to florida officials noting the storm and asking for an extension for voters to fix any issues with mail in or provisional ballots polling hours were extended in several precincts throughout the country because of late starts or other issues a common occurrence in past elections a paper shortage in luzerne county pennsylvania caused a judge to order voting sites to remain open two hours past the anticipated close time and then there were issues that voting rights groups described as weird a priest in toledo was unexpectedly checking the identification of voters said catherine turcer executive director of common cause of ohio in summit county home to akron a man was seen observing polling places before being asked to move along katya ehresman an organizer for common cause of texas said there were a handful of incidents of alleged voter intimidation within 100 feet of polling locations but the problem wasn t widespread she said there was overwhelming enthusiasm for voting statewide i m really excited about the turnout we are

previously required financial covenants there can be no assurance as to the requirements or form of future financial covenants including that the example we are providing will be incorporated into any covenant or measure of our performance in the future or as to the use or calculation of operating ebitda or any other non gaap financial measure operating ebitda as determined and measured by unique

on extinguishment of debt and certain expenses related to our forbearance agreement including financial advisor fees legal expenses amendment fees and risk advisory and mitigation costs operating ebitda as presented should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with u s gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income loss which is the most directly comparable financial measure to operating ebitda that is prepared in accordance with u s gaap operating ebitda as determined and measured by unique fabricating should also not be compared to similarly titled measures reported by other companies certain of the adjustments and add backs to operating ebitda are recurring in nature and are cash expenses which we believe limits the usefulness of operating ebitda as a measurement of the company s performance customer order intake coi reflects anticipated future sales from formally awarded programs and is based on expected production volumes

movie theater attendance is down largely thanks to the pandemic but chains like amc still need to make money if meme stocks aren t a reliable business plan why not find another use for a giant room with a huge screen and lots of seats in partnership with zoom amc theatres will launch a product called zoom rooms next year basically you go to the movie theater to join a zoom meeting with your company yes you must commute to the movie theatre only to join a meeting with your colleagues across the country who are also at an amc movie theatre if your company isn t strapped for cash you might even get some complimentary popcorn these theatres which range between 75 and 150 seats will be available to book for three hour blocks amc has an abundance of attractive theatres at centrally located venues in city after city after city each with ample seating capacity especially so during daytime hours on weekdays when most meetings take place said amc theaters ceo adam aron zoom rooms at amc broadens our scope as we now can participate as well in the multi billion market for corporate and other meetings while the idea of one person sitting alone at a movie theater on a zoom call is funny that s not what s going on here this technology is supposed to connect groups of people in different locations so for example a new york based team might meet at one theatre to catch up with a los angeles based team at another theatre but it remains unclear how you can actually tell who s talking if you have dozens of people crowded into a theatre movie theatre popcorn aside it seems like a technical nightmare to figure out how to actually conduct a meeting this way and perhaps working from home and mailing your employees some nonperishable popcorn bags is a simpler alternative as hybrid work has become more commonplace throughout the united states zoom rooms at amc will enable companies and other entities with decentralized workforces and customer bases to bring people from different markets together at the same time for cohesive virtual and in person events and meeting experiences a press release from amc theatres says it feels like someone put a handful of publicly traded companies into a hat picked out two randomly and challenged them to create some kind of new collaboration amc floundered during the pandemic since its core business was rendered moot by a once in a lifetime catastrophe but even as vaccines become more widespread people aren t returning to the movies like the company hoped even though amc s quarterly revenue increased the company still reported a quarterly loss this week meanwhile zoom is trying to broaden its scope by adding features like email and calendar as its unprecedented growth slows down

titled measures reported by other companies certain of the adjustments and add backs to operating ebitda are recurring in nature and are cash expenses which we believe limits the usefulness of

is more of the earnings season and then what the fed is doing allianzim s johan grahn said the election itself seems to have been kind of a dud in terms of market reaction and clearly not the the strong wave that was being discussed before investors may experience some relief on the back of election results which could remove some uncertainty and reduce volatility for markets but grahn expects

back even stronger and requires even more restraint he said that s why the fed is not waiting around for things to settle on their own time we know inflation is painful and everyone hates it barkin added we have been mandated by congress to maintain stable prices and we are doing what it takes to get inflation back to our 2 percent target that s one place i can assure you we are headed back to

michael r blood associated press los angeles the outcome in a string of highly competitive california u s house races will play into control of congress next year potentially helping republicans seize control or providing a democratic buffer as the party struggles to maintain its teetering majority the stakes were spotlighted last week when president joe biden traveled to southern california to campaign on behalf of endangered democratic rep mike levin whose district straddles orange and san diego counties it was biden s second trip to california in less than three weeks meantime vice president kamala harris was in los angeles for a rally monday to urge democratic voters to get to the polls republican leaders believe as many as five districts in the state could swing their way enough to give the gop the house gavel in a midterm election year when voters typically punish the party that holds the white house should that happen republican rep kevin mccarthy of bakersfield would be in line to replace speaker nancy pelosi of san francisco for their part democrats are eager to claw back four house districts they surrendered in 2020 and hope to gain more to pad their dominance in the state congressional delegation republicans hold only 11 of the state s 53 seats which drops to 52 seats next year because california s once soaring population growth has stalled overall in the house there are 220 democrats 212 republicans and three vacancies competitive districts are something of a rarity in heavily democratic california and cut against its national reputation as a liberal stronghold but pockets of conservative strength remain even as democrats hold a nearly 2 to 1 statewide edge in voter registrations the contests are being fought over issues that are shaping races around the country democrats are stressing abortion rights and labeling gop rivals extremists in a party still largely under the sway of former president donald trump republican candidates are faulting biden and a democratic congress for inflation rising crime and the long running homeless crisis the main battlegrounds are orange county a suburban expanse south of los angeles that was once a republican stronghold but has become increasingly diverse and democratic and the central valley an inland stretch sometimes called the nation s salad bowl for its agricultural production the key races tuesday trump supporter seeks 3rd upset north of democratic los angeles u s rep mike garcia is the only republican member of congress in the los angeles metropolitan area despite a democratic tilt in his district the former navy combat pilot has won two consecutive elections but the last two years ago was by just 333 votes he faces an even tougher challenge this year after his district the 27th was redrawn and became more democratic democrat christy smith is on the ballot for the third time after two earlier losses to garcia smith a former legislator has spotlighted garcia s opposition to abortion rights and depicts him as out of step with the district he was endorsed by then president trump in his 2020 contest then joined house republicans who rejected electoral votes from arizona and pennsylvania and opposed trump s impeachment after the capitol insurrection garcia highlights his military service and points to his vote supporting 2 000 stimulus checks during the pandemic as one example of his political independence the district includes a large number of veterans and is home to defense industries which could be an asset for garcia a longtime republican looks to hold on in a changed district republican rep ken calvert has held his seat east of los angeles for nearly three decades but the once a decade redrawing of district boundaries landed him in a battleground the 41st district where the registration is about equally split between republicans and democrats he s a familiar name and the longest serving republican in the california congressional delegation he has a fundraising advantage but his support from former president donald trump poses complications in a district that now includes many transplanted los angeles residents and liberal palm springs which has a large concentration of lgbtq voters his home city corona is the largest in the district and he s been touting his clout on the appropriations committee that enables him to bring home federal dollars for transportation and water projects he s facing democrat will rollins a former federal prosecutor who is gay rollins calls calvert an extremist and places safeguarding democracy and protecting abortion and lgbtq rights among his priorities on the ballot prop 1 seeks to put abortion safeguards in the california constitution swing district voters get sharp contrast in candidates voters in coastal orange county have a stark choice in selecting their next member of congress democratic rep katie porter a national progressive star is facing republican scott baugh a former state legislative leader and past head of the county gop in the 47th district that includes huntington beach and swaths of suburban terrain baugh has been pounding on economic issues including inflation and gas prices he recently tweeted a picture of a gas station sign with prices topping 7 a gallon and wrote biden has done nothing to stop this madness porter is a prolific fundraiser and has pumped over 24 million into the contest compared to about 2 million for baugh she s been stressing abortion rights and her work as a consumer advocate including fighting abusive credit card fees both candidates have depicted each other as extreme it was a shock in 2016 when then democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton captured orange county a place long synonymous with conservative politics the county that was once largely white and republican has grown demographically diverse and increasingly democratic with biden unpopular nationally the race will test the depth of that transformation resilient republican seeks another surprise in farm belt republican rep david valadao has persevered in a district with a strong democratic tilt and now is one of two republicans who voted to impeach then president donald trump who could be reelected more california s most fiercely contested political turf is in this southern central valley area democrats hold a staggering 17 point registration edge in the 22nd district in the state s farm belt but valadao has highlighted a bipartisan streak to win in left leaning districts before he held his seat from 2013 until january 2019 lost it for a term then won it back in a 2020 rematch with democrat t j cox he s facing democrat rudy salas in a newly redrawn district salas a state assemblyman who is considered a moderate has been dueling with valadao over gas taxes the opioid overdose crisis and health care in challenging year for democrats gop targets district on california coast democratic rep mike levin carried his election two years ago by 6 points but in a challenging year for democrats nationally republicans are looking for an upset in the coastal district that runs through orange and san diego counties coastal california typically leans democratic but the race is seen as a toss up democrats hold only a slight registration edge in the 49th district the risks for levin were spotlighted in the final days of the campaign by the president who visited in hopes of bolstering the incumbent s chances biden warned that a republican congress would reshape america by cutting back on health care and upending abortion rights and retirement security republican candidate brian maryott a businessman and former san juan capistrano mayor who was defeated by levin in 2020 has been highlighting pocketbook issues at a time of high inflation climbing interest rates and gas prices that have cleared 7 a gallon he also says he will resist fringe socialist interests levin has focused heavily on veterans affairs as well as climate change and the environment in a district that straddles marine corps base camp pendleton negative ads fingerpointing shape race for district with asian tilt in the 45th district anchored in orange county republican rep michelle steel a south korean immigrant looking for a second term in congress and democrat jay chen a navy reservist and the son of immigrants from taiwan initially made inflation and hate crimes against asian americans key issues but the race took an ugly turn and most of it has focused on accusation and recrimination chen s advertising depicts steel as an extremist who would threaten abortion rights while republicans accused chen of racism after he told supporters an interpreter was needed to understand steel s remarks arguing that chen was mocking her accented english chen has said he was referring to convoluted talking points that he said steel uses to sidestep issues steel also has distributed flyers depicting chen as a communist sympathizer while chen has said his grandmother fled china to escape communist rule the race is being watched nationally for what it will say about the preferences of the asian community related with sour economy republicans see opening with asian american voters in midterm elections the district was specifically drawn to give asian americans who comprise the largest group in the

belt a new district in the central valley has produced one of the closest contests this year the 13th district has a prominent democratic tilt and a large latino population similar to other districts

related to the annual shareholders meeting in the prior quarter the increase in affo was also attributable to approximately 113 000 of interest patronage received during the current quarter as certain farm credit associations paid a portion of the 2022 interest patronage which relates to interest accrued during 2022 and is typically received in the first half of the following calendar year early additionally cash dividends declared on our series c preferred stock increased due to additional stock issuances during and since the prior quarter cash flows from operations for the current quarter decreased by approximately 8 1 million from the prior quarter primarily due to the timing of when certain rental payments are scheduled to be paid pursuant to their respective leases and an increase in the amount of cash payments made for interest our estimated nav per share increased by 0 96 from the prior quarter to 16 56 at september 30 2022 primarily due to a decrease in the net fair value of our fixed long term borrowings as a result of increases in market interest rates and valuation increases in certain of our farms that were re appraised during the current quarter partially offset by ongoing capital improvements made on certain of our farms which will not be reflected in the properties fair values until the respective projects are complete subsequent to september 30 2022 equity activity series c preferred stock sold 814 119 shares of our series c preferred stock for net proceeds of approximately 18 5 million sold 814 119 shares of our series c preferred stock for net proceeds of approximately 18 5 million increased distributions increased our distribution run rate by 0 44 declaring monthly cash distributions of 0 0458 per share of common stock including op units held by non controlling op unitholders if any for each of october november and december 2022 this marks our 28th distribution increase over the past 31 quarters during which time we have increased the distribution run rate by 52 7 comments from david gladstone president and ceo of gladstone land despite concerns around the current economic environment we had a very strong quarter from an operational standpoint we got off to a good start with participation rents for the quarter which allowed us to increase our top line revenues while keeping our property operating expenses relatively flat when compared to the second quarter while we have completed over 62 million of new farm acquisitions this year acquisition activity has been slower for us this year and we expect it to remain slow for the rest of 2022 and likely into 2023 we are still in the market should attractive opportunities arise but we continue to act conservatively with our capital and be more selective with acquisitions in light of increased interest rates and overall uncertainty within the economy we were extremely fortunate to have made it through hurricane ian with only minor damage to a few buildings and structures all of which is covered by insurance and we continue to keep those in mind who were negatively impacted by the hurricane we continue to monitor the ongoing drought situation in the west and at this time all of the permanent plantings we own are on farms that have sufficient water however as are many other growers in california we are working with our tenants to take proactive measures to try to secure as much water availability as we can to ensure our farms have enough water should california experience another dry winter to date we have not had any water deficiencies prevent any of our tenants from making their obligated rent payments with over 99 of our borrowings fixed for the next five plus years we believe we are well protected against further interest rate increases and while inflation continues to hover near the highest rates seen in over 40 years the overall food segment and more particularly the food at home segment are both increasing at even higher rates we expect demand for food and crop pricing to continue to stay strong and we believe our current portfolio is poised to benefit from continued high inflation quarterly summary information

if republicans do end up winning control of at least the house of representatives the reaction from markets could be modest new york election day brought another rise for wall street with stocks climbing tuesday for a third straight day the s p 500 rose 21 31 or 0 6 to 3 828 11 though it flipped between an even bigger gain and a modest loss to get there the dow jones industrial average climbed 333 83 points or 1 to 33 160 83 and the nasdaq composite gained 51 68 or 0 5 to 10 616 20 with americans heading to the polls across the country amid high inflation and worries about a possible recession analysts say investors appear to be making bets for republicans to gain control of at least one house of congress that combined with a democratic white house could lead to little getting done in washington which may be bad for society but could also keep the status quo on economic policy and markets tend to abhor uncertainty if republicans do end up winning control of at least the house of representatives the ensuing reaction in financial markets could be modest according to economists at goldman sachs stocks have already rallied in anticipation of it with two straight gains of at least 1 before election day but a surprise win by democrats could upset the market if it leads investors to expect higher corporate taxes and other policy changes a republican win could also introduce its own risks that show themselves over time one could be that any help for the economy from congress during a possible recession would be less likely to pass and weaker than it would otherwise be under a congress controlled by democrats economists are gaming out what could happen in a recession because something much more impactful than control of the u s senate is dominating the economy as well as markets high inflation and the swift interest rate hikes the federal reserve is pushing through to get it under control that s why the more important milestone for markets this week than election day may be thursday s upcoming report on inflation that data will likely carry much more influence over what the fed does with rates it will continue to be front and center until we are out of the woods from this high inflationary environment said bill merz head of capital market research at u s bank wealth management the fed doesn t even know how far they need to go certainly nobody else does by raising rates the fed is intentionally slowing the economy by making it more expensive to borrow money that in turn should hopefully stamp down inflation which is near its most oppressive rate in four decades the problem for markets is that high rates drag down prices for stocks and other investments while raising the risk of a recession if rates go too high even though the fed has said it may soon pare back the size of its increases it is still warning markets that it may ultimately hike rates higher than expected because of just how stubborn high inflation has been the fed has already hiked its key overnight rate to a range of 3 75 to 4 up from virtually zero in march and more investors are expecting it to top 5 next year a softer reading than expected on thursday could give the fed leeway to loosen up a bit after raising interest rates at a furious pace this year economists expect it to show a continued slight moderation from a peak set during the summer but a worse than expected reading could have the opposite effect the fed has already said it would prefer taking interest rates too high rather than leave them too low that s because it sees a recession as a less bad outcome than punishingly high and enduring inflation the point though is how long does it take to get back to a more normal inflation rate and the longer it takes the more restrictive the fed is compelled to be merz said stocks are also moving on corporate profit reports as earnings season enters its tail end take two interactive sank 13 7 after reporting weaker results for the latest quarter than expected shares of companies entwined with the cryptocurrency economy also fell sharply with coinbase global losing 10 8 and robinhood markets falling 19 they dropped with crypto prices after the world s biggest crypto exchange by daily volume binance said it intends to buy one of its bigger rivals ftx binance is making the purchase to help ftx manage a crunch where users have been pulling money out amid fears about its financial strength it s the latest crisis of confidence to slam the crypto industry this year as prices have tumbled in part on worries about higher interest rates

democratic rep tom malinowski faces a rematch against republican former state senate minority leader tom kean jr the district picked up more republican voters after its boundaries in the northwest were redrawn malinowski who is seeking his third term narrowly defeated kean a former state lawmaker and the son of former republican gov tom kean sr in 2020 malinowski first won election by defeating republican incumbent rep leonard lance in 2018 the race is among the most closely watched in new jersey which has no statewide contests or ballot questions this year malinowski cast kean as too reliant on support from voters loyal to former president donald trump to represent the district which swung from reliably gop to democratic control during his years in the white house kean has seized on inflation as a top issue and hammers on house speaker nancy pelosi whom he is betting is unpopular with voters malinowski is a former obama administration official and supported impeaching trump as well the 1 trillion infrastructure bill that democratic president joe biden signed a year ago kean served as the top republican in the state senate from 2008 until this year after declining to seek office again in last year s election democratic incumbents mikie sherrill in the 11th district in the northern part of the state and andy kim in the 3rd district in south and central new jersey won election for a first term along with malinowski in 2018 however their districts became more democratic when the boundaries were redrawn democrats who controlled the redistricting process the redistricting commission met months after reports that malinowski had bought and sold stocks with a stake in the country s covid 19 response there is no indication malinowski acted on inside information to make his investment decisions and said he didn t direct his broker to make particular trades sherrill faces republican challenger paul degroot who s worked as a prosecutor in passaic

with 28 000 poll workers making it all happen at about 3 200 polling locations across new jersey the office of the secretary of state said monday results should be available a bit earlier this year as a new state law allowed elections officials to open and prepare vote by mail ballots for machine counting during the days leading up to the election that means they can be counted faster on election day as of monday 973 240 out of 6 5 million registered voters in new jersey had requested vote by mail ballots and 511 676 had been returned to their county boards of elections for counting vote by mail ballots still can be returned up until 8 p m tuesday at a secure ballot dropbox in the voter s county via the mail if postmarked by 8 p m or in person at the county board of elections turnout stayed steady in the second year of early voting by machine which happened oct 29 to nov 6 with 213 919 voting early statewide 6 426 in atlantic county and 2 967 in cape may county elections officials said there was about a 3 turnout slightly down from 2021 which i personally think isn t too bad given 21 was the gubernatorial race with a normal higher turnout to begin with said atlantic county superintendent of elections maureen bugdon the legislature elections officials everyone is hoping it will catch on and become more utilized by the electorate we shall see in the coming years i m feeling good i think it s going to be a historic day van drew said on monday afternoon before people go to vote they should go and fill their car with gas go to the grocery store and buy groceries for the week take a peek at their 401k and pay their bills van drew said this is really to me and to many people about whether we are going to become more dependent on government than ever and more socialist in nature democrat tim alexander said he would be working into the wee hours monday night and tuesday with his team doing their best to get every last democratic voter to participate i feel good about the election the pundits and i do not agree alexander said of predictions that democrats will suffer because of president joe biden s low approval numbers people are paying more at the gas pump and more for a can of soup but that is going to pass and women will still be without their constitutional rights that were stripped away when roe was overturned alexander said of the u s supreme court ending the court s protection of abortion rights this summer john froonjian executive director of the william j hughes center for public policy at stockton university said this election could see record turnout once vote by mail and election day machine counts are added to early voting totals a recent stockton poll found voter enthusiasm high this year he said and with the control of congress at stake the trend towards focusing on national issues could push turnout to record levels the statewide turnout in 2018 which was another congressional election was pretty much a record at 54 froonjian said it was higher than last year s gubernatorial election which was only 40 froonjian said it shows you what gets the blood running it s not so much the state house as congress the october debate between van drew and alexander sponsored by the hughes center and the press of atlantic city was viewed 3 000 times online froonjian said we ve put them out before on video and gotten 1 000 to 1 200 views to have 3 000 people view an election debate is a sign there is really a lot of interest out there froonjian said it s difficult to predict how the vote will go in atlantic city froonjian said where a ballot question is asking if the city should switch to nonpartisan elections in may for local offices rather than continue to hold party primaries in june and a general election in november candidates would run as individuals with no indication of party affiliation if the ballot question passes mayor marty small sr and five democratic city council members oppose the change and the lone republican on council and three democratic council members are supporting the change those supporting the change are also critics of small normally when it s a republican vs democrat issue i d say democrats clearly want to keep partisan elections and would prevail froonjian said but this is democrat vs democrat which makes it tougher i guess it s a test of marty small s organization and whether they will get their people out to beat this back in the last mayoral election small dominated but two of the council people who are pushing for the change also did well in that election froonjian said the change would rob the city s democratic committee which is dominated by small supporters of their power to choose which candidates to back in primary elections i know democrats up the ballot there is no question they want it to stay the way it is it s a real plus for them froonjian said of having well known local candidates help democratic candidates for county state and federal office atlantic county democrats supported redistricting that changed the first district from safely democratic covering primarily atlantic city and pleasantville to a more competitive one pairing atlantic city with the downbeach towns of ventnor margate longport and a slice of egg harbor township the redistricting also drastically changed the second district which had been safely republican making it much more competitive by pairing pleasantville with the mainland communities of northfield linwood and somers point and some of egg harbor township now incumbent democratic commissioner ernest coursey is facing a challenge by republican vern macon who heads of a fire suppression company the results will show whether the democratic gamble to have a better chance in the second will pay off or rob them of one of just two seats they now hold on the nine member county board of commissioners who s running in the atlantic county general election on nov 8

zac efron s the iron claw has made a lot of headlines as of late for how shredded the actor looks for the upcoming movie about the von erich family now the project has really upped its cred with the pro wrestling community as the word is out that one of aew s biggest superstars will join the film wrestler maxwell jacob friedman commonly referred to as mjf will enter the fray to help tell the iron claw s story mjf joins the iron claw in an unknown role though it seems fair to speculate he ll use his in ring experience to portray a notable wrestler attached to the von erich family in some way deadline reported maxwell jacob friedman will join zac efron as well as other previously cast actors jeremy allen white harris dickinson holt mccallany maura tierney and lily james the iron claw will be mjf s feature debut and he ll be the latest wrestler announced with ties to the project after chavo guerrero jr the iron claw tells the true story of kevin von erich and the von erich family who had a big impact on the sport of pro wrestling the von erich family is also known for the von erich curse which is tied to the fact that out of six offspring kevin von erich is the sole surviving child of fritz von erich no doubt the movie will educate a lot of casual and non wrestling fans about their impressive accomplishments and tragic stories maxwell jacob friedman s appearance in the iron claw will undoubtedly draw additional wrestling fans to this movie mjf made news months ago after his much publicized falling out with aew s top brass tony khan but he s returned in recent months to honor the rest of his wrestling contract it s widely reported mjf is a top prospect the wwe hopes to pull in when his contract expires at aew though he s reportedly under contract until january 2024 an appearance in the iron claw even in a smaller role will only raise mjf s star power even further in the pro wrestling world hollywood is littered with former pro wrestlers who turned to acting like dwayne johnson john cena and dave bautista it s possible mjf could be the next major name amongst those accomplished actors or this is just a one and done great performance like roddy piper in they live and he ll leave hollywood behind after this in either case it ll be exciting to see what mjf can bring to the iron claw and if that performance will raise his stock when his free agency is officially up in 2024 as of now he already seems like one of the most promising young talents in pro wrestling so this could be a huge boost for his career in pro wrestling if not acting the iron claw doesn t have a specific release date at this time but is expected to appear among the 2023 movie releases until then folks can continue to be impressed by the transformation of zac efron even if there are folks who still think he looks like lord farquaad from shrek

by saqib iqbal ahmed new york reuters investors are expecting republican gains in u s midterm elections a result that could ease worries about democratic spending and regulation but set up a bruising fight over raising the u s debt ceiling next year republicans are favored to win control of the house of representatives and possibly the senate polls and betting markets show though there are still hours left to vote with democrat joe biden in the white house that result would lead to a split government an outcome that has been accompanied by positive long term stock market performance in the past while macroeconomic concerns and federal reserve monetary policy have been the market s key movers this year politics could exert its own influence on asset prices a republican win would help quell concerns that fiscal largesse could exacerbate already high inflation and lead the fed to raise interest rates even higher than expected investors said potentially buoying the stock market s most recent rebound while supporting treasury prices and helping curb the burgeoning dollar i think the markets are rallying at the prospect of gridlock said jack ablin chief investment officer at cresset capital in chicago fiscal spending has created a challenge for central banks worldwide the prospect of no legislation is a bullish inflation signal historically stocks have tended to do better under a split government when a democrat is in the white house with investors attributing some of that performance to political gridlock that prevents either side from making major policy changes average annual s p 500 returns have been 14 in a split congress and 13 in a republican held congress under a democratic president according to data since 1932 analyzed by rbc capital markets that compares with 10 when democrats controlled the presidency and congress the s p 500 which finished up 0 6 on the day has risen about 5 over the last month the index is down about 20 for the year over the longer term however a split government could lead to heightened tensions over raising the federal debt ceiling in 2023 setting up the kind of protracted battle that led standard poor s to downgrade the u s credit rating for the first time in 2011 sending financial markets reeling if the republicans really gain some power here in the house and senate they can make raising the federal debt ceiling a really difficult process said tim ghriskey senior portfolio strategist ingalls snyder in new york analysts at goldman sachs wrote the need to raise the debt limit in 2023 could lead to meaningful fiscal tightening in 2024 and divided government could make a fiscal response to a potential recession less likely to pass and smaller if it does with u s equity options market positioned for relative calm a surprisingly strong showing by the democrats could throw the markets for a loop potentially bringing to the fore concerns about tech sector regulation as well as budget spending that could buoy already high inflation options strategists said options positioning on monday implied a decline of 1 5 in the s p 500 on the day after the vote should democrats pull off a stronger than expected showing according to tom borgen davis head of equity research at options market making firm optiver reporting by saqib iqbal ahmed editing by ira iosebashvili and jonathan oatis

good evening i m karen kaplan and it s tuesday nov 8 i hope you found time to go to the polls or mail in your ballot here s the latest on what s happening with the coronavirus in california and beyond it s been almost two years since the first covid 19 vaccines first became available and nearly one third of americans still haven t completed their initial series of shots one in 5 americans haven t rolled up their sleeves even once this despite the fact that the shots are free widely available and thoroughly tested with more than 640 million doses administered in the u s alone most importantly the vaccines have a proven track record of reducing the risk of dying of covid 19 according to the most recent data from the centers for disease control and prevention people who were unvaccinated were six times more likely to die of covid 19 compared with people who were fully vaccinated and they were eight times more likely to die of the disease than people who were vaccinated and boosted that alone sounds like a pretty good incentive to get poked with a few needles but plenty of other inducements have been added to the mix free doughnuts apple airpods college scholarships and a 1 5 million cash jackpot advertisement yet the ranks of the unvaccinated have barely budged even after novavax introduced a covid 19 shot that uses the same tried and true technology as vaccines for tetanus shingles and the flu vaccine mandates that might have forced some holdouts to get immunized are tied up in court and not being enforced is there any point in continuing to try to change people s minds are the 100 million or so americans who never made it to fully vaccinated status even a threat to those around them at this stage of the pandemic perhaps not clearly the unvaccinated are a threat to themselves dr jeffrey shaman an infectious disease specialist at columbia university told my colleague melissa healy the danger to the rest of us is a more debatable issue anti vaccination demonstrators rally against covid 19 vaccine mandates in santa monica in august 2021 ringo chiu afp via getty images the biggest reason why is that even though only 68 5 of americans are fully vaccinated almost all of us have at least a little immunity by now an analysis of blood samples from all 50 states the district of columbia and puerto rico estimated that 58 of u s residents had been infected by the coronavirus as of february that percentage is surely even higher now courtesy of the ba 5 surge from the late spring and summer the number of people who ve never had a coronavirus infection is dwindling by the day some of those coronavirus virgins may be unvaccinated but in all likelihood they re few and far between advertisement from an immunity standpoint is an unvaccinated person who has recovered from covid 19 any different from a fully vaccinated person who s never had covid 19 or a booster shot that depends on many variables but in many cases the answer is no just under half of fully vaccinated americans have not received a booster shot and studies have shown that being fully vaccinated but not boosted offers very little protection against the delta and omicron variants so in addition to the 100 million who are unvaccinated that s another 100 million plus americans we could categorize as undervaccinated even among the unvaccinated and undervaccinated an individual s immunity levels vary widely based on how long it s been since their last shot how much time has passed since their last infection how strongly their immune system reacted when they encountered the virus or a vaccine decoy and how quickly their immunity waned for those who ve had both vaccine and infection the sequence of events matters too getting the vaccine and then a breakthrough infection can result in strong protection against severe illness and death but the reverse isn t necessarily true americans immunity is kind of a patchwork said harvard university epidemiologist stephen kissler it s changing over time and it s changing over space so it s hard to say where any given community is at any given time that means the threat posed by an unvaccinated person depends on where they are but wherever they are they ll probably be giving the coronavirus a hand an unvaccinated person with covid 19 expels more virus particles than a vaccinated one and that s bound to help keep the pandemic going advertisement by the numbers california cases and deaths as of 2 21 p m tuesday track california s coronavirus spread and vaccination efforts including the latest numbers and how they break down with our graphics are we in for a tripledemic the pandemic was only a few months old when people who were tasked with contemplating worst case scenarios came up with a doozy a hypothetical conflagration of covid 19 and seasonal influenza that was quickly dubbed a twindemic this could be one of the worst seasons we ve had from a public health perspective with covid and flu coming together dr robert redfield said in august 2020 when he was director of the cdc he was partly right that was the winter the alpha variant first reported in the united kingdom pushed hospitals to the brink and beyond it was the deadliest period of the pandemic but at least the flu didn t make it any worse things were much the same the following winter the omicron variant pushed infections to unprecedented levels and so many people got sick that the death toll climbed higher than at any time before or since alpha thankfully flu activity was historically low the cdc estimates there were about 5 000 flu deaths last year a fraction of the typical toll advertisement now it looks like our luck has run out the flu season got off to an unusually early start and is already complicating our lives just ask harry styles and his legions of disappointed fans there are ominous signs that the recent decline in covid 19 cases is about to reverse especially as the long dominant ba 5 strain gives way to newer omicron subvariants like bq 1 and bq 1 1 on top of that is the very real threat of a third infectious disease respiratory syncytial virus or rsv it s already sending young patients to emergency rooms including amy schumer s son and prompted orange county to declare a health emergency forget about a twindemic how about a tripledemic a magnified image of respiratory syncytial virus or rsv along with the coronavirus and influenza it may spark a tripledemic this winter cdc it s probably not a coincidence that both flu and rsv activity are unusually high our efforts to avoid the coronavirus the last two winters by spending more time at home for instance or wearing masks when going out also curtailed our exposure to other viruses that will make us more vulnerable if we encounter them now luke money and rong gong lin ii report such encounters certainly seem more likely considering that so many americans are comfortable going about life like it s 2019 even california which has issued some of the strictest anti covid measures in the country will experience its first pandemic winter without an indoor mask mandate unless state health officials have a sudden change of heart advertisement the increased flu activity should not be taken lightly the most recent report from the state health department says san diego orange riverside san bernardino and imperial counties all have high flu activity even in los angeles the amount of influenza we re seeing is increasing sharply said county health officer dr muntu davis this is the earliest start of the flu season we ve experienced in the past five years and nationwide we re seeing the highest influenza hospitalization rates going back a decade said dr josé romero director of the cdc s national center for immunization and respiratory diseases the federal agency estimates that 730 americans have died since the 2022 23 flu season began last month ten of those deaths were in california the rsv situation is looking dire as well statewide the positivity rate for that virus is above 15 the highest it s been for this time of year since 2016 in orange county things are so bad that the two primary children s hospitals are operating at or beyond their capacity for patients with respiratory illness said dr regina chinsio kwong the county s health officer if you don t know much about rsv but you re starting to think you d better bone up on the disease check out this explainer from my colleague karen garcia it explains how rsv spreads what symptoms to look out for and how to treat it among other things chinsio kwong urged that people ages 2 and older mask back up when they re indoors even though covid 19 community levels are currently considered low throughout the entire state in a tripledemic situation the coronavirus is only one of the relevant threats california s vaccination progress advertisement see the latest on california s vaccination progress with our tracker your support helps us deliver the news that matters most subscribe to the los angeles times in other news under normal circumstances a governor who ordered nearly 40 million people to shelter in place for an indefinite period of time and in effect shut down the world s fifth largest economy probably wouldn t be cruising toward reelection with a commanding 20 percentage point lead over his opponent but anything can happen during this crazy pandemic and gov gavin newsom is on track to win a second term before the night is out election day feels like an opportune time to look back on newsom s covid 19 response to remind ourselves just how uncertain things were in march 2020 when the initial lockdown order came down my colleague taryn luna called it the most consequential government action in modern state history at the time california had 675 confirmed infections and 16 deaths but experts in his administration forecast that if nothing were done more than half of california residents could contract the coronavirus in a matter of months and the state s healthcare system would be overrun so newsom became the first governor to issue a stay at home order before long others followed it really started the national awareness and conversation about the public health interventions and public policy interventions that were needed at that time to flatten the curve and start our pandemic response dr thomas tsai of the harvard t h chan school of public health said a year later the bold action flattened the curve and saved lives but the longer the lockdown lasted the more unpopular it became millions of workers lost their jobs and millions of students struggled with distance learning people became restless they wanted to meet friends at restaurants and visit elderly relatives in long term care facilities advertisement the blueprint for a safer economy remember those four color coded tiers loosened restrictions on counties that had less coronavirus risk but it wasn t enough to prevent a recall election in 2021 that forced newsom to justify his embrace of mask and vaccine mandates he did so with gusto contrasting his actions with those of then president trump the recall attempt fell short by more than 3 million votes we ll have to wait and see how that compares with his margin of victory tonight in the meantime the walt disney co is taking a step toward a post pandemic future the company told about a dozen of its tv shows last week that it was dropping its covid 19 vaccine mandate for cast and crew members according to people in the know disney is one of the first major studios to take that step for a large number of shows though proof of vaccination may still be required on some projects vaccine mandates have been controversial in hollywood unions and producers agreed last year that they could be implemented but fran drescher president of sag aftra has been a vocal critic she praised disney s move in a video posted on twitter when cards must be presented to identify whether you are included or excluded we stand at a tipping point of an america i no longer recognize said the former nanny star who has said she is vaccinated i must applaud disney for taking the position not to vaccine mandate their sets any longer the company declined to comment on the matter other protocols for masking and testing on set will remain in place elsewhere on the vaccine front pfizer released data showing that people 55 and older who got the company s new omicron targeting booster produced four times as many antibodies as people who got a booster dose of the original vaccine what s more their antibody levels were 13 times higher than they d been before they got the bivalent booster an indication of what people miss if they skip the shot advertisement the results are among the early findings from the company s ongoing study of its new boosters which rolled out in early september it s still too soon to know how those antibody levels translate into real world immunity or how long that protection will last in more sobering news a report from the cdc s national center for health statistics says that alcohol related deaths in the u s rose 26 in the first year of the pandemic these include deaths from more than a dozen causes including alcoholic liver disease alcohol poisoning and mental and behavioral disorders tied to drinking alcohol related deaths were on the rise before the pandemic increasing by no more than 7 per year in the first two decades of the century the sudden spike in 2020 was the highest in at least 40 years

frustration with the communist party s zero covid policy continues to grow last week a man accused health workers of impeding his efforts to get his 3 year old son to a hospital after a gas leak in his home the family s residential compound was subject to a quarantine and one of the health workers told the father he would need to produce a negative coronavirus test before help could be offered unable to call an ambulance the man wound up taking his son to a hospital in a taxi unfortunately doctors there were unable to revive the boy the father s account was shared on the social media site sina weibo and the response was sympathetic the quarantines are supposed to protect life and health not to confront those who need to be rescued with obstacles one commenter said officials in lanzhou said the boy s death caused them deep sorrow and regret they said the health workers who offered resistance instead of help would be dealt with seriously public reaction to the toddler s death helped fuel speculation that the national government would relax its covid rules stock markets in china even rallied last week as investors grasped for any sign that life might be normalized but at a news conference saturday health officials said they would stick with zero covid unswervingly now most analysts say big changes aren t likely to come until next year your questions answered today s question comes from readers who want to know will i have to remove my mask during jury duty advertisement probably not and if you do it won t be for very long there are no known instances in which a juror would be required to remove their mask while within a courthouse according to a spokesperson for the superior court of los angeles county if you live in the county this is the court that s most likely to send you a jury summons the l a county department of public health no longer requires masks to be worn inside all government buildings that s reserved for healthcare facilities and places such as nursing homes but the superior court would still like to see them on jurors faces indeed it strongly recommends that everyone inside its courthouses wear a snugly fitting medical mask or respirator the federal courthouses here are taking a more relaxed approach to masks since all counties in the central district of california currently have low covid 19 community levels individuals may wear masks but masks are not required unless the presiding judge requires masks in the courtroom said sara tse chief deputy of operations for the central district even if a judge does not require masks that would not preclude a juror from wearing a mask because cdc guidance provides that people may choose to mask at any time don t let that stance trick you into thinking the federal courts aren t taking masks seriously during the summer when covid 19 community levels in los angeles and orange counties were high masks were not recommended there they were required tse said it is possible that there might be circumstances under which jurors might be asked to temporarily remove their masks for instance a judge might make such a request during the jury selection process when asking a prospective juror to answer a question advertisement if you have a concern about your upcoming jury service at the federal court you can contact the jury department at 213 894 3644 from 2 30 to 4 30 p
