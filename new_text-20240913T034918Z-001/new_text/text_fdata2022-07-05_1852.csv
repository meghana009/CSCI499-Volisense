a constant and largely unquestioned refrain in foreign policy is that the world has globalized closets are full of clothes stitched in other countries electronics and cars are often assembled far from where consumers live u s investment flows into asian markets and indians decamp to the united states for graduate school the numbers show the magnitude of international exchange trade among all countries hovers around 20 trillion a nearly tenfold increase from 1980 international capital flows also grew exponentially during that period from 500 billion a year to well over 4 trillion and nearly five times as many people are traveling across borders compared with four decades ago it is however misleading to claim that this flow of goods and services and people is always global in scale globalization as commonly understood is mostly a myth the reality is far closer to regionalization when companies supply chains and individuals go abroad they don t go just anywhere more often than not they stay fairly close to home consider trade if long distances didn t affect international sales the typical journey for any given purchase would be some 5 300 miles the average distance between two randomly selected countries instead half of what is sold abroad travels less than 3 000 miles not much farther than a flight across the united states and certainly not far enough to cross oceans a study by the logistics company dhl and scholars at the nyu stern school of business concluded if one pair of countries is half as distant as another otherwise similar pair of countries this greater physical proximity alone would be expected to increase the merchandise trade between the closer pair by more than three times companies forays abroad have been more regional than global as well a study of the fortune global 500 a list of the world s largest companies shows that two of every three dollars of their sales come from their home regions a study of 365 prominent multinationals found that just nine of them were truly global meaning that asia europe and north america each accounted for at least 20 percent of their sales additionally the oft repeated term global supply chains is a misnomer the making of things across borders tends to be even more regional than the buying and selling of finished products the pieces and parts that come together in modern manufacturing are more likely to be shipped between neighboring countries than from farther away international capital flows are also more regional than global cross border buyers of stocks bonds and other financial instruments don t invest as far away as one would expect given how global their options are on average going no more than the distance between tokyo and singapore foreign direct investment tends to follow trade over half of all cross border financing circulates solely within the european union and lending borrowing and foreign direct investment in asia by asian banks and companies is on the rise people tend to orient their lives regionally as well most people never leave their own countries and for those who do travel abroad well over half never leave their regions the vast majority of travelers taking european vacations are european the same goes for people in asia and north america those who move permanently abroad also tend to stick close to their countries of origin the majority don t leave their immediate region and although students who venture internationally tend to go farther than other travelers 40 percent don t leave the geographic area in which they were born over half the international flows of goods money information and people occurs within three main regional hubs asia europe and north america the economic rise of china south korea taiwan and vietnam began with regional investments and inputs eastern europe s fast paced growth came from linking to western europe between 1993 and 2007 mexico s economy more than doubled in size thanks in large part to the north american free trade agreement nafta reached in 1993 with canada and the united states the overlooked reality of regionalization has implications for u s policy although nafta was revised in 2020 it is now the u s mexico canada agreement usmca the north american hub is still not as integrated as that of its east asian and european counterparts in industries for which north american regional supply chains developed and solidified such as vehicles and aerospace local production maintained its edge but in other sectors including electronics and textiles north america s more limited regionalization led whole industries to move wherever regional links provided a leg up ideally the united states would be inking international trade deals to expand its market access and pursue its geopolitical aims such as countering china s rise that does not appear politically possible at the moment however a more viable policy would be to fortify and tap the united states regional network that would allow washington to access a broader swath of the global marketplace and stave off losing more of its competitive advantage to countries that are expanding their own regional footprints why regional trumps global the major reason networks skew regional is simple geography matters even with massive container ships moving things across oceans still costs time and money a transatlantic voyage adds a week to delivery and a trip across the pacific ocean adds a month before parts or goods show up in u s warehouses and factories that means producers and stores need to maintain larger inventories of goods that come from far away and it is not only cargo that can be delayed or lost when trade takes place over great distances even with virtually free calls video and file sharing the inherent difficulty of communicating and coordinating across space and time can add to the costs of doing business language and cultural cues vary by country and these differences often grow with distance this is one reason that a quarter of trade happens among countries that share a language legal codes and administrative norms also tend to be more similar the closer countries are eliminating the need for duplicate teams of lawyers accountants and human resources specialists and the intangible but vital task of finding things in common and building trust and understanding for teamwork can get harder as the distance between people grows the oft repeated term global supply chains is a misnomer trade pacts as well tend to be regional although the 1990s saw the creation of the world trade organization wto and the expansion of its membership and oversight powers what has been as important if not more so over the last 30 years has been the proliferation of bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements which tend to involve countries in the same region european countries turned first to each other for trade brazil joined with argentina paraguay and uruguay after reaching a bilateral trade deal with israel the united states turned to canada and mexico and later to ten other nations in the western hemisphere asian nations banded together through the free trade area of the association of southeast asian nations and later the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep global arrangements such as the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp the successor to a pact that was engineered by washington but that the united states later abandoned are so far more the exception than the rule companies see differences in their bottom lines depending on their geographic dispersion many have gone abroad to boost their earnings benefiting from the cross country advantages of differential skills and wage costs yet go too far and costs begin to rise again in 2010 an academic study of 123 u s multinationals found that returns on assets improved as companies expanded internationally within their region but declined when they ventured farther from home the management consulting group mckinsey company dubs this the globalization penalty finding in a survey of 500 multinational corporations that earnings diminished as operations spread out it seems the optimal distance for private sector profits is a goldilocks zone not too close but not too far the rule of three the strength of the regional networks that a country belongs to are therefore particularly important and in this regard european countries are well situated although brexit and mounting populist euroskepticism may make the eu appear fragile the european continent is in fact the most integrated region in the world the deep ties that connect its countries are rooted in over a half century of diplomatic bargains that created a single market a common passport and a shared currency today europeans make things together and sell to one another with nearly two thirds of eu trade staying within the union similarly internal european investment exceeds that from the rest of the world by 50 percent asia is not far behind in its integration according to the asian development bank the proportion of the region s trade that takes place internally has risen from 45 percent in 1990 to nearly 60 percent today surpassing north america and closing in on europe decades of export oriented development propelled by asian business leaders and backed by bureaucrats tied country after country together through production supply chains asian countries make things together and increasingly buy from one another nearly one third of asian finished goods are sold to consumers in the region extreme weather will upend logistics as ports flood and rails buckle north america s countries have also deepened their economic ties to one another in the wake of nafta trade between canada mexico and the united states rose fourfold outpacing that between those countries and ones outside the region investment too became more regional particularly for mexico where since nafta s signing in 1993 one of every two dollars flowing in has come from its neighbors in particular north america s agricultural and advanced manufacturing supply chains expanded and strengthened over the course of the 1990s leading regional commerce to jump by more than a quarter this integration didn t last however after china s 2001 accession to the wto regional exchanges dwindled falling from around 47 percent of the continent s total trade in 2000 to a low of 39 percent in 2009 before recovering slightly to around 40 percent by 2018 still although north america s internal connections remain significantly less robust than those in asia and europe they far outstrip those among the countries of africa latin america the middle east and south asia regions where less than a quarter of trade and investment occurs between neighbors just in time during the covid 19 pandemic border closures and rising transportation costs have prompted companies to consider bringing production closer to home governments have suddenly become keen to exercise more control over international supply chains for pharmaceutical and medical products at the same time ongoing technological innovation has made it easier for the private sector to expand production in different geographic neighborhoods automation in particular is making far flung factories and supply chains less vital and less profitable than in the past as sensors increasingly monitor assembly lines and equipment and robots and other forms of mechanization take over many manufacturing processes and tasks wages make up a smaller part of operating costs that development has diminished at least in part the once strong draw of locations with cheap labor new ways of making things such as 3 d or additive printing are also changing manufacturing processes making small batch production runs more affordable and reducing the need for specialized factories these advances lower the numbers of workers that companies need and change the skill sets they seek in many sectors skilled and higher paid technicians have become far more important than line workers that shift diminishes the advantages of economies of scale enabling at least some companies to move production closer to consumers without sacrificing profits the value of time is growing too as consumers expect faster delivery and near immediate gratification the longer lead times for goods produced by factories thousands of miles away can mean lost sales the popularity of customized products also makes mass producing facilities abroad less relevant than in the past moreover demographic shifts are raising the low wages that once drew so many companies to developing countries in china the great migration that brought over 200 million workers from the hinterlands to manufacturing centers has largely ended after decades of strict family planning more workers are now exiting the labor market than entering it this trend looks set to accelerate the national workforce is expected to shrink by 100 million people over the next 20 years working age populations are contracting throughout much of asia limiting labor pools and driving up wage rates across electronics and other supply chains in europe working age populations are in decline or appear to be headed that way millions of hungarians romanians and other eastern europeans have headed to their western neighbors in search of better pay and opportunities and an influx of migrants and more recently refugees is only partly replenishing workforces another factor curbing globalization is climate change extreme weather will increasingly upend logistics as ports flood rails buckle and airplanes are more frequently grounded by storms longer supply chains increase these vulnerabilities and potential costs meanwhile policies designed to slow the planet s warming by cutting emissions are raising global transportation prices incentivizing companies to manufacture goods closer to consumer markets the power of politics it s not just technological and demographic shifts and climate change that will curb globalization and favor more regionalization political change is playing a role as well after decades of opening up to the world economy many countries are pulling back the global trade alert a nonprofit that tracks and collates trade policies from official sources around the world has calculated that since the 2008 global financial crisis new protectionist measures have outpaced liberalizing ones three to one meanwhile the wto has been sidelined it is no longer the forum to negotiate new trade rules its efforts to reshape global trade ended in 2015 when the so called doha round of talks sputtered to a close more niche efforts such as attempts to reduce fishing subsidies in mostly rich nations are struggling since 2018 the wto has been unable to punish countries that break the rules as the united states under both the trump and the biden administrations has refused to approve new judges to its appellate body instead regional accords have stepped in to govern international trade the usmca regulates north america s trade ties and arbitrates disputes in asia the rcep now governs commercial exchanges among 15 countries removing most tariffs and combining rules of origin requirements to favor regional supply chains the african continental free trade area agreement aspires to do something similar replacing a tangle of bilateral rules and regulations with a single almost continent wide commercial system regional accords now set the rules for more than half the world s trade regionalization not globalization will set the corporate agenda in the coming decades geopolitical tensions threaten to fragment international commerce even further economic competition has become a pillar of great power rivalry with industrial policy back in vogue many countries including the united states are throwing up protectionist barriers the u s government has identified semiconductors large capacity batteries pharmaceuticals and dozens of critical minerals as vital to national security and is now implementing policies and spending tens of billions of dollars to expand stockpiles beef up manufacturing capacity at home and in friendly nations and redraw global supply chains in these designated sectors countries everywhere are drawing up their own lists some of them adding information and data flows fragmenting cross border flows of services as governments work to reshape the business environment across more industries they are also implicitly or explicitly asking other countries to choose sides through export controls and other mechanisms this will further limit international ties the push to reshore critical products and services is underway almost everywhere but what most countries will find is that outside of a few highly sensitive or vital products companies can t or won t bring production back home those that try to do so are more likely to go bust as costs rise and innovation falls the most probable scenario is that multinationals will turn away from globalized supply chains in favor of shorter more duplicative regional ones regionalization not globalization will set the corporate agenda in the coming decades america s advantage many of these technological demographic and policy shifts favor the united states the declining importance of cheap wages and the rising role of skilled labor should advantage better paid u s workers a trove of intellectual property and intangible assets including several of the new technologies transforming work and workplaces will allow many u s based companies to reap outsize benefits abundant financing means more discoveries more patents and more products the united states also boasts clear laws and regulatory regimes which is why so many investors prefer stocks and bonds issued under new york law and a generally receptive and entrepreneurial business environment for all these reasons the u s economy should fare well in this next round of globalization still washington s advantages aren t immutable other countries are also investing in education research and development and advancing their own technologies and national corporate champions moreover the next billion new buyers of cars clothes and computers will be in asia where middle classes are growing faster than in any other region to tap into this growth u s multinationals and exporters will need to adapt to effectively compete the united states should pursue reforms at home to take better care of its people and workers and to prepare them for a more fluid and volatile economic future this will require expanding safety nets ensuring labor rights and improving educational opportunities that upgrade americans skills domestic infrastructure also needs an upgrade to lower logistical costs that weigh down american made goods the 1 2 trillion set aside in the 2021 infrastructure investment and jobs act to pay for improvements to highways bridges electric grids and broadband is a good start more public spending for basic science and research and development should follow to usher in cutting edge scientific breakthroughs and technologies in addition to getting its own house in order the united states needs a more strategic approach to trade one of the country s challenges is the eroding price competitiveness of its exports in an increasing number of international markets the countries to which the united states enjoys preferred access account for less than 10 percent of the world s gdp and few of them are among the fastest growing markets as other countries have formed and joined trade accords the cost of u s exports has risen in relative terms because of the rcep cars assembled in japan and south korea no longer face the double digit tariffs that u s manufactured alternatives still confront in the region and chinese steel chemicals and machines all face lower levies than options made in the united states in an ideal world the united states would pursue a robust and comprehensive trade agenda joining the cptpp restarting negotiations over the transatlantic trade and investment partnership which would have linked the u s and eu markets and revitalizing the wto would open up more markets to u s goods and services and reinforce more transparent fair and environmentally friendly ways of doing business the united states would also do well to regain its leadership in international standard setting bodies restoring its traditional role as a rule maker and not just rule taker a production line in production line in shenzhen china september 2019 jason lee reuters but until the politics of trade change in the united states none of that is likely to occur in the meantime washington can benefit by turning to its neighbors canada and mexico have preferred access to many global markets where the united states pays full fare their respective portfolios of free trade agreements each cover some 1 5 billion consumers representing nearly 60 percent of global gdp feeding into canadian or mexican manufacturing supply chains can give u s producers and parts makers preferential access to the world s consumers which they currently lack on their own for instance mexican made cars sold in europe dodge the ten percent tariff u s made models face lowering the sticker price by some 3 000 on a ford focus and by over 4 000 on an audi q5 a savings that makes it hard for u s carmakers to compete the opposite is true for u s based parts makers mexican plants can source up to 40 percent of their europe bound models from suppliers in countries that are not part of the bargain that means imported mexican made cars sold in france or germany also keep u s factories humming in today s more regionally focused world exports are more competitive when countries make them together much of germany s touted international commercial success has resulted from its regional manufacturing ties by seeding plants and operations throughout eastern europe germany s private companies the famed mittelstand have bolstered the country s manufacturing base and created jobs at home as their products have thrived on global markets china s spectacular rise and export dynamism similarly has depended largely on its incorporation into regional supply chains if the united states wants to help its companies replicate these successes it also needs a regional approach regionalization brings competitive advantages that a single country even one as large and wealthy as the united states cannot match on its own to make products as good affordable and fast as the competition u s companies need to be able to source parts from many places and complete some tasks and processes in other countries a regional commercial strategy will also help more work stay on the continent and thus in the united states when part of production is located in canada or mexico u s suppliers are more likely to keep or gain contracts and remain in business than when production moves overseas and when orders rise so do jobs all along the supply chain the organization for economic cooperation and development estimates that on average nearly 40 percent of the value of u s imports from mexico is created in the united states for canada that figure is just over 25 percent conversely u s input into imports from the rest of the world averages just 4 4 percent reflecting how few u s based suppliers are part of the global production process to enhance north america s regionalization the continent needs to improve its linking infrastructure this means adding land crossings upgrading thoroughfares that lead to and away from the border expanding rail lines and depots and investing in people and technology to staff and to support ports of entry with faster connections and lower logistical costs manufacturers in north america can make products that are more globally competitive a more competitive north american economy is possible as parts and components move between the three countries workers must be able to follow more and easier legal work based migration paths are needed to make the region as a whole more productive and they will require transferable credentials licenses and diplomas business visas and longer term migration avenues greater coordination in education and training can help address gaps in skill and improve work environments to ensure that north america s population growth already a bright spot for the region continues educational exchanges language learning and cross border apprenticeships and skill development programs can all help build a continental workforce better able to entice new businesses and investment stiffening migration barriers will just lead more firms to go elsewhere and as the u s government rolls out industrial policies to increase the resilience of and access to a host of critical supply chains its neighbors can help geographic diversification can offset the risks that natural disasters and accidents pose to stockpiles and production capacity regional manufacturing can lower the public financial burden of subsidies as goods are more likely to attain a higher quality at lower cost when drawing on a cross border network of suppliers north america s regional trade has recovered albeit slightly from a 2009 nadir of just 39 cents of every dollar thanks to expanding textile machinery and produce supply chains but no north american leader is prioritizing a continental commercial future mexico is turning inward with energy and natural resource nationalism threatening its manufacturing base canada is looking to diversify its international commercial ties by reaping the benefit of trade deals with the united kingdom and the european union and in asia as a member of the cptpp and the biden administration is guided by another repeated but unsubstantiated refrain that nafta and other trade agreements hurt rather than help u s workers that is misguided most of the studies trashing nafta don t calculate the better paid export oriented jobs gained as a result of more favorable terms in the united states two biggest export markets nor do they consider how lower north american production costs kept industries such as auto manufacturing alive and even allowed them to thrive in the face of global price competition from vehicles manufactured in other rival regional hubs through integration a more competitive north american economy is possible three decades of freer trade the existence of sophisticated supply chains in specific sectors and widespread cross border ties between communities and workers due to the movement of tens of millions of people could be energized and expanded but deeper more sustainable regionalization will also require a change in mindset it

editor s note we ve just launched sign ups for our upcoming the whiskey wash newsletter click here to join our list and stay informed if you re reading the whiskey wash odds are good you re familiar with the whiskey aisle at your local retailer so you ve probably noticed that the shelves are looking a little crowded these days beginning as a small scale phenomenon confined to the wine producing regions of the west coast craft spirits brands began to debut on a national scale in the early 2000s today they re skyrocketing in number and popularity occupying more shelf space and elbowing in on national brands market share every single state in the nation now boasts at least one craft distillery and many are home to dozens the growth has been remarkable and according to michael kinstlick ceo of coppersea distilling it s not going to slow down anytime soon this week at the american distilling institute s annual conference kinstlick presented a white paper detailing craft distilling s meteoric rise the number of current distilled spirits permits the federal permit required to lawfully operate a distillery has grown from 560 in 2010 to 1 825 in 2016 in 2015 alone almost 400 dsps were issued a rate of more than one per day as of 2016 more than 1 000 craft distilleries are now operating in the united states exponential growth in an industry that was virtually nonexistent 15 years ago craft whiskey overtook vodka as the single largest craft category sometime in the early 2010 s and its share is continuing to grow today approximately 60 of all craft distilleries sell at least one whiskey expression kinstlick suggests that figure may be even higher in actuality since it does not count distilleries producing whiskey but waiting for their stock to age before releasing a product what does this incredible growth mean for the craft industry kinstlick sees continued expansion on the horizon and that expansion means more competition his white paper concludes the craft distilling market is no longer in its infancy the pioneers of the 90 s and 00 s yielded to the explosion in new entrants over the past few years and now we are seeing some of those entrants departing the next phase of the market will see increasing numbers of exits even as the number of new entrants continues to grow the dynamics of consumer demand and the prior examples of farm wineries and craft brewers suggest that the craft distilling market is far from saturation however the days of bottling gns based vodka and calling yourself the first distillery in which where county since prohibition may be over knowledgeable consumers are seeking truly local products with panache and differentiation the next milestone 2 000 craft distillers will not take nearly as long as the 23 years for the first 1 000 but it will take longer than three years for the next doubling to that level we predict another 1 000 net entrants over the next 5 years and that the number of craft distilleries will ultimately match the number of craft breweries while the next several years might be challenging for upstart distillers we consumers only stand to benefit competitive pressures will reward craft whiskey distillers producing truly delicious products a dynamic poised to make navigating the craft section of the whisky aisle even more fun

the fabric is run through bristled brushes to give it the soft texture and nap the fabric is known for flannel sheets can be made from a variety of materials but you frequently see flannel sheets made from cotton it s incredibly cozy and a great choice for chilly nights breathability if you re a hot sleeper breathability should be at the top of your list when searching for the best sheets stick to materials like cotton and bamboo for cooling when it comes to the type of weave percale tends to provide the most breathability percale sheets like the brooklinen classic percale do a great job of wicking away moisture and preventing overheating thread count bed sheets typically have a thread count that ranges from 200 to 800 but you should let the number serve as a guide of how a sheet feels rather than an ultimate indicator of quality a lower thread count spells more breathability while a higher one lends a sheet a more substantial feel when draped over your body as a general rule sheets above a 250 or 300 thread count are generally fine anything on the lower end say 270 or 300 works for hot sleepers who want to maximize breathability if you re looking for a thicker feeling sheet look for one in the 400 500 thread count ballpark some sheets such as silk flannel and linen don t have a thread count this isn t cause for alarm it s just because the fabrics are manufactured differently certain sets may advertise another assessment of weight such as momme or grams per square meter gsm but you don t necessarily need this information to purchase a high quality set organic certifications you run into several different certifications when shopping for sheets many of which indicate naturally derived and organically produced materials among these certifications the global organic textile standard gots and oeko tex are the most common when you spot an oeko tex certification it means the materials used are free of toxic chemicals whereas gots certified refers to materials derived by majority organic fibers both certifications are generally positive signs that the materials are healthy for you and the environment be on the lookout for sheets that claim to be organic without listing any legitimate certifications although they may say they re made with organic materials there s no way of knowing for certain unless they re verified by a trusted certifier if you re looking for a safe bet consider our top organic pick the avocado organic cotton sheets care and maintenance for the most part all sheets can be tossed into the washing machine but you still need to pay close attention to wash instructions while it s best to wash sheets in warm or hot water certain sets should be washed in cold water or on a delicate cycle also make sure to read the instructions for drying you may need to hang dry certain sheet sets depending on the materials or dry on a delicate cycle what type of sheets are the best quality the highest quality sheets are typically made of cotton but not just any cotton cotton that contains long staple fibers these fibers are spun into delicate fine yarns to create luxuriously soft sheets case in point our overall pick in this story is the boll branch signature hemmed sheet set made of 100 organic cotton the cotton material not only feels silky soft but is also naturally cooling by promoting ample airflow what sheets do nice hotels use there s nothing like sinking into a hotel mattress at the end of a long day and bed sheets play a major part in that comfy sensation most hotels use sheets made from high quality cottons such as egyptian and supima both types of cotton are incredibly durable but also soft if you re interested in bringing that hotel quality feel to your bedroom explore our recommendations for the best egyptian cotton sheets what s the best thread count for bed sheets while thread count is an advertising point for many retailers it s actually not as useful as you might think instead of using thread count to assess the quality of a sheet set you re better of thinking of it as a measure of how the sheet feels a higher thread count sheet has a more dense and less

editor s note this is the second in a series of stories about former gem state governors from eastern idaho idaho falls chase addison clark had clinched a narrow victory as idaho s 18th governor the year was 1940 and the 45 year old idaho falls democrat had come out on top after earning 50 48 of the vote about 120 000 total votes against his republican opponent clarence bottolfsen of arco michael moore who wrote an article about clark in 2015 tells eastidahonews com bottolfsen had defeated clark s brother barzilla in the 1938 gubernatorial race chase succeeded barzilla as idaho falls mayor in 1936 and after four years decided to throw his hat in the ring for governor they were very close barzilla s granddaughter patricia young says of barzilla and chase when my grandfather was defeated as governor chase wasn t going to let that happen to his older brother so he ran for governor and got elected chase whose father had served as idaho falls first mayor and whose daughter would grow up to marry the man who became idaho s longest serving u s senator was thrilled at the prospect of continuing the clark family tradition of public service but the victory would be short lived a disparaging remark directed at a wartime enemy denied him a second shot as idaho s leader entering politics chase s election as the gem state s chief executive was the fulfillment of a plan dating back decades earlier sometime in the 1920s he and his wife jean burnett along with barzilla and his wife ethel peck were holing up at the family s robinson bar ranch in the stanley basin why are you two fellas loafing around up here going to seed a neighbor asked the duo according to a 1991 article from the post register why don t you go back in the world and do something for yourselves the friendly nudge is just what the men needed and chase who ran a successful law practice in mackay at the time had already served two terms in the idaho house of representatives related how an idaho falls democrat became the state s 16th governor and started a political dynasty he moved back to idaho falls and went on to serve two terms in the idaho senate he got into state legislative politics during the time of the progressive era in idaho and all around the nation moore says at that time the democratic party in idaho was split into two factions in his book idaho s governors robert sims points out that both parties were equal in their ability to appeal to voters between 1936 and 1946 the governor s seat alternated between both parties every two years a governor s term was two years at that time moore describes chase as a progressive democrat who supported fdr and his new deal programs while supportive of the roosevelt administration clark was politically astute enough to realize that idahoans were antipathetic to many of the social welfare elements of the new deal clark stands as a curious mixture of support for the national new deal and an advocate of strong states rights as well sims writes as a legislator clark also supported many reform measures such as the ratification of amendments for the progressive income tax and the direct election of u s senators he supported the creation of a public utility commission and idaho s first workman s compensation law clark was elected governor after serving two terms as idaho falls mayor leading the state during wartime on dec 8 1941 a day after the japanese attack on pearl harbor fdr officially declared war on japan in a live address to congress much of clark s time as idaho s chief executive was spent preparing the state for entrance into world war ii he was instrumental in defense and other programs he helped establish the farragut naval training center in sandpoint gowen field in boise and the naval ordnance factory in pocatello moore says related memories of pearl harbor and why it matters to you 77 years later chase like his brother was lenient in his attitude toward prison administration in idaho and ultimately removed the warden of the state penitentiary because he felt his methods were too severe clark generously approved pardons for men able to enter the armed forces his actions resulted in a reduction in the number of state prison inmates from 500 to fewer than 200 clark was strongly criticized for this and it became a campaign issue in 1942 writes sims an executive order signed by fdr in 1942 gave military leaders the right to remove japanese people on the west coast even those who were u s citizens and place them in internment camps throughout the country one of these camps was in idaho and chase supported the relocation of japanese people to this camp moore references some disparaging remarks chase made about the japanese while he was governor that he says tarnished his reputation and marred his record in a speech in grangeville in may 1942 clark said that the jap problem could best be solved by returning all people of japanese descent to japan and then sink the island he went on to say that japanese people live like rats and declared i don t want them in idaho moore explains though moore says these remarks were a blot on chase s record there was a lot of prejudice against japanese people at that time and this was not an uncommon attitude still clark s 65 year old grandson chase church says his grandfather s statement came with a price ultimately he was not re elected for a second term because of it photo of chase clark with his wife jean taken from mackay blog clark gave a great deal to his state and its people when chase lost the election later that year fdr appointed him as a u s district judge in idaho a position he held until his retirement in 1964 he died two years later on dec 29 1966 at the age of 83 church was 9 years old when his grandfather passed and he remembers it as a rough christmas that year he was living in new york city at the time because his dad frank who was serving as a u s senator for idaho was representing the u s at the united nations a family member called and said clark had a stroke and church recalls flying home to idaho to visit him in the hospital he was in the hospital for about a week before he died so that was a really rough christmas for me he says clark is buried near his brother barzilla in the rose hill cemetery in idaho falls from his early days in the legislature to his time as mayor governor and federal judge few people have been involved in public service in as many capacities as clark as sims writes in his book clark gave a great deal to his state and its people as former senator and governor len jordan said in a tribute to clark his career of public service earned him a permanent and highly honored place in idaho s history lessons learned from a fascinating life clark s interest in politics and serving in public office is a trait that he passed on to his posterity his daughter bethine married frank church in 1947 who served as a u s senator for idaho from 1957 to 1981 the frank church wilderness area was named in his honor in 1984 when he died museum of idaho though not technically an elected official bethine was frank s political partner for 24 years and traveled extensively with him on the campaign trail she was known as idaho s third senator because of her active partnership according to boise state university and she mentored numerous democratic candidates for local state and federal office chase church is frank and bethine s adopted son and as a kid he would often accompany his father to political events he vaguely remembers meeting john f kennedy at the democratic national convention in 1960 that was when john f kennedy was nominated says church my father was the keynote speaker i remember him bringing me up on stage to meet jfk and shake his hand despite growing up in a politically active household church has chosen a much different path and did not pursue a career in politics he s spent most of his life working in the electronics industry he s now semi retired in california where he and his wife work with kids in foster care though church only had a few short years with clark he remembers his grandfather with fondness and describes him as an elderly white haired man who was gentle and kind he recalls a story about his grandpa acquiring lots of land in mackay in his younger days it was the height of the great depression and he would trade his legal services to help pay for it church has some stock certificates from his grandpa dating back to that era when clark was the director of a bank in mackay there were a lot of people who lost everything they had because they put it all in this bank he felt so bad about it that he sold all of his land to help people get through the depression church is grateful for what his grandfather taught him about being honest and taking care of others and the greatest lesson he learned came from his father who taught him the importance of compromise and being willing to listen to someone else s point of view the only way he could get things done back in the old days whether you were republican or democrat people were able to compromise on things they were able to hammer out agreements and you might not get everything you wanted but the other guy at least got something too and they were able to make things work politicians don t seem to be able to do that today church says

traction while confidence in the bank of canada to bring inflation back to the target of two per cent is waning while there are concerns about real wage growth and access to credit confidence in labour market conditions and the general economic environment are above the historic average to the point where people say they plan to spend significantly more of the savings accumulated during the pandemic over the next 12 months an interest rate hike or two might put those plans on hold but there does seem to be a rosier view of the big picture than the facts warrant the debate among economists is whether canada will slide into recession to some extent recessions are psychological if people are working and feel secure they will keep spending but the warning signs from around the world indicate it will be hard for canada to export its way out of a recession the russian invasion of ukraine and china s covid lockdown are compounded by signs of a slowdown in the united states the

hardship orman will be the first to tell you that what you don t do with your money may be even more important than what you do with it and in a june 9 blog post orman warned against waiting too long

anything orman was asked what she thought of the fire movement that s fire as in financial independence retire early her blunt response i hate it i hate it i hate it i hate it set off a firestorm among the fire faithful but she explained that it would take a lot of money to make retirement work at say age 35 you need at least 5 million or 6 million she said really you might need 10 million in her opinion anything less wouldn t offer you enough protection from a potential financial catastrophe like an expensive illness you will get burned if you play with fire orman told her interviewer

morning shortly after 4 30 a m on saturday police received a call about an altercation taking place on 1100 east off washington parkway in washington city where a group had gathered in the street in front of an apartment complex according to the reporting party a suspect had attempted to hit several people with his vehicle police said washington city police lt kory klotz told st george news that as soon as units rolled up to the scene one man already had fled another suspect who was reportedly intoxicated attempted to leave but was detained by police before he could drive away another man was found passed on a lawn nearby officers also found a man with a deep and long laceration to his right arm that was heavily bleeding he was with another man who had been attempting to provide emergency medical aid until help arrived according to a police report filed in support of the arrest upon the ambulance s arrival the man with the arm wound was treated at the scene before being transported to st george regional hospital for evaluation and treatment klotz said and the partygoer who was helping the injured man rode along in the ambulance officers then spoke to several witnesses who said a man later identified as 27 year old aaron felde of washington city attempted to run them over with his suv a dark green nissan pathfinder according to the police report and while doing this the suspect allegedly struck two other vehicles witnesses said earlier that evening four men left a bar in st george and ended up at a party where they were asked to leave one of the men felde reportedly told the others he was sober and offered to drive the group home a second vehicle also left the party and followed in tow while en route one of the men asked felde to slow down but he ignored the request and continued driving erratically the report states after being asked several times to pull over felde stopped near the complex on 1100 east where other partygoers were outside as one of the passengers went to get out of the suv felde reportedly hit him a scuffle broke out between the two men and then the suspect got back into the pathfinder and sped forward toward the group in an attempt to hit them with the car according to the police report police say two of the men were struck by the suv one of the men pushed the third man out of the way and put his arm up just as the suv lunged forward which caused a deep laceration to his forearm one guy went over the hood of the suspect s vehicle while two others squeezed out of the way klotz said a verbal altercation ensued which is when felde started to back out as he did so he allegedly changed his mind and hit the accelerator the suv lunged forward and struck the back of a mazda dead on klotz said the mazda was then pushed into a toyota tundra that pitched forward into the group standing in front of the truck had they not jumped out of the way klotz said they likely would have been pinned in between the vehicles and seriously injured despite his saying he was sober the suspect was reportedly intoxicated according to witnesses who reported seeing felde drink a half a bottle of vodka at the party the officer noted another witness in the area was awakened by the fighting and told officers he looked out his window to see a dark green vehicle back up quickly and then accelerate toward four people where the suv appeared to have crushed one of the men while another was struck the suspect then hit two parked cars before leaving the area the witness said a cell phone later found at the scene assisted officers in identifying felde as the driver of the pathfinder investigators also located a single red shoe near the cell phone when investigators responded to the suspect s residence they found the dark green pathfinder with heavy front end damage consistent with what investigators found at the scene detectives also noticed swelling on the suspect s left eye when asked the suspect reportedly said he was in an altercation earlier that morning and was not sure how he got home when the suspect was transported to the police station in washington city for an interview the report states he requested an attorney and all questioning ceased during a search of the nissan officers located a red shoe on the driver s side floorboard that matched the shoe found at the scene on 1100 east and a records check later revealed that felde had a suspended license out of montana the suspect was transported to purgatory correctional facility facing multiple charges including four third degree felony counts of aggravated assault he also faces one misdemeanor count each of a collision involving property damage failing to report a collision involving property damage driving on a suspended license and intoxication two other suspects also were arrested for misdemeanor offenses related to intoxication klotz said the investigation into the incident continued into saturday afternoon and involved multiple witness statements trips to the hospital and bystander accounts he also said an altercation that only took a few minutes impacted multiple individuals the investigation was hampered by the fact that officers had to rely on statements provided by individuals that were heavily intoxicated said klotz adding that alcohol played a major role in the events that unfolded that night from start to finish this investigation was crazy he added this report is based on statements from court records police or other responders and may not contain the full scope of findings persons arrested or charged are presumed innocent until found guilty in a court of law or as otherwise decided by a trier of fact copyright st george news saintgeorgeutah com llc 2022 all rights reserved

for some this year s independence day celebration will be muted because of recent supreme court decisions that raise grave concerns about our individual liberties and religious freedoms on this 246th anniversary of the declaration of our independence from the rule of tyranny we acknowledge that since the founding of our nation we have yet to fully realize the vision of a land where the unalienable rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness might be experienced equally by all citizens we know that women people of color indigenous persons religious minorities including jews and members of the lgbtq community among others were only granted these rights after years of struggle and even then those rights were not always granted in full measure many fear that some of these hard earned rights might soon be taken away just as abortion access has in many states which is as rabbi danya ruttenberg notes in a recent article a matter of religious freedom but on this day let us reflect on a moment just after our nation s founding in august of 1790 george washington who had been elected the first president of the united states the previous year traveled to newport r i along with his secretary of state thomas jefferson in anticipation of his visit moses seixas a leader of the hebrew congregation of newport sent washington a letter in which he petitioned the president for full rights for the jewish community at that time jews in rhode island though citizens could neither vote nor hold office in his letter seixas described the united states government as one which to bigotry gives no sanction to persecution no assistance but generously affording to all liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship deeming every one of whatever nation tongue or language equal parts of the great governmental machine in his response president washington borrowed some of the language of sexias s letter the citizens of the united states of america have a right to applaud themselves for giving to mankind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy a policy worthy of imitation all possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship it is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights for happily the government of the united states which gives to bigotry no sanction to persecution no assistance requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens today we celebrate the promise of that moment we honor the courage of those who were willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for that vision for that idea rather than allowing these recent decisions to dampen our celebration let us be inspired by our founding generation who saw the world that was and dreamed of a world that might yet be rather than allowing these recent decisions to dampen our celebration let us be inspired by our founding generation who saw the world that was and dreamed of a world that might yet be instead of despairing at this moment let us move forward with determination and hope animated by a vision of an america that will someday in part through our own efforts fulfill its promise to become a place where bigotry is given no sanction persecution no assistance and where all will be afforded the dignity of liberty of conscience and control of their own bodies let us be inspired by the words of senator carl schurz 1829 1906 who also served our nation as secretary of the interior the german born schurz who immigrated to america as a young man and who never stopped believing in its promise famously said in response to those who declared their patriotism by claiming our country right or wrong our country when right to be kept right when wrong to be put right let us endeavor to build an america worthy of president washington s description in his letter to the jewish community of newport there he references a verse from the prophet micah that imagines a time when our people whom washington calls the children of the stock of abraham along with all of our fellow americans will continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants while everyone shall sit under own vine and fig tree and there shall be none to make afraid on this independence day let s celebrate that ideal and rededicate ourselves to reaching it as another visionary would have it if we will it it is no dream rabbi yoshi zweiback is the senior rabbi of stephen wise temple in los angeles california

columnists pat hickey and sean whaley this opinion column was submitted by rgj columnist pat hickey and carson city based writer sean whaley a number of notable folks have talked plenty about saving lake tahoe beyond compelling prose not many have been able to do all that much about preserving the lake s incredible natural heritage the legendary john muir visited lake tahoe in 1888 and saw the devastating effects of the loosely regulated timber business by 1897 muir was crusading before congress to make tahoe a national park the founder of the sierra club didn t succeed by then too much of the land in the tahoe basin was already in private hands it turns out that one eccentric land grabbing californian george whittell jr ended up doing more than anyone to conserve pristine property on the nevada side of the lake born into san francisco wealth whittell serendipitously turned his inherited stock holdings into dollars right before the depression the great gatsby style figure was among the first californians to relocate here to domicile his vast fortune in low tax nevada given his abundance of cash and a wily eye for a good business deal whittell ended up owning nearly one third of the tahoe basin including 27 miles of nevada shoreline the onetime playboy turned preservationist planned massive developments but most never materialized because of his growing reclusiveness and accidental conservation tendencies the lasting physical legacy he did leave lake tahoe is the 6 5 acre luxurious waterfront thunderbird estate which lies nestled in its bouldered cove south of sand harbor sharing four hours and nearly three bottles of wine with the thunderbird preservation society s curator bill watson we regaled in tales of of the lodge s hidden excesses like the cozy poker room where whittell is said to have exchanged beaucoup bucks with the likes of baseball bad boy ty cobb casino pioneer bill harrah and fellow recluse howard hughes as is typical of the stories sean and i have encountered walking around tahoe many of the thunderbird lodge s tales are found within the estate s illustrious history like the 600 foot tunnel dug by area miners that leads to the boathouse home of his classic thunderbird yacht whittell employed native american stonemasons from carson city s stewart indian school to fashion the property s rock surfaces and pathways to blend naturally into the cove s granite shoreline given our slightly tipsy state sean and i continued on our quest to cap off the evening s hike with the hopes of viewing a full moon rising sean reflects we picked the night of the full strawberry moon to hike to secret cove a clothing optional beach below highway 28 encompassing another segment of our journey around lake tahoe the hike was beautiful but anticlimactic there were no nude moonbathers on the lovely beach in fact there was no one around at 10 p m but the two of us we sat in the sand and watched small waves lap at the shore enjoying the dark night sky we waited patiently for the super moon to make its appearance but being on the east side of the lake up against the sierra nevada meant that luna was in no hurry to put on her show for us patience turned to weariness and so we hiked back up to the parking area thinking we might catch a glimpse of the full moon when we arrived hiking from the deserted beach through the pitch dark was an adventure but we emerged unscathed there was no moon visible at the parking area at 11 p m and eventually both pat and i decided to take our leave as sean reports only a couple of boobs like the two of us would visit a clothing optional beach when it was too late to see anything still the real treasure we caught a glimpse of was the mostly untouched stretch of nevada that ended up being the finest gift george whittell sold or bequeathed to the public in his adopted state bill watson who s helping preserve whittell s stories for a public that knows little of how much this uncommon figure left to nevada says the real legacy of george whittell was not the visible monuments of his home or boat but the open space along the eastern shore that preserved the nevada side of the lake from looking like the california side nevada is richer because of wealthy eccentrics like whittell who came here and discovered that home means nevada today s home is better because of him rgj columnist pat hickey was a member of the nevada legislature from 1996 to 2016 sean whaley is a writer based in carson city he covered politics in nevada s capital for various news outlets from 1989 to 2017 have your say how to submit an opinion column or letter to the editor

menafn usa art news peter brook one of the most innovative and admired theatre directors of his time whose stage work had a powerful symbiotic relationship with the visual arts of the past 75 years has died aged 97 brook s multi layered career was made up of nearly 25 years as an innovative sometimes iconoclastic figure in the commercial theatre of london and half a century as a paris based magus of international theatre he was a master of collaborative experimental productions and his 1985 adapatation and staging across 11 hours of the ancient sanskrit epic the mahābhārata was one of the great mind expanding and world touring artistic experiences of the late 20th century the london born brook made his name as a rising star of british theatre in the late 1940s in his early 20s he was already directing productions at the shakespeare memorial theatre in stratford where he staged a watteau inspired 1946 performance of love s labours lost while from 1947 to 1949 he acted as director of productions at the royal opera house in covent garden london in the latter role he made headlines by commissioning designs for stage and costumes in 1949 from salvador dalí for a new production of richard strauss s one act opera salome brook believed that dalí was the only artist capable of capturing the erotic degeneracy of strauss s and the imagery of oscar wilde s the production had a succès de scandale but it was an experience that neither brook frustrated by the conservative nature of the 1940s opera world nor the opera house wished to repeat and brook s contract was not renewed brook was unusual in the degree to which he was a master both of the visual and the word in his stage productions in two of his most admired shakespeare stagings titus andronicus at the shakespeare memorial theatre 1955 and king lear for the newly established royal shakespeare company in 1962 he was credited as both director and designer and he worked closely with stage and costume designers who channeled his ideas for the look of the performance the production of titus andronicus a piece long considered unstageable because of its heartless gory subject matter was a triumph of stylisation that eschewed stage blood in favour of the techniques of japanese noh theatre where the blood emanating from the mutilated lavinia played by vivien leigh was represented by streaming lengths of red ribbon brook s second great achievement was reportedly to elicit from laurence olivier one of his most unmannered and emotionally true performances in the title role brook s notes for these productions including sketches for stage designs some of them roughed out on bills from london restaurants were among the archive of his papers acquired by the victoria albert museum in london in 2014 they also contain his notes on a performance of chinese operas at the westminster theatre london in 1947 which later inspired his celebrated 1970 production of shakespeare s a midsummer night s dream set in a white box set designed by sally jacobs and with the actors in brightly coloured costumes performing on trapezes and stilts the production which transferred to new york set a visual and metaphorical template whose influence can be felt in the history of art installations at white cube galleries over the past half century as much as it can in the development of theatrical production over the same period peter brook s 1970 staging of shakespeare s a midsummer night s dream designed by sally jacobs and performed at the royal shakespeare theatre in stratford upon avon photo donald cooper alamy stock photo the production of a midsummer night s dream was one of the most concrete realisations of brook s most influential written work the empty space 1968 which opens with his most quoted dictum i can take any empty space and call it a bare stage a man walks across this empty space whilst someone else is watching him and this is all that is needed for an act of theatre to be engaged brook was an exact contemporary of peter hall in 1955 the year that brook directed titus andronicus hall had created a sensation by bringing samuel beckett s waiting for godot to london for the first time to hall brook was the greatest theatrical innovator of his generation the person out on the frontiers continually asking what is quality in theatre where do you find truth in theatre brook felt that his chance to experiment artistically really started with a theatre of cruelty season staged in london in honour of the work of the french playwright antonin artaud it was funded by the royal shakespeare company and brook was able to work as an artist in space and time with actors but without preconceptions or a fixed time frame the result was a radical 1964 production of weiss s marat sade starring the young glenda jackson as charlotte corday and the company generated anti vietnam war play us 1966 brook founded a crucible in which to further his innovative work in paris in 1970 where with generous foundation subsidies he set up a multinational multi ethnic troupe and the international centre for theatre research ictr he also restored a disused theatre the bouffes du nord which became his acting group s permanent home their single greatest achievement was the mahābhārata a massive trilogy on which brook worked with jean claude carrière and marie hélène estienne his regular collaborators for nearly a decade it is the distillation of a 3rd century bce epic the longest poem known to literature whose original text is around ten times the length of the iliad and the odyssey combined the first performances of the piece which was designed to offer what the critic mark lawson has called a universal comprehensibility through image and gesture was given in a disused quarry near to avignon descriptions over the years have recorded performance lengths at different sites as lasting anything from nine to eleven hours the trilogy toured the world transferred to the bouffes du nord and then in english to brooklyn new york city and to glasgow in brooklyn the mahābhārata enabled the revival of the abandoned majestic vaudeville theatre and in glasgow the conversion of the former museum of transport into the tramway arts space to critics who sawthe mahābhārata as being orientalist brook countered that the ictr with its multi racial personnel had always worked against the evil of racism the novelist bernardine evaristo paid tribute to brook following his death remembering his production of the ik a 1975 play by colin higgins and denis cannan the ik set in uganda at the roundhouse in 1976 when i was 15 16 was unforgettable multi racial ahead of his time inspiring puzzling an actor threw up for real i was told each night on stage i wonder what i d make of it today when considering the venice biennale in the arsenale buildings or the triennale di milano expo installations in borrowed spaces around the city it is hard not to be reminded of their influential theatrical equivalents the tramway arts space the avignon quarry and other found theatrical spaces made possible by brook s epic cosmopolitan multi national touring productions and especially bythe mahābhārata brook remained the artistic director of the ictr until 2011 and went on working to the end publishing several recent volumes on theatrical

phil mackintosh nasdaq it s that time of year again when many of us have interns just joining the desk so over the next few weeks we will update our introductions to markets and trading for interns each has plenty of links for interns looking to take a deeper dive into the topics mentioned for those of you who have worked in the market for years sit back relax and enjoy the refresher you never know when an intern might ask a question about the basics what are stock markets for all markets even the ones you shop in for groceries have a pretty simple underlying purpose to bring together buyers and sellers doing trade in a centralized way allows consumers to compare prices and producers to advertise to more customers at once economically it s a win win stock markets add another dimension as they also provide companies with access to investors cash from investors allows companies to grow profits which in turn provides income back to the investors the markets are an ecosystem whether centralized or not markets work best with a diverse ecosystem of participants each with their own specialized role to play in buying selling and valuing stocks chart 1 the stock market ecosystem listing exchanges bring all participants together exchanges play a central role in stock markets literally they are by law open to everyone and create a single market for issuers investors and liquidity providers they allow companies to find investors and traders to all interact at the same prices despite their different time horizons and trading signals exchanges are also unique in that they usually advertise prices on behalf of all customers to help attract other traders and investors that provides what economists call positive externalities it helps all traders keep prices as efficient as possible while creating tighter spreads that reduce transaction costs for all investors even those who don t trade on an exchange it also lets everyone see whether the market is up or down at any instance allowing them to modify investments buy dips and sell peaks with more confidence getting to the heart of the issuer companies also called issuers because they issue stocks are critical to public markets without issuers joining public markets there would be fewer companies to invest in fewer dividends for investors with 401k accounts and fewer securities to hedge and trade public markets provide listing standards and sec rules require corporate accountability via quarterly accounting statements and other disclosures that tends to make public markets more transparent and relatively safer for investors because of that most mutual funds are limited to investing in so called listed stocks only a few exchanges actually engage in ipos and list stocks but thanks to pro competition rules there are around a dozen more exchanges that are just markets for trading chart 2 number of u s companies on each tape by market cap last year turned out to be a multi decade record for ipos with over 1 000 new listings raising 286 billion arguably low interest rates which enabled stocks to reach strong valuations helped make public markets more attractive than many other kinds of investments the day of an initial public offering ipo is important for a company and investors typically bringing a company public allows some bigger investors like workers 401k plans as well as lots of little retail investors to buy their stock having more investors can boost a company s valuations and increase trading activity as investors know they can sell at any time chart 3 2021 was a record year for ipos u s equity markets aren t the only choice for new companies though our public markets have to compete with private markets otc markets formerly including pink sheet and bulletin board stocks and international stock markets for listings that said the u s stock market is the largest source of equity capital in the world with 51 trillion of market cap and trading of around 444 billion each day issuers need investors in order to raise capital issuers need to attract investors long term investors come in two main flavors mutual funds and pension funds also called institutional investors are where a professional manages a portfolio for a group of individual investors retail investors or households in chart 4 can execute trades and manage their own portfolios direct from an app on their phones data suggests they both have around the same amount of capital to invest approximately 24 trillion each chart 4 who owns shares based on year end 2021 data all investors are trying to maximize their investment returns many mutual funds will research stocks to try to find companies that will grow revenues the fastest pay the best dividends have the best profit margins or offer the best value however you define that these funds provide an important role in what we call price discovery where good companies prices go up as investors buy them while companies with less rosy outlooks see their prices fall as investors sell it is part of what helps markets efficiently allocate capital but actively picking stocks that outperform is also how portfolio managers beat the market other portfolio managers run index funds they try to buy every stock in an index usually at market weight these funds save costs as they do less research and much less trading they are also relying on the market s overall efficiency to ensure the prices they pay are not inefficient data comparing returns of index and active funds suggests the market is very efficient recent data also shows that assets in index funds are now larger than actively managed mutual funds retail investors also want to maximize investment returns or at least minimize losses and app based trading has allowed retail to trade more easily and cheaply than ever before in fact during covid we saw retail investors trade even more than usual thanks to the introduction of commission free trading and increased saving caused by covid due to fewer expenditures on items such as vacations and restaurant meals we also saw retail allocating the bulk of their net buying into etfs a form of mutual fund that trades on exchange retail activity levels have fallen as the meme stock phenomenon has faded and more recent data suggest their confidence to buy stocks may also have taken a hit in the face of the 2022 selloff issuers and investors need banks and brokers most of the time issuers and investors need banks and brokers to help them enter and exit the market banks have many direct relationships with issuers and mutual funds they research and often lend to companies they also research stocks and execute trades for mutual funds sometimes using their own atss alternative trading systems such as dark pools so they contribute to both capital formation and liquidity ahead of an ipo brokers will canvass investors to assess interest and help price and allocate shares in the ipo the ipo is known as a primary market then as investors buy and sell stocks to change their portfolio holdings in so called secondary markets they usually need brokers to work their orders over time investors need shorter term traders to keep markets efficient there is not always another investor looking to sell when a new investor wants to buy that s where short term traders from hedge funds and banks to market makers and arbitrageurs help although each has different investment objectives they all play a critical role in keeping markets efficient and liquidity cheap our estimates also suggest they actually make up the majority of trading chart 5 chart 5 investors have the majority of assets intermediaries do the majority of trading market makers don t hold stocks for long but their specialty is being both a buyer and seller at the same time creating a two sided market in each stock ensures that investors can trade regardless of whether they are looking to buy or sell in return market makers hope to earn the spread or the difference between the bid and the offer arbitrageurs help futures and options track their underlying asset prices very well our research shows that etfs trade in line with their portfolios net asset values even if the etf doesn t trade thanks to sophisticated statistical hedging strategies many etfs are actually cheaper to trade than their underlying stocks hedge funds in contrast tend to hold long and short positions at the same time their strategies often keep similar stocks sometimes called pairs efficiently valued that helps keep markets more efficient adding selling to a buyer of one stock by buying a hedge from a seller of another stock research even shows that short sellers help keep markets efficient by adding sellers to overbought stocks markets rules have evolved over time stock markets have rallied and crashed multiple times in history often following bear markets rules are changed to protect investors that s exactly what happened after the largest bear market in u s history which followed the u s depression where stocks fell over 85 from their highs as unemployment reached 24 9 in the decade that followed the depression u s markets saw the introduction of a number of new rules to protect investors securities act of 1933 established rules for ipo s so that investors would have information on which to base their investment valuations established rules for ipo s so that investors would have information on which to base their investment valuations banking act of 1933 also known as the glass steagall act separated commercial banks that lent homebuyers money and investment banking that traded stocks and bonds to this day insurance on bank accounts fdic and brokerage accounts sipc is different also known as the glass steagall act separated commercial banks that lent homebuyers money and investment banking that traded stocks and bonds to this day insurance on bank accounts fdic and brokerage accounts sipc is different exchange act of 1934 established the securities and exchange commission sec to regulate stock and options markets and set exchanges as self regulatory bodies sros responsible for policing their own listed companies and trading rules established the securities and exchange commission sec to regulate stock and options markets and set exchanges as self regulatory bodies sros responsible for policing their own listed companies and trading rules formation of nasd in 1938 the national association of securities dealers nasd regulated the trading of stocks that were not listed on exchanges it has since become nasdaq trading and finra broker regulation the national association of securities dealers nasd regulated the trading of stocks that were not listed on exchanges it has since become nasdaq trading and finra broker regulation investment company act of 1940 set all the rules that mutual funds including etfs need to follow including safe custody of assets and limits on leverage chart 6 market rises and falls log scale setting up for consolidation and fragmentation of trading another significant regulatory change happened in 1975 with the securities act amendments those rules set up what we now call the national market system nms perhaps most importantly brokerage commission rates were deregulated by the sec a move that drew significant criticism as wall street cried may day however in a trend that would play out again over the following decades lower costs led to rising volume that has long since made up for lower fees then in 1994 congress passed the unlisted trading privileges act of 1994 which allowed any exchange to trade any ticker regardless of where that stock was listed today there are 17 exchanges and more than two dozen dark pools all of which can trade any listed us stock although instinet launched the first dark pool in 1986 reg ats didn t set consistent rules for dark pools to trade in in 1999 chart 7 today s market is fragmented with many venues able to trade any stocks they want market automation also started in the 70s it probably seems hard for an intern to believe but as recently as the 1990s most stocks were traded in person in pits or at posts on the floor of an exchange with each trade written down on tiny pieces of paper that were taken back to the office to be processed for customers the next day interns would probably join runners delivering physical stock certificates from the seller s broker to the buyer s broker some floors do still exist today but the u s market started to automate back in 1971 an event that ultimately created nasdaq although nasdaq s first data centers had tape drives monochrome cathode tube screens sideburns and plaid trousers a lot has changed since then exhibit 1 a nasdaq data center in 1971 the year the company s electronic exchange began operating with most floor based markets all investors would see was a ticker tape of historic trades literally a rolled up piece of paper with typing on it well after the trades had actually happened although even today the industry refers informally to the record of all quotes and trades as the tape you might even hear a trader still say a trade has hit the tape which means it is now on the screen and in the database moving from automated quotes to trades in its first iteration the national association of securities dealers nasd now finra built a system for market makers in otc generally micro cap stocks to electronically update their bid ask quotes that became the nasd automated quotations hence the acronym nasdaq exhibit 2 one of the early bunker ramo computer terminals used to make and see quotes over time as computers improved more data could be shared more easily this benefited investors and traders who could not necessarily see what was happening on other human trading floors the main data innovation in the 1980s was the creation of a real time level 2 data feed more than simply providing the best bid and offer level 2 showed all market maker best quotes below the bid and above the offer what is now called depth exhibit 3 the quote montage from the nasdaq workstation ii in the late 1990s showing depth note prices are in fractions of a dollar some bonds still trade in fractions today automating executions after the 1987 crash another big market crash happened in 1987 when the s p500 fell more than 20 in one day back then there were no market wide circuit breakers or other guardrails to slow markets down and allow buyers to assemble in the aftermath it was discovered that many market makers were unable or unwilling to trade even though buy prices could be seen on the screens shortly after the process of matching trades was also automated creating what we now call actionable quotes although in their early forms the small order execution system soes automated executions up to a maximum of just 1 000 shares to protect market makers from large market movements the selectnet system allowed traders to create locked in trades although it worked a lot more like email for trading lower costs drive liquidity and activity into the 2000s however that set the scene for a market that looks more like what we know today where almost all trades are executed electronically and as the market adopted computerized trading important new rules were introduced 1997 order handling manning rules now that customers could join the same bid as market makers manning required brokers to put customer orders first that made it easier for investors to trade with each other and capture more spreads manning rules now that customers could join the same bid as market makers manning required brokers to put customer orders first that made it easier for investors to trade with each other and capture more spreads 2001 decimalization led to quotes being in cents which we see today not fractions as we saw above that followed fractional ticks reducing from eighths to sixteenths in 1997 all of which made spread costs much smaller and market making less profitable led to quotes being in cents which we see today not fractions as we saw above that followed fractional ticks reducing from eighths to sixteenths in 1997 all of which made spread costs much smaller and market making less profitable 2007 reg nms mandated many things we take for granted today quotes that are publicly available and actionable prices that can be consolidated in real time to create an nbbo and an interconnected market that helps investors always trade on markets with the best prices as a result market making became more automated and trading got cheaper from 1995 to 2005 markets saw spreads decline 90 and liquidity increased tenfold chart 8 the impact of market wide automation cut trading costs and boosted liquidity trading at the speed of light this all means that over the past 50 years trading has gone from human speed to computer speed to the speed of light computerized trading has led to fewer manual errors faster processing and cheaper trading it has also made trading faster a lot faster consider that a human blink takes around a quarter of a second that s 250 milliseconds light travels from one u s exchange to another around 100 times faster and the computers that compile the consolidated quotes for the public take even less time currently around 12 microseconds for utp and less than 20 microseconds for siac all of which is to say arbitrage happens very quickly and markets are now very efficient chart 9 distances between trading centers at the speed of light where do prices come from in reality almost all trading in u s stocks is done in data centers in new jersey these days so that all investors know which exchange has the best bid and which has the best offer a single unified national best bid and offer nbbo that gathers the best prices from all venues is available to all investors this forms the tape that we talked about earlier chart 10 sips compile the nbbo based on all the exchanges quotes in a specific security given there can only be one unified nbbo the responsibility for creating it has historically rested with each stock s primary listing exchange today we have three tapes as chart 2 shows calculated electronically by securities information processors sips tape a covers all nyse listed covers all tape b covers regional exchange listings including bats nyse american and arca covers exchange listings including bats nyse american and arca tape c covers all nasdaq listed one good reason for this is that primary exchanges are also responsible for opening and closing trading in their listings each day the closing auction is especially important because it sets the official prices used for index funds to trade and mutual funds to invest customer cashflows market structure helps everyone invest and trade better today s stock markets are fast and complicated but the good news is that there are lots of rules designed to make it look simple and protect investors that s not to say they are perfect there are ongoing debates about things like odd lots tick sizes retail trading and short selling rules as well as competing ideas on the optimal way to allocate the economics of price setting and trading overall though our market structure helps make u s markets some of the cheapest and most liquid to trade in and that is even good for issuers phil mackintosh is chief economist at nasdaq

bloomberg argentina s new economy minister silvina batakis vowed to continue the government s economic plans in a bid to stem a market plunge following a weekend filled with political turmoil in the crisis prone nation in her first words since taking over for her predecessor martin guzman who suddenly resigned saturday batakis sought to reassure the public she wouldn t overhaul economic policy i believe in a balanced budget batakis told the press in buenos aires after being sworn in monday evening without taking questions we re going to continue with the economic program argentines already battling 61 annual inflation have yet to be convinced the country s black market exchange rate widely used by the public due to tight capital controls plunged on monday as much as 15 to a record low 280 pesos per dollar before paring back some losses by contrast the official spot rate dropped 0 4 to 125 97 pesos per dollar savers yanked money out of bank accounts with online platforms posting five minute wait times just to log on local businesses reported people rushing to stock up on imported goods like coffee fearing the price would jump soon after the depreciation of the currency suppliers sent companies notices that previously announced price increases had been annulled for bigger ones what bloomberg economics says the official exchange rate is nearly 10 stronger than it was at the end of 2021 in real effective terms which is weighing on argentina s ability to boost its low international reserves the perception that the currency is artificially strong and the country lacks the external financing to meet its investment requirements is fueling expectations of an impending depreciation and reducing investor willingness to finance the government in pesos adriana dupita latin america economist click here for the full report argentina s global bonds which trade at deeply distressed levels near 20 cents on the dollar indicating a high probability of default will come under even more pressure on tuesday when us markets reopen following a long weekend read more argentines seek hedging in crypto after economy minister resigns sudden exit batakis took the reins of economic policy after guzman who has been one of the closest advisers of president alberto fernandez since the start of his administration two and a half years ago stunned the government by announcing his exit with a 7 page letter on saturday his resignation further exposed a piercing divide between fernandez and his powerful vice president cristina fernandez de kirchner with frantic negotiations for over a day to come up with a new economy chief batakis a low profile left leaning economist served as economy minister in the province of buenos aires from 2011 to 2015 back then kirchner was president and daniel scioli currently production minister was batakis boss as governor of the country s most populous district she didn t respond to multiple requests for comment from bloomberg news in an interview with a local tv station on monday night batakis gave reassurances to nervous investors on the government s policy path argentina must fight against inflation she said fiscal deficit is countercyclical but it can t be permanent and the country needs to return to fiscal balance the new minister more recently served at the national level as province secretary a second tier post at the interior ministry that s run by top ally of kirchner former officials say the role helped batakis built relationships with argentina s powerful provincial governors which could allow her to generate consensus as she navigates a divided coalition she s entering with pretty ample support because the governors know her mercedes d alessandro a former economy ministry official who directed policy on gender and equality issues until march said batakis is also keenly aware of the problems ordinary argentines face no honeymoon still batakis won t have any honeymoon beyond inflation seen at nearly 73 by december and poverty levels reaching almost 40 of argentines economists forecast a recession for this year and the central bank has razor thin cash reserves to defend the peso against the brewing currency rout the government has no access to international capital markets after defaulting on wall street investors in 2020 the country s local peso debt market is shriveling up too rolling over less debt analysts warned that the growing strength of kirchner s far left faction of the ruling coalition further jeopardizes argentina s 44 billion program with the international monetary fund kirchner is a longtime critic of the imf and last year floated the idea of not paying back the money before a deal was reached argentina s imf deal at risk with new economy minister analysts even before batakis took over investors doubted the government could comply with the program s targets monday s initial black market reaction suggests more losses ahead and a new inflation acceleration the appointment of batakis is a triumph for cristina kirchner and hence a sign that the radicalization of the government will intensify marcos buscaglia founding partner at

latin america s landscape for medtech clinical trials by julio g martinez clark ceo bioaccess planned and ongoing medical device clinical trial market rose 14 in q1 2022 globally compared to the last four quarters average according to globaldata s medical devices clinical trials database 1 according to a grand view research report the global medical device contract research organization cro market size is expected to reach 12 1 billion by 2028 registering a cagr of 8 6 from 2021 to 2028 the main drivers of the cro medical device market include time savings cost efficiency and expertise in the area accelerating the process of devices reaching the market 2 there are over 6 500 medtech companies in the u s primarily small and midsize enterprises 3 more than 80 of these companies have fewer than 50 employees typically the ones with fewer than 20 employees have limited financial resources and minimal to no sales revenue 4 5 waiting for long drawn out ethics and regulatory approval on an early feasibility study efs or a first in human fih study could tie up investment dollars and quickly lead a startup company to starvation this article examines the need to conduct medtech clinical trials outside the u s and explores the growth of these trials in latin america particularly in colombia and paraguay i will address critical success factors and provide recommendations to ensure cost effective ethical and quality efs and fih medtech clinical trials in the region the need to go outside the u s ous for medtech trials the fda doesn t require u s medtech startups to disclose their ous efss or fih studies on clinicaltrials gov 6 this makes it challenging to keep track of the number of ous efss or fihs that u s medtech startups are conducting in a specific country according to the author s experience and feedback from industry colleagues the countries that most u s medtech clinical trial companies traditionally choose for their ous efs or fih studies are in eastern europe i e poland the czech republic georgia australia new zealand and latin america colombia paraguay panama chile according to the fda an efs is a limited clinical investigation of a medical device early in development it typically enrolls a few subjects fewer than 15 is used to evaluate the device design concept concerning initial clinical safety and device functionality and may guide device modifications 7 an efs gains early insights into an innovative medical technology during the development process before starting a larger clinical trial an efs is a critical step in device innovation and facilitates direct and interactive collaboration between fda sponsors and innovators in the earliest product life cycle stages capturing efs data supports subsequent u s clinical studies e g pivotal post market historically efss have often been conducted ous due to actual or perceived resource constraints and requirements costs and time associated with u s study conduct 8 according to the fda an fih study is a limited clinical investigation where the manufacturer evaluates its medical device for the first time in human subjects for a specific indication an fih can be an efs but not all fih studies would be considered efss 9 according to the medical device innovation consortium it takes about six and a half years and 37 million for a company to bring a device from bench testing to completion of an efs or an fih in the u s therefore many medical innovations never make it to market these companies will not survive the time and financial burden if the device development times including the clinical phase are extensive 5 time is critical for prospective participants and study teams by some estimates a delayed development program costs clinical trial sponsors 37 000 in operational costs each day 10 the unpredictable inefficient and expensive regulatory process to conduct an efs or an fih in the u s forces medtech clinical research startups to conduct ous research where trial regulatory hurdles are more favorable than in the u s and it is easier and faster to recruit subjects at a lower cost according to a recent survey most medtech company responders said that they have conducted or plan to conduct their efs or fih overseas to avoid the stringent trial ecosystem in the u s for example glysure a u s company that conducted a trial in india reported that the outcomes of its ous trial far exceeded its expectations with direct trial cost savings of 50 to 70 compared to u s or eu costs and more importantly savings of 9 to 12 months in development time due to faster regulatory approval processes 11 over the past two decades medtech clinical trial companies have transferred a significant part of their initial clinical research activities overseas this is in response to a more stringent legal regulatory and financial environment in the u s 5 the implementation of the eu medical device directive mdr in 2021 with its new rigorous requirements for substantial clinical data to back mdr regulatory submissions will be the main driver of medtech companies seeking higher performing countries in which to conduct clinical trials outside the eu region in the eu countries the competent authorities and the ethics committees ec in each country can take many months to review the documentation required to seek approval for a clinical program in some countries it can take more than a year to negotiate successfully with the authorities to gain approval for a new clinical trial also after ce marking approval medtech companies will be looking at finding new regions to conduct good quality post market clinical follow up pmcf programs since many research sites in the eu do not have the research staff and support to conduct the pmcf programs that the mdr now requires this is making the eu a less desirable location for the medical device clinical trial market and it may be increasing companies interest in emerging markets like latin america 12 latin america is emerging as a desirable medtech clinical trial destination the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd an intergovernmental economic organization with 38 member countries founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade has never been closer to latin america than it is today chile costa rica colombia and mexico are oecd member countries and on jan 25 2022 the oecd council decided to open accession discussions with argentina brazil and peru 13 increasingly complex and inconsistent clinical trial regulations are causing delays and rising costs and may lead to a decline in the number of international trials to boost medical research and help regulators overcome this problem the oecd calls on its member governments to harmonize their clinical trial approval processes to promote medical research and save lives the aim is to encourage international collaboration in clinical research and streamline procedures for conducting clinical trials the oecd has encouraged its member countries to update their clinical trial regulations to align them with oecd recommended best practices and encourage foreign investment in international clinical research 14 due to its ethnically diverse population its high rate of urbanization and solid doctor patient relations latin america has become one of the most attractive locations for the international medical device clinical trial market 15 according to clinicaltrials gov in 2020 there were 67 medical device trials in latin america an explosive 67 5 increase from 40 in 2017 16 latin america s history of medtech clinical trials can be traced back to 2008 the university of miami um miller school of medicine and the um international medicine institute imi and angiografia de occidente ao a network of cardiovascular catheterization labs in cali colombia have been working together since 2008 under an education research and training affiliation agreement since then the imi has bolstered ao as one of the centers of excellence for cardiovascular disease in latin america under this affiliation ao has emerged as a premier leader in structural heart disease therapy in latin america 17 in 2008 eduardo de marchena m d was a professor of medicine and surgery director of the interventional cardiology program and associate dean of the um miller school of medicine and the imi for several years dr de marchena has co directed and participated in the structural heart latin american symposium at ao in cali the ao annual symposium is considered one of the most important in south america and attracts heart experts from the miller school and throughout latin america and europe de marchena has co directed the symposium with his longtime collaborator antonio dager m d who heads ao and trained from 1985 to 1988 as an interventional cardiologist at the university of miami miller school of medicine 17 the educational research affiliation between the university of miami miller school of medicine and ao allowed both parties to collaborate on developing research projects with innovative cardiovascular devices in colombia colombia stands out in latin america for its solid institutions and commitment to the private sector making it one of the most economically and politically stable countries in latin america the country also stands out as a destination for medtech efs and fih clinical trials the educational research affiliation between um and ao led them to use the symposium as an initiative to train doctors in colombia and the rest of latin america this affiliation sparked a wave of efs and fih research in cali colombia including several sponsored clinical trials u s medtech companies such as directflow synecor mitralign mitraspan

research funding inflow and to treat over 20 000 subjects 27 experts agreed that colombia could benefit from over 100 new clinical trials every year with close to 500 million in economic gains per year 28 several studies have found that colombia s level of education physician patient relationships adherence to trial protocols and patients enrollment and interest in the research are all perceived as high 28 colombia s regulatory agency invima recently announced to the research community in colombia that it is working on updating the medical device clinical trial framework to make the approval process more efficient and to align it with its 10 year plan to become a knowledge based society29 and oecd best practices recommendations for international clinical research 30 according to clinicaltrials gov in 2020 chile welcomed 62 clinical trials this represents about 19 million in pharmaceutical clinical research investments 31 32 although chile with about 19 million people 84 4 in urban areas appears to be an attractive country for medical device efss it has a three to four month ec review and approval timeline and a very complex list of requirements chile lacks a mandatory medical device regulation check out my recent article on the regulatory framework for medical devices in chile chile s clinical trial regulations have not been updated since law 20120 from 2006 33 chile lacks a clear regulatory pathway for the approval of medical device clinical trials only a select list of hospitals in chile have an accredited institutional ec limiting the site selection process to only those hospitals the hospitals with an accredited ec are primarily public and academic university hospitals making setting up a clinical trial in chile overly bureaucratic and complex and not aligned with the speed and predictability that a medtech clinical trial startup wants to see panama updated its clinical trial regulations in 2019 law 84 of may 14 2019 and received 16 clinical trials and about 3 9 million in pharmaceutical clinical research investments 32 panama has about 4 million people 68 in urban areas 34 the country has a three to four month central ec review process and has 11 accredited ecs 35 however panama may be too small to ensure fast recruitment it only has five private hospitals in panama city 36 with little medical device clinical research experience since the country is mainly known for vaccine trials panama is mainly underdeveloped outside panama city limiting subject recruitment and the site selection process for a medical device efs or fih study to just the five hospitals in panama city with about 1 8 million people paraguay is a south american country with about 7 million people about 525 000 live in the capital asunción paraguay has the lowest urbanization rate in south america 61 6 compared to an average of 84 6 for the countries in the region 37 the paraguayan population suffers from endemic rheumatic heart disease likely correlated to the country s high poverty rate within the last 15 years paraguay has become a popular medical device ous efs destination especially for cardiovascular medical technologies adrian

paraguay is three to four months but the time can be shortened to as little as one week with the right government contacts since resolution 614 of december 2016 the ministry of health in paraguay has put in place a robust regulatory framework for the approval of clinical studies 38 paraguay was once classified among the six most corrupt countries globally and the second most corrupt in the western hemisphere observers maintain that corruption in paraguay remains a significant impediment to the emergence of more vital democratic institutions and sustainable economic development in the country 39 there are industry concerns about corruption in paraguay s clinical trial regulatory approval process and light oversight of good clinical practices gcps medtech clinical trial companies that want to have clinical studies above reproach have limited interest in conducting clinical trials in paraguay will the fda accept foreign clinical trial data the fda accepts foreign clinical data from ous studies if the following conditions are met the sponsor conducted the study following gcps and the fda can validate the data from the study through an on site inspection 40 the medtech clinical trial company sponsoring a study shall submit to the fda a description of actions taken to ensure that the research conforms to gcp defined as a standard for the design conduct performance monitoring auditing recording analysis and reporting of clinical trials in a way that assures that the data and the reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights safety and well being of trial subjects are protected the supporting documentation must include qualifications of the investigator s description of the research facilities summary of the protocol results of the study and case records in case the fda requests it description and details of the investigational medical devices used information that shows that the study is adequate and well controlled name and address for the

in the study how the sponsor monitored the study and how the investigator s were trained to comply with gcp guidelines 40 how to start your ous journey in latin america clinical trials require extensive planning ous medical device trials particularly in emerging markets add a new layer of complexity because of the unique challenges of distance logistics regulatory approval and cultural differences the success of an ous medical device efs hinges on choosing the right cro site and pi to meet the study goals it is critical that a medical device trial sponsor works with its cro to find a pi who is genuinely interested in the trial provides feedback on the device s design and has the right background and experience it s critical for a clinical trial sponsor to have people on the ground who live and breathe the local customs and can communicate effectively across geographical and cultural boundaries to resolve issues a u s medical device company should select a medtech focused cro with a local presence in latin america and experience with development stage medical technologies not just pharmaceuticals since the skills the trial process and requirements are vastly different there s a big difference between planning and conducting a trial where the investigational drug has been almost finalized compared with an efs or fih medtech clinical trial with fewer patients and much greater risk the cro the investigators and the research site must be flexible to work with experimental early stage medical devices every country has its pros and cons for conducting clinical research and all regions may not be perfect destinations for clinical trials thus it becomes crucial to identify and evaluate the best country to match your trial needs this evaluation process can be achieved essentially by performing efficient country level feasibility here are the top seven key areas to explore to execute country level clinical trial feasibility successfully subject recruitment potential regulatory and ethical approval processes and timelines sites capabilities qualified staff and resource availability regulatory benefits and incentives confirmation of data acceptance overall project costs details on clinical trial shipment and connectivity 41 conclusion development stage u s medtech clinical research startups struggle to find highly talented medical staff who will give them the focus and energy to gather quality and ethical clinical data at a competitive cost the global distribution of clinical trials is shifting to emerging low income and middle income nations 42 with the help of local experts u s medtech companies should do country level clinical trial feasibility before deciding on an efs or fih location these efss or fihs usually include a limited number of subjects treated with a device which may be in its early development stage before the design has been finalized u s medtech clinical trial startups cannot afford delays in the development of their innovations and should explore latin america for ethical quality and lower cost clinical research colombia is looking to attract more clinical research foreign investment and has an ambitious 10 year

interview with racheli visman ceo and co founder at savoreat can you tell us a little about savoreat and how it was founded the idea behind savoreat came to me six years ago at the time i was the coo of a medtech company and was dealing with health issues that severely limited my diet one day while grocery shopping i had a vision of a robot that prepares the exact delicious meal i was craving only healthy and aligned with my diet after a quick google search i found that there is no such thing and decided to follow my vision and transition from medtech to foodtech founded in 2018 and launched on the tel aviv stock exchange in december 2020 savoreat was the first ever food tech company in israel to do an ipo powered by its proprietary robot chef the company provides a plant based solution with unprecedented quality and personalization to the market the diner can choose the amount of fat protein size and form of preparation savoreat also offers data analysis about consumer preferences the number of products left what needs to be ordered and more savoreat s proprietary fully automated offering backed by its iot system is isolated from the kitchen environment ensuring no contaminants and solving significant issues such as communication with the diner supply chain issues and even waste the system provides a consistent convenient efficient and adaptable production solution for the food service industry what is the robot chef please explain in detail how it works the robot chef is a technology solution connected to iot and big data that empowers the diner to order a digitally manufactured plant based food product all by communicating with the savoreat application each robot chef is capable of cooking 3 different plant based versions of the beef patty with a breakfast sausage patty white meat and a turkey patty that s currently in their final stages of development how does the robot chef integrate within a restaurant space are you replacing human workers with the robot chef the robot chef is isolated from the kitchen it can be located in the front or back of the restaurant and can digitally cook savoreat s products in the future savoreat envisions the robot chef will be able to integrate and cook other patties as well savoreat s robot chef is not a replacement for human workers but rather it brings extra solutions which reduce the necessity for labor to operate the robot as it is mostly self automated and easy to operate if as needed how does savoreat s plant based alternative compare to other meat alternatives in the space companies like beyondmeat and impossible meat spearheaded the first generation of plant based alternative meat products that provided a worthy replacement for plant based carnivores savoreat takes meat alternatives a step forward by establishing the new generation of meatless meat made with zero human interference we are bringing in not only the innovative technology to produce meatless burgers but we are also providing a product that is tailored to both the consumers and food service providers needs how does savoreat push the plant based industry forward in terms of innovation the full solution is completely different in that it s not just a plant based alternative rather it is a full holistic tech solution that provides the answer to various challenges facing the food industry from supply chain and communication with the end consumer to customer preference analysis and even giving the power of choice to the diner savoreat s vision is both personalized nutrition in the future and to offer this full solution as a home device how does savoreat benefit logistics for food service providers anticipate and better manage supply chain issues savoreat s solution allows the operator to know in advance which cartridges they need to order what runs out faster and what less what the consumer prefers etc accordingly the operator can order cartridges ahead of time and avoid problems while streamlining the supply chain known as one of the problematic factors in all markets today in the future the idea is to place the cartridge order automatically waste savoreat s solution offers the ability for food service providers to do away with the preparation of products refining and tailoring not only the ordering and storing process but the production as well this dramatically reduces the number of food products over produced which results in mass food waste additionally this also reduces the amount of individual packaging for each product with savoreat s solution digitally manufactured on the spot from a single packaged cartridge each capable of producing 4 6 burgers preparation speed one robot chef can digitally manufacture three patties in approximately six minutes and savoreat aims to get that to only two minutes simple and easy use no special training is required no need for it manpower no extra cooks and no unique training to operate the robot chef what has been the reception from consumers in regards to the savoreat unique patty the first commercial activity savoreat did at the beginning of the year was with one of the leading burger chains in the middle east the responses received from the end consumer were very positive the taste and texture of the patty were highly enjoyed by the diners who tried the product and in addition the technology and dining experience were equally so savoreat s product appeals to not only vegetarians or vegans but to flexitarians as well with the majority of the flexitarian population between the ages of 20 40 they are more likely to associate with innovation and technology and are considered early adopters in the integrated technology sectors across industries what s next for savoreat the company s next step is to continue focusing on growth and developing more products that offer better versions of the solution but mainly savoreat wants to enter the u s market which is already in the pipeline to take place in the fall as part of the company s collaboration with the global company sodexo as part of this operation savoreat s solution will be offered within academic institutions in the united states and extra collaborations in the u s market are to be expected additionally the company is working on a number of local operations to take place in different locations within the upcoming three months from tech offices and events to operating the robot chef in a leading burger chain in the middle east and even a food truck experience the savoreat journey touring the country 2024 techtimes

the tyee is a fan of hakai magazine victoria based hakai magazine part of the tula foundation and hakai institute family is an online magazine publishing fascinating articles about coastal science and societies globally the information and storytelling are top notch the accompanying article was first published there we strongly encourage you to visit hakai magazine on the southern tip of galiano island a diagonal 28 kilometre long strip of land suspended off the coast of southern british columbia a thicket of douglas fir thins to a small clearing overlooking active pass a layered vista of darkly green gulf islands the archipelago of which galiano is a part extends in every direction directly below the viewpoint the blare of a ferry s horn alerts us to a boatload of passengers headed for the nearby city of vancouver this is the spot says andrew simon a naturalist i ll let you find it a mosaic of ground cover plants makes a living carpet i recognize only one of them tiny spears of common pincushion moss spring from their leafy bedding patched together against the dirt and bedrock then i spot a yellowy moss turned crisp from a dry summer and ask simon if that s the one we re looking for he furrows his brow no that s niphotrichum elongatum he says it s another of the more ordinary rock mosses of the pacific northwest coast simon has brought me here in search of triquetrella californica a far rarer moss it s a small inconspicuous thing he says but it is beautiful i look around for a few moments longer before declaring that i give up simon crouches on his hands and knees the tip of his nose inches from the soil as he holds back walnut colored tresses look at how abundant it is around here he says we re seeing it everywhere on this sunny july day triquetrella californica looks like little more than a sprinkling of dried ramen noodle crumbs but like ramen the moss is made to be hydrated at simon s suggestion i pour a sip of water over the desiccated sprigs and they instantly animate into a miniaturized copse of limey green spires with leaves growing out in ranks of three hence the tri in triquetrella the nondescript plant has not only come back to life it has also with simon s help erupted into my consciousness you ve found the rarest moss in canada says simon there s your sensationalist headline simon is being facetious an exacting scientist he would hate to read an overblown valuation of the modest moss yet his superlative was true at the time this rocky outcrop was the only place the plant was found north of the canada u s border since then a friend of simon s has found a patch near comox on vancouver island as we step back into the forest i test simon s knowledge further pointing to plants along the hiking path he rapturously rattles off the latin names of each species when i naively point to a spindly bush with what looks like black beans dangling from its otherwise bare branches simon informs me it is scotch broom cytisus scoparius a widespread invasive species i feel a flush of embarrassment for not knowing even the most commonplace of plants though life teems all around us most of us can scarcely put a name to the nearest animal vegetable or mineral when simon walks in the woods he s among old friends for the past six years the thin 36 year old with a macro lens olympus point and shoot forever around his wrist has been on a quixotic mission to document every last species on galiano island from the lone pair of elk that swam ashore one day from another of the gulf islands to the orb spiders guarding glistening webs to the oysters clustered beneath the tides his project spans animal plant fungal and protozoan life forms and includes marine life up to a kilometre offshore and down to a reef 120 metres below the surface as well as every bird that flies overhead biodiversity galiano better known as biogaliano is among the more ambitious comprehensive and grassroots biological inventories being carried out anywhere on earth scientifically biogaliano is a formidable ledger of scientific knowledge and a baseline against which to measure ecological change in the future in its first few years the project has already documented a host of species never before recorded on the island and in some cases like triquetrella californica entirely new to canada at least as importantly simon has given the likes of sideband snails snowberries and fairy slippers a space in the conscious minds of galiano island s human residents putting a name to something is fundamentally an act of acknowledgment the starting point for the kind of intimate relationship that can inspire us to protect the natural world judith winston a former commissioner with the singapore based international commission on zoological nomenclature the body that oversees the scientific naming of animals puts it bluntly if a species doesn t have a name it doesn t exist if it doesn t have a name it s never going to be conserved simon may know about an impressive number of things living beneath the forest canopy now but his dedication to understanding nature didn t really kick in until his early 20s growing up by the shores of lake huron in ontario he always held an interest in the wild world but as a young man he became what he describes as a disillusioned political activist type he spent his latter teens and early 20s as a volunteer with canada world youth and on organic farms bouncing around such destinations as brazil hawaii and mexico finally in 2007 he landed on the property of trevor goward in b c s dry interior near kamloops goward is a passionate gardener a self taught lichenologist and a researcher with the university of british columbia he calls himself a bit of a hermit but goward is kind and affable the sort of big picture thinker that can tie every modern day crisis back to the avarice of a capitalistic worldview one of the tasks goward assigned to simon was transcribing voice recordings that goward took while in the field parmeliopsis ambigua candelaria concolor agonimia tristicula as the euphony of latin names rolled over him simon found that the role of scribe offered an unexpected doorway into goward s worldview i met trevor and i realized that there s a lot more stories out there than just the human story simon says learning the names of mosses and lichens allowed him to focus his attention outward to the exuberant richness of the planet s diverse living things rather than dwell on his inner discontent a piqued passion for biodiversity eventually led simon to focus on environmental studies and cognitive science at quest university canada in squamish b c and his experience with goward helped him land an internship on galiano island in 2010 after a summer spent pulling weeds propagating native plants and teaching environmental education classes for the galiano conservancy association a local non profit dedicated to ecological stewardship simon set to work conducting biodiversity surveys on the island it proved to be a fascinating place for a budding naturalist hidden in the rain shadow of vancouver island and washington state s olympic mountains galiano is the driest of the gulf islands but it used to be even drier nine thousand years ago the tilt of the earth s axis placed the islands at a more southerly latitude than they are today giving them a semiarid climate the planet s shifting alignment gradually moved the archipelago northward and around 5 000 years ago the b c coast became inundated with rain since galiano island was still sheltered between mountain ranges though it retained some of the species and ecosystems of its warmer past today the island is a patchwork of rain loving evergreens like western red cedar and dry meadow trees like garry oak the island is within the unsurrendered territories of the penelakut and other coast salish nations but settlers from elsewhere began arriving in the 19th century most of the 1 400 current year round residents have made homes of scattered cabins in the woods and over the summer months the island is flush with visiting kayakers campers and hikers come nightfall eerie darkness envelops land and sea and the morning is greeted by the scent of evergreens and the chorus of thrush and warbler at first simon wanted to create a comprehensive field guide to the species found on a large property owned by the galiano conservancy by the time he had written a rambling 100 page manuscript that hadn t yet moved beyond marine algae he realized that there were probably better ways to engage the community in learning about the local biodiversity having himself been changed by the process of getting to know his non human neighbours he wanted to help the local community deepen its appreciation for the island that he had grown to love around the same time inaturalist a free app that makes it easy for even novice naturalists to identify species became available users can simply upload a photo of drooping purple flowers for example and a machine learning algorithm will spit out a name digitalis purpurea a perennial plant commonly called foxglove with a high degree of accuracy the wider inaturalist community which includes many experts confirms the identifications or fills in blanks where the algorithm fails the first main goal was just initially this obsessive goal of documenting all of the living things says simon the second goal was to engage the community in that process and to make biodiversity research more friendly and participatory one of the first steps for the biogaliano project was collecting the names of every species that had previously been documented on the island simon gathered records dating back to 1859 from explorers who had visited the island as well as findings from local naturalists he scoured natural history museum archives and drew on the knowledge of jeannine georgeson a coast salish and sahtu dene friend who had grown up on galiano and collaborates with indigenous knowledge keepers in the end simon had a list of nearly 2 800 species of animals plants and fungi known from the island and a launching point for his mission to identify every species yet to be found it s like a scavenger hunt he says naming and learning names are among the most central elements of language they are foundational steps in being able to communicate and speak specifically about the world toddlers will instinctively repeat the names of the objects that they hear being said around them in the old testament god parades the animals in front of adam to be named in a mayan creation story it is the deities who name all life bringing it out of emptiness and into being our current understanding of the breadth of life forms has roots in the age of exploration that occurred between the 15th and 17th centuries people started to make voyages around the world and bring back all kinds of stuff including plants and animals says winston of the international commission on zoological nomenclature naming is how we began to make sense of what we now call biodiversity inundated with new species in the thousands from dodos to dugongs scientists needed a standardized way of referring to species across continents and languages in the mid 18th century a swedish species classification expert or taxonomist called carl linnaeus developed and popularized binomial nomenclature which remains the official system of scientific naming a species is identified by its genus which is shared with any close relatives followed by a unique specific epithet the two combined are its species name for example human beings genus homo no close relatives currently exist specific epithet sapiens species name homo sapiens once a new species is confirmed by the scientific community its presence can be added to the grand encyclopedia of recognized life forms according to the catalogue of life an international effort to create a universal species compendium there are 2 3 million known species from microbes to the world s largest living animal the blue whale while calculations are rough scientists estimate there are another 8 7 million yet to be identified each year up to 18 000 species are named or renamed with 2021 adding the likes of the emperor dumbo octopus and the nano chameleon perhaps the world s tiniest reptile which can comfortably perch on the tip of your pinkie finger many such as eunota mecocheila an iridescent tiger beetle and scolopendra alcyona a rare amphibious centipede have only a scientific name with no known common moniker in any language awareness of these species is likely limited while new names are constantly added to the scientific vernacular an increasing number of species is also being permanently erased from the catalogue estimates vary widely but up to 55 000 species are lost each year from forces such as habitat loss climate change and pollution a rate 1 000 times higher than before humans became the dominant influence on the environment most of these vanished species are nameless a similar pattern of loss is reflected in day to day speech subjects that carry heavy cultural significance often have a more diversified lexicon the scots have an impressive vocabulary for describing bad weather such as snell for a biting cold that pierces the skin or drookit for being soaked to the bone hawaiians have around 65 words to describe fishing nets and 180 associated with sweet potatoes in the 2015 revision of the oxford junior dictionary around 50 nature words such as herring lobster and otter were dropped and replaced with words like cut and paste and broadband a microcosmic reflection of what holds relevance and what no longer does in the modern world this is exactly the tide of change that simon is trying to hold back it s october and a grey sky hints at a future storm as a biogaliano search party made up of nine expert and novice species identifiers myself included moves into the trees on the southern edge of the island with retractable magnifying glasses dangling off necks like pendants our group treads softly over the soggy forest floor pausing frequently to examine infinitesimal colonies of life previous biogaliano hunts have focused on insects fungi and plants but we are on the lookout for more overlooked branches of the evolutionary tree simon has emailed the participants a 21 page document listing every species of lichen a life form that is a symbiotic fusion of fungi and algae and bryophyte mosses and their cousins the liverworts and hornworts ever recorded on the island 263 lichens 179 bryophytes our mission is to confirm whether the species previously noted in historical records are still out there as well as to document new discoveries but nature is endlessly distracting brightly coloured jelly fungi spring from dead wood one species sometimes referred to as witch s butter grows in clusters on a fallen log like gelatinous orange brains a forestry student from ubc pops a piece in her mouth and says it just tastes like water pam janszen a naturalist who collected her first slime mould more than 25 years ago spreads a heavy duty plastic bag on the ground to protect her legs from the damp earth as she kneels to peel back the bark on a rotting log ooh she says with delight holding her breath to keep still she carefully inspects a slime mould through her camera s macro lens with the naked eye i can barely make out minute black baubles standing erect on stems like alien lollipops pulling out a knife janszen gently nicks a sample of the mould and stashes it in a metal tin for later identification simon s knowledge isn t limitless altogether he credits over 50 taxonomic experts with assisting the project each committed to discerning the fractal details of their selected branch of the evolutionary tree people that can identify species are often rarer than the species themselves says simon over the years he has organized various biodiversity missions on galiano the specialists convene for a day or a weekend to collectively identify as many species as possible they re often joined by interested enthusiasts biogaliano s facebook page now has over 800 followers around half of the local population on inaturalist the project has over 500 unique contributors some of whom are visitors to the island together these participants have marched up forested mounts waded through swamps and dived beneath the ocean surface in search of species to add to the island s biodiversity catalogue wins in the quest came early in 2016 olivia lee a bryophyte specialist and former collections manager at the beaty biodiversity museum in vancouver was hiking on galiano island and collecting unfamiliar mosses a soft green variety caught her attention and she collected a sample after flipping through her guidebook of pacific northwest mosses the specimen remained a mystery she passed along images of it to other specialists until richard zander from the missouri botanical garden determined it was triquetrella californica the species that is now among the rarest known mosses in canada i never thought i would discover something lee tells me in a video call beaming sheepishly i ve never won the lottery before it just felt really really good in 2019 jessica kirkwood a galiano local was driving through bluffs park on the southern tip of the island when she noticed a heavyset sienna colored snake coil and hiss next to her truck she posted a video of the creature on the facebook page at the time the island s only known snakes were three species of timid garter snakes and the sharp tailed snake the aggressive serpent that kirkwood saw with the girth of a muscly arm stood in stark contrast simon sent the video to herpetologists in canada who dismissed it as a garter snake later herpetologists in california identified it as a pacific gopher snake the last time one had been seen in canada was in 1957 on galiano island rediscovery of the pacific gopher snake could potentially usher in new conservation measures the snake is listed as extirpated no longer present in canada and if additional herpetologists confirm a population in bluffs park the area could be granted special federal or provincial protection by the end of 2021 biogaliano had documented over 4 000 species in its six years of operation including 1 241 arthropods 931 plants 482 fungi 264 lichens 230 mollusks 186 birds 83 fish and 42 mammals they ve documented over 1 200 species such as a rare coralroot orchid and an unusual jumping spider never before recorded on the island on top of the approximately 2 800 historically identified species they ve also confirmed the continuing presence of half the species from the historical roster some of the missing species have probably been extirpated simon says but many are rare or obscure enough that they may still be found one on simon s to find list is ostrea lurida also known as the olympia oyster an endemic species that jeannine georgeson says her family often used to eat driving through a patch of old growth forest mottled with the gargantuan stumps of even more ancient giants felled by loggers decades ago simon and a few other bioblitzers pull over to quickly peek at the mosses and lichens dan tucker an avid young bryophyte enthusiast from cortes island b c shows simon a shard of decaying wood coated in a manicured lawn of green growth despite spending hours staring at mosses by this point the distinguishing characteristics are still lost on me that looks exactly like every other moss i remark anticipating my question on how the hell he can differentiate this from other mosses tucker smiles and says after a while these things sort of start to have an essence documenting bryophytes tucker tells me is just something he feels like he has to do a compulsion donna gibbs a marine naturalist who has participated in a biogaliano marine foray tells me something similar for three decades she and her husband made a routine of diving near their home in port coquitlam just east of vancouver and recording every species that they saw from harbour seals to the nudibranchs it s a complete labour of love she says i was amazed by the things i could find in my backyard and in my neighbourhood says scott gilmore a biologist who is one of simon s go to insect experts explaining his own motivations whenever i find something and i don t know what it is i try and go and work it out it s just been a lifelong passion putting names to things can the rest of us really become more like simon and his environmental entourage goward points to psychologist howard gardner s theory of multiple intelligences which posits that people can be intelligent in eight different ways mozart for example was blessed with musical genius at the age of 14 he is said to have transcribed every note of a 15 minute long choral piece after listening to it only once einstein s logical mathematical intelligence revolutionized the way we understand the universe in gardner s book multiple intelligences new horizons he recalls presenting his theory which originally included seven intelligences to a lecture hall of academics the renowned ecologist ernst mayr was in the audience and reportedly commented but you ll never explain charles darwin with your taxonomy of intelligences gardner s next iteration of the theory included an eighth intelligence the naturalist it s a special way of recognizing patterns and seeing how they fit together says goward there are some people in the world who are simply born naturalists they see patterns rather than physical things yet all of us may share in that propensity for nature in the same way that while very few people are geniuses like mozart nearly everyone appreciates music the eighth intelligence is written into the human experience acclaimed philosopher erich fromm described the human instinct to connect with nature and other living beings as biophilia a term later popularized by naturalist e o wilson science writer carol kaesuk yoon builds on that idea in her book naming nature she argues that millennia of foraging for food and fending off predators have carved out a universal capacity to perceive the natural order a hardwired human instinct she calls the umwelt the term stems from a german word meaning the environment or the world around but biologists use it to refer to each species unique perception or experience living separate from the wild world has severed us from our intrinsic umwelts yoon writes to hone our sense of nature and our place in it we can begin by learning the names of species around us much like children do with their first words or like the taxonomists distinguishing between different species as biogaliano has shown biodiversity thrives in the most unexpected of places on an escarpment overlooking a channel alongside the road in a community park inside a rotten log naturalists like simon can serve as guides to reawaken a dormant umwelt recall that the second goal of biogaliano is to rekindle the intrinsic joy found in the wild world people really care about what they see what they experience says kevin toomer a biogaliano participant small things that i wouldn t have placed much importance in before have more importance to me now toomer says that since he s known simon he has developed an especially heightened awareness of bees and of course mosses and lichens if you learn the name of a bird a robin a varied thrush or what have you you ve learned a word and you can begin to talk about that creature and people that don t know those words can t says goward while the oxford people are trying to take words out simon is trying to put words in yet biogaliano is more than a field based immersion into nature s who s who returning wild words to our vocabularies also serves as a gateway to understanding nature s complexity evening is falling and the biogaliano team conglomerates at the galiano community hall a small shake shingled building where folding tables have been set up near electrical outlets to power the microscopes simon has ordered pizzas for everyone and the naturalists unpack samples stashed in brown paper bags and begin working at identifying the specimens janszen slips the slime mould she collected under a dissecting microscope and brings it into focus revealing spherical heads atop hair thin stems the black bobbleheads are decorated with a corona of light brown speckles their netted pattern revealing that the species is cribraria vulgaris it has been found around the world but this is the first record of it on galiano island the biogaliano list grows longer by one more name it will take weeks perhaps even months to review and identify the dozens of samples taken in the blitz preliminary results indicate that in a single day s effort the team confirmed the continuing presence of seven species historically found on the island and added 25 new species to the overall list five are new to b c four of those are also new to canada two are new to all of north america and one is even new to the americas this last species a fungus had previously only been found in russia throughout simon s adventures in species seeking he s been teased by the possibility that biogaliano will identify a life form entirely new to science if and when that happens simon or whichever of his naturalist friends makes the discovery will be in the rarefied position of distinguishing the finding with a name on lasqueti island a wild and woolly issue has divided residents read more rumours of the death of false creek are false read more on a philosophical level naming is imbued with power naming is an act of claiming and more often than not reflects the worldview of the namer rather than the named in naming an individual animal or a species we not only choose how we want to represent that animal but also how others are to represent and perceive it writes sune borkfelt an animal studies and literature scholar at aarhus university in denmark we lay the foundations of representations and perceptions to come the roly poly bug for instance brings to mind a more congenial image than the red eye medusa though neither animal is necessarily endearing the former is a type of wood louse and the latter a jellyfish according to borkfelt the names we bestow can also bring us closer to or distance us from species perhaps the most anthropocentric are names taken from influential europeans in the past anna s hummingbird steller s jay scouler s willow a more ecological worldview is reflected in names that describe the species itself in hul q umi num the language historically spoken by the indigenous people of galiano island alder is kwulala ulhp roughly meaning orange plant for the tree s tangerine inner bark oregon grape is luluts ulhp meaning yellow plant for the bush s bunches of sunny blossoms many scientific names are descriptive as well for the pacific gopher snake pituophis catenifer its epithet refers to the chain like pattern that adorns the serpent s back simon is formalizing biogaliano s findings in the scientific literature by publishing a series of papers and later this year he will start a phd program with ubc researching biodiversity data science he recognizes though that he still has heaps left to find on galiano island and that his growing list of identified species is only a starting point these names are all just like the words in a sentence simon tells me to really appreciate a place and its ecology it s about learning how those words fit together his words remind me of another discovery that came out of the october foray simon and alejandro huereca delgado a specialist in fungal parasites of lichens had collected a speckle that looked like a coarse ground pepper flake entangled in a tuft of mint green fibers under closer inspection it proved to be much more a composite of at least four different species an alga and a fungus hosting a fungus hosting yet another fungus ecology can live within language as much as landscape

paris russia s invasion of agricultural power ukraine has severely disrupted the global wheat market prompting warnings that the conflict could lead to hunger in some countries wheat is milled into flour to make a huge range of foods from bread to pasta to desserts everyone eats wheat but not everyone is capable of producing it says bruno parmentier an economist and author of the book feeding humanity only around a dozen countries produce enough wheat to be able to export it too china is the world s top producer but is also a major importer of the commodity to feed its 1 4 billion people russia the united states australia canada and ukraine are the world s top exporters egypt indonesia nigeria and turkey are among the top importers grain prices were already high before russia began its invasion of ukraine in february there were several factors behind the increases energy prices soared as economies bounced back from covid lockdowns sending costs for nitrogen based fertilisers higher the end of covid restrictions also led to major disruptions to global supply chains as demand surged for all sorts of products in addition a heatwave in canada led to a dismal harvest in the country last year wheat prices surged even higher after russian troops stormed ukraine exceeding 400 euros 418 per tonne in may on the european market double its level last summer the higher costs are dramatic for developing countries more than 30 nations depend on russia and ukraine for 30 percent of their wheat import needs according to the un food and agriculture organization the two countries considered the breadbaskets of europe accounted for 30 percent of global grain exports before the war their production has increased in recent years with russia becoming the top exporter and ukraine closing in on third place a russian naval blockade has prevented ukraine from shipping out 25 million tonnes of grain that are now stuck in farms or silos at ports while some quantities have been transported via rail and road exports are still six times smaller than by sea ukrainian farmers faced a dangerous planting season with some having to work with flak jackets and rely on specialists to remove mines and other ordnance from fields ukraine s wheat harvest is expected to fall by 40 percent this year the country s grain association says us secretary of state antony blinken has branded russia s blockade as blackmail saying it was a deliberate strategy by russian president vladimir putin to force the rest of the world to give in to him and drop sanctions on moscow in times of war big producing countries literally hold the fate of others in their hands parmentier said turkey has spearheaded efforts aimed at resuming grain deliveries across the black sea and said on june 22 that four way talks with russia ukraine and the united nations could be held in the coming weeks china is not expected to release wheat stocks while india has imposed a temporary ban on its exports after a heatwave hit harvests global wheat production is forecast to reach almost 775 million tons in 2022 2023 4 5 million lower than the previous year according to the us department of agriculture reduced production in ukraine australia and morocco will only partly be offset by increases in canada russia and the united states the department said but prices have fallen in recent weeks as harvests have started markets have priced in the ukraine conflict and concerns rise of a looming recession according to experts
cannon falls minn two months after giving birth jennifer magee noticed a change in her baby s feeding routine that scared her she was starting to drink more formula almost every hour increased appetite is normal for growing infants including magee s daughter aubrey but amid the national formula shortage magee 25 had only one container left barely enough to last three days we re flying through formula magee said as the shortage worsened in may i m afraid that pretty soon if we don t stock up we re not going to have it for her finding more wouldn t be a straightforward task magee faced the same strain many parents experienced during the past few months as they scrambled to find formula but she felt added stress because she relies on the special supplemental nutrition assistance program for women infants and children known as wic a federally funded initiative meant to help low income women buy food including baby formula her daughter was born in march long after pandemic related supply chain issues began to affect formula availability and just weeks after baby food manufacturer abbott nutrition shut down production at its michigan factory and recalled multiple formulas further disrupting supply in may fda officials projected the shortage would persist until late july for magee and other parents who live near state borders especially those in rural communities with limited and distant shopping options wic s limitations further exacerbate the shortage a resident of bay city wisconsin magee must shop at a store that is authorized by her state to accept wic benefits unlike people who receive money from the supplemental nutrition assistance program or snap another support for low income families wic recipients can t use their benefits across state lines according to the u s department of agriculture bay city is a village of about 400 on the western edge of wisconsin across the mississippi river from red wing minnesota which has a population of about 16 500 bay city has no wic approved grocery stores red wing less than 10 miles west has three wic approved stores but magee can t use her wisconsin benefits at them instead she drives nearly 50 miles to a wic approved walmart supercenter in menomonie wisconsin in search of the hypoallergenic formula her daughter needs while the formula shortage is not just affecting wic families it is magnifying disparities that low income families have faced for years said brian dittmeier senior director of public policy at the national wic association the nonprofit advocacy organization that represents wic programs typically wic recipients have a designated formula they can purchase with their benefits as part of what the program calls a food package after the abbott nutrition recall the wisconsin department of health services issued a list of substitutions for families whose designated formula was among those recalled nutramigen the formula magee used to soothe her daughter s milk sensitivity was not recalled but that hasn t made it any easier to find since the shortage led to a nationwide scramble for other brands each time magee drove to menomonie for nutramigen she was making a wild guess she might find some she didn t in may the wisconsin department of health services suggested families navigating the shortage check smaller grocery stores and drugstores and search store websites before going in person yet some smaller stores don t accept wic and what s online may not reflect what s on the shelf like most states wisconsin does not allow wic families to shop online with their benefits sometimes that s a barrier because of the cost of transportation said brittany mora the wic director for pierce county where magee lives as she reflected on the amount of travel families have taken on in search of formula especially as gas prices have soared it would take a 65 mile round trip for magee to check the four wic approved stores in her county similar challenges have emerged for women receiving wic in minnesota the state s wic director kate franken said the families that come to her program for support sometimes don t have a car though minnesota like wisconsin now offers wic recipients imported formulas to increase their options the additions don t help all families equally because they are standard milk based formulas and can t be consumed by babies with some sensitivities franken said those are babies like magee s daughter when magee realized she couldn t depend on her wic benefits to immediately access hypoallergenic formula she turned to family for help on may 23 magee s soon to be mother in law geralyn laurie turned to facebook asking for help finding formula for her granddaughter she offered to pay for cans and shipping within weeks 26 cans of hypoallergenic formula had made their way to the end of the farmland bordered gravel road leading to laurie s home in cannon falls minnesota about 30 miles west of bay city everyone i think wants to help and several people were just like i m on it she said by the time her granddaughter was 3 months old laurie had spent more than 455 on formula magee has yet to be able to use her wic benefits to feed her daughter khn kaiser health news is a national newsroom that produces in depth journalism about health issues together with policy analysis and polling khn is one of the three major operating programs at kff kaiser family foundation kff is an endowed nonprofit organization providing information on health issues to the nation

holiday falls on a saturday the market will close on the preceding friday if the holiday falls on a sunday the market will close on the subsequent monday stock and bond market hours for those wanting answers to other questions like what time does the market open regular stock market trading hours for the new york stock exchange nyse and nasdaq stock market are 9 30 am to 4 pm on weekdays bond markets usually trade between 8 am and 5 pm the stock markets close at 1 pm on early closure days bond markets close early at 2 pm all times eastern unless otherwise indicated many folks might wonder why the stock market offers such limited hours when there are certainly people who want to buy and sell at all times of the day one of the main reasons for this is liquidity which is how much buying and selling is going on at a given time the more liquidity in a particular security the likelier you are to get a fair price on it the less liquidity the more likely you might have to settle for a less than ideal price to finish off a transaction for the market to function effectively you need buyers and sellers says charles sizemore principal of sizemore capital management this is why the stock market has set hours that happen to correspond to the east coast workday you want the maximum number of traders buying and selling at the same time if you were at an estate auction selling your grandmother s antiques you d want a lot of bidders there it s the same rationale in the stock market and there is trading that is done outside of these regular hours on days with a regular session for instance there is pre market trading this occurs before the market and while hours vary they can extend as early as 4 am and run until the opening bell rings at 9 30 am there is also after hours trading which happens after the market closes and typically runs from 4 pm to 8 pm but just because you can trade outside of regular stock market trading hours doesn t necessarily mean you should investors should be aware that volume and liquidity tend to be lower in pre market and after hours trading temporary market stoppages the stock market rarely closes unexpectedly but so called circuit breakers do occasionally trigger temporary trading halts circuit breakers were first introduced after the black monday crash of october 1987 the dow dropped almost 23 in a single session which stands as a record to this day circuit breakers are intended to curb panic selling like calling a timeout in sports a temporary pause in trading allows market participants to catch their breath though it doesn t necessarily keep stocks from declining once trading resumes there are three levels of circuit breakers tied to how steeply the market declines a level 1 market wide circuit breaker is tripped if the s p 500 falls 7 from its previous close market wide circuit breaker is tripped if the s p 500 falls 7 from its previous close a level 2 circuit breaker comes into effect when the market plunges 13 circuit breaker comes into effect when the market plunges 13 a level 3 circuit breaker kicks in if the market tanks 20 a level 1 or level 2 breach halts trading for a minimum of 15 minutes a level 3 rout halts trading for the remainder of the trading day level 1 and level 2 circuit breakers can be triggered between 9 30 am and 3 25 pm a level 3 breach can be triggered at any time extraordinary stock market closures the market has also shut down a smattering of times throughout history following catastrophic events the attacks on the world trade center and pentagon prevented the market from opening on september 11 2001 and the exchanges remained shut until september 17 prior to that you have to go back to world war i for an example of the stock market shutting down the outbreak of hostilities in europe led the new york stock exchange to close up shop from july 31 to november 28 1914 the market went dark only two other times in its history the nyse closed for 10 days during the panic of 1873 and it took a week off trading to mourn the assassination of president abraham lincoln in 1865 additionally markets will typically close when a former president dies they most recently closed in december 2018 for the funeral of former president george h w bush data provided by the nyse and sifma

and wounding more than 36 in the chicago suburb of highland park the gunman climbed to the roof of a business using a ladder in an alley police said the attack turned a civic display of patriotism into a scene of mayhem hours later police announced that they had a suspect in custody after 22 year old robert e crimo iii surrendered to authorities the main street in highland park became a crime scene spanning blocks strewn with abandoned chairs and flags witnesses who later came back to retrieve strollers and other items were told they could not go beyond police tape it sounded like fireworks going off said retired doctor richard kaufman who was standing across the street from where the gunman opened fire adding that he heard about 200 shots it was pandemonium he said people were covered in blood tripping over each other the shooting comes with gun violence fresh on the minds of many americans just hours after the shooting in highland park two philadelphia police offers were shot near the benjamin franklin parkway as thousands of people celebrated a fourth of july concert and fireworks show both officers were later released from hospital in may a gunman murdered 19 school children and two teachers at an elementary school in uvalde texas just 10 days after a man shot dead 10 people at a grocery store in buffalo new york the chicago suburb attack is likely to rekindle the debate about gun control and whether stricter measures can prevent the mass shootings that happen so frequently in the united states police said they did not know what the motive was for the shooting in highland park the wounded ranged in age from 8 to 85 including four or five children nicolas toledo a man his 70s was the first victim identified as of late monday by his family my

ones the synagogue said violent images online social media and other online posts written by accounts that appeared to be associated with either crimo or his rapper alias awake the rapper often depicted violent images or messages the accounts showed a man with physical characteristics and facial tattoos similar to those in photos of the suspect released by police one music video posted to youtube under awake the rapper for example showed drawings of a stick figure holding a rifle in front of another figure spread on the ground in a different video a stick figure is shown bleeding in front of police cars reuters could not verify if the youtube account belonged to crimo although the account was terminated on monday after he was named a suspect a youtube spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment president joe biden said he and his wife jill were shocked by the senseless gun violence that has yet again brought grief to an american community on this independence day biden referred in his statement to bipartisan gun reform legislation he signed recently but said much more needed to be done and added i m not going to give up fighting the epidemic of gun violence

on monday morning a gunman opened fire on the fourth of july parade in highland park illinois a northern suburb of chicago six people have died so far and dozens are injured it is the latest in a string of horrific mass shootings that continue to rip through american society a stretcher is seen after a mass shooting at the highland park fourth of july parade in downtown highland park ill a chicago suburb monday july 4 2022 ap photo nam y huh more than two dozen have been hospitalized including one child in critical condition the age of those shot spanned between eight and 85 years old including at least five children with minor to severe injuries according to reports that have emerged the gunman opened fire from a rooftop of a business along the route of the parade heavy gunfire can be heard on videos captured on social media as a marching band was performing hundreds of parade goers fled in a mass stampede others who remained helped paramedics tie tourniquets on the victims a number of bystanders described the scene as a war zone in an emotional statement to abc 7 chicago local physician dr david baum described the deadly scene he witnessed a couple hundred feet away you saw massive amounts of bodies on the corners where the gunman just picked people off he said these bodies were decimated these were eviscerations of body parts the people who were gone they had horrific injuries the kind of injuries you only see in wartime police reported that the alleged shooter was 22 year old robert e crimo iii who fled the scene a massive manhunt by the police and federal law enforcement agencies began in the chicago suburbs and the suspect was caught and taken into police custody by the early evening more information will come to light in the coming days about the specific motivations for this latest act of homicidal violence though there are initial indications that crimo holds far right political views ten months ago he posted disturbing music videos including one that showed imagery of a man with a rifle in a video called toy soldier several reports have now emerged of crimo attending a trump rally in 2020 and appearing to cheer on a trump motorcade in 2021 highland park also has a large jewish population while it is not clear at present if crimo s motives were anti semitic in april a number of anti semitic flyers were littered around the city and other northern suburbs this event must be placed and analyzed within its broader social and political context the united states is a society plagued by unprecedented levels of social inequality police violence massive levels of exploitation of the working class endless wars the worship of the stock market and the indifference of the ruling class to the needs of the population mass violence has become part of american life when charles whitman known as the texas tower sniper shot indiscriminately at a gathering of people in 1966 it was a truly shocking event in american society such mass shootings are a near daily occurrence now according to the gun violence archive there have been over 307 mass shootings in 2022 to date in the united states on track to exceed the 611 mass shootings in 2020 a figure that is approaching two such incidents daily mass shootings have more than doubled since these events began to be tracked in 2014 there were 269 mass shootings 335 in 2015 382 in 2016 346 in 2017 336 in 2018 and 417 in 2019 before leaping to 611 in 2020 most recently the massacre in uvalde texas in may sparked widespread revulsion and anger chicago itself is a city plagued by violence president biden barely referred to the horrifying events in highland park in his remarks at the white house yesterday devoting all of 11 words that said nothing you all heard what happened you all heard what happened today instead he gave a number of paeans to the military in a pre planned speech in which he declared that the united states is a great nation i ve never been more optimistic about america than i am today an optimism that digs deep never gives up that s america biden s delusional remarks about the state of american society along with his indifference to yet another mass shooting is in line with the interests of a ruling class that is wholly consumed with preparations for endless war and the maintenance of a policy of mass infection that has led to over a million dead in the united states in the covid 19 pandemic to the ruling class life for the masses has become expendable and cheap one year after biden declared independence from the virus to discuss the horrific mass shooting that had taken place just hours before would have struck a discordant note in biden s declaration that we are a great nation i have never been more optimistic about america than i am today as with the pandemic the american ruling class s solution to social problems is to just ignore them the police in the united states kill more than a thousand people with impunity every year such as the latest horrific shooting the murder of jayland walker hit by over 60 bullets fired by police officers the richest 400 people in america control over 3 trillion in wealth while half of americans do not even have 400 in savings to cover an emergency such levels of inequality across the country and in the chicago area are completely incompatible with democracy as has been made clear with the shredding of the right to abortion by the supreme court along with a slew of other decisions that pave the way for the eradication of the democratic rights of the population biden and the democratic party have nothing to offer except the prospect of war against russia and china in large part due to the acute levels of social tensions at home in response to the persistence of high gas prices that are wrecking working class families biden told the media he will fight the us nato war in ukraine against russia as long as it takes threatening the danger of nuclear war and planetary suicide the promotion of political reaction spearheaded by every institution of government has been accompanied by the incitement of right wing violence sections of the ruling class through the republican party are preparing for dictatorship by whipping up fascistic groups right wing terrorism and racially motivated and anti semitic attacks for their part the democrats have adopted a political strategy of accommodating their fascistic republican counterparts calling them colleagues even though trump and a vast section of the state conspired to carry out a coup on january 6 the democrats have also begun to carry out an electoral strategy in which they boost far right candidates within the republican party part of the playbook used by hillary clinton and the media in 2016 that assisted donald trump the democratic governor of illinois j b pritzker recently spent millions on ads to boost the fascistic trump backed multimillionaire darren bailey helping him win the republican primary election for governor bailey spoke in the nearby suburb of skokie illinois the site of a fascist march in the 1970s where he said in response to the shootings in highland park let s move on and celebrate the independence of this nation the latest horrific mass shooting must be taken as a warning fascistic violence is dripping from every pore of capitalist society and democratic forms of government are crumbling under the weight of america s massive social inequality the fight against fascist violence and the defense of basic democratic rights require the building of a socialist movement of the working class

rainforest in the democratic republic of the congo toronto africa s unique natural capital assets were the center of conversation at the 2022 africa green economy conference held in a hybrid format from june 27 to 30 participants gathered to discuss the value of nature in africa s economy and call for more nature positive ventures in development hosted by the green growth knowledge partnership ggkp capitals coalition green economy coalition gec and world wide fund for nature wwf the conference featured virtual opening and closing plenary sessions and themed in person national conversations around the continent these sessions took place in south africa uganda gabon and mozambique participants stressed that the conference was coming at a unique moment in the face of several global economic shocks affecting africa climate change biodiversity loss and geopolitical challenges the failure of the current system s existing global cooperation mechanism to meet these challenges equitably and sustainably is leading to the current calls for the review of the global system moderator kevin urama acting chief economist and vice president for economic governance and knowledge management african development bank said most countries are falling short of the climate action needed to meet their 2015 paris agreement emission reduction targets climate finance to help developing countries meet targets is also lagging oliver greenfield convenor green economy coalition argued that the limited progress on environmental action resulted from policymakers continual emphasis on economic gains above all else we accept that development is the priority and environment is the trade off that s largely what s happened for 50 years avoidance of crisis is not the best investment model for most finance ministers we know that he said greenfield suggested policymakers consider investments that contribute to the best outcome in multiple areas environmental social and economic considering the environment alongside the economy would be very beneficial for africa stressed dr mao amis co founder and executive director of the african center for green economy he added that in most african countries natural capital accounts for 30 50 percent of their total wealth in sub saharan africa over 70 percent of people depend on forests and woodlands for their livelihoods the value of nature in the economy is undisputed we are so intricately linked to nature that we cannot disassociate our relationship with nature and the more we recognize that the more we can make strides in achieving the role of nature in the economy he said tapping into nature and pursuing nature positive investments is seen as an avenue for wealth creation by policymakers ligia noronha un assistant secretary general and head of unep new york office views nature positive investments as a great risk mitigation instrument and a key investment strategy for the continent this is absolutely obvious but it has perhaps not been invested in sufficiently africa has a tremendous amount of natural capital stocks both in minerals and biodiversity and this can be a tremendous asset for the growth of africa she said she added that natural capital could also create many green jobs for africa s population multi stakeholder engagement however is needed to center nature s place in national economic development dr gabi teren programme manager endangered wildlife trust highlighted that greater skills and communication across sectors are needed to drive action on environmental targets ultimately without the companies being involved at all levels there aren t enough experts necessarily to have the skills to apply these tools to really have a truly green economy we have to have far better communication between the private sector between between environmental practitioners and between policymakers she said the involvement of the finance sector in particular is crucial according to a presentation by the world resources institute access to financing and the limited participation of the private sector are two of the biggest challenges to implementing nature based solutions nbs in africa nature based solutions are initiatives involving nature that solve societal challenges while building up natural ecosystems and biodiversity for example conserving mangrove forests can protect

houston texas exxon mobil corp said this week that profits from skyrocketing fuel prices could result in a record 16 billion quarterly profit exxon like other oil companies has seen surges in profits as oil rose to more than 105 per barrel and gasoline is reported selling at 5 per gallon in the united states it is expected that such enormous earnings could well result in calls for windfall profit taxes exxon america s largest u s oil producer has said in filings that it anticipates an increase of some 7 4 billion in operating profits over the first quarter in 2022 in real terms exxon might see a quarterly profit of more than 16 billion the company s largest quarterly profit was recorded at 15 9 billion in 2012 high energy prices are largely a result of underinvestment by many in the energy industry over the last several years and especially during the pandemic exxon said in a statement on the expected profits at the same time analysts anticipate a per share profit of 2 99 compared to 1 10 in the same quarter in 2021 official quarterly results will be released on july 29 in may commenting on exxon s profits u s president joe biden said exxon was making more money than god after posting its biggest quarterly profit in seven years meanwhile u s representative ro khanna said this week that exxon s record breaking profits caused him to redouble efforts in congress to pass a windfall tax on the nation s oil companies big oil companies should be providing relief to their customers not pouring billions into stock buybacks to enrich their investors he said in a statement
good news for millions of california taxpayers the state is giving you a rebate thanks to a 97 billion budget surplus the largest in state history golden state lawmakers voted l week to send about 9 5 billion back to californians the rebates rightly are designed to give more to those who need it most 14 2 million tax filers who have incomes up to 75 000 single 150 000 joint those folks will get 350 per filer plus an additional 350 if they have at least one dependent so that means a couple making minimum wage with two kids would get 1 050 that s significant money especially when gas is over 6 a gallon but the legislature also appropriately is returning funds to people who earn more 2 1 million filers with incomes between 75 000 and 125 000 single 150 000 to 250 000 joint will get 250 per tax filer plus an additional 250 for a dependent s so a single working parent earning 76 000 with twins would get 500 in california 76 000 doesn t go so far especially if one is supporting a family taxpayers above that single filers making between 125 000 and 250 000 couples between 250 000 and 500 000 would get 200 per person plus 200 for any dependent s could they live without it certainly but folks in this bracket have been cut out of almost every other government rebate or credit recently and it s time they received something as well could lawmakers have done more maybe the budget is full of millions for important initiatives like homelessness not to mention pet projects around the state from palm springs plaza theatre to the csusb palm desert student center such line items can look like pork from far away but somehow when they re in your backyard the bacon smells pretty delicious some critics say by putting more money in people s pockets the move could stoke inflation at a time when the federal reserve is trying to fight it we re not worried about that at most it s going to cover 10 to 15 tanks of gas per family we do hope california can efficiently administer the rebates expected in october and prevent fraud if only we had the estimated 20 billion that state officials say was scammed from our employment development department during the covid 19 pandemic we could give everyone three times what they re slated to get by halloween politicians on the right have tried to make hay over the legislature s decision not to halt the scheduled 3 cent increase in the gas tax that went into effect on friday but do the math and you ll find out that s more about political points than actually helping california drivers the 3 cent per gallon increase would cost a motorist 200 once he or she had purchased 6 666 gallons the average american uses somewhere around 600 gallons per year so the rebates will help people much more quickly and the slight increase in the gas tax will help cover what are indubitably going to be more expensive road projects in the years ahead as inflation continues california s gravy train is unlikely to last long a good bit of this year s budget surplus was driven by outsized gains taxpayers reaped in 2021 as the stock market surged now that that s cooling off the state s fiscal picture could shift quickly for the worse so go ahead and spend your rebate if you need to or save it for a rainy day you just might need it to cover a tax increase not so far down the road this article originally appeared on palm springs desert sun california lawmakers did right by taxpayers by giving rebates

many americans have wrestled with this dilemma at some point during the pandemic yet it still seems to come up again and again when can you stop isolating after a covid 19 infection the question is especially vexing if you re feeling better but still testing positive on a rapid test even with the arrival of new subvariants the basic ground rules haven t changed since omicron first came onto the scene the centers for disease control and prevention says someone can stop isolating after five days if they re fever free for 24 hours and are starting to get better as long as they keep wearing a mask around others for another five days some researchers have criticized these rules pointing to research that shows some people may remain infectious after day five and many experts advise waiting until you test negative on an at home test before venturing out but if you feel fine it can be frustrating to wait especially if you re in the subset of those who test positive past 10 days james hay who studies infectious disease dynamics remembers earlier this year when his sister continued testing positive for two weeks their family had plans to get together over the holiday a gathering that included an older relative who was vulnerable to covid to us that was just not worth the risk says hay who s a research fellow at the harvard t h chan school of public health going to the shops with a mask on that s a different kind of risk consideration testing to get out of isolation is tempting because it promises a straightforward answer unfortunately and perhaps unsurprisingly the science is not entirely settled we don t have anything that says definitely you are contagious or definitely you re not says dr emily landon an infectious disease specialist at uchicago medicine the best thing we have are these rapid antigen tests unlike pcr tests which search for genetic material from the virus rapid antigen tests work by looking for the proteins that are packed inside the virus a positive test generally correlates with the presence of infectious virus scientists can determine that by taking samples from someone who s been infected and trying to grow the virus in a lab what s known as a viral culture generally most people who get infected are not still testing positive on an antigen test 10 days after symptom onset if you have enough virus in your system to be turning one of these tests positive that means your body probably hasn t yet fully cleared the infection says hay but there is no perfect study that shows how likely it is that a positive test on a rapid test translates into shedding enough virus that you could actually infect another person says dr geoffrey baird chair of the department of laboratory medicine and pathology at the university of washington school of medicine the answer to that is clear as mud he says indeed infectious disease experts tend to differ about how much stock to put in a rapid test result when someone knows they re infected and deciding whether it s safe to rejoin the outside world after all baird points out that these tests were never designed to function as get out of isolation cards relying on the result to tell whether you re truly still infectious is dicey he says there s actually a lot more discrepancy than anyone would be happy with he says a positive antigen test could essentially be picking up leftover viral garbage which can include dead viruses mangled viruses viruses that are 90 packed together but not really going to work says baird and the amount can vary depending on each person s immune system the variants the stage of the infection and so on this is partly why baird did not bother to take a rapid test when he had covid recently and had to decide when it was ok to return to work after a week when he was feeling better he came back to the office where everyone s required to wear an n95 mask even if it is an imperfect tool not everyone is down on using a rapid antigen test landon says it s extra information that can give you a sense of how to proceed especially if people are banking on the cdc guidance to determine whether to end isolation that s because some people will still be infectious after five days she says in fact a studyco authored by landon followed health care workers at the university of chicago who had been infected but were feeling mostly better and went to get tested after five days they found that more than half of them still tested positive on antigen tests after six days this tracks with other research for example one studyanalyzing data from a testing site in san francisco during the january omicron surge suggests that many people were still testing positive after five days and research done by the cdc shows about half of people were still testing positive on the antigen test between five and nine days after symptom onset or diagnosis you d be erring on the side of caution if you followed the test and said i m not going to leave my isolation until after my test is negative she says preliminary datafrom scientists at harvard and mit shows that about 25 of symptomatic people with covid 19 had virus that could be cultured after eight days after symptom onset or their first test but hay cautions there is considerable variation in the studies because of small sample sizes differing populations how the rapid tests are done the vaccination status of who s being tested and how healthy they are among other factors that explains a lot of the variation across studies but i think it s still pretty consistent as an overall finding that if you re antigen positive then you re quite likely to be infectious he says some research has aligned more closely with the cdc isolation guidance which assumes most people will no longer be infectious after five days a preprint study of close to 100 vaccinated college students at boston university suggests that a majority were no longer infectious after five days only about 17 of those who we looked at still had what looks like viable covid out past five days says dr karen jacobson an infectious disease specialist at the boston university school of medicine and one of the study s authors a very small number did have virus that could be cultured eight days after symptom onset her study found that a negative rapid antigen test on day five is a perfect indicator of whether the virus could be cultured in a lab in other words anyone who had a negative test on day five or later after their initial diagnosis had no more detectable virus the flip side was that if you had a positive rapid about half of the people still had culturable virus and half did not says jacobsen the way that we ve started to frame it and i think many others have is that if you re positive you particularly need to take this very seriously at the end the day if you re still testing positive but you feel fine and are symptom free the decision to go out in the world comes down to context if you re going to spend time with people who are high risk think twice says landon if you are thinking about going to the nursing home to visit your grandmother this is not the time to do it she says but if there s something essential you need to do don t feel trapped in your house go do it but keep your mask on she adds copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
