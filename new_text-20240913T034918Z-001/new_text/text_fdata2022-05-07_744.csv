southfield mich wxyz michigan is leading the nation when it comes to skyrocketing gas prices aaa reports that we saw an approximately 30 cent increase in the last week it is the largest increase in the nation fuel providers tell 7 action news part of the increase is due to the fact that this month metro detroit gas stations need to switch over to more expensive summer fuel the change over results in an increase in costs the michigan petroleum association says for gas stations the average cost is about 4 40 a gallon for regular unleaded they are selling at some stations at a loss this could mean that as gas stations average out their costs and set prices your price could increase in the coming days if trends continue i love my car so much but it is like do i love it enough to keep paying these prices said andrew thomas a driver from detroit many drivers are considering cutting back if they haven t already while the higher gas prices are bad for drivers and local gas stations there are winners the oil companies are making record profits right now because they can said janell townsend ph d oakland university school of business marketing chair this week shell announced a record 9 1 billion in quarterly earnings an increase from 6 4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 bp s first quarter earnings are 6 2 billion up from the 4 1 billion the previous quarter drivers want to know why oil companies can t charge less if they are making so much money i think they should feel some of the pain put themselves in our shoes for once said thomas well there is a supply and demand factor said professor townsend townsend says we are at a time of year when people drive more the energy information administration says here in the u s gasoline stocks decreased by 2 2 million barrels while demand increased by 8 74 million the price of oil is a global price they do not set the price said zeina alsalman ph d an oakland university economics professor professor alsalman says u s oil companies have doubled production since 2008 and now are benefiting she also says speculators are expecting prices to go up and as a result agents are right now buying above ground inventories for later impacting prices now whenever we say there is a shortfall in oil production it is not the main reason for the increase in oil price it is the precautions against a shortfall so when they start buying more as a precaution against a shortfall in oil production that is what increases the price of oil along with more global demand said professor alsalman those precautions may be happening in response to the european union s proposal to ban russian oil imports within six months
the past few days on wall street have been unsettling if not downright ugly after a surge on wednesday the dow shed more than 1 000 points thursday in its worst day since early in the pandemic and the tech heavy nasdaq index lost 5 percent the losses continued friday it s hard to watch such rapid nosediving even for people who subscribe to the long standing investment advice to buy and hold wall street is in a clear correction mode there s unease about just how much the economy and corporate profits will slow this year as the federal reserve battles inflation russia s war in ukraine causes widespread pain and consumers get more cautious as prices rise but this is not a time to panic the u s economy is showing a lot of resilience job openings hit a record high in march and 428 000 jobs were added in april with gains in nearly every industry the unemployment rate is basically back at precrisis lows black workers and workers with a high school diploma but no college are seeing encouraging improvement as well overall this has been the fastest job market rebound in decades families and businesses continue to spend helping propel more growth and jobs the reality is that the stock market and many parts of the economy were overheated at the start of this year and needed to cool down home prices have skyrocketed more than 30 percent since the start of the pandemic housing demand far exceeds housing supply especially for affordable homes as the fed has hiked interest rates mortgage rates have jumped to their highest levels since 2018 which is starting to cause some people to think twice about buying it s a similar story for stocks which rose rapidly in the past decade of ultralow fed interest rates the massive market gains have fueled inequality as the rich have made eye popping profits while about half of americans own at least some stocks mainly in retirement funds the bulk of the market gains go to the top 10 percent who own almost 90 percent of u s stocks giving back a little of those market gains isn t terrible it helps curb excess speculation in the market as the fed reverses course and while the mega wealthy are losing billions many middle class and lower income americans are gaining jobs and higher than normal pay raises advertisement the market pullback right now is consistent with a reassessment the investment equivalent of a time out while the dow is down just over 9 percent this year and the widely watched s p 500 index is off about 13 percent this isn t yet a bear market when the key indexes fall 20 percent from their recent highs even with the recent pullback the dow is still up more than 55 percent in the past five years follow this author editorial board s opinions follow

from the start of the ukrainian crisis in february the russian ruble plummeted ensuring its worst decline over the year to date trading period of any currency its rapid price drop sent traders rushing to buy high options instruments for a weaker ruble against the u s dollar with risk reversals almost double that of the turkish lira known for its volatility the ruble plummeted to 139 to the u s dollar in early march compared to its already weak levels of 80 in february however it has recovered dramatically to its preinvasion levels and is currently trading at about 78 after the country took measures like strict capital controls high volatility levels present forex trading opportunities at very high risk since the ruble has been in decline since the start of the 21st century moreover the ongoing war and sanctions are not likely to assist its recovery neither is the volatility of oil and gas prices ruble rescue russia s more robust financial position includes a sharp rise in oil and gas exports and a massive drop in imports bloomberg economics expectations maintain that russia s earnings from its energy exports could reach 321 billion in 2022 a third more than last year especially if the european union continues buying in addition foreign currencies continue to flow into the country thanks to the increase in oil prices and its trade with china and india two big economies that maintain trading relations with russia the rest of the rebound say some experts results from the government propping it up with measures besides the capital controls other measures include an increase in key interest rates to 20 and a demand for payments in rubles for energy from unfriendly countries however putin quickly changed his position and allowed foreign buyers to pay in euros or dollars through special accounts at gazprombank that convert 80 of the payments to russian sellers into rubles russian companies are helping to prop up the currency with this measure in an interview with dw oanda market analyst craig erlam says the currency moves don t represent russia you see the fundamentals reflected in the currency he added that the currency might suggest differently but its economy does not have the same outlook as before the invasion furthermore the imf forecast of 2 8 growth for 2022 in january has changed new indications say that it will shrink to anything over 8 ruble trading a government proclamation also prevents russian brokers from selling foreign owned securities when many foreign investors want to opt out the ban on trading allows the government to protect the stock and bond markets while keeping money in the country and propping up the ruble s price u s secretary of state antony blinken told nbc earlier this month that the currency s resurgence is due to the manipulation he maintains that the artificial propping up of the money s value by preventing people from selling rubles is not a sustainable move instead it almost certainly means a long term impact on their economy particularly as more businesses move out of russia in the meantime trading volumes for the ruble have plummeted meaning that far fewer transactions determine the market price moreover the current improvement in the ruble s worth does not increase confidence in the long run mainly because countries in the west are determined to find other energy sources russia may be the largest exporter of natural gas but other suppliers like the u s are ready to fill the gap especially in the vast european market other significant suppliers include the u k norway qatar and azerbaijan currently greece has also intensified its efforts to extract its gas resources and israel wants to build a europe pipeline the central bank of russia s head elvira nabiullina has used several methods to prop up the currency still very few buyers from outside and within russia want rubles at this point government interventions don t come without risks and the only way the currency can withhold its current value is by lifting the sanctions russia would have to agree to resolve the ukraine conflict for this to happen and it is currently not taking a step back final take the countries that buy large amounts of russian gas can t all wean themselves off it overnight but if russia insists on making this move it risks turning one of its most significant revenue streams into a dribble russian borrowers can also not afford to continue paying the 20 interest rate forever in conclusion the appearance of a stronger ruble from these measures means the chances of its collapse are far greater than the risk anyone would want to take in investing in it related images courtesy of depositphotos

battered u s stocks may not be bargains as investors brace for inflation data file photo a wall street sign is pictured outside the new york stock exchange in new york reuters by lewis krauskopf new york reuters u s stocks tumble this year is putting an increased focus on equity valuations as investors assess whether recently discounted shares are worth buying in the face of a hawkish federal reserve and widespread geopolitical uncertainty with the benchmark s p 500 index down 13 5 year to date valuations stand at their lowest levels in two years putting the index s forward price to earnings ratio at 17 9 times from 21 7 at the end of 2021 according to the latest data from refinitiv datastream advertisement advertisement although many investors tended to brush off elevated valuations during the market s dynamic surge from its post covid 19 lows they have been quick to punish companies viewed as overvalued this year as the fed rolls back easy money policies that had kept bond yields low and buoyed equities while recently discounted valuations may boost stocks appeal to some bargain hunters other investors believe equities may not be cheap enough as the fed signals it is ready to aggressively tighten monetary policy to fight inflation bond yields surge and geopolitical risks such as the war in ukraine continue roiling markets stocks are getting close to fair valuation but they re not quite there yet said j bryant evans portfolio manager at cozad asset management in champaign illinois if you take into account bond yields inflation what is going on with gdp and the broader economy they re not quite there yet wild swings shook markets in the past week after the fed delivered a widely expected 50 basis point rate increase and signaled similar moves for the meetings ahead as it tries to quell the highest annual inflation rates in 40 years the index has declined for five straight weeks its longest losing streak since mid 2011 more volatility could be in store if next week s monthly consumer price index reading exceeds expectations potentially bolstering the case for even more aggressive monetary policy tightening from the fed there has been a healthy reset in valuations and sentiment wrote keith lerner co chief investment officer at truist advisory services in a recent note to clients for stocks to move higher on a sustainable basis investors will likely need to have greater confidence in the fed s ability to tame inflation without unduly hurting the economy though valuations have come down s p 500 s forward p e stands above its long term average of 15 5 times earnings estimates graphic u s stock market valuations story continues potentially burnishing stocks appeal s p 500 companies are expected to increase earnings by about 9 this year according to refinitiv data as they wrap up a better than expected first quarter reporting season one likely factor is whether treasuries extend a sell off that has lifted the benchmark 10 year note yield which moves inversely to prices to its highest since late 2018 higher yields in particular dull the allure of technology and other high growth sectors as their cash flows are often more weighted in the future and diminished when discounted at higher rates the forward p e for the s p 500 technology sector has declined from 28 5 times to 21 4 so far this year according to refinitiv datastream data as of friday morning advertisement advertisement in terms of growth valuations they have been hit the hardest and likely the most oversold said art hogan chief market strategist at national securities but the sector continues to trade at a nearly 20 premium to the overall s p 500 above the 15 premium it has averaged over the broader index over the past five years if the 10 year yield hovers between 3 to 3 5 after being a fraction of that level for a long period that is going to continue to be a weight on the p e and therefore the discounting mechanism for the growth and technology space said john lynch chief investment officer for comerica wealth management which favors value over growth shares to a large extent the pressure from higher yields has been baked in lynch said but i don t think it is going to go away i think it is going to persist reporting by lewis krauskopf editing by ira iosebashvili and richard chang
commentary the federal open market committee has just commenced its latest meeting to set monetary policy everyone their dog and even the fleas on those dogs expect the central bank to notably ratchet up their inflation fighting efforts come may 4 around 2 00 p m et specifically this will come in the form of 1 a 50 basis point half a percent increase in benchmark short term interest rates and 2 more color on just how quickly the federal reserve will begin selling assets from its uber bloated balance sheet on that latter expectations are that the central bank will be net sellers of nearly 100 billion month between mortgage securities and treasury paper all else being equal this will be designed to further crimp lending which at least for home mortgages finally has slowed abruptly even if housing prices themselves in most places remain high and take some of the inflationary steam out of the system of course we would never be in this predicament in the first place had the fed led by the arthur burns of our time jerome powell not as a first matter gone so nutso with money printing over the last couple of years burns made consumer and producer price increases back in the 1970s worse than they would have otherwise been by printing too much money and keeping rates too low ostensibly to help cushion the economy first off from the arab oil embargo and its effects the oil wasn t coming anyway no matter what burns did so all he succeeded in doing was driving its price up even further with his cheap money policy and prices for everything else as well obviously powell did not learn from this history nor did anyone around him and or his legions of apologists cargo plane jay went far beyond the past money printing antics of helicopter ben bernanke burns that mad monetary scientist alan greenspan who never met an unregulated derivative he didn t like and the rest indeed in scarcely more than two years the powell led fed created some 30 percent of the total dollars ever brought into existence powell s justification was to cushion us from the self imposed deep but short recession in the wake of the wuhan virus caused lockdowns and such but like burns he made all this far worse by raising the prices of most everything by flooding the system with too many dollars so not without some justification markets and pundits alike and the average american consumer reeling under the consequences of powell s disastrous policy now look to the arsonist and wonder how eager a fireman he s now going to be some of the more simplistic analyses are comparing him to another former fed chairman paul volcker who belatedly was brought into the picture to put out burns s inflationary inferno of the 1970s back then at least volcker started with a clean slate it remains to be seen whether powell has either the ability or the will or will be allowed by circumstances to clean up his own mess one of the issues today that confuses this whole flation thing let alone the mix of said factors we are in store for in the months and years ahead is the fact that the average pundit or economist does not understand the genesis of inflation in the first place this is one reason of course that a president joe biden can even try and sell his malarkey to the public that all this inflation raging out there is the fault of russian president vladimir putin he for one will never acknowledge that the primary cause of rising prices for everything is the arsonist he just gave a second fed term to jerome powell is expected to raise rates at the upcoming federal reserve meeting in may 2022 as i have previously explained here the mess powell has made for all of us is courtesy of his overextending even more the asset inflation regimen created by volcker in that previous fed chairman s second act much more so powell s wildly inflationary policy of the last couple years especially has already given us hyperinflation in asset valuations of all manner the question now is whether when in trying to undo some of this disaster powell pushes us back to the other extreme and inflated asset classes deflate sharply i will predict to you that long before the still liquid u s economy grinds down into a recession because of modestly tighter monetary conditions the fed s rate hikes rising market interest rates and now a near 20 year high in the u s dollar will cause a deflationary implosion in the markets while all the moving parts and pieces may not be quite the same the pattern of such a thing will be the same as back in 2008 a rapid gut punch reversal into some deflation in markets that will in turn drag down the economy into a worse recession than we are already in store for but this time around unlike 2008 we have a number of now systemic factors baked into the cake that will not uniformly lead to lower prices even if demand gets hit somewhat in a new global recession ominously the new global currency and commodity wars now unfolding made worse by the russia ukraine war and the generally counterproductive sanctions regimen enacted by the west read war mongering united states led nato will be making this worse and because of abysmal u s policy decisions the cost to our nation especially of all manner of materials needed for the coming green economy will stay in the stratosphere for some time to come together with conventional energy so while i never would have said this even a year ago brace yourselves for a considerably worse stagflation than what we all endured a generation ago don t be surprised when stocks lose another 20 30 percent or so the economy is more firmly in recession but the cost of living is still rising much nearer to 10 percent than powell s obliterated target of 2 percent views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the epoch times
the united states are in a tricky position right now and everybody knows it the level of social division continues to rise and all of us in some way or another feel a tension that we all know isn t going to be released merely by voting harder simply put there are overwhelmingly powerful civil disjunctions that the normal methods of politicking simply will not resolve a good model for understanding what is happening right now is to look back in time to the classical greek and hellenistic eras at one point or another just about every polis had to deal
photo credit bigpixel photo shutterstock the health of the manufacturing sector in the u s has been a major focus of public attention in recent years with populist political figures like donald trump on the right and bernie sanders on the left offering critiques of u s trade policy and debating how best to assist american manufacturers and workers policymakers and economic leaders of all stripes have put new focus on support for manufacturing from former president trump s focus on trade policy and president biden s 1 2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill to companies reshoring plants and consumers expressing preferences for american made goods combatting the apparent decline of u s manufacturing has become a shared commitment manufacturing is important to the u s economy for several reasons manufacturing jobs have historically been a pathway to the middle class offering good pay without requiring high levels of education companies that rely on manufacturing invest heavily in research and development which helps drive innovation domestic manufacturing also contributes to more secure and resilient supply chains a point that has become clear during the covid 19 pandemic but in recent decades the role of manufacturing in the u s economy has been diminished many companies began moving factories abroad in search of lower costs and better profit margins trade deals like nafta reduced the cost of foreign imports giving u s producers more competitors technological advances made manufacturing processes more efficient which reduced the need for many manufacturing jobs the effects of these shifts in manufacturing are most apparent in employment which has decreased over the years as a share of overall employment and in total numbers after manufacturing peaked near 40 of u s jobs at the height of world war ii the sector has seen a steady decline over time to around 8 4 of employment today in total employment manufacturing jobs peaked at 19 5 million in the late 1970s and fell off sharply after 2000 to just 12 6 million today but despite the decrease in manufacturing employment over the past several decades manufacturing output as a share of real gdp has stayed relatively stable since 1997 manufacturing has fluctuated between 11 5 and 13 2 of gdp after adjusting for inflation while manufacturing output as a share of nominal gdp has declined over that span from 16 2 to 10 9 the change in the nominal figures reflects both growth in other sectors as well as slower price increases for manufactured goods more so than a decline in manufacturing productivity but one important piece of the conversation around manufacturing in the u s is where manufacturing is thriving many northern states that were major u s manufacturing centers historically including new york and pennsylvania have seen lower rates of growth in employment and output from manufacturing in recent years instead many of the states with the highest recent growth in manufacturing both for employment and gdp are found in the southern and western u s nevada has seen nearly 50 growth in both manufacturing employment and gdp from 2010 to 2020 while california has had a 45 6 increase in gdp and florida saw a manufacturing gdp increase of 35 5 at the metro level many of the top locations for manufacturing currently are also found in these states though a few rust belt metros have also enjoyed a resurgence in manufacturing the data used in this analysis is from the u s bureau of economic analysis to determine the locations where manufacturing is thriving researchers at construction coverage calculated a composite score based on the following factors and weights manufacturing employment growth from 2010 to 2020 2x manufacturing gdp growth from 2010 to 2020 2x manufacturing share of total employment in 2020 1x manufacturing share of total gdp in 2020 1x in the event of a tie the location with the greater manufacturing employment growth from 2010 to 2020 was ranked higher to improve relevance only metropolitan areas with at least 100 000 residents were included additionally metros were grouped into cohorts based on population size here are the u

work ethic you find on wall street if you go to the outside world and you start working with people people just are not motivated in the same way it is just a pain in the ass to get anything done in the real world people leave work at five six p m people take one hour lunch breaks and people do this and that and whatever believe me it makes a big deal because if you are working with people who all work real hard to do whatever it takes to get things done it just makes things so much easier and doing things is what makes people feel good about their life and makes them feel important this is the whole self worth thing to complete and do things he talks a little about how he thinks workers in big corporations and the academy just aren t as motivated they lack ambition or i think in the old days back in the fifties or sixties people kind of just had a set pattern of life they went to work climbed the ladder slowly and did whatever they were told i think now that people are so seduced by the capabilities that you can jump ahead and how much difference you can make how important you can feel or whatever it is that gets you off he s referring to the organization man approach to work made possible at least for white men by the middle class security of the post war period who needs manic ambition when you re not terrified of falling from your class position but then he finishes with it feels like now you can get a lot done be really productive and it is seductive and that is why people who have more than enough money more than enough respect still are involved in this at the expense of their families because they need to feel needed and there is nothing better than to complete thing on a regular basis there s something great about this dude with so much confidence in his approach to life that he doesn t have to dress up what he gives him self worth completing and doing things and his addiction to it productivity is what gets him off everyone else just doesn t understand the thrill of completing things on a regular basis i thought about this passage this week while working on the chapter in the new book on the history office tech that promised to make workers lives easier but usually just created the compulsion to do more work much like the digital technologies of today these technologies from 24 hour computer lieutenants in a ge dishwashing factory to word processors were sold to workers as a means of making their work simpler more predictable safer gone were the days of desperate struggle to type out a memo without typos at 5 pm or remembering that the fourth steam gauge always read just a little off automated tech was going to be a worker s best new colleague automation was also positioned as a sort of cure all for america s industrial slump a way to close the gap between their global competitors particularly japan and germany it promised to decrease inefficiencies and increase productivity and productivity as robert macneil put it in his intro to an episode of pbs newshour in 1980 was the in word of the year everyone who thinks he knows what s wrong with this country wants to improve productivity leaders were confused however when employees began to push back who wouldn t want their work to be easier the problem as documented in books like shoshana zuboff s the age of the smart machine harley shaiken s work transformed and joel makower s office hazards was the tech was often just as annoying often made them feel like shit and it made people hate their jobs technology robbed workers of what had been highly valued physical knowledge about a job the precise way to jimmy a stuck gear the sound a machine makes when something s about to break that knowledge accumulated over years on the job had served as leverage over management if the company refused to come to an agreement with their union it would take the company weeks if not years to find workers with the skills to replace them the threat of a strike had real power because workers knowledge was precious sensors and computers took the craft behind that work quantified it and automated it a process often referred to as de skilling the worker s knowledge was made obsolete at the same time managers were newly vested with quantitative authority over their employees work lives they held the data and the ability to wield it in accordance with their desires which meant they also held the power in this way technological innovation wrested the most valuable elements of workers lives away from them and handed it straight to management no wonder workers resented it a skilled machinist talking to shaiken in 1985 said the experience of operating a computerized machine tool made him feel like a rat in a cage another worker tasked with operating a robotic welding system said you don t have time to light a cigarette i d take my old job hand welding any day an employee forced to monitor a numerical control nc system said i m a worker not a sitter i like to be kept busy my day goes by faster my mind is more active you get a little weak minded on the nc office workers also resented the new technologies sure it was great not to have to type the same letter in triplicate but many of the machines were situated in spaces that simply weren t designed for them xerox machines in rooms without ventilation word processors in spaces without proper lighting thousands of workers reported migraines severe eye strain cataracts bronchitis and allergies back cover of work hazards leaders often attributed worker reticence to initial fear of losing their jobs there would be a breaking in period they d get to know the technology and see how great it is and everyone would gradually embrace the new normal they brandished stats showing that automation didn t lead to layoffs they just led to higher productivity america could be competitive again why should anyone be scared workers might have been initially scared that they would be made obsolete but the animating anxiety concerned the experience of the work itself and how effectively the gospel of productivity blinded leaders to all other concerns in the 1980 pbs newshour interview referenced above journalist lewis silverman asks a lawyer who s implemented automating technologies in his firm if he ever worries about how it s de personalized the work i don t think that s in any way a factor in this type of automation the lawyer replied i think what we will see is that as the ability to produce documents more quickly increases and frees us to do other things we will find that rather than doing as many documents in half the time and then have half the time to do nothing we will be producing twice as many documents as we did in the past and working on twice as many transactions productivity in other words doesn t make the clerk s job easier it doesn t give them more time to rest it just sets new standards for the sheer amount of work they should be accomplishing in a given day for a counter argument newshour turned to karen nussbaum the head of working women a national organization of office workers working women had previously been known as 9 to 5 and nussbaum worked with jane fonda to help craft the narrative for the film 9 to 5 she emphasized that automation made workers feel like they had less control over their work that their jobs were even more routinized that they feel more disconnected from their colleagues and that the technology physically affected their health part of the problem were the machine themselves but an even bigger issue was the productivity they required when you re operating at peak efficiency there s no space for any of the human parts of the job what s more automation was normalizing doing more work for less pay but again leadership didn t see it that way jack walsh then director of telecommunications and office services at avon said that some secretaries had felt empowered by the new tech and even gained additional skills they conducted a study that found that 10 percent of a manager s work could be delegated to a secretary and that the secretary s role was thus enhanced nussbaum s reply was cutting technology can enhance the work but that s not what s happening for the large majority of office workers she said i d be interested to know whether mr walsh increased the pay of any of those secretaries who are now doing the work of some of those managers ad for herman miller c 1984 susan wood getty images this is the dystopian reality of productivity culture its mandate is never you figured out how to do my tasks more efficiently so you get to spend less time working it is always you figured out how to do your tasks more efficiency so you must now do more tasks sometimes if you re a wall street investment banker you can complete infinitely more tasks until you have so much money that you don t even need it anymore you re productive for the thrill of it but also because you don t know how else to gauge your own self worth but the people who help that banker in his quest whether his explicit support staff assistants or his implicit one office cleaners house cleaners food delivery people often have a very different relationship to productivity it s not pleasurable or addictive it s just denying the most human parts of yourself in order to survive the economic moment at this point we ve embraced so many new technologies with so many accompanying mandates to increase our work load but with so little attention to why and to what end to contribute to a stock price that benefits a select few to check the boxes on our to do list to spend so much time at our computers that our bodies physically ache we re assisted by technologies but we are still ultimately humans the self worth derived from simply getting things done is insufficient at some point the brain and body says no nowhere is it more apparent than in the endless wednesday of the eleventh month of attempting to work from home against the backdrop of a horrific pandemic every day we wake up and complete our tasks and grasp at peak productivity and fail and go to bed and wake up and grasp all over again the exhaustion of continual failure compounds the exhaustion of the work itself we ve reached the point of diminishing returns i think we know this you can see it explicitly manifest in anti hustle culture in the renewed embrace of unions and the labor movement in the popularity of books like how to do nothing and movements like the nap ministry some people have known it for a long time some are just gradually coming to terms with it a lot of it i ve found depends on just how inculcated you were by productivity culture were you surrounded with examples of productivity as success or were the productive people in your life the most exhausted and pissed off maybe a disability meant that productivity was never an option and you had to learn to live in a society that venerates it above all else maybe you always rejected it maybe you re from a country that doesn t worship growth at all costs many people i know embraced it in some capacity because it kinda worked it got you partway to the places you wanted to go until it didn t you started to get diminishing returns the sort that no number of fancy planners or five minute meditations or ruthless neglect of other parts of your life could correct this is when people burn out quit adopt entirely new attitudes towards what kind of work they want to fill their days with and or get radicalized i feel like we re welcoming more and more millennials even even gen zers to this club everyday gen x knew better i wish we millennials would ve learned more from them but will you please let us hang out with you now the vast majority of people are not paid enough for the productivity that is demanded of them more money can be stabilizing and quiet the financial stress that interferes with productivity but it doesn t solve the fundamental problem human productivity has a ceiling technology attempts to modify that reality but it can only do so much the body and the mind begins to falter capitalism does not care for that reality or for the human wreckage it leaves behind leaders will seek out workers who can meet the new production quotas that technology suggests they can achieve and dispose of them when they can no longer do so and do not fool yourself this is as true for factory and physical labor as it is for the office and knowledge work i m not scared that a robot is going to be able to write a blog post or write my next book i m scared that i ll be expected to write five books in the time i would ve previously been expected to write one and for the same amount of pay when nussbaum founded 9 to 5 and later working women the hope was to harness the anxiety resistance and alienation amidst the shift to automation and transform it into labor protections for the office workers who d long resisted unionization the energy and organization was there but working women s efforts ran headlong into the nationwide union busting efforts fear of american decline fetishization of the free market and the early intersection of neoliberalism and postfeminism which suggested that the cause and solution to any problem was personal problem at work yours to fix and when it comes to the office the easiest most accessible solution will always be work more but that s the attitude that led us here knowledge workers have embraced our own deskilling and the subsequent de valuing of our labor and rebranded it as personal productivity we have downloaded so many fucking apps bought so many planners read so many life hacks all in service of our continued debasement but there s still time to push back you can try and maybe even succeed to do it yourself but the individual even those with the most white male social capital in the workplace can only fend off those standards for so long we have to

that dramatic changes stem from the fact that since arizona legalized marijuana local promoters have been pushing the boundaries of melding the experiences of concertgoers and consumers enter cannaval a high flying adventure where loud music cannabis carnival acts and professional wrestling all collide and because this was a novice experience for concertgoers and consumers alike many who assembled by the wrestling ring grew worrisome as parts of the wrestlers demeanors shifted during the interviews even watson was taken back his voice dropped a few decibels as somebody who lived in arizona for six years i never thought i would see people walking around outside smoking marijuana grand slam watson and fresco mattic who requested to go by their pro wrestling monikers or else are the reigning arizona wrestling federation tag team champions that s mattic s signature move where he grabbed fabrizio from the rear hooked his arms underneath fabrizio s arms in a full nelson picked him up and slammed him to the mat then the arizona champions double teamed cañedo in the squared circle tossing him into the middle of the ring setting him up for phillips philips climbed onto the top turnbuckle leaped backward into the west phoenix airspace did a backflip and landed on top of cañedo to pin him the ref counted 1 2 3 and phillips and the arizona champs raised their arms in victory we pretty

the wrestling ring at the west phoenix venue he s also the wrestling promoter who booked the wrestlers and luchadores world wrestling entertainment inc which is shortened to wwe is the largest professional wrestling promotion company in the world the wwe website proclaims that any competitor who tests positive for marijuana shall be fined 2 500 per positive result but according to various wrestling fan websites the pro wrestling company is pretty lax about the rule many pro wrestlers from the 1980s through the 2000s are finally speaking openly about their marijuana use including norris bones jarmon a san diego based pro wrestling trainer who trucked in and assembled the wrestling ring at the west phoenix venue he s also the wrestling promoter who booked the wrestlers and i think it s actually changing nowadays watson said the reason why wrestlers weren t admitting to smoking weed for a while i think it s because in wwe the main stage it was against the rules click to enlarge erika mckendree was at one of the 94 vendor booths at the event she repped the genesis bioceuticals company mike madriaga pro wrestler grand slam watson was on a good trip at the recent cannaval music festival and cannabis expo at the phoenix events entertainment complex not because the phoenix raised 5 foot 11 205 pound arizona wrestling federation awf tag team champion just smoked a fat blunt but because reality had just kicked in i ve never seen anything like this where people are out here smoking weed and wrestling he yelled into themicrophone before sunset on april 30 the duo teamed up with xander philips of san diego to duke it out with leo cañedo sexy fabrizio and sdc some dude chillin in a three on three wrestling match mattic a 6 4 225 pound las vegas wrestler continued in a deep and powerful voice i m the master of the fresco bomb an original finish that destroys all opponents old boy saw that tonight in the ring afterward the champs walked around the 13 acre carnival grounds bear mcdowell road and 99th avenue in west phoenix the wrestlers mingled and took photos with the 21 and up crowd the 18 and up patients with cards and the other talent performing throughout the venue there were lucha libre wrestlers from mexico 18 samba dancers six rotating aerial acrobats jugglers stilt walkers fire performers unicyclists glassblowers and award winning master balloon artist cody williams i didn t expect to be here right next to a wrestling match williams said it was a show style piece super interesting to watch with a lot of crowd interaction when the festival attendees walked in through the main gates williams balloon station and the 18 by 18 foot wrestling ring were the first attractions to see earlier in the day williams created animal and pot related balloon sculptures so he and his buddy dan a juggling unicyclist could pass the balloons out to the fans from inside the wrestling ring williams added i also made a 4 foot wrestling guy out of balloons then when dan was unicycling in the ring an evil wrestler came up chris nastyy a heel or bad guy in the pro wrestling circuit jumped into the ring talked trash to the arizona fans and popped the balloons including the wrestling balloon sculpture but willams wasn t offended the audience went wild for it he said it was a lot of fun to watch afterward another wrestler came in and pounced on nastyy throughout metro phoenix weed and pro wrestling showcases like this were unheard of until now watson the arizona champ explained like just before the 2020s here in arizona they were still pushing the books to people getting caught with marijuana i got hit with the books do you know what i mean so it s like now you see cops walking around here i wouldn t be surprised if one of them hit a blunt it s crazy to see that and how different it is that people are just open about it but it s not just arizona weed smokers who grappled with medicating and recreational usage in public the relationship between pro wrestling and weed consumption was taboo only spoken about in code in locker rooms for years there were a lot of us that smoked weed in the wrestling industry on the low jarmon said rob van dam rvd allegedly had difficulty with pro wrestling management because of weed but obviously they got over it because now rvd is in the wwe hall of fame van dam wrestled with the wwe extreme championship wrestling ecw and total nonstop action wrestling tna impact wrestling leagues beginning in the early 1990s and on and off until recently he is a longtime user and proponent of cannabis products now 51 he has transitioned his pro wrestling career into creating rvdcbd a cannabinoids company it specializes in cbd and cannabis paraphernalia which a few phoenix based dispensaries at the event stock on their brick and mortar shelves then there s the godfather who made a guest appearance at one of jarmon s wrestling events in a recent table talk interview he told the hosts he smoked a one hitter inside fellow wrestler undertaker s coffin prior to a wwe show i swear that s true i smoked in the coffin he said the 60 year old godfather also said he began medicating with cannabis at 27 to get off painkiller pills i watch these wrestlers these older wrestlers and they re all banged up jarmon continued there s not an old wrestler who doesn t have some ailment or something wrong with their knees and they take painkillers and other things to block the pain the godfather hasn t taken a narcotic pill since he was introduced to cannabis erika mckendree was at one of the 94 vendor booths at the event she repped the genesis bioceuticals company the pharmaceutical users are awakening and acknowledging that there is a better way for them she said and it s really important for us to bridge that gap and try to help rehab a lot of those people who have become addicted to pharmaceuticals and turned into users mckendree and her buddies provided free pre rolls pre rolled joints to the concertgoers wrestling fans and the wrestlers i just laughed she continued it s funny to see people wrestling with wigs and cute girls throwing up pre rolls the arizona tag team wrestling champs sparked up a pre rolled joint then they checked out one of the designated cannabis consumption lounges to view a couple of the music acts authority zero the black moods mouse powell black bottom lighters pariah pete dann g barefoot and rico santana 400 performed on the main stage being an enhanced super duper athlete you have to make sure you have something to go off of after long strenuous matches and bouts mattic said in a softer toned voice one thing that helps out is something like this weed man it s just getting you in the right mind so it s kind of a trip i m on when asked if smoking weed affected the arizona wrestling champions performance in the ring the tag team champions eyes lit up you do have to make sure you are continuously active watson responded you can t just sit there and smoke all day mattic continued i m a productive smoker and smoking before going to the gym will get me more in the zone keep me focused and get me locked in but afterward when i m done i can relax david fowler the executive director of the cannaval event was stoked with the action packed wrestling matches people loved the entertainment and the fact that we had married the wrestling aspect with the cannabis expo he said in a recent email after a successful event we are looking to november 12 for cannaval 2 0 it ll be bigger and better

by last week stocks had fallen to just 104 million barrels the lowest since 2008 and before that 2005 weekly petroleum status report eia may 4 distillate stocks are now 31 million barrels or 23 below the pre pandemic five year seasonal average for 2015 2019 inventories are on course to fall even further to a projected low of just 102 million barrels before the middle of the year with a possible range of 97 million to 105 million barrels based on seasonal trends over the last decade the projected inventory outlook has tightened since the start of april when stocks were on course to fall to a low of 107 million barrels with a range of 96 million to 114 million the resulting shortages of distillate are driving prices for both distillate itself and crude sharply higher and are bleeding across into shortages and higher prices for gasoline and jet fuel cyclical fuel distillate is mostly used in road and rail freight manufacturing construction farming mining and oil and gas extraction so consumption is very sensitive to the business cycle in this instance shortages are a symptom of the strong rebound in economic activity following the pandemic and its bias towards fuel hungry merchandise rather than services similar shortages have been observed in the late stages of previous business cycles with stocks rebuilding once the economy enters a mid cycle slowdown or an end of cycle recession the long term time series shows distillate stocks do not replenish themselves spontaneously they only recover when the economy goes into a soft patch or a full blown recession at present refiners in the united states and the rest of the world do not have enough capacity to satisfy the high level of demand the shortage is likely to be intensified later in 2022 and 2023 as a result of u s and european union sanctions on russia s petroleum exports because russia is a major supplier of distillate fuel oil given that global crude production and refining systems are already stretched to the limit the only way to stabilise inventories and prices is for consumption to grow more slowly or fall which will require a business cycle slowdown source reuters editing by paul simao

firm who was once revered as one of the evangelical world s biggest benefactors could spend the rest of his life in prison after he was arrested and charged last wednesday with racketeering conspiracy securities fraud and wire fraud offenses the charges stem from a number of interrelated schemes to unlawfully manipulate the prices of publicly traded securities in archegos portfolio the u s department of justice announced prosecutors say those schemes caused billions of dollars in losses to leading global investment banks brokerages and investors archegos has operated as a private hedge fund also known as a family office unlike other large hedge funds archegos was not required to tell regulators information about its holdings and debt that might have shined a light on the fraud and

hwang and his chief financial officer patrick halligan pleaded not guilty in manhattan federal court on april 27 the wall street journal reported hwang was released on a 100 million bond while halligan was released on a 1 million bond lawrence lustberg a lawyer for hwang told the new york times that the allegations against his client are overblown and the indictment has absolutely no factual or legal basis he said hwang is entirely innocent of any wrongdoing mary mulligan a lawyer for halligan also told the outlet that her client is innocent and will be exonerated federal prosecutors said two other archegos employees william tomita who was the firm s head trader and scott becker who was its chief risk officer pleaded guilty to their role in the schemes and are currently cooperating with the government according to the indictment hwang along with halligan becker and tomita lied to banks to obtain billions of dollars that they then used to artificially inflate the stock price of a number of publicly traded companies they allegedly invested in stocks mainly through special contracts with banks and brokers called swaps the swaps allowed hwang to cause massive buying of certain stocks including on carefully selected days and times which artificially pumped up stock prices the department of justice statement says hwang and his team are accused of lying to banks and using a series of manipulative trading techniques to keep those stock prices high and prevent them from falling in one year hwang artificially increased the value of a 1 5 billion

year hwang allegedly turned a 1 5 billion portfolio and pumped it up into a 35 billion portfolio but last year the music stopped the bubble burst the prices dropped and when they did billions of dollars of capital evaporated nearly overnight federal prosecutors said that in a matter of days the companies at the center of archegos trading scheme lost more than 100 billion in market capitalization archegos owed billions of dollars more than it had on hand and archegos collapsed investors who purchased the affected stocks at artificial prices also lost the value they believed

the barrow service station was demolished seemingly suddenly last month throwing its preservation minded west dallas neighbors into an uproar but how the building which was once home to both the family of the infamous clyde barrow and where they supported themselves with their star service station ended up a pile of rubble is a more complicated case than evil developer tears down a historic building and the same thing that ultimately allowed the owner of the property brent jackson of oaxaca interests to tear it down may also open up the potential demolition of another structure tied to clyde barrow the lillie mcbride home on north winnetka avenue where clyde barrow shot tarrant county sheriff s deputy malcolm davis point blank in the chest while bonnie parker waited nearby in the car here s why the landmark commission began work to designate both properties the lillie mcbride house is owned by the neighboring wesley rankin community center as landmarks in march 2020 once that process is initiated a two year moratorium is placed on demolition while the landmark commission works to convince the property owner to save the structure in some way sometimes it works sometimes it doesn t chief of detectives bill decker of the dallas county sheriff s department right plays the part of clyde barrow in an official reenactment of the january 6 1933 gunfight at 507 county avenue which would later be known as the lillie mcbride house on north winnetka ave courtesy dallas public library the hayes collection in this case it really really didn t work because the process was initiated on march 2 2020 on march 10 dallas county had its first covid 19 case by the next week city council meetings went virtual and mayor eric johnson temporarily halted any committee meetings that didn t address covid 19 the landmark commission didn t meet in april that year but by may it was once again meeting each month however an exchange during this week s landmark commission meeting seemingly indicates that the commission s designation committee was not meeting at all during the pandemic murray miller director of the city s office of historic preservation explained to the commissioners that the moratorium had expired when jackson opted to demolish the building miller said the whole matter had basically been unattended to since the process began in 2020 with the designation committee not meeting the two year moratorium expired without any action that freed the developer to knock down the property the moratorium expired on march 2 the filling station was demolished 45 days later the fact that the designation committee their efforts and duties were suspended that did not apply to the moratorium one commissioner asked so the clock kept running even though the activities of the designation committee were halted miller asked assistant city attorney bert vandenberg to explain the designation committee s activities were not suspended by the city he informed them explaining that the amended emergency regulation addressed board and commission meetings the designation committee is not actually a board or commission he said but within a month after the first emergency regulation went through boards and commissions were allowed to meet virtually i think there was a lot of chaos it was just a flurry of strangeness at that time that probably led to the illusion of a suspension vandenberg said miller told the committee that the designation process for the barrow family home and filling station didn t move beyond the initiation phase because basically there was nobody moving the ball forward and because the owner didn t consent to the designation that didn t mean that the commission didn t have some choice words for jackson during the meeting apparently the developer got from what was told to us allegedly a buddy to pull a demolition permit under the guise that it was a vacant duplex said rosemary hinojosa the district 6 commissioner where the barrow service station and the lillie mcbride house sit we want to know if there are consequences to what the developer did she said adding that she felt jackson behaved in an underhanded manner according to city records the demolition permit was pulled by a representative of f hall mowing on the behalf of a man named robert hurham who is listed as the owner tenant the address for hurham is the same one listed for oaxaca interests and brett jackson s limited liability company williejaxon vib the permit lists the structure as a single family dwelling or duplex the structure is zoned for community retail use and a 1982 permit said the land use was an office showroom or warehouse however by 1999 when the city issued a master permit for work on the property it was listed as a single family dwelling we have reached out to the city to determine how the structure became listed as a single family home and have yet to hear back that distinction is important for a big reason residential structures can get same day demolition permits while commercial demolitions have a few more hoops to jump through according to the city s how to brochure permits for commercial demolition require in addition to specific insurance limits approval from environmental and health services if the building is not historic and or in the central business district historic buildings which as we all know now the service station was not depend on the timeline of the landmark commission because the barrow service station has been listed as a single family dwelling it was likely easier to get that permit back in 2020 jackson told the commission he had no interest in saving the structure at all my plans are not to keep this building the west dallas developer told the landmark commission saying that he couldn t agree to the landmark when he reflected on the fact that the barrow gang murdered multiple people the commission could ve moved ahead with the landmarking without jackson s participation providing they could get two thirds support from both the landmark commission and the city council but thursday miller said that based on history the council would be unlikely to vote as a supermajority against the owner s wishes without owner consent it is very difficult to protect historic properties he said commission members pointed out that it s not impossible though the landmarking of the lakewood theater the knights of pythias temple and st ann s school were examples of that they said prior to jackson purchasing the property sonia and alexander canales owned the property for at least 20 years using it as overflow parking for the pharmacy they owned nearby now that the barrow station is sitting in a landfill the community is racing to protect the lillie mcbride house which is also no longer protected by a pre pandemic moratorium the lillie mcbride house 2022 matt goodman the community wants to save the lillie mcbride house hinojosa said we would like the city to do its due diligence in this to ensure proper communication between the building inspection department and the office of historic preservation so that site doesn t become demolished the mcbride house still sits next door to the wesley rankin community center which said in 2020 that it would be open to having the structure moved off the property hinojosa said west dallas residents have already identified three more properties they d like to protect she d also like the area protected by a demolition delay overlay that would slow down demolition permit approvals in the meantime the commission is going to begin double checking the status of any other properties that it initiated landmarking on to make sure that they don t need to re initiate that process it s very important that our work move forward now said evelyn montgomery the commission s vice chair get the d brief newsletter dallas most important news stories of the week delivered to your inbox each sunday

hey there time traveller this article was published 05 05 2022 711 days ago so information in it may no longer be current it s a rainy friday night in late april and most of the tables at low life barrel house s brand new space are occupied for the brewery s soft opening where staff are pouring eight beers and two varieties of a fizzy grape based beverage called piquette among those surveying the room is adam carson co founder of low life with tyler birch of barn hammer brewing co there s brewer chris young one of the quieter members of the low life crew who pops his head out from the brewing area in the back to periodically say hello jesse oberman low life s winemaker and assistant brewer as well as the brains behind next friend cider a project that sees him foraging fruit from backyard trees and turning them into cider is more the extrovert type chatting away with anyone within earshot general manager lucas gladu is seemingly everywhere overseeing patrons and the brand new bar staff all at once jessica lee winnipeg free press from left adam carson owner chris young brewer lucas gladu general manager and jesse oberman winemaker celebrate the opening of low life barrel house i had wanted to chronicle a brewery build from start to finish for some time and following low life s progress at 398 daly st n has proved to be quite the learning experience the challenges they ve faced are even more acute because unlike other locals they ll be making a range of barrel aged beer wine cider and other drinks and of course all the challenges have been compounded by the covid 19 pandemic it has been a long exhausting road to low life s opening carson looks happy relaxed visibly relieved it s a far cry from the stress he s experienced on this yearlong journey one that has taken up all of his time a lot of his money and frayed relationships with friends and business partners april 2021 i meet the 37 year old carson for the first time just weeks after he and birch also 37 signed the lease to take over the former electra sign office just off pembina highway they re in demolition mode smashing through office walls and opening up the space that will hold the brewing and winemaking equipment large oak barrels and taproom when the pair first started brewing together carson was a partner at clearview rentals which is the equipment rental agency he still runs while birch had helmed tnt fenceworks before we started low life i used to go over to tyler s house and brew in the basement make this gigantic mess the very first beer that we brewed that was doable was very close to the grandpa s sweater says carson referring to barn hammer s oatmeal stout now a staple in their lineup mike sudoma winnipeg free press the exterior of the new home of low life barrel house the former electra sign office on daly street north just off pembina highway birch mentioned to carson that he wanted to get into the beer industry full time sold his fencing business and got to work on what would become barn hammer brewing co carson helped out with the build at barn hammer before he and his wife relocated to toronto in 2018 despite the move it was around that time carson and birch decided to start their own brewing project and the pair began brewing in earnest out of barn hammer s facility in early 2019 rather than brew under the barn hammer name carson and birch s funkier often barrel aged beers were released under the name low life barrel house we started doing it as a side project for us it definitely wasn t for the money says carson we d release one beer at a time mike sudoma winnipeg free press construction is about to take a place at the new site for low life barrel house carson was mulling opening a bricks and mortar brewery in toronto when the pandemic hit when things started shutting down including his wife s fitness studio they returned to winnipeg at that point he and birch began searching in earnest for low life s own space while continuing to make their barrel aged beers in dribs and drabs at barn hammer in what was maybe fate both carson and birch got separate emails from different real estate agents about the same daly street building and they started swinging hammers in the space march 1 2021 the plan is to open the 100 person taproom in september but for that to happen they ll need in place both the brewhouse and the large oak barrels called foeders pronounced food ers which will help impart low life s signature flavour profile the brewhouse essentially the engine of a brewery which consists of brewing equipment including the kettle brite tank and fermenters is slated to arrive mid summer and the foeders shortly thereafter alex lupul winnipeg free press from left adam carson and tyler birch in the space that will eventually become home to low life barrel house first there are the water upgrades to attend to so the building can handle the increased need for water required in the brewing and cleaning processes each regular sized batch of beer they brew is about 20 bbl beer barrels the measurement used in the industry which is the equivalent of around 2 300 litres so there s the water involved with making the beer plus the cleaning of the tanks and barrels the dishwashing washrooms and more low life had to upgrade the water line in the building to facilitate brewing a fix that cost upwards of 25 000 instead of spearheading the brewing themselves birch and carson hired chris young longtime head brewer at half pints brewing co who also moved to toronto briefly and worked at indie ale house before returning to winnipeg he s been an absolute revelation carson says chris has brewed two new beers for us that are in mini foeders at barn hammer a dark saison and a berliner he s been amazing on brett and barrels one of the signature features of low life barrel house s beer is the fact they re infected for lack of a better term with brettanomyces or brett brett is a particular strain of yeast which is often used in lambic beers and other belgian and belgian style brews it typically imparts earthy funky flavours that in moderation bring additional complexity to beers at a facility such as low life brewer chris young and winemaker jesse oberman will need to be careful to ensure airborne brett particles don t infect the wines and ciders while a bit of brett in such products can add similar complexity to beer those funky flavours can easily overwhelm wines click to read more one place brett thrives particularly well is in oak barrels hence the baker s dozen of 2 300 litre large oak vessels called foeders in low life s taproom as is the case with wine aging beer in oak barrels imparts different flavours than when finished in stainless steel tanks before bottling barrels allow minute amounts of oxygen in and out which ramps up the bretty notes and ages a beer differently in addition to the taproom foeders low life has a range of smaller vessels onsite as well making beer in foeders takes time months rather than the days or weeks typically involved with making beer hence the fact that until low life can start packaging or kegging some of their foeder aged beers in the next month or two they re focusing on making brews that reflect their unique flavour profiles but without the use of wood for more detail on low life s innovative beer styles visit lowlifebarrelhouse com close one of the reasons the business is called low life barrel house rather than say low life brewing co is that the plan is also to operate an urban winery in the space making reds whites rosés and sparkling wines with organic fruit purchased from ontario to that end carson and birch hired oberman who has taken part in harvests in ontario and europe worked as a sommelier in london operates a wine importing agency focusing on minimal intervention natural wine producers called elevage selections and makes cider under the next friend name i was really into natural wine for years i learned about it in montreal when i was on my honeymoon says carson we went to london right after that and natural wine s everywhere it blew my mind jesse and i moved back to winnipeg around the same time so i reached out to him it was serendipitous timing says oberman who was in france when the pandemic hit and like carson retreated to winnipeg adam said he wanted to start making wine and i was making cider in my basement inspired by the minimal intervention wines of southern france the alsace region as well as neighbouring germany the wines oberman s looking to make will be relatively low in alcohol hazy in appearance due to being unfiltered and made in a hands off style all the hallmarks of natural winemaking it s like pretty thrilling to make wine in winnipeg oberman says a sentence i never thought i d hear uttered by anyone i wanted to be a winemaker and i wanted to live in winnipeg and i just didn t think the two were compatible with a brewery winery and cidery licence the plan is for oberman to move his next friend cider operations from barn hammer to low life where he ll have access to more space and barrels they ll also make piquette a slightly spritzy beer strength beverage made from grape pomace which is leftover skins and seeds and water until the barrel house can open the modest revenue from sales of existing low life stock as well as carson and birch s income from their other businesses is what s keeping the demo work going july 2021 daniel crump winnipeg free pressmaking beer in foeders takes time months rather than the days or weeks typically involved with making beer low life barrel house isn t yet looking anything like a spot to enjoy a pint over the sound of heavy machinery and heavy metal iron maiden to be precise the pair point out where everything is going to end up the brewing equipment taproom washrooms cooler and more we re also planning to get a still to make some whisky birch notes we want to say get a chardonnay barrel age a brett beer in it take that out and put whisky in there and see what happens the big snag right now is paperwork from the city we re just waiting on permits for everything it s now is in zoning s hands says carson i contacted zoning this morning they won t tell me where i am in the queue just give me a ballpark are we talking number 300 number two just so we can prepare better talk to our subtrades some trades will go elsewhere the plumbers are going well i have another job to take that paperwork will set off a chain of events that will move low life much closer towards completion once we get our permit the inspector will come sign off on the plumbing we can pour the concrete let that sit and then the floors come in and then go time alex lupul winnipeg free press from left tyler birch and adam carson work in the space that become home to low life barrel house in the meantime arrangements are being worked out with the manitoba liquor gaming and cannabis authority that will allow the first step in the brewing process to happen at barn hammer then have the non alcoholic grain juice transferred to low life for fermentation and aging in the foeders we d basically make the beer there then drive it over here pump it into the foeders and just let it sit the 13 foeders slated to sit in low life s tasting room have arrived but until the concrete can be finished and the floor installed they re sitting empty at clearview rentals they re a key part of what sets low life barrel house apart from most other local craft drinks makers one of the trickier points about low life is that many people don t really know what we do or how we do it carson says the taproom will solve a lot of those problems you come in and go what are these big barrels that s what we age our beer in adds birch that s why we were very interested in having them on display the brewhouse meanwhile is another story we ordered it in december and it was due to come in july carson says now it s pushed back to september all of which makes their initial september opening date likely unattainable i think october might be more realistic but honestly it s probably going to be november carson admits september 2021 sure enough delays and setbacks along the way mean the september opening isn t going to happen this isn t a huge surprise as anyone who has opened a brewery can tell you and while things aren t progressing on schedule when i pop in to daly street to catch up with carson and birch in the fall of 2021 there has certainly been progress the cooler in the back area where grains and finished cans and kegs of beer will be stored is done with the exception of the door we just sent the cheque this morning it s supposed to be here for the first week of october says carson the refrigeration units meanwhile will be installed on the roof later in the week and the drywall in the space being finished in large part by birch and his father who owns brandon s black wheat brewing co is nearly done once it s finished the urethane floor will be installed but that can t happen until the refrigeration units are out of the space and on the roof and another big thing we re waiting for right now is the electrical to get switched over says birch we need more power if we didn t order by the day we did they went up some 25 per cent in price and since then they ve gone up again adam carson carson expresses frustration at the delays they ve encountered many of which were due to supply chain issues one particular snag they ll encounter repeatedly along the way is with doors particularly bay doors for the front of the building and fire rated units needed for installation between the brewhouse and taproom the bay doors which we ordered in late april early may it looks like they re coming the sixth of november says carson and normally that s something that you should be getting like two to four weeks after you order today i contacted two different hutterite colonies to build them just to see if they could get them quicker he also notes the cost of materials including the bay doors are skyrocketing if we didn t order by the day we did they went up some 25 per cent in price and since then they ve gone up again carson expects the brewhouse to arrive the week after the urethane floor is installed the fermenting tanks have already arrived and are for the time being stored at clearview rentals with the foeders meanwhile they have added lucas gladu to their roster he was formerly in charge of the bar at forth and will act as general manager and salesperson he s working part time for now with the intention of going full time in january alex lupul winnipeg free press a liquor licence application notice outside low life barrel house and while the delays have caused significant headaches and dented carson and birch s cash flow they ve taken what they ve learned from the barn hammer build and put it to good use when i did barn hammer i got an architect to just mostly approve stuff and we kind of designed it ourselves for budget reasons which ended up with some regrettable oversights birch says this has been much more planned out and organized in that way but he is starting to find he s less able to keep tabs on things back at barn hammer i spend all my time here he says i keep trying to do barn hammer stuff but i have to finish so many things here before we do the wall we need to put the draft lines in finish the drywall so that the electrical guy can do his thing i keep trying to do barn hammer stuff but i have to finish so many things here before we do the wall we need to put the draft lines in finish the drywall so that the electrical guy can do his thing tyler birch low life has also been broken into twice in the past couple of months i had all my tools stolen birch says the first time they took my cordless angle grinder and then the second time they came and just cut the hinges off the door with that same cordless angle grinder just peeled it back like a banana and crawled in but carson s still somewhat optimistic noting that if installation of doors and approvals from the city come through there s still a chance to open in 2021 albeit with some temporary fixes for smaller missing pieces we could perhaps have a soft opening let s say mid november i could deal with dec 1 he says but we re not missing the holidays i can assure you of that november 2021 birch and carson meet me again at daly street where things are visibly coming together although far from completion the floors are done the brewhouse is in place and the 13 foeders line one of the taproom s walls it s shaping up to be a brewery unlike any other in the city while the bay doors still haven t arrived carson expects them soon and most other door related issues appear to have been resolved getting material is out of control but we got doors we had to pay extra and they were rushed through we ordered them last week and we get them in three weeks both young and oberman continue to make beer piquette and cider at barn hammer although production on low life beer continues to scale down as more materials are brought to daly street jesse is the hardest working person he s there from mornings until midnight doing beer stuff his cider stuff wine stuff carson says alex lupul winnipeg free press the drywall has to be finished before the urethane floor can be installed both birch and carson are cognizant of the toll building low life has taken on their respective psyches i think the last time we were here with you i was a bit down about it all birch says to me but we re starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel carson agrees i feel the same way we were both down and negative with so much going on but yeah i think there is a clear ending ahead as to when they expect to arrive at the end of the tunnel carson remains optimistic i think we could maybe be brewing in three weeks he says in terms of an opening date however he s less specific i think we d open the minute we were allowed to we need some money coming in january 2022 mike deal winnipeg free press tyler birch left and adam carson check out the progress of low life barrel house the holidays have come and gone and low life is still neither open nor making beer on site carson visibly downcast when i drop by in january rattles off many of the same problems that plagued them on my last visit supply chain issues cost increases to materials and the like but again there has been more visible progress the brewhouse is completely installed the taproom fridge and merchandise area completed the washrooms and plumbing nearly done and the kitchen essentially just a dishwasher for glassware there ll be no food prepared at low life is close too other progress is less visible namely the preparation of the oak foeders to receive beer for aging they ve been steamed and will first be filled with what s called a trash wort a low alcohol beer that can be dumped after use unless it tastes good of course to help with conditioning and mellowing out the woody notes in the barrels water doesn t do it it s not acidic enough says birch i think the lower ph of the beer actually takes some of that oakiness out mmike sudoma winnipeg free press despite supply chain issues cost increases to materials and the like there has been more visible progress one of the unwelcome holiday gifts for the low life crew has been contracting covid both oberman and young tested positive while birch was laid up with what he assumed was covid as well only carson managed to dodge getting sick production of low life beers at barn hammer has pretty much stopped in anticipation of getting up and running on daly street we have a couple beers in foeders at barn hammer and that s it says birch whose drywalling and construction duties at low life have wrapped up allowing him a bit more time at his wall street brewery for oberman unlike the others witnessing any kind of a build first hand is new and has been a revelation adam works in construction and tyler has built a thousand things chris has opened breweries before too there s a lot of problem solving every day he says we were both down and negative with so much going on but yeah i think there is a clear ending ahead adam carson every time something comes up i m like oh my god it s going to ruin everything and they re like no no he hopes to have some piquettes ready to go in march that he reckons will be made at barn hammer while young gets to know the newly installed brewhouse i hesitate before asking again about an opening date risking sounding like a broken record but birch sounds confident there s not that much to do in here although i know it doesn t look like it he says laughing it s definitely not 2 1 2 months from now there s no way it will take that long april 2022 mike deal winnipeg free press the foeders have been steamed and will first be filled with what s called a trash wort a low alcohol beer that can be dumped after use unless it tastes good of course to help with conditioning and mellowing out the woody notes in the barrels in early april 2 1 2 months later there s not been much news from the low life camp which i figure isn t a good sign so i email oberman birch and carson about meeting again with the hopes things are nearly ready to go one year after we first met to chat after locking in a time to meet at daly street carson informs me birch is no longer part of the project it s odd to be back in the space without birch there but carson offers his take on his departure owning and running one brewery is a hell of a lot of work plus he owns mammoth canning a mobile canning facility used by many local breweries and then navigating it through a pandemic while trying to open another brewery during the pandemic and with a young family i imagine it s a bit overwhelming a bit much for anyone s plate says carson who has a young child of his own and another on the way i m not saying he can t handle that workload but you ve got to focus on your priorities if you own all of barn hammer and half of low life what would you rather save if you lose barn hammer you re totally screwed mike sudoma winnipeg free press we canned and packaged some beer that was very satisfying young says carson explains he and birch officially ended things a few weeks back we had a conversation in december where he was going to step back in some form then in mid january he was back on had figured his situation out differently and then it just kind of petered out again back to where we were with all the big pieces in place in the facility however things really are looking near completion the taproom bar and furniture are in lighting looks to be mostly done and lo and behold there s beer brewed on site and in cans and kegs although they ve not been aged in foeders there s just no time about half of the foeders are filled with beer aging away for future release we canned and packaged some beer that was very satisfying young says and as much as i don t mind doing other things here it s good to be able to just make beer but i know this same story from every other brewery that s ever opened there s so many things that go into it carson who seems exhausted but with a glimmer of optimism jumps in i wish i knew what he knew i m in construction and we just install this has been a lot different than anything i ve ever been a part of there were a lot of moving parts mike sudoma winnipeg free presshead brewer chris young in the back room speaking of parts the cost of wood has skyrocketed over the last year we have a beautiful exterior design and patio which is 90 per cent wood carson says and we re just holding off from doing it wood has gone up in price so much that it s not doable right now so we re going with a temporary patio which aesthetically is not going to be as nice that s not putting your best foot forward but that s the reality carson says the patio will have room for an additional 60 guests and the bay doors that will lead to the patio have yet to arrive we re still waiting on the overhead doors we ordered over a year ago they re still not here carson says almost laughing they re supposed to ship today from nebraska they re beautiful glass with black trim light s going to be pouring in here it s going to look great he s pleased about the look of the taproom although some of the first choices on particular elements didn t come through and those changes came with a cost these last minute changes you hear oh that tile by the way it s unavailable the one you wanted which is x amount per square foot this one s twice as much but it s all we can get in time for you to open he says i need more chairs so i emailed two weeks ago about chairs and they are 110 more each than they originally were asked about cost overruns on the project as a whole carson doesn t get into specifics and i don t ask but he says there have been enough of them it s not double but it s not far off he says wincing and a lot of that was due to covid you can t just make that money back it s not like you can say oh we paid an extra 20 per cent for this countertop so now we re charging a percentage on the beer not all of the 20 taps behind the taproom s dark porcelain bar will have beer wine or cider flowing from them when the place opens but many are already spoken for carson anticipates seven beers will be available on tap initially with offerings including a piquette two different grape ales a house saison a small pale a dry hopped sour and a dark mild none of which will have been aged in foeders but which will still be representative of low life s unique take on brewing tasting notes the first four beers below were brewed at low life s new location albeit not aged in foeders due to the time it takes for barrel aging they re available at the brewery and have started rolling out to liquor marts and beer vendors the latter two brews were aged in oak although they were brewed at barn hammer s wall street location as such they can t be sold at low life but are at liquor marts and beer vendors and may still be

concord grape saison with brett also in the foeders is a pilsner which will likely get the brett treatment as well but they ll not be ready until late may or june oberman meanwhile has been working with his ontario grapes on some of his first creations for the most part production on the wine started at barn hammer and will be finished at low life initial offerings will include a rosé made of skin macerated vidal grapes as well as cabernet franc three sparkling wines another skin contact vidal that will be an orange wine and a white blend of which there will be two iterations one for low life and one for barn hammer and while carson seems in slightly better spirits the stress is still palpable much of which he attributes to dollars and cents if anything ever really bad happened to my other company i d be in trouble and now i m spending almost all my time here he says echoing birch s sentiments before he stepped away unless you re working 80 hours a week you ignore one business and your family my daughter is due in a month he pauses before continuing it s been the worst year of my life i m a very positive person and very upbeat high energy i usually try to kid around and laugh and now i can t sleep but you know the last couple of weeks i ve been trying to be a little bit more positive because i can see it i can see a light at the end of the tunnel drinking some of these new beers that chris is making with zero guidance for me the last couple he s made have been fabulous i m really excited about this place we just need to get the doors open at this point and he says barring any last minute snags on approvals from the city and the like low life barrel house will have its soft opening on april 29 and officially open to the public may 4 daniel crump winnipeg free presspeople check out low life barrel house on the establishment s long awaited opening day a couple of days later i stop by barn hammer s wall street taproom to touch base with birch about the split when i arrive he s working the canning line for the initial offering from super fun beverage co a project he and carson both still co own and whose initial offerings will be craft seltzers birch steps away from the line for a few minutes visibly more relaxed than during our previous low life visits what i wanted from low life and what adam wanted from low life was different we just wanted to go in different directions he says the other part was that barn hammer was really suffering i was doing the construction at low life spending so much time there and i have a young family it was like i just can t do it even if it was going super well i probably would have backed away birch notes the pandemic was particularly hard on barn hammer add in the rebranding they re rolling out upcoming renovations to the space and other projects such as super fun and mammoth canning and it was all too much and while he s disappointed he won t be a part of the facility he helped build birch has no regrets about the decision to step away and focus on barn hammer it s been so much easier he says i m way happier way less stressed mike sudoma winnipeg free press it s the evening of april 29 my last official visit the construction noises have been replaced by the din of human voices a taproom filled with people chatting and drinking beer under large domed light fixtures that fabulous wall of foeders offering a beautiful backdrop the menu of beers on the wall behind the bar is missing a couple of letters and not all the lights are lit quite yet but it s finished enough once those new bay doors are installed and the evening sun is shining through it will be quite a sight tonight the rain from the latest colorado low to blast the city is just starting to fall in addition to the eight beers and two piquettes on tap there are several offerings in cans to go none of which have been aged in barrels but which bring low life s tasty left of centre adventurous approach to beer there s also glassware t shirts hoodies and more for sale staff are pouring drinks as carson young oberman and gladu circulate and chat with the various invited tradespeople involved in putting the place together daniel crump winnipeg free pressa few of the offerings brewed on site and for sale at low life barrel house oberman and young say they ve found working together both inspiring and educational although the chaos of getting ready to open and the fact that oberman is still doing next friend cider stuff at barn hammer means the pair haven t collaborated extensively at daly street with the grape ales pouring on tap and in cans their first true tag team effort they re an unlikely pairing but one that seems destined to bring a real sense of adventure to winnipeg s craft beer and wine scene and the doors do officially open to the public wednesday with photos of the handsome foeders hazy beers and slick new taproom already spreading across social media low life has already had many requests for special event bookings for later in the year and between the barrel wall the innovative beers and the spacious taproom it s easy to see why one of the things i ll take away from chronicling low life s journey from side project to stand alone drinks maker is that cost overruns and delays are pretty much the norm although in this case they were escalated by the pandemic and while the beers taste great and the almost completely finished facility looks spectacular both front and back of house there s so much hard work and behind the scenes issues to contend with that

when luiz inácio lula da silva steps onto a stage in são paulo on saturday to formally launch his sixth campaign for brazil s presidency he will do so as the clear favourite it is a remarkable turnaround for the former union leader who spent the last contest in jail but four years on is now in a strong position to win an unprecedented third mandate to govern latin america s biggest country two decades after he first won power polls give the former president a clear lead over the far right incumbent jair bolsonaro with over half of those surveyed saying they will not vote for the former army captain under any circumstances after a first term marred by scandal serial incompetence and authoritarian sabre rattling lula in contrast has positioned himself as the national unity candidate by picking geraldo alckmin the conservative rival he beat to win a second term in 2006 to be his running mate this time out last week the united nations human rights committee ruled the corruption inquiry that led to lula s imprisonment thus preventing him from running against bolsonaro in 2018 had violated due process lula hailed the judgment as an extraordinary cleansing of the soul though brazil s supreme court had already annulled the convictions for which he served 580 days in jail the un s largely symbolic ruling will help deflect efforts by bolsonaro to refocus public attention on the corruption scandals that marred lula s workers party s 13 years in power until 2016 controversial statements but in recent weeks the confidence around lula s team has started to give way to some nervousness several supporters have even gone public with criticism after a series of controversial statements have led some to call into question the 76 year old s previously sound political touch read more at a may day rally on sunday in a speech remarkably short by his usual standards lula was forced to apologise for saying the day beforethat bolsonaro doesn t like people he only likes the police brazil s state police forces are well organised and politically influential and have been relentlessly courted by the president lula was also heavily criticised for suggesting that sending groups of 50 union members to knock on the homes of federal deputies and talk with their families would have more impact than demonstrations in the capital brasília these gaffes at a time when he is supposed to be reaching out to the centre ground have focused attention on the campaign team around lula with power struggles ongoing for control over its communications strategy among the criticisms levelled against it has been the failure to compete with bolsonaro s sophisticated social media operation that has allowed him to bypass largely critical traditional media lula has also failed to reassure financial markets about the future direction of fiscal policy at a time of growing unease at bolsonaro s increasingly reckless management of the public finances seasoned campaigner bolsonaro has used his control over brazil s administrative machine to put together more competitive slates in key states than seemed possible a year ago using the federal budget to buy political support thus despite picking alckmin as his running mate several of brazil s traditional centrist parties are yet to join lula s coalition as many within their ranks lobby for the right to align with the president especially in regions where bolsonaro is strongest but despite the recent turbulence around him lula brazil s most seasoned political campaigner has sought to remain calm i am tranquil and certain we have all the conditions to win the elections he said in a radio interview earlier this week he knows he is attempting to become the first candidate to prevent an incumbent president being re elected but he is the first challenger who can point to his own time in the job when the economy boomed and millions were lifted out of poverty at a time of high unemployment rampant inflation and growing hunger nostalgia is set to be lula s most potent electoral weapon

by lewis krauskopf new york reuters u s stocks tumble this year is putting an increased focus on equity valuations as investors assess whether recently discounted shares are worth buying in the face of a hawkish federal reserve and widespread geopolitical uncertainty with the benchmark s p 500 index down 13 5 year to date valuations stand at their lowest levels in two years putting the index s forward price to earnings ratio at 17 9 times from 21 7 at the end of 2021 according to the latest data from refinitiv datastream although many investors tended to brush off elevated valuations during the market s dynamic surge from its post covid 19 lows they have been quick to punish companies viewed as overvalued this year as the fed rolls back easy money policies that had kept bond yields low and buoyed equities while recently discounted valuations may boost stocks appeal to some bargain hunters other investors believe equities may not be cheap enough as the fed signals it is ready to aggressively tighten monetary policy to fight inflation bond yields surge and geopolitical risks such as the war in ukraine continue roiling markets stocks are getting close to fair valuation but they re not quite there yet said j bryant evans portfolio manager at cozad asset management in champaign illinois if you take into account bond yields inflation what is going on with gdp and the broader economy they re not quite there yet wild swings shook markets in the past week after the fed delivered a widely expected 50 basis point rate increase and signaled similar moves for the meetings ahead as it tries to quell the highest annual inflation rates in 40 years the index has declined for five straight weeks its longest losing streak since mid 2011 more volatility could be in store if next week s monthly consumer price index reading exceeds expectations potentially bolstering the case for even more aggressive monetary policy tightening from the fed there has been a healthy reset in valuations and sentiment wrote keith lerner co chief investment officer at truist advisory services in a recent note to clients for stocks to move higher on a sustainable basis investors will likely need to have greater confidence in the fed s ability to tame inflation without unduly hurting the economy though valuations have come down s p 500 s forward p e stands above its long term average of 15 5 times earnings estimates graphic u s stock market valuations potentially burnishing stocks appeal s p 500 companies are expected to increase earnings by about 9 this year according to refinitiv data as they wrap up a better than expected first quarter reporting season one likely factor is whether treasuries extend a sell off that has lifted the benchmark 10 year note yield which moves inversely to prices to its highest since late 2018 higher yields in particular dull the allure of technology and other high growth sectors as their cash flows are often more weighted in the future and diminished when discounted at higher rates the forward p e for the s p 500 technology sector has declined from 28 5 times to 21 4 so far this year according to refinitiv datastream data as of friday morning in terms of growth valuations they have been hit the hardest and likely the most oversold said art hogan chief market strategist at national securities but the sector continues to trade at a nearly 20 premium to the overall s p 500 above the 15 premium it has averaged over the broader index over the past five years if the 10 year yield hovers between 3 to 3 5 after being a fraction of that level for a long period that is going to continue to be a weight on the p e and therefore the discounting mechanism for the growth and technology space said john lynch chief investment officer for comerica wealth management which favors value over growth shares to a large extent the pressure from higher yields has been baked in lynch said but i don t think it is going to go away i think it is going to persist reporting by lewis krauskopf editing by ira iosebashvili and richard chang

when russia invaded ukraine governments around the world responded with severe economic sanctions russian president vladimir putin retaliated threatening to ban exports of oil gas fertilizer and wheat we will only be supplying food and agriculture products to our friends former russian president dmitry medvedev said april 1 on telegram calling food a quiet weapon in the war advertisement wheat is a weapon but not just in the obvious way putin is not only starving his enemies into submission he s also using wheat as a weapon of psychological warfare the russian president is a master propagandist and like all manipulators he knows that perception carefully managed can become reality wheat is a valuable global commodity both symbol and sustenance in 2009 after a spike in prices a senate subcommittee proclaimed wheat even more central to modern civilization than oil bread is a measure of stability or instability and that s what makes it such a powerful propaganda tool wheat as one agriculture economist wrote during the panic of 2010 is all about fear the real danger is not a global wheat shortage it s a fear driven panic that pushes up prices and cuts off the truly hungry there s a tendency to believe that people starve because there isn t enough food to go around but for the past 60 years that hasn t been the case in that period food prices have steadily trended down even as income inequality within countries has trended up so today when people go hungry it s not because there s a shortage of food it s because they don t have the money or the ability to buy it famines are never about food production said arif husain chief economist for the u n world food program it is always about access meanwhile farmers from illinois to india began planting more wheat when prices started going up on april 8 the u n food and agriculture organization forecast a relatively comfortable supply level of grain worldwide global wheat production has increased rice production is at an all time high if everyone remains calm there s enough to go around said angie setzer co founder of consus a farm and agriculture consulting group but right now we re in freakout mode the danger is that panic will inflate prices making bread unaffordable for those who can t pay market rates everyone says the price has to go higher because of inflation people buy because of the idea that it has to go higher and it goes higher said setzer and then everyone says see we have inflation and it s the most beautiful self fulfilling prophecy in the world in response multiple countries imposed restrictions on food exports driving prices even higher by creating an artificial scarcity thus generating what the world bank warned could be a multiplier effect on global prices by early april prices had sunk from holy moly highs to merely historic ones heads were cooling but not entirely grain prices are still at levels not seen since the panic of 2008 10 when protests over food broke out in countries around the world and eventually helped topple governments across the middle east on april 5 as prices began to sink putin threatened global food production by hinting that a shortage of fertilizers was inevitable russia would have to carefully monitor exports to countries which are hostile to us he said for the past month pundits politicians and grain traders have been parsing his threats will he cut off ukraine s exports a key part of the world s export market in corn sunflower oil and wheat will he withhold russian wheat for political gain as experts have been warning for years and most important can putin really cause a global food crisis advertisement maybe but only if we let him only temporarily and mostly in places where people are already hungry if well fed nations panic and keep prices high food truly will be unaffordable for the world s hungriest people share this article share the real concern is much poorer nations who cannot compete with the richer countries in the world said setzer we know that will starve people but that doesn t matter in the face of an inflation trade an often speculative investment strategy that seeks to profit from rising prices all this gives putin who never hesitates to use food as a weapon against civilians disproportionate power over the world s hungriest wheat inflation hits lower income countries harder for two reasons diets there rely more on carbohydrates and food makes up a much higher proportion of overall budgets in many low and middle income countries food can account for close to half of household budgets said marc bellemare an agricultural economist at the university of minnesota in the united states by contrast it s between 7 and 10 percent in the u s we will feel it a little bit said bellemare people are going to bellyache about it but it s not going to be what it s like in other countries for hungry countries where the social contract is shaky high wheat prices have historically contributed to political uprisings a short lived change in prices can set off long simmering anger and that s why governments are panicking when food security is threatened said bellemare then political order is threatened advertisement sudan is a good example in 2018 sudan imposed a series of austerity measures bread prices tripled by 2019 a wave of bread protests had ousted the country s military dictator longtime russian client omar hassan al bashir the symbol of the protesters when they turned out on the street against bashir was bread said alex de waal executive director of the world peace foundation and a famine expert he quoted one of their slogans you are stealing the wealth of the country and we can t afford bread which was largely true in 2020 the sudanese government spent 916 million on wheat and flour of which 79 percent was from russia and 2 percent from ukraine sudan is now facing currency collapse massive inflation and a government that lacks widespread popular support sudan s economy is in free fall said kholood khair managing partner at insight strategy partners a policy organization based in khartoum for me it s not a case of what does russia ukraine look like in two or three years what does russia ukraine supply of wheat look like immediately and in the next two to three months when supply in sudan is going to be running out the situation in sudan is so bad said de waal that the inflation rate there actually went down not because food got cheaper but because nobody could afford it there s one thing worse than hyperinflation which is when hyperinflation subsides because no one has any money lebanon is in a similar predicament reeling from an economic collapse that the world bank ranked among the worst of the past 170 years and that has plunged three quarters of the population into poverty the lebanese government as is the case in much of the middle east subsidizes bread in 2020 lebanon imported 66 percent of its wheat from ukraine and 12 percent from russia lebanon imports 80 percent of its overall food supply when prices rise past a certain point governments usually draw on grain reserves stored in massive silos to avoid having to buy at inflated prices but when thousands of pounds of ammonium nitrate stored at the beirut port exploded in 2020 killing more than 250 people and damaging 6 000 buildings the blast also destroyed the silos holding the country s only grain stocks small and privately held since lebanon mostly relied on just in time ordering advertisement in late february when putin invaded ukraine the lebanese government claimed it had enough reserves to last a month or two but sami halabi director of policy at triangle a beirut based research institute didn t buy it ramadan started april 2 and general elections are may 15 political parties usually use elections and ramadan as excuses to host lavish dinners and pass out meals to people since the invasion the government has raised the price of subsidized bread twice halabi suspects that the government will keep bread prices more or less stable until the elections are over then let them skyrocket the worst case scenario and probably the most likely one is a repeat of what happened last summer blackouts fuel shortages and runaway food inflation fivefold over two years according to the world food program all compounding to create an unprecedented hunger crisis the well fed world can do a few things to stop this inflationary cycle the first is not to panic price volatility might be bad for eaters but it s good for agribusiness investors grain speculators and the abcds the four transnational megacompanies that control the sourcing shipping and storage of food archer daniels midland bunge cargill and louis dreyfus they like volatility inflation is also good for putin high wheat prices help finance the war the concern is real setzer said it s going to be six to eight months before we really feel comfortable but as long as we stay calm we should be able to make sure that everyone has enough to get through the situation at hand in the meantime setzer recommended a few simple things anyone can do to take pressure off global markets and supply chains find local food producers see if there s a farm near you with a community supported agriculture project try to reduce food waste i m not saying you stop shopping at a grocery store she said but try to get comfortable with your local farm groups

i never talk about labor force participation rates because it is the most useless labor data we have everyone had forecasted this data line to fall in the 21st century and it has nothing is wrong with this people generally make too much of this data because it makes a sexy headline so the fact that this fell means nothing to me nor will it ever in my life it won t mean anything to me in the afterlife either the data line that i track that matters most will always be prime age employment to the population data because that is the proper working age workforce not people 16 24 or 55 and over the employment to population percentage for the prime age labor force fell in this report but is 0 6 away from being back to february 2020 levels the jobs recovery in this new expansion has been much better than we saw during the recovery phase after the great financial crisis the current jobless claims data is very low historically as the hunt for labor and making sure to retain workers is a real issue for companies this is a weekly data line that has been in a downtrend for some time even though i retired my america is back recovery model on dec 9 2020 i knew getting all the jobs back lost to covid 19 would take some time so september of 2022 was the target date that i believe we will achieve those pre covid 19 levels of course we had to deal with delta and omicron variants but still we are on pace to get all the jobs back by september of this year feb 2020 152 553 000 jobs may 6 2022 151 314 000 jobs that leaves us with 1 239 000 jobs left to make up over the next five months which means we need to average adding 247 800 jobs per month the unemployment rate currently stands at 3 6 look at the jobs data and which sector added jobs in march construction jobs came in positively but the real winner was manufacturing jobs job openings in construction and manufacturing are big in america today the notion that robots and immigrants took all the jobs was simply a joke as we can see the labor market is solid and has some legs when the economy is back to normal i expect to see much smaller job gains as our country lacks the population growth to have big job numbers unless it s coming off a recession now to the second big news the recession red flags recession red flag model 4th flag raised today for every recovery model you need to have a recessionary model traditional cycles can be forecasted correctly it makes things interesting when you get a shock like covid 19 the united states of america was still in an expansionary mode in 2019 and 2020 before covid 19 hit us for a more traditional economic expansion and recession here is the model backtested with the housing bubble years in which the red flags were all up in 2006 the fourth recession red flag looks for over investment in the economic cycle what sector was so hot that the demand for that sector couldn t be sustained retail sales durable goods spending and the e commerce side of this expansion saw an epic boom due to covid 19 now those stocks are getting deflated and the demand for durable goods can t be sustained i use the company peloton and their boom and bust cycle as an example of what a job loss recession looks like this company had booming demand and then that demand collapsed leaving them with too many workers that they had to fire it also derailed their plans for a manufacturing plant to build more bikes amazon recently spoke about being too big and having too much capacity after the massive surge in consumer demand as demand normalizes the need for this much labor and capacity doesn t seem apparent anymore this is very common in boom and bust cycles where for some time you need more people and capacity to fill in demand but if that demand doesn t sustain itself you will have spare capacity if you want to hear some encouraging news about the growth rate of inflation peaking out this news from amazon is it there are two final recession flags which are always the most important the leading economic index falls four to six months before every recession of course this hasn t happened but this data line had an epic recovery from april 2020 the same month i wrote the america is back recovery model new home sales and housing starts traditionally fall into a recession this is where the 5 plus mortgage rate world can facilitate this red flag going up so far this hasn t been the case but this is 100 something we need to focus on as an economic expansion matures we always look at different variables housing holds a key right now as the last two recession red flags would need real estate to get weaker for us to discuss a recession of course the russian invasion of ukraine and the china lockdowns are out of our control but we can still create models that factor them in our expansion and recession ultimately it will be all about the u s consumer who has always been our engine of economic growth and we will see if they can keep the last two flags from being raised
