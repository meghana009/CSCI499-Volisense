but besides crazy bets on high oil prices in the near future there are other signs that the demise of fossil fuels has been greatly exaggerated in the mind of many a news consumer oil is on its way out so is coal so is gas although that one might stick around for a little longer we are after all moving into a new era of clean energy and while it will take us some time to get there it s our only option for a future and fossil fuels have no place in that future the latest oil gas and coal price rally therefore must have come as a shock to that hypothetical news consumer it turns out this rally said that news does not always reflect reality neither do oil and gas price forecasts remember when there was a gas glut as recently as last year everyone said it would persist keeping prices low but it didn t the glut ended quite suddenly this year predicting oil or apparently gas prices is a notoriously uncertain business this however is not stopping hundreds if not thousands of people from doing it on a daily basis with varying degrees of success right now most forecasters seem to expect prices to continue rising because there are simply too many factors working to support them over the longer term predicting oil prices becomes even more challenging right now it is especially challenging because few forecasters appear to have anticipated the current rally and now a flurry of revisions are being made according to a new york times report the revisions are not about average oil prices this year and next however they concern peak oil demand one of the few necessary conditions for every net zero scenario the dominant narrative is that the renewable energy rush will kill off oil demand growth in a few years a decade at most yet this narrative never foresaw the current rally for some reason it never factored in the possibility of a surge in the demand for coal not just in the usual place emerging economies but in countries such as the united states where coal consumption is on track to rise for the first time since 2014 the energy crunch this year disrupted a lot of narratives the short term price outlook is quite fascinating crude oil inventories are being drawn down across the world and opec is sticking to its original decision to add just 400 000 bpd to combined monthly output it is however not doing even that because some of its members are struggling to fill their production quotas due to underinvestment that has been plaguing them for years demand meanwhile is rising with the energy crunch seen adding anywhere between 500 000 bpd and 750 000 bpd to the global daily average this combined with reports that u s crude oil inventories are some 6 percent below the five year average for this time of the year and that oecd inventories are 162 million barrels below the pre covid five year average has been very effective in keeping prices above 80 per barrel and spurring forecasts for three digit prices this is what usually happens when prices are rising but this time the rise was not exactly the usual one part of the cycle of commodity prices this time prices were pushed up by a severe shortage of energy sources fossil fuel energy sources this fact could have spurred a much needed discussion about governments approach to the renewable energy shift but it hasn t not publicly yet it has spurred doubts that the shift would work exactly as governments plan it and price forecasts reflect these doubts some are already talking about 200 brent and not only talking but betting on it these may be crazy bets but they do reflect a heightened uncertainty about the prospects of oil demand much more heightened than usual in reality brent rising to 200 a barrel could only happen in case of a severe reduction in production and that is unlikely to happen as soon as next year if ever but besides the crazy bets there are also other signs that the demise of fossil fuels has been greatly exaggerated fund managers are returning to oil and gas stocks reuters reported this week despite the push into esg investing over the past few years funds are now eager to boost their exposure to oil and gas thanks to this year s stock price rally energy stocks have outperformed the s p 500 substantially they ve booked a 53 8 percent increase over the past month versus 20 2 percent for the broader index now the biggest question is about the longevity of the rally no oil price rally lasts forever but according to the nyt this time there are two quite different explanations that would determine the longer term outlook for oil price movements one is for a short term price boost from pandemic related factors the other is a disparity between emissions ambitions and the capabilities to fulfill these ambitions advertisement some would like to bet on the first explanation that the current oil price rally is little more than a fossil fuel version of the dead cat bounce and fossil fuels are truly on their way out under the advance of wind solar and hydrogen yet the second explanation rings truer in the context of investment decisions a recent unep report warned that oil and gas production plans by the 15 biggest producers are at great odds with the paris agreement emission targets in other words these 15 biggest producers continue to bet on oil and gas despite emission ambitions including their own stated net zero targets oil may not reach 200 next year or ever but it might end up being around and in wide use for longer than many might have hoped and believed by irina slav for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com
washington ap a deal within reach president joe biden and congress s top democrats edged close to sealing their giant domestic legislation though the informal deadline appeared to slip as they worked to scale back the measure and determine how to pay for it negotiations were expected to continue into the weekend all sides indicating just a few issues remained unsettled in the sweeping package of social services and climate change strategies biden met at the white house on friday with house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader chuck schumer joined by video call from from new york trying to shore up details the leaders have been working with party moderates and progressives to shrink the once 3 5 trillion 10 year package to around 2 trillion in child care health care and clean energy programs pelosi said a deal was very possible she told reporters back at the capitol that more than 90 of the package was agreed to the climate change components of the bill are resolved but outstanding questions remained on healthcare provisions vice president kamala harris sounded even more certain on a visit to new york city she said tensions often rise over final details but i am confident frankly not only optimistic but i am confident that we will reach a deal no agreement was announced by friday s self imposed deadline to at least agree on a basic outline biden wants a deal before he leaves next week for global summits in europe pelosi hoped the house could start voting as soon as next week but no schedule was set sticking points appear to include proposed corporate tax hikes to help finance the plan and an effort to lower prescription drug costs that has raised concerns from the pharmaceutical industry democrats are in search of a broad compromise between the party s progressives and moderates on the measure s price tag revenue sources and basic components at the white house the president has rolled up his sleeves and is deep in the details of spreadsheets and numbers press secretary jen psaki said biden was to spend the weekend at his home in wilmington delaware psaki compared the work to starting social security and other major federal programs decades ago then building on them in following years progress here is a historic package that will put in place systems and programs that have never existed in our society before she said noting the effort to expand child care and provide free prekindergarten for all youngsters negotiations are proceeding as biden more forcefully appeals to the american public including in a televised town hall for what he says are the middle class values at the heart of his proposal in a senate that is evenly divided between the democrats and firmly opposed republicans biden can t afford to lose a single vote he is navigating his own party s factions progressives who want major investments in social services and centrists who prefer to see the overall price tag go down when you re president of the united states you have 50 democrats every one is a president every single one so you gotta work things out he said during a cnn town hall thursday still he expressed optimism about the process it s all about compromise compromise has become a dirty word but bipartisanship and compromise still has to be possible he said on one issue the taxes to pay for the package the white house idea seemed to be making headway with a new strategy of abandoning plans for reversing trump era tax cuts in favor of an approach that would involve imposing a 15 corporate minimum tax and also taxing the investment incomes of billionaires to help finance the deal biden has faced resistance from key holdouts in particular sen kyrsten sinema d ariz who has not been on board with her party s plan to undo president donald trump s tax breaks for big corporations and individuals earning more than 400 000 a year the president was unusually forthcoming thursday night about the sticking points in the negotiations with sinema and another democrat conservative sen joe manchin of west virginia while the president said sinema opposed raising a single penny in taxes on the wealthy or corporations a white house official later clarified that the president was referring to raising the top tax rates not the range of tax proposals which sen sinema supports if so that could unlock a key piece of a deal with a better understanding of the revenues available democrats can then develop a topline amount of spending for the package and adjust the duration and sums for various programs accordingly biden said manchin doesn t want to rush the transition to clean energy so quickly because it will result in major job losses in his coal producing state even still biden acknowledged major reductions to his original vision he signaled the final plan would no longer provide free community college but said he hoped to increase pell grants to compensate for the loss of the policy he also said that what had been envisioned as a federally paid months long family leave program would be just four weeks another work in progress the idea of expanding medicare to include dental vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors is a priority for sen bernie sanders the independent of vermont biden said he likes the idea but with manchin and sinema objecting the proposal is a reach instead he said democrats are considering offering seniors an 800 voucher to access dental care as well as another program for hearing aids that sinema may support however the vision care component biden said has been harder to resolve and there is no consensus yet overall biden and his party are trying to shore up middle class households tackle climate change and have the most wealthy americans and corporations pay what he calls their fair share for the nation in the mix are at least 500 billion in clean energy tax credits and other efforts to battle climate change 350 billion for child care subsidies and free prekindergarten an extension of the 300 monthly child tax credit put in place during the covid 19 crisis and money for health care provided through the affordable care act the newly proposed tax provisions though have rankled democrats who have long campaigned on scrapping the republican backed tax cuts that many believe unduly reward the wealthy and cost the government untold sums in lost revenue at a time of gaping income inequality many are furious that perhaps a lone senator could stymie that goal under the changes being floated the 21 corporate rate would not change nor would the top individual rate of 39 6 on those earning 400 000 or 450 000 for couples however the white house is reviving the idea of a corporate minimum tax rate that would hit even companies that say they had no taxable income a frequent target of biden who complains they pay zero in taxes the new tax on the wealthiest individuals would be modeled on legislation from sen ron wyden d ore chairman of the senate finance committee he has proposed taxing stock gains of people with more than 1 billion in assets fewer than 1 000 americans

on the opening day of messari mainnet 2021 new york city s long awaited first crypto conference since the start of covid 19 reports came blazing in via a viral tweet that the united states securities and exchange commission had served a subpoena to an event panelist at the top of an escalator in broad daylight while it s still not entirely clear who was served or why this isn t the first time the sec has encroached upon the crypto industry in full view of the public let s go back a mere two months on july 20 2021 sec chair gary gensler issued his remarks outlining the sec s scope of authority on cryptocurrency it doesn t matter whether it s a stock token a stable value token backed by securities or any other virtual product that provides synthetic exposure to underlying securities these platforms whether in the decentralized or centralized finance space are implicated by the securities laws and must work within our securities regime just like the sec s bold arrival at mainnet gensler s remarks definitely did not arise out of the blue they arose because gensler along with his regulatory entourage finally arrived at the terrifying realization that cryptocurrency s tokenized synthetic stocks are just like stocks but better related powers on don t worry bitcoin s adoption will not be stopped so what are synthetics synthetic assets are artificial renditions of existing assets whose prices are pegged to the value of the assets they represent in real time for instance a synthetic share of renewable energy giant tesla can be purchased and sold at exactly the same price as a real share of tesla at any given moment consider average stock traders for whom profit margins accessibility and personal privacy take precedence to them the apparent realness of tsla acquired from a broker dealer will not hold water next to the cryptoverse s many synthetic renditions which can be acquired at a fraction of the cost at 8 00 pm on a sunday evening what s more it s only a matter of time before traders will be able to stake synthetic tsla in a decentralized finance protocol to earn interest or take out a collateralized loan related crypto synthetic assets explained the role of synthetics decentralized platforms built on blockchain and legacy financial systems are on the verge of clashing in one of the most tumultuous battles in economic history and gensler s remarks merely constitute a shot across the bow make no mistake decentralized finance defi and traditional finance tradfi have already drawn their battle lines they will remind powerful incumbents and new entrants alike that contrary to what contemporary wisdom may suggest systems of exchange imbue assets with value not the converse the ramifications cannot be understated synthetic assets establish a level playing field where centralized and decentralized systems can compete for users and capital a free market for markets typically digital marketplaces support an assortment of assets that compete by being exchanged against one another but when the asset side is fixed that is when identical assets exist across multiple platforms it is the marketplaces that compete for the largest share of each asset s daily trading volume ultimately traders settle the score determining where assets should live and which systems should die on that accord while bitcoin btc competes indirectly with fiat currencies as a unique form of money transacted over a decentralized network it is the array of emergent fiat currency pegged stablecoins that pose the most pernicious and immediate threat to national governments and their directors in central banking unlike bitcoin which often proves too volatile and exotic for outsiders fiat backed stablecoins cut down the complicated tradeoffs and keep the simple stuff around the clock access low cost international transfers kick ass interest rates and 1 1 redemption into fiat related stablecoins present new dilemmas for regulators as mass adoption looms even to skeptics stablecoins drive a strong bargain and the u s congress put forth its own token of acknowledgment with its december 2020 legislative proposal of the stable act which would require stablecoin issuers to acquire the same bank charters as their centralized counterparts at chase wells fargo and so on incumbent institutions have a long history of seeking out acquiring and at times even sabotaging their competition it s not difficult to see where legacy banking s aversion to synthetics comes from as decentralized platforms become more user friendly and tread further into the mainstream significant buy side demand will migrate from legacy platforms and their formerly exclusive assets into digitally native synthetics robinhood saga the remix imagine what might have transpired if robinhood users had access to synthetic shares of gme and amc on jan 28 2021 if even a small minority of the buy side demand for those stocks say 10 migrated from robinhood to mirror protocol s synthetic stocks it would have effectively inflated the supply of shares outstanding and consequently suppressed the share price in turn gamestop s c level executives would have been in for a real tough board call related gamestop inadvertently paves the way for decentralized finance and then consider also the implications of investors staking their synthetic gme and amc in defi protocols to receive mortgage and small business loans at drastically reduced interest rates definitively cutting banks and other incumbents out of the equation such a scenario would behoove gamestop and amc to migrate a fraction of their shares to blockchain based platforms in order to restore robust pricing mechanisms meanwhile investors on the retail side who only seek a superior user experience and the benefits of interoperability with defi protocols would ultimately win something you don t hear too often in modern financial markets from stocks to commodities real estate instruments bonds and beyond the emergence of synthetic assets will disrupt pricing mechanisms catalyze unprecedented turbulence in financial markets and produce unforetold arbitrage opportunities unlike anything the world has ever seen although the consequences of such a dramatic shift are beyond prediction centralized incumbents will not voluntarily cannibalize their business models free markets must be entrusted to select winners the future of synthetics as demand for synthetic assets reaches and exceeds that of their purportedly regulated tradfi counterparts the capitalists and investors of the world will be forced to contemplate what in fact makes an asset real in the first place and will ultimately determine not only the direction of free markets but their very constitution in the heat of an existential crisis financial institutions and governments will undoubtedly get all hands on deck the sec will battle to eradicate synthetic stocks congress will commit to subduing stablecoin issuers from challenging the international banking elite the commodity futures trading commission cftc will step in to tame platforms dealing in derivatives and financial crimes enforcement network fincen will continue to target those aiming to protect user privacy related the new episode of crypto regulation the empire strikes back rough days lie ahead and it is already too late to turn back the hands of innovation compound s ctokens synthetix s synths and mirror protocol s massets have already opened pandora s box while offshift s fully private zk assets are slated to

the former president s contribution to the us public discourse has diminished since january 6 twitter and facebook banned him from their platforms shortly after he lent encouragement to the angry mob that stormed the us capitol in an attempt to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election now he is aiming to launch his own platform named truth social to stand up to the tyranny of big tech we live in a world where the taliban has a huge presence on twitter yet your favourite american president has been silenced trump wrote in a statement i am excited to send out my first truth on truth social very soon the transaction that was announced on wednesday will combine two entities that at present are little more than corporate shells digital world completed an initial public offering last month it raised us293 million 392 6 million mostly from hedge funds that specialise in providing initial financing to special purpose acquisition companies these vehicles typically have no operations and only skeletal management teams and use the money they raise to go hunting for acquisition deals advertisement the merger with trump media was agreed with impressive speed under the securities rules that govern spacs orléans e braganza s company was required to certify that it did not have an acquisition target in mind at the time of its ipo on september 8 only six weeks later digital world announced a deal to put its cash reserve at the disposal of trump s new venture which aims to create the first major rival to big tech by countering liberal bias and creating a non cancellable global community donald trump s contribution to the us public discourse has diminished since january 6 ap truth is not yet available for download a page on apple s app store promises that it will include standard features of social media apps such as notifications profile pictures and a message feed a presentation posted on the company s website envisages an inclusive big tent approach where all are welcome but also pledges to a conservative media universe even the former president s involvement in an executive capacity may not be a given a presentation published on the company s website mentions trump s name at least a dozen times but also includes a significant disclaimer all personnel listed in the deck may change the presentation states there is no guarantee whatsoever that employment agreement will be finalised regardless of how the venture takes shape the hedge funds that provided digital world s cash stand to make a risk free return investors in spac ipos have a right to redeem their shares at a premium rather than going along with any deal advertisement some of digital world s early backers have done far better than that by selling into the runaway rally that followed the announcement of the trump deal trading was so brisk on thursday that a volume of shares equivalent to the company s entire share capital changed hands multiple times according to data from s p global market intelligence at values that reached as high as 4 5 times the price in last month s ipo among the potential biggest winners for those who bought in at us94 20 the price at friday s close the chance of making a profit depends largely on trump s ability to turn initial financing of a few hundred million dollars into a social media enterprise commanding a valuation in the billions if trump succeeds one of the biggest winners will be patrick orlando a florida based financial executive whose little known firm arc global investments ii llc put up us25 000 to buy a stake in the blank cheque company orlando owns about 17 8 per cent of digital world according to a september 8 regulatory filing a stake that was worth more than us600 million on friday digital world portrays orlando as a seasoned financial executive whose 25 year career covers all aspects related to special purpose acquisition corporations securities filings list him as having senior roles at three other blank cheque vehicles including yunhong international a wuhan china based shell company initially set up by local businessman yubao li none of those companies has yet completed an acquisition before turning to spacs orlando served as chief technical officer at pure biofuels corporation whose turbulent existence illustrates the risks of speculative sharemarket ventures advertisement incorporated in 2003 pure biofuels raised millions from investors to finance the construction of a biodiesel processing plant in lima peru the company had not generated any significant revenue by the time orlando left in 2011 and was later dissolved orlando returned to the us and began working for bt capital markets a boutique miami investment bank where according to court filings he worked on a 115 million deal to finance a fleet of tugboats purchased by venezuela s state owned oil company petróleos de venezuela gets worse every day during the decade that preceded his deal with trump orlando sometimes fought legal battles against business associates one lawsuit involved a tussle over the ownership of a miami condominium unit that orlando maintained had been transferred to him by a former colleague at pure biofuels in partial repayment of a loan another took aim at a colleague at a different company who had allegedly failed to repay money he owed the dispute apparently arose because of difficulties in arranging the sale of what is described in court filings as a 50m honduras debt held by a swiss banking institution advertisement in trouble with bankers wife family paying bills late and gets worse every day orlando wrote in a 2012 email that was reproduced in court filings sometimes don t pick up when my dad calls to avoid talking out of sheer embarrassment orlando went on the last 3 months i barely answer if peru or unknown number orlando did not respond to a request for comment it is unclear how orlando recruited a self described brazilian prince to serve as the financial brains of his new technology venture or how the pair convinced trump to sign on to the most significant business deal of his post presidency but orléans e braganza who was an investment banker at jpmorgan chase and lazard frères before he took up politics has long expressed his admiration for people in trump s inner circle eleven days after last year s us presidential election orléans braganza joined the chorus of right wing voices cheering as trump s personal lawyer asserted baselessly that irregularities with electronic voting machines had swung the result in favour of joe biden advertisement rudy giuliani was a heroic lawyer who confronted the mafia of his time orléans e braganza wrote on twitter in portuguese now he is placing smartmatic on public trial on thursday a day after trump s spac deal was

there s been a lot of cultural gab lately about dave chappelle s netflix special in which the comedian upbraids the transgender community admonishing them to get a sense of humor and stop lumping their struggle in with the challenges faced by black people first some conservatives lauded the streamer for not backing down in the face of a tedious social media firestorm that followed the special s premiere then they backed down advertisement there s another recent netflix offering a miniseries that company execs will never have to justify or step back from far from tweaking the rabid left maid based on stephanie land s memoir maid hard work low pay and a mother s will to survive hits all the right notes from the standpoint of artistic creation and the progressive mentality moreover it is a perfect example of the kind of social justice biasing that hollywood and the entertainment industry at large have made their stock and trade especially since the 1960s but most pointedly in the past quarter century we take you now to a recreation of the acquisitions meeting at which maid was first pitched you want sausage you got sausage three creative executive buyers a white male we ll call the lead buyer a female and a black male sit in the room ready to hear from their team the lead buyer speaks up okay people what have you got for us today we ve gotten a first look at a treatment about fbi agent peter strzok called a matter of honor says one team member it looks pretty good there is some murmuring among the executive buyers the female executive pipes up that s going to be a hard pass we just did comey and however heroic strzok may be we don t want to roil the waters in front of the midterms another pitcher speaks up i m looking at an interesting property that centers on a group of bodybuilders in saudi arabia who idolize pumping iron era arnold schwarzenegger it s kind of a time warp deal these guys could care less about the gubernatorial term the maid service scandal none of that instead they see bodybuilding as a claim to fame and just want to develop muscles as arnold did advertisement the black executive asks wouldn t it be difficult to work in a gay angle given the location the pitcher pauses to consider it would be tricky but there might be a way to insert it sideways without actually saying it i m going to say no says the lead buyer speaking of maids says another team member i think this book by stephanie land might be worth considering it s the redemptive story of a single mom s journey out of an abusive family legacy talk to me says the lead buyer for starters all the white guys in the story are bad people the father of the child in play is a troubled alcoholic prone to violent outbursts while he never hits the female protagonist he does put his fist through the wall of their mobile home you know it s only a matter of time go on says the female executive it comes out during the story that the protag s father battered her mother the mother herself is a certifiably damaged hippie damaged of course by the white husband who beat her the protag s mother s current boyfriend also white is an unscrupulous cad with a gambling addiction who cheats the unbalanced mother out of her home there s only one good male character in the story a person of color of course he is good in the sense that he offers to help the protag but bad in the sense that he is attracted to her which infers there will be strings attached to the help at her nadir the protag rejects him and instead returns to the bed of her abuser advertisement when the executives offer no comment the pitcher knows they re listening we ve got three sympathetic latina characters a crusty housecleaning service operator with a heart of gold a woman the protag meets at a shelter for battered women who through emotional circumstances beyond her control ends up returning to the bastard who abused her and finally a pregnant single mother of three who is an unstable hoarder themes of mentally unbalanced women run through the entire story the subtext being that men made these women the psychiatrically tenuous people they are how about the representation of black americans in this story asks the netflix lead buyer they re all exemplary i would describe the woman who manages the women s shelter as a reincarnation of representative maxine waters as an angel a salutary thread is similarly developed when a wealthy black woman who the protag cleans house for is first painted as a dismissive bit but turns out to have the proverbial heart of gold she and the protag become bosom buddies as the story progresses how does the story flesh out in terms of the journey asks the black creative executive in her quest to escape her situation our protag faces a labyrinth of governmental agencies we ve got social workers as peripheral characters making obligatory comments about the staggering level of governmental red tape and yet presented as ultimately there to help advertisement gay folks yes a financially advantaged lesbian couple rides to the rescue when the protag and her daughter need a place to live and only presents her with walking papers when the child s father shows up drunk and disorderly he breaks a costly vase at a house party you mention several financially stable characters says the female executive yes all of them politically liberal where is the story set asks the lead decisionmaker washington state the puget sound region transgenderism we could not identify an example of that in the book any legal angles throughout the story when the emotionally abusive husband won t roll over on custody a ball breaking female attorney comes on board pro bono with a strategy for destroying him he rolls talk about our protagonist says the female executive well she s bright well mannered ethical attractive a wonderful mother to her little girl and she s also the best house cleaner in the bunch would such a woman even have to resort to working for a maid service that s the sticky widget which may require some suspension of disbelief does she possess any other overarching character traits yes a finely honed sense of entitlement she musters through scene after scene surprised and subtly indignant at the amount of s t she has to go through how many forms she has to fill out to get help from various agencies advertisement happy ending a lovely denouement the sense millennials have of being the center of the universe is strongly evoked in the final scene our protag alex showing promise as a writer receives a scholarship to the university of montana at missoula you may or may not know that there is a huge m on sentinel mountain which overlooks the campus and the city alex plans to tell her daughter maddy that the m stands for wait for it maddy nice says the lead buyer the female exec has a final question would you say that there are any characters in this story that could be described as conservative or republican there s a long pause no not at all another pause well says maid s pitcher reflectively i guess some conservatives might say that yes there are conservatives and republicans in the story but you never see them the pitcher raises his arms making the air quote gesture the quiet law abiding self sufficient and patriotic folks living in the burbs and on the rural eastern side of washington state areas that vote overwhelmingly republican which supported and continue to support donald trump the people who elect politicians who fight to limit high taxation rates that make all of the programs depicted in the series possible the people who contribute to the woes of the sympathetic characters in the story also some conservatives and possibly even some regular people may describe alex as a woman who makes horrible decisions and often contributes to her own negative outcomes advertisement silence falls over the meeting room then the lead buyer says okay very good we ll get back to you on this but i think it s safe to say we re interested

off a 300 a week federal supplement for unemployed americans many people they argued would then come off the sidelines and take the millions of jobs that employers were desperate to fill yet three months after half the states began ending that federal payment there s been no significant influx of job seekers in states that cut off the 300 check the workforce the number of people who either have a job or are looking for one has risen no more than it has in the states that maintained the payment that federal aid along with two jobless aid programs that served gig workers and the long term unemployed ended nationally sept 6 yet america s overall workforce actually shrank that month policymakers were pinning too many hopes on ending unemployment insurance as a labor market boost said fiona greig managing director of the jpmorgan chase institute which used jpmorgan bank account data to study the issue the work disincentive effects were clearly small labor shortages have persisted longer than many economists expected deepening a mystery at the heart of the job market companies are eager to add workers and have posted a near record number of available jobs unemployment remains elevated the economy still has 5 million fewer jobs than it did before the pandemic yet job growth slowed in august and september an analysis of state by state data by the associated press found that workforces in the 25 states that maintained the 300 payment actually grew slightly more from may through september according to data released friday than they did in the 25 states that cut off the payment early most of them in june the 300 a week federal check on top of regular state jobless aid meant that many of the unemployed received more in benefits than they earned at their old jobs curtis mccray a mississippi department of corrections recruiter left points out a positive testimonial to a job applicant during the lee county area job fair in tupelo miss oct 12 employers representing a variety of manufacturing production service industry medical and clerical companies attended the daylong affair with an eye towards recruitment hiring training and retention photo rogelio v solis associated press an earlier study by arindrajit dube an economist at university of massachusetts amherst and several colleagues found that the states that cut off the 300 federal payment saw a small increase in the number of unemployed taking jobs but it also found that it didn t draw more people off the sidelines to look for work economists point to a range of factors that are likely keeping millions of former recipients of federal jobless aid from returning to the workforce many americans in public facing jobs still fear contracting covid 19 for example some families lack child care other people like rachel montgomery of anderson indiana have grown to cherish the opportunity to spend more time with their families and feel they can get by financially at least for now montgomery a 37 year old mother said she has become much pickier about where she s willing to work after having lost a catering job last year losing the 300 a week federal payment hasn t changed her mind she ll receive her regular state jobless aid for a few more weeks once you ve stayed home with your kids and family like this who wants to physically have to go back to work she said as i m looking and looking i ve told myself that i m not going to sacrifice pay or flexibility working remotely when i know i m qualified to do certain things but what that also means is that it s taking longer to find those kinds of jobs indeed the pandemic appears to have caused a re evaluation of priorities with some people deciding to spend more time with family and others insistent on working remotely or gaining more flexible hours some former recipients especially older more affluent ones have decided to retire earlier than they had planned with americans overall home values and stock portfolios having surged since the pandemic struck fed officials estimate that up to 2 million more people have retired since then than otherwise would have and after having received three stimulus checks in 18 months plus federal jobless aid in some cases most households have larger cash cushions than they did before the pandemic greig and her colleagues at jpmorgan found in a study that the median bank balance for the poorest one quarter of households has jumped 70 since covid hit a result is that some people are taking time to consider their options before rushing back into the job market graham berryman a 44 year old resident of springfield missouri has been living off savings since missouri cut off the 300 a week federal jobless payment in june he has had temporary work reviewing documents for law firms in the past but he hasn t found anything permanent since august 2020 i m not lazy berryman said i am unemployed that does not mean i m lazy just because someone cannot find suitable work in their profession doesn t mean they re trash to be thrown away likewise some couples have decided that they can get by with only one income rather than two at least temporarily sarah hamby of kokomo indiana lost her 300 a week federal payment this summer after gov eric holcomb a republican ended that benefit early hamby s husband who is 65 has kept his job

she said and to be honest i don t want to go work at a computer in an office like what a lot of us are being pushed to do so now i m stuck between doing some line of work that pays too little for what

that many parents mostly mothers are still unable to manage their child care duties to return to work staffing at child care centers has fallen reducing the care that is available and while schools have reopened for in person learning frequent closings because of covid outbreaks have been disruptive for some working parents exacerbating the labor shortfall a record number of people quit their jobs in august in some cases spurred by the prospect of higher pay elsewhere in missouri a group of businesses still frustrated by labor shortages more than three months after the state cut off the 300 a week federal jobless checks paid for billboards in springfield that said get off your butt and get to work the state has seen no growth in its workforce since ending emergency benefits we don t know where people are said brad parke general manager of greek corner screen printing and embroidery who helped pay for the billboards obviously they re not at work apparently they re at home richard von glahn policy director for missouri jobs with justice an advocacy group suggested that many people on the sidelines of the job market want more benefits or the flexibility to care for children people don t want to go back to the pre pandemic job market von glahn said employers have a role in creating a work environment and offering a package that provides workers the security they need in wyoming fewer people are in the workforce now than when the state cut off all emergency jobless aid fear of contracting covid 19 likely discouraged some people from seeking jobs wenlin liu chief economist at the state economic analysis division said last week wyoming has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country he noted and has been a covid 19 hotspot since late summer the surge in infections liu said may be causing some parents to keep their children home state rep landon brown a republican defended the cutoff of federal unemployment aid wyoming brown said is not interested in continuing to allow the federal government to keep people away from jobs paying them as much to stay home in some cases as to go and get a job mississippi ended all emergency jobless aid on june 12 yet it had fewer people working in august than in may in tupelo last week a job fair attracted 60 companies including a recruiter from vt halter marine a shipbuilder located 300 miles south about 150

distributes unemployment benefits the agency has received calls of desperation todd said from businesses needing to recruit workers during the pandemic we re in a different point in time than we have been in a very long time todd said the job seeker is truly in the driver s seat right now
streetwise giving thanks in 2017 by frank dunnigan november 2017 as we gather in the month of november to give thanks this column s usual remembrances of jellied vs whole cranberry sauce mashed potatoes with or without lumps and the merits horrors of mincemeat pie will be put aside temporarily instead it is time to reflect on how thankful all of us should be for those individuals who have occupied special places in our lives but who have now left us among my own classmates from st cecilia school st ignatius and university of san francisco several have passed on this past year out of hundreds of former co workers at least one familiar name appears among the chronicle s obituaries every week or so many of my long time parkside and sunset district neighbors have also departed san francisco for the very last time recently with the loss of each one i am reminded of the many shared moments that we enjoyed together as our paths crossed in this life one of those people in particular whose passing on father s day this past june left a considerable void in the lives of many of us is paul rosenberg born to a richmond district couple in 1945 just a week after ve day paul was a true san franciscan with deep roots his parents were also san francisco natives and one set of his grandparents held their wedding ceremony at the old temple beth israel on geary near fillmore street well over 100 years ago paul spent his entire life in the richmond district eventually returning to the home that he once shared with his parents as his family expanded to include his beloved wife sherrie and their son coleman three generations of his family all attended the same neighborhood elementary school and over the years three generations of rosenbergs have been active members of various san francisco labor unions a precocious only child paul graduated from lafayette school presidio junior high and lowell high school with many of his cousins as fellow lowell alums at this point he would likely interrupt me to chime in with three and a half years of old lowell at hayes and masonic and final semester at new lowell on eucalyptus which he deliberately pronounced you cal ih pee tus drive from the fall of 1962 until mid year graduation on january 29th of 1963 paul was a faithful attendee at the annual meal hosted by that first graduating class from new lowell on the exact date of their graduation the group also met on several other occasions each year from an early age paul took an interest in state and local politics often memorizing the names of candidates and ballot propositions from the daily newspaper he also studied the winners and the runners up along with dates and offices held by previously elected officials as well as the outcomes of hundreds of old propositions and ballot measures most of this encyclopedic knowledge was contained in his vast mental storehouse but he admitted to having extensive paper and photo files too continuing in his own words i went back east to college cal berkeley it came as no surprise to anyone who knew him that his 1967 bachelor s degree was in bio statistics a rare and difficult field in which he achieved great success while many of the rest of us ended up pursuing far less arduous courses of study as liberal arts majors following college graduation paul began his career as a statistician with university of california berkeley he then moved to a new position in the health industry for nearly a decade before joining the city county of san francisco human services agency in 1976 there he worked for the next 33 years at a series of increasingly responsible assignments managing computer systems that controlled the income and daily well being of tens of thousands of local residents at his retirement ceremony nearly a decade ago lavish praise was made for his technical talents along with his fairness and just treatment of co workers and members of the public who depended upon his department s work paul was nearly 40 years old when he and sherrie katz were married in 1984 when friends questioned him about why he waited so long his answer was simple it s an important life step and you have only one chance to get it right to everyone who saw the couple together it was clear that both of them made excellent choices in selecting one another sherrie recently pointed out an amazing piece of trivia when paul traveled to my family s home in michigan for our engagement party in 1984 it was literally his very first visit to a place outside the pacific time zone he hated to travel saying that he did not need to go anywhere else because he was completely happy living in san francisco five years later their son coleman was born just one week prior to the loma prieta earthquake thus rounding out the family paul and sherrie were two only children who had an only child and the three of them formed a warm and loving family unit just like his late father paul was an avid local tour guide for visiting family and friends with a detailed knowledge of all things san francisco my own introduction to paul came 10 years ago at a wnp evening get together at the cliff house when i approached him for some background on a man named sullivan who once served on the board of supervisors paul s quick response convinced me that he was the master of this subject which one j joseph james j john j or john t he was certainly the only person in the world who could name every single member of the san francisco board of supervisors since 1850 along with the years that they served and he could tell stories about many of them in fact when a city run website was established several years ago paul was astounded to find that it included a grossly inaccurate listing of previous board members and that some supervisors of recent vintage including lieutenant governor gavin newsom had not been included at all he quickly provided city hall with a corrected listing of all previous supervisors and their terms in office going back more than 160 years even after taking this extraordinarily generous step paul shook his head in silent disbelief when a city hall employee stated publicly that the board s 6 to 5 female majority that was seated in january 2017 was a first for san francisco he quickly reminded the clerk of the board that women had held an identical majority more than 35 years earlier from 1981 85 ella hill hutch succeeded by willie b kennedy wendy nelder louise renne carol ruth silver nancy walker and doris ward paul then noted that there was an even larger 7 to 4 female majority serving from 1993 97 roberta achtenberg succeeded by susan leal angela alioto sue bierman annemarie conroy succeeded by mabel teng barbara kaufman willie b kennedy succeeded by leslie katz and carole migden paul s favorite supervisor was almost certainly the late james b mcsheehy 1874 1944 who served on the board from 1918 1942 among mcsheehy s numerous mangled quotations paul and also the late herb caen loved to cite these classics this building has all the earmarks of an eyesore the handwriting on the wall is just as clear as a bell you can t straddle the fence and still keep your ear to the ground this comes with a few cents of being a vast and fabulous sum let us take the bull by the tail and look the matter squarely in the face this is crouched in language which is perfectly oblivious several years ago when members of a lunch group were lamenting the 1963 closure and subsequent demolition of market street s fox theatre paul announced you can place the blame on those mean old grown ups who were living and voting in san francisco back then and he then related the story behind proposition i eye on the november 1961 ballot that measure called for the city county of san francisco to buy the fox and to operate it as a performing arts center paul explained that passage required only a simple majority of the votes cast 50 plus one vote in order to save the classic theater astoundingly given the public lamentations both then and now about the loss of this architectural treasure the measure was rejected with nearly a 60 no vote sadly the steel ball and bulldozers were on the scene just 18 months later among paul s many hobbies he was deeply devoted to all things related to muni which was his preferred mode of daily transportation as an historian he could look at a vintage photo of rolling stock and immediately name the model route number and street location of the image he was also often able to identify the year based on the political ads displayed on the side of the vehicle and someone once joked that given a few minutes he could probably name the operator as well in 1977 paul was among a small group of rail fans and history enthusiasts who helped found the non profit market street railway serving as president and remaining active in its operations for decades often wearing the group s distinctive logo in the lapel of his coat these and other historical interests led to paul s involvement as a founding member of the san francisco history association in 1982 that group began after several memorabilia collectors met at the first san francisco fair at the moscone center while exhibiting their collections these individuals began discussing their shared interest in local history they decided to form a group the san francisco history collectors association to exchange stories and information about historical artifacts and as the group grew the word collectors was dropped from the name paul was a regular attendee and also a speaker at many of the group s monthly meetings and in 2013 he received the organization s prestigious dr albert shumate memorial award in october of 2017 that group announced the formation of the paul rosenberg legacy fund paul was naturally drawn to western neighborhoods project soon after its founding in 1999 he was an early member of the group s board of directors and continued to serve on its advisory board over the years he researched and wrote about topics ranging from a mysterious richmond district bombing in 1927 to the so called fake rocks on point lobos avenue opposite the cliff house to paved over forgotten streetcar tracks at 22nd avenue and balboa in addition he was an invaluable resource and fact checker extraordinaire for many of the rest of us involved in wnp he was a popular guest on the group s podcast participated in a number of history minute videos assisted as a regular commentator on walking tours provided much needed staffing at public events and was a dedicated volunteer who helped identify thousands of vintage images on the opensfhistory site for the enjoyment of others in 2008 paul and his long time friend noah griffin the two were only a few months apart in age and grew up near one another on 40th and 41st avenues in the richmond district teamed up as co masters of ceremony at an early richmond history day event the gathering which supported local libraries also served to remind residents of the long and varied history of an important san francisco neighborhood everything paul was interested in he was interested in passionately he was a true renaissance man active in many circles a generous benefactor of numerous causes and great friend to many in yiddish he might be called a mensch which translates to a person of honor and integrity we are fortunate to have passed this way together with him something for which we can all be grateful as we sit down around the thanksgiving table with family and friends this november not surprisingly paul s life accomplishments are far too numerous to be contained in a single column so tune in next month for the conclusion remembering a life well lived contribute your own stories

questions over jpmorgan chase s policies and practices towards the firearms industry led to the postponement and potential cancellation of more than 800 million in bonds in louisiana on thursday on the heels of the state s attorney general asking the financial giant s ceo to provide some clarity about where the bank stands advertisement jamie dimon told the bond commission that the bank had no anti gun policies or practices even though the ceo admitted in congressional testimony earlier this year that jpmorgan chase does not do business with the makers of modern sporting rifles or as dimon himself put it when he was testifying before a congressional committee back in may of this year we do not finance the manufacture of military style weapons for civilian use sounds like an anti gun policy to me and it appears the louisiana bond commission agrees commission chair john schroder who is also the state treasurer opened the nearly three hour long meeting by striking two gas and fuels tax bond items from the 51 item agenda starting off with items 47 and 48 i m removing them from the agenda today reason being i was made aware of this issue late tuesday and tuesday was the day we actually selected the bank that would be doing this refinancing schroder said without naming jpmorgan chase and then i was made aware of some issues that i have some concerns with item 47 on the commission s agenda pertained to the fixed rate financing of 700 million in gasoline and fuels tax revenue refunding bonds item 48 was for 121 million in variable rate refinancing of gasoline and fuels tax second lien revenue refunding bonds i notified the bank last night at 10 30 p m so we will regroup schroder said we will have to look at our criteria and see what we need to do because quite frankly for those who don t know what i m talking about we were issuing a refinance on 700 million of gas and fuels we re going to pull that and we re going to give it a month and go back and look at our criteria and make sure we re treating everyone equal because right now we don t know what that is advertisement the language used was vague enough that if you didn t have any background information you d have no idea what a big deal this is if this deal gets scuttled it won t spell the end of jpmorgan chase but it does shut off another bond market for the financial giant which is already barred from bidding on any government bonds in the state of texas because of its law declaring that banks competing for those bonds must not discriminate against the likes of the firearms industry there s a real danger for jpmorgan chase bank of america citigroup and others that have adopted policies barring the firearms industry from their services that other states are going to start following the lead of places like texas and louisiana so far the financial industry hasn t blinked but we re still in the embryonic stages of the legislative pushback against their anti gun policies 800 million here 800 million there and pretty soon you re talking about real money even for a firm as large as jpmorgan chase there are only a handful of states with laws like texas on the books at the moment but this is one of those ideas that could quickly catch on in red states across the country if you re a conservative pro second amendment lawmaker in a state that s already passed constitutional carry for instance and you re looking for a good pro gun issue to turn into a bill you could do a lot worse than firing monetary shots across the bow of anti gun banking battleships until they provide fair access to financial services

the toxic policy twins this october 20 headline in the new york times is worth a ponder where are the workers how can so many americans afford not to work and will it last good questions as we all can see the economy is running short of workers in high visibility sectors and it s an open question as to whether this shortage is a short term phenomenon or a long term one interestingly the biden administration seems to want it to be the latter more on that in a bit in the meantime the times has its explanation for voluntary unemployment americans are flush with cash that is of course an exaggeration most americans are nowhere close to full up money wise yet still the natural prosperity of the u s economy including the boom brought on by donald trump s 2017 tax cut has been further goosed by covid related stimulus including trillions in direct federal expenditures as well as ultra low interest rates and accelerated loans and grants in the words of the times thanks to pandemic stimulus programs during both the trump and biden administrations many families have received multiple checks from the federal government over the past 18 months those stimulus programs also increased the size of unemployment benefits over the same period home values and stock prices have risen too as a result many households have more of a financial cushion than they used to we can look back and say that some of this spending was necessary after all the economy suffered a ccp virus related heart attack in early 2020 and so it was a good idea for the government to apply electrical cardioversion money defibrillators and to set in motion counter cyclical spending moreover on the matter of voluntary unemployment we can further say that not every job is a good job to put the point another way bad jobs usually become good jobs when they pay more so in that sense if workers are scarce relative to the number of available job openings some 10 million according to the labor department that s good because the competition for workers will bid up wages yet we should also beware of these two economic dangers first over spending today the federal government is spending too much overheating the economy and igniting inflation second over regulation the feds and some state and local governments are causing supply problems and have been for a long time the latest and most obvious example of a regulatory obstacle is the vaccine mandates that inhibit businesses and workers from normal functionality this toxic twinning of red ink and red tape is a formula for inflationary stagnation or as it was called in the 1970s stagflation as it happens i have written much about the ominous parallels between the economy of the 2020s and that of the 1970s including here here and here indeed the historical record tells us that if the 70s 20s parallelism is allowed to continue the voluntary unemployment we see today will be joined by something much worse tomorrow involuntary unemployment joe biden born in 1942 ought to remember the 1970s and yet instead of learning from the past with an eye toward avoiding pitfalls biden seems happy to be reliving it the toxic policy triplets even more remarkably the 46th president seems eager to revive yet another mistake from the past namely bidding potentially productive americans out of the workforce by putting them on the government dole such runaway welfarism was a policy mistake of the 1960s in that decade president lyndon johnson s great society agenda caused welfare spending as a percentage of the economy to double one bad result of the great society was a sharp increase in the federal deficit and yet we also saw the worsening of problems vastly more dangerous a worsening of human dependence of cultural degradation and of social breakdown yes it was the height of perversity the federal government was spending billions to actively make societal problems even more problematic a brave examination of this tangle of pathologies simultaneously soaring rates of unwed births dependence drug use and criminality can be be found in journalist ken auletta s 1983 book the underclass which helped to convince even liberals that we needed a change in welfare policy finally in the late 1980s a great republican governor tommy thompson of wisconsin aided by his intrepid social services chief jason turner began chipping away at the welfare problem in the following decade wisconsin s reform movement went nationwide in 1996 the republican led 104th congress prodded president bill clinton into signing a landmark federal welfare reform bill the results of this reform were dramatic over the next quarter century the number of people on welfare first called aid to families with dependent children and now temporary assistance to needy families fell from 12 6 million in 1996 to 2 9 million in 2020 to be sure the problem of costly welfare dependence has hardly gone away as former texas senator phil gramm wrote recently in the wall street journal since the war on poverty started in 1965 the labor force participation rate of bottom quintile earners who now receive more than 90 of their 50 000 average income from government transfer payments has fallen from almost 70 to 36 in other words uncle sugar is still ladling out plenty of sweets such that those who don t wish to work can still enjoy material conditions that most of the world would envy most people around the world would not however envy the actual lifestyle of the american underclass as the recent spike in crime tells us the same problems of welfare induced underclass pathology that auletta chronicled are still with us today to be sure the problem is smaller than it was three for four decades ago and yet it is larger than it was even just a few years ago yet all the while the left has been looking for an opportunity to undo any and all welfare reform in 2021 with the beginning of the biden presidency progressives saw their window of opportunity that aperture was the 3 5 trillion build back better bbb also known as the reconciliation bill now being debated in congress one of the most controversial elements of bbb is what democrats call a childcare tax credit ctc for their part republicans call ctc a trojan horse designed to undo welfare reform by stealth as part of their political pitch democrats typically spin ctc as a tax cut even though more than three fourths of the benefits will go to families who already pay no taxes which is to say ctc is a grant moreover since there s no work requirement or even an education requirement ctc is really a no strings attached handout which is to say it s a plan for a return to the open ended era of pre 1996 welfare spending and all the attendant troubles the current ctc proposal calls for families to receive 3 600 annually for each child under age six and 3 000 for each child aged six to 18 with a total cost over ten years of 550 billion robert rector and jamie bryan hall of the heritage foundation argue that the purported tax relief of ctc is really a bait and switch contrary to the administration s rhetoric the primary focus and sole permanent feature of the child allowance policy would not be tax relief but the elimination of all work requirements and work incentives from the current child credit program in pursuing this change the administration explicitly seeks to overturn the foundations of welfare reform established during the clinton presidency we can add that work requirements are about much more than just getting people into jobs to help the economy the far greater importance of work requirements is the signal that they send to the individual one part of the message is that work is good because work organizes one s personal life thereby preventing the decadence of indolence and a second part is that work is good because it makes every worker a contributing as well as a benefiting member of the commonwealth that s the key to a genuinely great society where every able bodied citizen is a free and independent stakeholder obviously many progressives don t agree with any of this thinking about the value of work and at least for now they are in charge of the national agenda in fact as rector further explains the biden plan abandons the link between work and welfare established by welfare reform in the 1990s and re establishes the principle of unconditional entitlement to taxpayer funded benefits rector adds a better policy would be to strengthen work obligations for able bodied recipients in such programs as temporary assistance to needy families the earned income tax credit subsidized housing and food stamps interestingly most americans seem to agree with this conservative vision to be sure they might have trouble picking their way through the spun up phraseology of the biden plan and yet once the real issues upholding personal responsibility and vindicating the work ethic are explained to them they end up in agreement with the heritage foundation experts in supporting work not welfare the gut wisdom of ordinary people is further attested by survey researcher rich thau who has conducted focus groups on ctc he quoted one young woman in texas saying the child tax credit specifically is just going to promote more people to stay at home and not go to work because they re getting this free money handed to them thau added this point reminiscent of 1980s complaints about welfare was widely shared among these swing voters as we can recall concerns about welfare and the resulting underclass hit a peak in the 80s thereby causing political leaders to finally fix the policy mistakes of decades prior today biden has a problem his overall bbb has been so battered by scrutiny that it s looking more like a bane not a boon to democrats and ctc is a particular bone of vulnerability and while most congressional democrats are still on board with bbb albeit with greater unease one important democrat is definitely not on the back to the bad old days train that would be sen joe manchin of west virginia who said in september of ctc there s no work requirements whatsoever there s no education requirements whatsoever for better skill sets don t you think if we re going to help the children that the people should make some effort as of now we don t know what will happen with ctc just as we don t know the fate of the bbb we only know this much joe biden has revived two of the worst ideas of the 1970s inflationary over spending and contractionary over regulation and added a third bad idea from the 1960s destructive welfarism and so the toxic policy twins have now become toxic policy triplets

deal on biden s 2t plan edges closer harris is confident washington ap a deal within reach president joe biden and congress top democrats edged close to sealing their giant domestic legislation though the informal deadline appeared to slip as they worked to scale back the measure and determine how to pay for it negotiations were expected to continue into the weekend all sides indicating just a few issues remained unsettled in the sweeping package of social services and climate change strategies biden met at the white house on friday with house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader chuck schumer joined by video call from from new york trying to shore up details the leaders have been working with party moderates and progressives to shrink the once 3 5 trillion 10 year package to around 2 trillion in child care health care and clean energy programs pelosi said a deal was very possible she told reporters back at the capitol that more than 90 of the package was agreed to the climate change components of the bill are resolved but outstanding questions remained on health care provisions vice president kamala harris sounded even more certain on a visit to new york city she said tensions often rise over final details but i am confident frankly not only optimistic but i am confident that we will reach a deal no agreement was announced by friday s self imposed deadline to at least agree on a basic outline biden wants a deal before he leaves next week for global summits in europe pelosi hoped the house could start voting as soon as next week but no schedule was set sticking points appear to include proposed corporate tax hikes to help finance the plan and an effort to lower prescription drug costs that has raised concerns from the pharmaceutical industry democrats are in search of a broad compromise between the party s progressives and moderates on the measure s price tag revenue sources and basic components at the white house the president has rolled up his sleeves and is deep in the details of spreadsheets and numbers press secretary jen psaki said biden was to spend the weekend at his home in wilmington delaware psaki compared the work to starting social security and other major federal programs decades ago then building on them in following years progress here is a historic package that will put in place systems and programs that have never existed in our society before she said noting the effort to expand child care and provide free prekindergarten for all youngsters negotiations are proceeding as biden more forcefully appeals to the american public including in a televised town hall for what he says are the middle class values at the heart of his proposal in a senate that is evenly divided between the democrats and firmly opposed republicans biden can t afford to lose a single vote he is navigating his own party s factions progressives who want major investments in social services and centrists who prefer to see the overall price tag go down when you re president of the united states you have 50 democrats every one is a president every single one so you gotta work things out he said during a cnn town hall thursday still he expressed optimism about the process it s all about compromise compromise has become a dirty word but bipartisanship and compromise still has to be possible he said on one issue the taxes to pay for the package the white house idea seemed to be making headway with a new strategy of abandoning plans for reversing trump era tax cuts in favor of an approach that would involve imposing a 15 corporate minimum tax and also taxing the investment incomes of billionaires to help finance the deal biden has faced resistance from key holdouts in particular sen kyrsten sinema d ariz who has not been on board with her party s plan to undo president donald trump s tax breaks for big corporations and individuals earning more than 400 000 a year the president was unusually forthcoming thursday night about the sticking points in the negotiations with sinema and another democrat conservative sen joe manchin of west virginia while the president said sinema opposed raising a single penny in taxes on the wealthy or corporations a white house official later clarified that the president was referring to raising the top tax rates not the range of tax proposals which sen sinema supports if so that could unlock a key piece of a deal with a better understanding of the revenues available democrats can then develop a topline amount of spending for the package and adjust the duration and sums for various programs accordingly biden said manchin doesn t want to rush the transition to clean energy so quickly it will result in major job losses in his coal producing state even still biden acknowledged major reductions to his original vision he signaled the final plan would no longer provide free community college but said he hoped to increase pell grants to compensate for the loss of the policy he also said that what had been envisioned as a federally paid months long family leave program would be just four weeks another work in progress the idea of expanding medicare to include dental vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors is a priority for sen bernie sanders the independent of vermont biden said he likes the idea but with manchin and sinema

it was new year s eve devin lyall sat in the back bedroom of her drug dealer s house her thin fingers fumbled with the syringe her fingers weren t the only frail thing about her in the past few months she had lost about 40 pounds leaving her practically skin and bones she was using opana a strong narcotic melting the small circular pills into a liquid that she could inject as the dregs of 2012 trickled into the new year lyall didn t have much hope it was as if her life was ticking away as quickly as the seconds remaining before midnight she was shaking chills running through her body yet she was so hot she felt like she was on fire she kept injecting hoping it was the relief her body needed she woke up later lying in a hospital bed her mother and father stood over her she wasn t sure when or how she had gotten there lyall had overdosed the drug dealer had called her mother who rushed her to wilkes medical center they made it in time for doctors to give lyall the reversal drug naloxone saving her life i remember in that moment feeling very helpless but relieved lyall said i was so glad that i wasn t in that house anymore and that maybe i had an opportunity to do something different it was the first time in a long time that i thought maybe i can get help she began the new year in the icu for seven days a regular room for 10 more and detox for 14 after that in short supply naloxone is a drug that blocks the nervous system s opiate receptors it is most commonly used for drug overdoses narcan is a well known brand name in august pfizer halted production of its single dose injectable naloxone due to a manufacturing issue this causes issues as buyers organizations distribute this naloxone to many grassroots harm reduction coalitions across the state dr nabarun dasgupta drug and infectious disease scientist at unc gillings school of global public health and others have estimated the interruption would result in about 1 million fewer doses which could lead to as many as 18 000 avoidable overdose deaths in 2012 the year lyall overdosed naloxone and overdose kits weren t common in clinics harm reduction coalitions or other local organizations hardly any individual had them on hand in a way lyall was fortunate she had a dealer who called her mother and her mother responded many who overdosed at the time weren t as lucky now naloxone is more accessible on pharmacy shelves part of local syringe exchange programs and often in first responders hands this access is crucial especially as opioid overdose deaths rose to an all time high in north carolina in 2020 the change is largely a result of north carolina s 2016 naloxone standing order which allows pharmacists to dispense naloxone to those who need it and for community distribution but addiction recovery experts say the standing order is not doing enough to blunt the rapid rise of opioid addiction there s a third tier of programs around the state that rely on other programs to purchase naloxone for them dasgupta says so these are sponsored programs programs run by people of color serving people of color and they are ones that don t have the official paperwork to buy and purchase naloxone but have the really critical infrastructure to get it to where it needs to go getting naloxone to these local harm reduction groups is critical because this is often where active users who are most at risk go for naloxone the standing order only covers distribution not purchasing pharmaceutical companies producing naloxone require a prescription this is where the nuances of north carolina order stand in the way of easily getting naloxone to the organizations where it is most effective the standing order it s kind of a sham dasgupta says our legislature came up with a piecemeal almost useless version of a law that created this standing order then feel like they ve done something and wash their hands of it what would have really helped is for these smaller programs to be able to order naloxone directly from pharmaceutical distributors with rising overdoses a flawed standing order and a pfizer naloxone shortage north carolina faces what could be a nightmare crisis on horizon louise vincent is the executive director of the nc urban survivors union a grassroots greensboro group working to support and assure safety for opioid users in the community through syringe exchanges and by providing naloxone if i didn t have naloxone i couldn t go to work vincent says i could not look someone in the face and tell them i don t have naloxone and send them to die because you re literally sending someone off to die if you don t have it this reality landed on national consultant robert suarez s doorstep at urban survivors just a few weeks ago a young woman ran into the center screaming her friend was overdosing in her car right outside the clinic suarez grabbed two bottles of naloxone ran outside opened the passenger side door climbed on top of the overdosing man and administered the lifesaving drug after he injected the naloxone suarez said he gave him mouth to mouth during the four minutes it took the naloxone to work four minutes is an eternity when someone isn t breathing on their own suarez says a month into pfizer s naloxone shortage the urban survivors union s supplies remain sufficient for now but the fear of coming up short is pervasive i m acutely aware that there s a shortage and i want to be mindful vincent says i cannot run out i will not run out bottom line is i won t run out there s expired naloxone that i ve already figured out how to access we re pretty scrappy people i m going to find it sharing resources another way harm reduction groups are coping with this shortage is by getting naloxone from larger organizations across the state with the ability to purchase from other pharmaceutical distributors one of these groups helping provide naloxone is project lazarus in wilkes county they have a medical director able to order the drug we ve worked with what stock we have and every time we have looked at getting naloxone it wasn t just for ourselves says fred brason executive director and founder i ve given louise vincent naloxone i ve given it to twin cities harm reduction brason explains that studies show that people who go to a pharmacy for naloxone are usually family members or friends of a user rather than the user themselves within the harm reduction circle there is a huge concern there never has been the full access that is necessary to make the difference naloxone can brason says any reduction from what was already not sufficient is going to create major problems urban survivors union tracy coins a waitress in greensboro relies on the urban survivors union for naloxone the circle of people that i travel in wouldn t go anywhere else but urban survivors coins says they don t want to walk into places like cvs or walgreens because those people are so judgmental in august coins saved someone overdosing right in front of her with the naloxone she had on hand she was with a group of people at a friend s house and they were all doing heroin suddenly one man curled up his body as tense as a rubber band stretched to its limits his arms and legs locked up coins looked around the room and realized that no one had any idea how to help i carry naloxone with me all the time if i can she said the only place i get it is through urban survivors coins gave him naloxone and mouth to mouth until he came to local harm reduction agencies acknowledge that there are people who are going to use drugs by providing naloxone and hosting syringe exchanges they say they give these people the option to have a safer experience boots on the ground after lyall s near fatal new year s eve she got clean she gradually got her life back her house her kids and she reconnected with her family today she is the founder and executive director of the nonprofit wilkes recovery revolution in wilkes county the organization focuses on helping people overcome addiction and is a harm reduction center working to assure users are safe distributing naloxone and trying to decrease stigma syringe exchange programs are truly the people that are boots on the ground lyall says we re the ones intersecting with people who use drugs and serving them on a daily basis yet we are the last to get naloxone when i think it should probably be the other way around so if there s a shortage then we re definitely hurting at the grassroots level as a syringe exchange pfizer expects its naloxone shortage to continue through february 2022 leaving harm reduction groups to continue relying on sources whose naloxone supplies are diminishing lyall says she had a wonderful life before her addiction a supportive upper middle class upbringing a good job and a family of her own when she slipped down some icy stairs at a ski resort shattering her ankle she had no idea that the pain medicine she would be prescribed would be the start to a crippling addiction now lyall reflects on pulling herself out of the depth of her addiction how difficult this was and how lucky she was to get naloxone in time to save her life at the nonprofit s r3 recovery center in north wilkesboro she wants to give people this same chance when i moved back home my mission was to give other people the opportunities that i had she says i understand that i was a privileged person and that not everybody gets those same options and opportunities and that i was very lucky to have
the industrial revolution resulted in massive declines in transport costs leading to increased market size and a demand for larger businesses but organisational technology was clunky early forms of the joint stock company resulted in scandal and bankruptcy eventually however the limited liability joint stock company as we currently know it emerged right now that organisational form dominates the global economy a new form of organisation has recently emerged in the crypto economy decentralised autonomous organisations daos are the twenty first century equivalent of joint stock companies early daos have also resulted in scandal and lost money just like the modern corporation in the nineteenth century daos require legislation to legitimise them the bragg report makes this very recommendation if adopted australia would be the second jurisdiction in the world after the us state of wyoming to legitimise this new organisational form not only would this clearly signal that australia is open for business australia would be the business this would provide a massive stimulus to the existing services sector not to mention all the support industries that would arise and evolve around that new organisational form the other major impediment to the growth of the crypto economy is our taxation system in particular the cgt regime cgt performs a backstop to the income tax system preventing leakage and avoiding schemes in which revenue is artificially reclassified as capital cgt however has a catastrophic impact on the crypto economy where it operates equivalently to a cascading sales tax it creates unprecedented complexity uncertainty and encourages non compliance to be fair the ato has little leeway to apply the law any differently nonetheless a cascading sales tax is poor policy in an industrial economy and it is very poor policy in a crypto economy the bragg report recognises this advertisement in addition to being sensible in cgt the bragg report invites a debate into crypto taxation generally quite rightly it wants to avoid endorsing revenue leakage and widespread tax avoidance if not evasion but at the same time there is a recognition that a serious debate needs to be had about ensuring that a highly innovative industry isn t strangled by a twentieth century tax system our phrase not theirs our cutting edge organisational form is from the 19th century and our tax system from the 20th century they have served us well and in many instances will continue to serve us well we can do better we are doing better the bragg report sets out a bold vision of australia as being a leading crypto economy in the 21st century admittedly this represents a dramatic policy change the changes to our economy will be dramatic the challenge facing policymakers is whether australia will be proactive or reactive to those changes by producing this report andrew bragg and his colleagues have chosen to be proactive sinclair davidson and elizabeth morton are both at the rmit blockchain innovation hub
rick maciag and his grandson kellan 6 peruse the aisles at lee s toy and hobby in groton friday october 22 2021 lee s owner peter marcus says his stock is low due to supply chain issues plaguing retail businesses sean d elliot the day buy photo reprints observing supply chain issues and shortages pete marcus said he stocked up lee s toy and hobby in groton pretty well anticipating a good holiday he does his best to stock the store with things he knows are popular but said the chips fall where they will and he s never seen supply issues like this before some types of toys and collectibles are becoming harder to get or only have limited options marcus said citing legos games and pokemon cards if you re coming in specifically for certain items you better shop now he advises he added when you get into specifics that s when you re going to be in trouble supply chain experts are also advising consumers to shop early for the holidays and to be flexible with what they want scott gladstone whose group owns seven wireless zone locations including in new london and groton said he is faced with the same chip shortages and transportation issues as every other industry but that verizon has done a good job of streamlining its distribution they are planning ahead as best as they can he said however that being the case we are actually telling our customers now plan it as far ahead as you possibly can even when there isn t a supply chain crisis wireless zone runs out of phones in december because of increased demand gladstone said the stores used to have a lot more inventory but now don t have even entry level phones in stock though it may only take two to four days to get a phone once ordered he said stores are able to stockpile things like chargers other accessories and repair parts though why are these issues happening cuihong li professor of operations and information management at the university of connecticut school of business pointed to three reasons for shortages high demand shortage in supply and logistical bottlenecks the pandemic caused increased demand for certain types of goods such as furniture and electronics but because factories shut down the supply can t keep up with demand on top of that a shortage of truck drivers warehouse space and containers have contributed to bottlenecks li said usually when container ships arrive from asia at a port on the west coast they would unload and then reload the containers back to asia but because it s now taking so long to unload ships may not be able to wait long enough to reload and they ll sail back to asia with empty containers she said it s taking longer to unload because increased demand means more ships are coming but there s a shortage of workers at the port you need trucks to pull away the containers and to unload the goods at the warehouse li said now if you don t have enough workers at the warehouse if you don t have enough truck drivers to pull away then you cannot unload the containers from the ships as well so everything is kind of interlocked she said it s good news that ports are now working 24 7 but we also need more trucks and more warehouse space on oct 13 after the port of long beach began operating 24 7 president joe biden announced an agreement for the port of los angeles to become a 24 7 operation with walmart fedex target samsung and the home depot committing to unloading during off peak hours walmart target and other large retailers have also chartered their own container ships the bureau of labor statistics reported that consumer prices are up 5 4 from a year ago and that u s import prices were up 9 2 from last september to this september kate li professor of information systems and operations management at suffolk university s sawyer business school in boston noted that chinese factories are also closing or experiencing temporary restrictions because of power shortages she also noted that a lot of toys gaming systems smartphones and other electronics are impacted by the microchip shortage therefore she doesn t think there will be a significant discount on these kinds of items on black friday and she s not even sure whether the most popular items will be in stock then while factory closures and labor shortages have impacted a wide variety of products li said making chips is a bigger problem because it requires skilled workers she said people will also want to pay attention to published holiday shipping deadlines for example when doing ground shipping the recommended send by date for delivery before christmas is dec 15 for the u s postal service and for fedex li said in the time since she entered her phd program in 2004 she s seen shortages here and there but nothing to the extent of what we re seeing now she doesn t see the situation getting worse but she also doesn t see it getting better for at least the first half of 2022 because you need time to clear up the backlog if you see it buy it now at the olde mistick village kitchen and specialty food store kitch owner dan price said the products that are difficult to get make no sense so it s hard to plan he couldn t get garlic presses for about two months and finding pizza stones was hard for a while cutlery fluctuates price said it used to take three days for an order to arrive and he would get about 95 of what he wanted but now it takes two and a half weeks to get 35 or 40 of what he wants and he has to reorder from someone else we re seeing a lot of christmas shoppers now which is earlier than we usually do price said we tell people if you see it buy it now he said all of the cookware kitch sells is american made and he ll buy things american made even if they re more expensive but most of the gadgets and knick knacks are made in asia at kelley s pace in olde mistick village owner jeff anderson said manufacturers started migrating from china to vietnam a few years ago but vietnam went into lockdown in july and shut down production new product introductions have been delayed and the life cycle of old products is ending so there s less available anderson places orders about seven months in advance and fills in along the way but he s seeing that orders placed six months ago are being delayed but he went on a buying spree so his basement is full of product kelley s pace carries shoes from nine manufacturers and he said the more popular ones hoka asics new balance and brooks will run out sooner customers will be able to get a shoe that fits right but not necessarily in their preferred color as for clothing electronics and recovery items it s been up and down anderson said a lot of summer clothes never came and the september order of safety vests with fiber optic lights hasn t arrived johnson s hardware in groton isn t as big for holiday shopping as other stores but fourth generation owner bill johnson said getting power equipment has been a struggle one issue is there aren t enough people

a deal within reach president joe biden and congress top democrats edged close to sealing their giant domestic legislation though the informal deadline appeared to slip as they worked to scale back the measure and determine how to pay for it negotiations were expected to continue into the weekend all sides indicating just a few issues remained unsettled in the sweeping package of social services and climate change strategies biden met at the white house on friday with house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader chuck schumer joined by video call from from new york trying to shore up details the leaders have been working with party moderates and progressives to shrink the once 3 5 trillion 10 year package to around 2 trillion in child care health care and clean energy programs pelosi said a deal was very possible she told reporters back at the capitol that more than 90 of the package was agreed to the climate change components of the bill are resolved but outstanding questions remained on health care provisions vice president kamala harris sounded even more certain on a visit to new york city she said tensions often rise over final details but i am confident frankly not only optimistic but i am confident that we will reach a deal no agreement was announced by friday s self imposed deadline to at least agree on a basic outline biden wants a deal before he leaves next week for global summits in europe pelosi hoped the house could start voting as soon as next week but no schedule was set sticking points appear to include proposed corporate tax hikes to help finance the plan and an effort to lower prescription drug costs that has raised concerns from the pharmaceutical industry democrats are in search of a broad compromise between the party s progressives and moderates on the measure s price tag revenue sources and basic components at the white house the president has rolled up his sleeves and is deep in the details of spreadsheets and numbers press secretary jen psaki said biden was to spend the weekend at his home in wilmington delaware psaki compared the work to starting social security and other major federal programs decades ago then building on them in following years progress here is a historic package that will put in place systems and programs that have never existed in our society before she said noting the effort to expand child care and provide free prekindergarten for all youngsters negotiations are proceeding as biden more forcefully appeals to the american public including in a televised town hall for what he says are the middle class values at the heart of his proposal in a senate that is evenly divided between the democrats and firmly opposed republicans biden can t afford to lose a single vote he is navigating his own party s factions progressives who want major investments in social services and centrists who prefer to see the overall price tag go down when you re president of the united states you have 50 democrats every one is a president every single one so you gotta work things out he said during a cnn town hall thursday still he expressed optimism about the process it s all about compromise compromise has become a dirty word but bipartisanship and compromise still has to be possible he said on one issue the taxes to pay for the package the white house idea seemed to be making headway with a new strategy of abandoning plans for reversing trump era tax cuts in favor of an approach that would involve imposing a 15 corporate minimum tax and also taxing the investment incomes of billionaires to help finance the deal biden has faced resistance from key holdouts in particular sen kyrsten sinema d ariz who has not been on board with her party s plan to undo president donald trump s tax breaks for big corporations and individuals earning more than 400 000 a year the president was unusually forthcoming thursday night about the sticking points in the negotiations with sinema and another democrat conservative sen joe manchin of west virginia while the president said sinema opposed raising a single penny in taxes on the wealthy or corporations a white house official later clarified that the president was referring to raising the top tax rates not the range of tax proposals which sen sinema supports if so that could unlock a key piece of a deal with a better understanding of the revenues available democrats can then develop a topline amount of spending for the package and adjust the duration and sums for various programs accordingly biden said manchin doesn t want to rush the transition to clean energy so quickly it will result in major job losses in his coal producing state even still biden acknowledged major reductions to his original vision he signaled the final plan would no longer provide free community college but said he hoped to increase pell grants to compensate for the loss of the policy he also said that what had been envisioned as a federally paid months long family leave program would be just four weeks another work in progress the idea of expanding medicare to include dental vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors is a priority for sen bernie sanders the independent of vermont biden said he likes the idea but with manchin and sinema objecting the proposal is a reach instead democrats he said are considering offering seniors an 800 voucher to access dental care as well as another program for hearing aids that sinema may support however the vision care component biden said has been harder to resolve and there is no consensus yet overall biden and his party are trying to shore up middle class households tackle climate change and have the most wealthy americans and corporations pay what he calls their fair share

karachi china pakistan economic corridor cpec authority czar khalid mansoor came out on saturday swinging at the united states for hatching plots against the multibillion dollar project addressing the cpec summit at the institute of business administration iba the special assistant to the prime minister sapm on cpec affairs accused the united states of conniving in cahoots with india against the economic lifeline of pakistan from the point of view of the emerging geo strategic situation one thing is clear the united states supported by india is inimical to cpec it will not let it succeed that s where we have to take a position mr mansoor said read most loans under cpec at commercial rates report islamabad is the seventh largest recipient of chinese overseas development financing with 71 projects worth 27 3 billion currently under way as part of cpec many western think tanks and commentators have termed cpec an economic trap that has already resulted in bloated public debt levels and disproportionately high chinese influence in the domestic economy washington now taking stock of economic and political consequences the premier s aide said the united states and india continue to make attempts to manoeuvre pakistan out of china s belt and road initiative bri a global infrastructure development plan under which the chinese government has been investing heavily in about 70 countries there s no way pakistan will forgo any of its benefits it has more than once burnt its fingers in the western alliance in the past he said adding that their attempts to dilute china s strategic influence in the region will fail he said the western powers view cpec as a symbol of china s political ambition that s the reason cpec is seen suspiciously by both the united states and europe they view cepc more as a move by china to expand its political strategic and business influence said mr mansoor noting that china has been able to manage that apprehension to a great extent the united states is now taking stock of the economic and political consequences of withdrawing from the region he said i had a very very detailed discussion with the american embassy people i told them cpec is available for them as well they have also expressed their wish that they would like to develop some kind of involvement and see how it can be beneficial for both countries he noted the sapm said islamabad is seeking the expansion of cpec to afghanistan and has discussed the possibility of taliban led afghanistan joining the multibillion dollar economic corridor he said there s been deep interest in developing economic connectivity between afghanistan and pakistan and with other neighbouring countries including iran some european countries have started showing interest in cpec their ambassadors keep on coming he said he repeatedly referred to fake news and negative propaganda about the viability of cpec and the pace of its progress in terms of its scope phase ii of cpec is going to be an order of magnitude bigger than phase i published in dawn october 24th 2021

the university of michigan s endowment climbed 4 7 billion to a market value of 17 billion in the 2021 fiscal year that ended june 30 officials announced thursday during the board of regents meeting the increase represented a 41 growth said geoffrey chatas executive vice president and chief financial officer for the school the endowment makes up the majority of the university s long term investment strategy chatas told the board we are very pleased with the strong performance chatas said but we also know that investment income particularly in the short run can be very volatile and investment performance needs to be understood in the context of looking at those returns over time he noted that um s endowment fell in value in 2016 the university s long term investment strategy combined with its endowment spending policy serves to insulate operations from expected volatility in the financial markets and provides for a stable and predictable level of spending distributions over the long term said chatas the university s long term investment portfolio which is largely its endowment has had a median annual return of 9 5 in the last 20 years compared to 7 3 among college and university endowments the school said in a release each year he said the university moves some of the money from the endowment to its operating budget during the last fiscal year chatas said 404 million from the endowment was distributed to support student scholarships faculty research libraries infrastructure and critical care annual endowment distributions have totaled about 5 2 billion in the last 20 years the school said in a release um s endowment was ranked 92nd among colleges and universities on a per student basis according to a report by the national association of college and university business officers chatas said president mark schlissel said that the university s endowment provides more funds annually for the university than the school receives in state revenue sharing um s financial strength is inextricably linked to our ability to deliver on our public mission through excellence in all we do schlissel said the endowment enhances our academic programs and other activities allows us to provide large amounts of financial aid to keep a michigan education affordable and helps to set us apart in public higher education kkozlowski detroitnews com
oil system collapsing so fast it may derail renewables warn french government scientists a team of french government energy scientists are warning that the collapse of the global oil system is coming so rapidly it could derail the transition to a renewable energy system if it doesn t happen fast enough in just 13 years global oil production could enter into a terminal and exponential decline accompanied by the overall collapse of the global oil and gas industries over the next three decades but this is not because the earth is running out of oil and gas rather it s because they are increasingly eating themselves to stay alive the oil and gas industries are consuming exponentially more and more energy just to keep extracting oil and gas that s why they ve entered a downwards spiral of increasing costs of production diminishing profits rising debt and irreversible economic decline hanging on for dear life to the old dying fossil fuel paradigm is a recipe for civilisational suicide the implication is that global energy shortages and price spikes will be a taste of things to come if we stay dependent on fossil fuels yet a growing narrative has instead wrongly pinpointed the clean energy transition as the culprit the economist for instance describes the global gas price spikes as the first big energy shock of the green era blaming inadequate investment in renewables and some transition fossil fuels like gas this could lead to a popular revolt against climate policies this implies that the fundamental driver of global energy volatility is the transition away from fossil fuels but this flawed narrative has it exactly backwards energy return on investment eroi the key to understanding all this is in how the new study published in elsevier s applied energy journal applies the concept of energy return on investment eroi pioneered by systems ecologist professor charles hall whom i worked with on my book failing states collapsing systems eroi measures how much energy you must use to extract energy for a given resource or technology the metric works as a simple ratio that estimates the quantity of energy you can get out for every single unit of energy that s put in so obviously the higher the ratio the better because it means you can get more bang for your buck the new study is authored by three french government scientists louis delannoy pierre yves longaretti and emmanuel prados of the national institute for research in digital science and technology inria which operates under france s ministry of national education and the ministry of economy finance and industry along with david j murphy an environmental scientist and energy expert at st lawrence university in new york their research found that 15 5 more than a tenth of the energy produced from oil worldwide is already necessary to keep producing all the oil yet this is getting worse not better since the production of the easiest to get conventional oil slowed down and plateaued around fifteen years ago we re increasingly relying on forms of difficult to extract unconventional oil that uses greater amounts of energy for more complex techniques like fracking the downwards spiral in 1950 the eroi of global oil production was really high at about 44 1 meaning for every unit of energy we put in we were getting a whopping 44 out yet as the graph below from the new study illustrates this value has undergone a shockingly steep decline by 2020 it reached around 8 1 and is projected to decline and plateau to around 6 7 from 2040 onwards by 2024 within the next four years the amount of energy we are using for global oil production is going to increase to 25 of energy production in other words the world will be using a quarter of the energy produced from oil just to keep producing that oil but instead of getting more efficient fossil fuel technologies are getting less efficient which is why the quantity of energy we need to keep producing oil is exponentially increasing by 2050 fully half of the energy extracted from global oil reserves will need to be put back into new extraction to keep producing oil the authors have an interesting name for this self defeating phenomenon they call it energy cannibalism this tendency is having massive consequences on long term economic growth that few mainstream economists acknowledge today the key issue is that the more energy we need to extract energy itself the less energy is available for other areas of the economy and society as economists professor tim jackson and dr andrew jackson of the university of surrey have shown there is now abundant scientific evidence that the decline in eroi is an underlying driver of the decline in economic growth this suggests that the last two decades of global economic turbulence are closely related to the global economy s continued structural dependence on fossil fuels a dependence that if it goes on will guarantee a grim future of energy and economic decline amidst mounting environmental crisis yes the age of fossil fuels is ending what does this mean for the idea of peak oil previous discussions about peak oil the scientists say were too polarised to be helpful so they call for a re opening of the debate based on these new findings not because we are running out of oil the authors point out that we clearly have too much fossil fuels stock to respect ambitious climate targets but because our economic ability to access the oil affordably is declining at an exponential rate that decision makers aren t talking about if the shale tight oil has been able to compensate for the production plateau of conventional oils since the mid 2000s they portend no other liquid is expected to take off and become the next backstop energy source this they argue will define the point at which all global oil production will probably peak and decline a date they suggest lies somewhere around 2034 that is just 13 years from now a contracting window exists between oil prices high enough so that extraction and development are viable and low enough to let consumers have access to it they conclude from this perspective peak oil will never be either totally peak supply or peak demand but a mix of both in proportions that are difficult to measure and project gas crisis reveals the imminent end of europe s fossil fuel age other analysts have pointed out that technology disruptions like solar photovoltaics wind turbines batteries for storage and electric vehicles evs are on track to eliminate demand for oil and gas over the next decade oil therefore faces a perfect storm from both above and below in a separate new study the same team looked at global gas data finding similarly that while we re currently using 6 7 of global energy to produce gas that quantity is growing at an exponential rate and will reach nearly a quarter by 2050 over the next decades then oil and gas investments will become stranded due to three converging pressures climate policies demanding that fossil fuels stay in the ground plummeting demand as fossil fuels and combustion engines are increasingly disrupted by solar wind batteries and evs and accelerating energy cannibalism as the oil and gas industries ironically consume themselves into oblivion in the process of trying to keep going aborting the alternative perhaps the most alarming implication of the new research concerns renewable energy technologies the authors conclude either the global energy transition takes place quickly enough or we risk a worsening of climate change a historical and long term recession due to energy deficits at least for some regions of the globe or a combination of several of these problems so if we delay the clean energy transformation for too long there might not be enough energy to sustain the transition in the first place leading to a worst of all worlds scenario the collapse of both the fossil fuel system and the ability to create a viable alternative the good news is that according to more and more research the alternative could open up a vast new possibility space for human civilisation according to financial think tank carbon tracker renewable energy technologies such as solar wind and batteries are becoming more efficient rolled out with increasing speed and generating greater returns as i ve argued for the technology forecasting group rethinkx there s also mounting evidence that renewable energy technologies have a higher and increasing eroi compared to fossil fuels and if optimally deployed can avoid bottlenecks in minerals and materials supplies there s no time to lose the new research led by the french team confirms that whether we like it or not human civilisation is in the midst of the most rapid transformation of the global energy system we ve ever experienced and hanging on for dear life to the old dying fossil fuel paradigm is a recipe for civilisational suicide byline

the toxic policy twins this october 20 headline in the new york times is worth a ponder where are the workers how can so many americans afford not to work and will it last good questions as we all can see the economy is running short of workers in high visibility sectors and it s an open question as to whether this shortage is a short term phenomenon or a long term one interestingly the biden administration seems to want it to be the latter more on that in a bit in the meantime the times has its explanation for voluntary unemployment americans are flush with cash that is of course an exaggeration most americans are nowhere close to full up money wise yet still the natural prosperity of the u s economy including the boom brought on by donald trump s 2017 tax cut has been further goosed by covid related stimulus including trillions in direct federal expenditures as well as ultra low interest rates and accelerated loans and grants in the words of the times thanks to pandemic stimulus programs during both the trump and biden administrations many families have received multiple checks from the federal government over the past 18 months those stimulus programs also increased the size of unemployment benefits over the same period home values and stock prices have risen too as a result many households have more of a financial cushion than they used to we can look back and say that some of this spending was necessary after all the economy suffered a ccp virus related heart attack in early 2020 and so it was a good idea for the government to apply electrical cardioversion money defibrillators and to set in motion counter cyclical spending moreover on the matter of voluntary unemployment we can further say that not every job is a good job to put the point another way bad jobs usually become good jobs when they pay more so in that sense if workers are scarce relative to the number of available job openings some 10 million according to the labor department that s good because the competition for workers will bid up wages yet we should also beware of these two economic dangers first over spending today the federal government is spending too much overheating the economy and igniting inflation second over regulation the feds and some state and local governments are causing supply problems and have been for a long time the latest and most obvious example of a regulatory obstacle is the vaccine mandates that inhibit businesses and workers from normal functionality this toxic twinning of red ink and red tape is a formula for inflationary stagnation or as it was called in the 1970s stagflation as it happens i have written much about the ominous parallels between the economy of the 2020s and that of the 1970s including here here and here indeed the historical record tells us that if the 70s 20s parallelism is allowed to continue the voluntary unemployment we see today will be joined by something much worse tomorrow involuntary unemployment joe biden born in 1942 ought to remember the 1970s and yet instead of learning from the past with an eye toward avoiding pitfalls biden seems happy to be reliving it the toxic policy triplets even more remarkably the 46th president seems eager to revive yet another mistake from the past namely bidding potentially productive americans out of the workforce by putting them on the government dole such runaway welfarism was a policy mistake of the 1960s in that decade president lyndon johnson s great society agenda caused welfare spending as a percentage of the economy to double one bad result of the great society was a sharp increase in the federal deficit and yet we also saw the worsening of problems vastly more dangerous a worsening of human dependence of cultural degradation and of social breakdown yes it was the height of perversity the federal government was spending billions to actively make societal problems even more problematic a brave examination of this tangle of pathologies simultaneously soaring rates of unwed births dependence drug use and criminality can be be found in journalist ken auletta s 1983 book the underclass which helped to convince even liberals that we needed a change in welfare policy finally in the late 1980s a great republican governor tommy thompson of wisconsin aided by his intrepid social services chief jason turner began chipping away at the welfare problem in the following decade wisconsin s reform movement went nationwide in 1996 the republican led 104th congress prodded president bill clinton into signing a landmark federal welfare reform bill the results of this reform were dramatic over the next quarter century the number of people on welfare first called aid to families with dependent children and now temporary assistance to needy families fell from 12 6 million in 1996 to 2 9 million in 2020 to be sure the problem of costly welfare dependence has hardly gone away as former texas senator phil gramm wrote recently in the wall street journal since the war on poverty started in 1965 the labor force participation rate of bottom quintile earners who now receive more than 90 of their 50 000 average income from government transfer payments has fallen from almost 70 to 36 in other words uncle sugar is still ladling out plenty of sweets such that those who don t wish to work can still enjoy material conditions that most of the world would envy most people around the world would not however envy the actual lifestyle of the american underclass as the recent spike in crime tells us the same problems of welfare induced underclass pathology that auletta chronicled are still with us today to be sure the problem is smaller than it was three for four decades ago and yet it is larger than it was even just a few years ago yet all the while the left has been looking for an opportunity to undo any and all welfare reform in 2021 with the beginning of the biden presidency progressives saw their window of opportunity that aperture was the 3 5 trillion build back better bbb also known as the reconciliation bill now being debated in congress one of the most controversial elements of bbb is what democrats call a childcare tax credit ctc for their part republicans call ctc a trojan horse designed to undo welfare reform by stealth as part of their political pitch democrats typically spin ctc as a tax cut even though more than three fourths of the benefits will go to families who already pay no taxes which is to say ctc is a grant moreover since there s no work requirement or even an education requirement ctc is really a no strings attached handout which is to say it s a plan for a return to the open ended era of pre 1996 welfare spending and all the attendant troubles the current ctc proposal calls for families to receive 3 600 annually for each child under age six and 3 000 for each child aged six to 18 with a total cost over ten years of 550 billion robert rector and jamie bryan hall of the heritage foundation argue that the purported tax relief of ctc is really a bait and switch contrary to the administration s rhetoric the primary focus and sole permanent feature of the child allowance policy would not be tax relief but the elimination of all work requirements and work incentives from the current child credit program in pursuing this change the administration explicitly seeks to overturn the foundations of welfare reform established during the clinton presidency we can add that work requirements are about much more than just getting people into jobs to help the economy the far greater importance of work requirements is the signal that they send to the individual one part of the message is that work is good because work organizes one s personal life thereby preventing the decadence of indolence and a second part is that work is good because it makes every worker a contributing as well as a benefiting member of the commonwealth that s the key to a genuinely great society where every able bodied citizen is a free and independent stakeholder obviously many progressives don t agree with any of this thinking about the value of work and at least for now they are in charge of the national agenda in fact as rector further explains the biden plan abandons the link between work and welfare established by welfare reform in the 1990s and re establishes the principle of unconditional entitlement to taxpayer funded benefits rector adds a better policy would be to strengthen work obligations for able bodied recipients in such programs as temporary assistance to needy families the earned income tax credit subsidized housing and food stamps interestingly most americans seem to agree with this conservative vision to be sure they might have trouble picking their way through the spun up phraseology of the biden plan and yet once the real issues upholding personal responsibility and vindicating the work ethic are explained to them they end up in agreement with the heritage foundation experts in supporting work not welfare the gut wisdom of ordinary people is further attested by survey researcher rich thau who has conducted focus groups on ctc he quoted one young woman in texas saying the child tax credit specifically is just going to promote more people to stay at home and not go to work because they re getting this free money handed to them thau added this point reminiscent of 1980s complaints about welfare was widely shared among these swing voters as we can recall concerns about welfare and the resulting underclass hit a peak in the 80s thereby causing political leaders to finally fix the policy mistakes of decades prior today biden has a problem his overall bbb has been so battered by scrutiny that it s looking more like a bane not a boon to democrats and ctc is a particular bone of vulnerability and while most congressional democrats are still on board with bbb albeit with greater unease one important democrat is definitely not on the back to the bad old days train that would be sen joe manchin of west virginia who said in september of ctc there s no work requirements whatsoever there s no education requirements whatsoever for better skill sets don t you think if we re going to help the children that the people should make some effort as of now we don t know what will happen with ctc just as we don t know the fate of the bbb we only know this much joe biden has revived two of the worst ideas of the 1970s inflationary over spending and contractionary over regulation and added a third bad idea from the 1960s destructive welfarism and so the toxic policy twins have now become toxic policy triplets

our predilection for gold is well known unfortunately pakistan s market infrastructure for buying and selling gold is not properly regulated gold is a valuable and safe asset for the investors as well because regardless of where it ultimately ends up gold perpetually remains in the world once mined gold reserves in the developed economies continue to grow at a rapid pace and according to the latest world gold council report the united states has the world s largest stockpile of gold reserves at 8 133 46 tonnes and it is the largest by some distance the us reserves are just about equal to those of germany italy and france combined pakistan s gold reserves have remained constant at 64 65 tonnes till the second quarter of 2021 the federal board of revenue fbr has set up a board to oversee the deficiencies in the gold market but it has been unsuccessful in regulating and taxing the millions of dollars in informal gold trade that occurs through the jewellers in an interview earlier this year an official of the jewellers association raised voice against the fbr s decision to regulate the gold market claiming that it would result in harassment and a restriction of their operations unless the government makes a more comprehensive effort to digitalise the entire economy concurrently the jewellers according to him were willing to work with the government to streamline the process provided the authorities refrained from forcing small gold businesses towards sales tax registration as this might have a detrimental effect on their business i believe this is a flimsy argument the government should apply a flat taxation system across the gold market every person should be held accountable and no one should be unfairly burdened whether they are small or big dealers the fbr has an obligation to ensure that designated non financial businesses and professions dnfbps such as dealers in precious metals and stones should comply with all financial obligations millions of rupees in black money can be easily converted into gold and stored anywhere without the need for legal ownership the government should take aggressive measures to regulate the gold sector to expand the country s tax base in addition the fbr must design workshops to educate the public about the features of gold that allow it to be wonderfully moulded and carved for various purposes being a good conductor of electricity and low on maintenance gold is the metal of choice for various industries and has medical and technical applications regrettably there is only one metal exchange in pakistan and it is still in its early stages of development as a result the public purchases gold in its physical form and has no idea that the yellow metal can be acquired indirectly such as through futures contracts gold exchange traded funds etfs or mutual funds an etf has an advantage over bullion in that it may be sold for cash at the market price one can sell it just as one sells stock exchange shares gold etfs are more liquid than the metal itself and can be traded from the comfort and security of one s home hafiz muhammad usman rana birmingham united kingdom published in dawn october 24th 2021
reporting by rishard khan and raphael john lall gary griffith s bid to return as commissioner of police cop and his fate in this situation remain in limbo as controversy continues to fester over the selection process culminating in the resignation of the entire police service commission psc calls for the attorney general s head and a motion by the opposition united national congress to impeach the president the motion however was defeated by the electoral college on thursday prime minister dr keith rowley has also come under fire for the psc cop fiasco griffith who was appointed cop in 2018 and became the first substantive cop since 2012 after commissioner dwayne gibbs resigned is perhaps one of the most polarising public figures in the country he has been hailed a hero by his supporters but has also garnered the dislike and distrust of many in his three year tenure and although polls among citizens have given him a high popularity rating one of the most recent public additions to the list of those who weren t pleased with griffith as cop is dr rowley on october 16 dr rowley made a bombshell revelation in 2020 he wrote to the then psc chairman bliss seepersad saying he had lost confidence in griffith as cop dr rowley refrained from divulging any significant details at the press conference and again at a pnm political platform earlier this week where he only reasoned that he lost confidence in griffith based on his good judgment and understanding rowley too has been taken to task by some sections of the public for his statement but many are now wondering what could have led the prime minister to lose confidence in the commissioner was it a single incident or a series of concerns in the 2018 process to appoint a cop the psc did not place griffith in the number one position in fact he was fourth on the merit list pm rowley leader of the pnm government however invested his political capital in choosing griffith as the candidate for the vacant post this according to criminologist and social researcher daurius figueira was especially so given griffith s history of being the public face as national security minister for the people s partnership government s agenda to dismantle the national security apparatus they inherited from the pnm exemplified by the rejection of the offshore patrol vessels figueira said the pnm in opposition and in the 2015 electoral campaign placed great emphasis on the national security failures of the pp government but then embraced griffith placing him in the said national security apparatus to figueira and large sections of the country this was a contradiction the pm was subsequently forced to offer public explanations justifying his action but two years after griffith s appointment the pm wrote to the psc expressing his loss of confidence in the cop this action was a blow to his political stocks figueira believes as his investment of political capital in griffith had clearly backfired this has to be placed in the context of his public hints after the 2020 election victory that he was now wrapping up his political career which opened up the search for a new leader in that event then there was the tha election in january 2021 its tie and the need for a redo which signalled weakness in the heartland as the pm insisted in public on the importance politically of the two tobago seats to pnm control of the state figueira added figueira told the sunday guardian dr rowley however acted within his remit as prime minister to communicate his concerns with the psc the pm has the power to indicate to the psc and the police commissioner that he has lost confidence in the pc as this presents a threat to national security which only the pm is responsible for we will never know the reality that formed the decision in 2020 but that is the prerogative of the pm and his alone that is the reality of the order of power under our constitution the two men have clashed publicly since the start of the pandemic and this culminated with the pm calling griffith to a meeting the clash stemmed from a private party in west trinidad in september 2020 the pm called on the police to enforce the public health regulations equally after footage of a private pool party at bayside towers emerged on social media at that time people attending parties along the corridor and other parts of the country were being arrested for breach of the public health regulations persons who are partying and spreading this virus must feel the full brunt of the law in trinidad and tobago it s not for me to tell the commissioner who to arrest and how to arrest but as prime minister i could tell the commissioner of police that the law must apply to protect us in trinidad and tobago from those who are not prepared to listen dr rowley then said at a press conference however griffith fired back shortly after explaining publicly that police could not intervene in matters on private property because the law did not allow it he rowley needs to know his position as chair of the national security council but he continues to make comments about policing and he doesn t have that authority or knowledge because it s the second time he has made the error first when he said the commissioner doesn t have the authority to go into supermarkets and banks to try to close them down then he came and he did a michael jackson moonwalked and corrected himself he s doing the same thing again griffith said then following the meeting with the prime minister griffith held firm in his position on the law but apologised for how he responded it was my right to clarify that misconception because i am not going to be bullied or pushed or pressured into doing anything that is illegal he said many have speculated that this altercation catalysed the pm s lack of confidence in griffith a clash in personalities the speculation isn t without merit political analyst dr winford james said one of the major signs of turbulence between the prime minister and cop was griffith saying that the office of the cop is an independent one and no one can summon him to a meeting gary griffith made it clear that his office is an independent one i agree with that the prime minister himself said complainingly that he cannot instruct the police he tried to summon griffith to a meeting to which griffith said was improper the question is what should be the relationship between the two offices it is clear that the constitution intended separation of what people do james believes there was a clash in personalities he believes the problems between the prime minister and the cop is not necessarily because of the present personalities and officeholders but t t and the rest of the caribbean have prime ministers with autocratic tendencies given the autocratic nature of the prime ministerial rule given the brashness and fearlessness of the previous cop it is not unreasonable to speculate that they may have had differences of opinion along the way there may have been some differences on how to police the covid restrictions as the matter in bayside seem to have suggested power struggle political scientist dr bishnu ragoonath meanwhile felt there was no specific event in the public domain that led to the fracture in the relationship between the prime minister and the former cop however in retrospect he said some incidents could be interpreted that there was a tenseness in the relationship the bayside incident being one of them clearly griffith was saying things that suggest that he was not toeing the line that the prime minister may have wanted him to toe griffith had stated that notwithstanding that petrotrin and av drilling had come to some agreement that did not preclude him to continue his investigations as to whether av drilling had done something i don t know that those were some of the issues that would have allowed the prime minister to lose confidence although i cannot specifically say why ragoonath added he believes that the controversy over the appointment of a new cop was a result of a power struggle between dr rowley and griffith it ended up in some people s court it ended up in the court of the psc it ended up in the court of the president and all of them being collateral damage because they all got taken into what was taking place between the prime minister and the then cop they got caught in the crossfire he said ragoonath too reiterated that griffith was number four on the merit list when he was appointed to the position of cop in august 2018 but he felt it was a good political move for the government at that time as griffith was popular and it gave the public the impression that the government had a grip on the crime situation he concluded that the maelstrom will have negative consequences in society for the ordinary man on the street they would like to know where does the security of t t lies they want to know if there is strong leadership in the t t police service to arrest the crime situation people are afraid of there are also economic problems as a result of the closure of businesses and rising unemployment people are concerned about all these things this does not help the country national security concerns figueira questioned whether certain incidents which may not be placed in the public domain by the officeholders may have impacted to create the current pm cop imbroglio he said from april to june 2021 events unfolded which indicated the existence of transnational organised crime toc pipelines moving illicit arms ammunition and other material from the usa and its territories to t t this toc pipeline was active and large enough to attract the attention of the us federal state the us department of state given the geopolitical interest of the north atlantic in t t the arms ammunition and material shipment interdicted at piarco trinidad on information supplied by the us agencies indicated the intent to outfit a militia in t t whose only intention was to destabilise t t with an armed insurgency he added this intent was further revealed with the interdiction in june of a cache of arms ammunition plastique and detonators buried outside the walls of the maximum security prison at arouca did the agencies of the us department of state brief the pm as to the nature of this toc arms trafficking pipeline stressing the involvement of people in possession of fuls and fdls in this pipeline stressing the need for immediate action with failure to do so having the ttps face sanctions by the usa figueira questioned in 2013 he said the us department of state imposed sanctions of the royal st lucia police force which were modified only in 2021 but not totally removed he said these realities will never be placed in the public domain but must be considered and factored into the events presently under debate in t t the missing merit list the prime minister has come under fire for the cop debacle after opposition leader kamla persad bissessar alleged he secretly met with president paula mae weekes and the then psc chairman on august 12 at president s house to discuss the merit list for the position of acting cop dr rowley has since denounced the allegations there are speculations that this meeting resulted in the president not submitting the names of the candidates selected by the psc for the cop post to the parliament the opposition has since asked the prime minister president and former psc chairman to confirm who was the public official at president s house this failure was one of the key drivers of the opposition s motion to remove president weekes president weekes remained silent on the collapse of the psc the controversy surrounding the appointment of a new cop and calls to say who was the office holder but after numerous calls from prominent attorneys criminologists and political scientists for her to address the public as they said she has a moral obligation to do she finally broke her silence last sunday however even though president weekes did so she did not address the question put to her by the opposition leader about the visit addressing her failure to submit the merit list she said it reached her office on august 11 however she said it was rescinded hours later which meant she could not submit the list to parliament for consideration i assure the nation that neither the otp nor i participated in allowed or encouraged any attempted or actual improper interference influence or breach of the principle of separation of powers in the operation of the psc in the matter of the commissioner of police a release from the president said figueira questioned did the merit list for the post of police commissioner place griffith at number one in spite of the letter the pm sent to the psc in 2020 he said if yes then there is no proof of political interference in an independent agency under the constitution but he questioned what then is this national security matter of grave importance that merited the withdrawal of the list and the need to appoint an acting police commissioner which was griffith to then place his appointment in stasis until such time thereafter the national security issue was settled it was clear he said the psc was not acting lucidly in appreciation of the gravity of this issue power in the hands of the pm figueira acknowledged that while the process to appoint a cop is independent the pm still has a considerable say it is the majority that the pm commands in the parliament appoints the pc not the masses the buck then stops with him the pm has the power to disagree with the manner in which a pc is applying the policy for the ttps formulated by the government and to publicly disagree with policy articulated publicly by the pc that is in contradiction with government policy for the ttps he told sunday guardian james said it was this power dr rowley attempted to communicate to the psc with his letter why did he do that the only answer i can give is that the prime minister wanted to influence the decision making by the police service commission he is prime minister and there is an impression that he can give he does not appoint the members of the commission he said only when the merit list reaches parliament to be debated the government can use its majority to vote for whomever they prefer as cop outside of that the government should not interfere in the process figueira believes the psc did its job but contributed to the debacle when it sent griffith on leave over its ongoing investigations into alleged corruption in the firearm user s licence process from what is in the public domain the psc did their duty by completing a merit list and sent it off to the president which they were required to do we entered the minefield with the withdrawal the same day of the merit list and the appointment of gary griffith as acting pc then sending him on leave because of a national security issue which they chose to investigate having no security clearance to do so effectively and legally he said the psc exceeded its remit when it did so as on a national security issue they have no locus standi and since they don t hire without the command of the person who commands the majority in parliament can they fire without the command of the person who commands the majority in parliament the psc took action without realisation of the order of power they were dealing with that impacted the post of pc they treated it as an average post governed by industrial relations jurisprudence when it is not figueira concluded that there is a need for constitutional reform an official secrets act and a homeland security act but in the gridlock of the politics of race stasis inertia rule he said legal notice 183 of 2021 the opposition and respected public figures have been calling for the head of ag al rawi for the convoluted psc cop mess and said he must be held to account for legal notice 183 2021 the commentators believe it was a poorly drafted piece of legislation that appeared to compromise the selection process for a commissioner of police prof ramesh deosaran had said there was a political and moral obligation for the pm and the ag to account for inserting the notice he labelled suspicious and confusing in june the government issued legal notice 183 of 2021 which allowed griffith to continue in the role as acting cop until the selection process was completed and the cop could be appointed on october 14 high court judge nadia kangaloo upheld an interpretation lawsuit from social activist ravi balgobin maharaj in which maharaj claimed that the psc needed the approval of the house of representatives to make acting and substantive appointments for the commissioner of police and deputy commissioners of police dcps striking down paragraph 4 the ruling effectively invalidated the acting appointment given to griffith balgobin was represented by attorney anand ramlogan sc gary s conundrum on the day before the pm declared he had lost confidence in griffith october 15 the police complaints authority issued a release stating that it had completed its investigation into the treatment of suspects in the kidnapping and murder of andrea bharatt while in custody in february the pca found that while in the custody of sort officers the suspects joel balcon and andrew morris were the subject of torture with two of the individuals being the subjects of acts of violence that led to their deaths it submitted its findings to the office of the director of public prosecutions then acting commissioner of police and the ministry of national security shortly after entering the cop s office griffith launched his brainchild sort the special operations response team the team s members which included former soldiers were hand picked by the commissioner to tackle elaborate criminal operations in april asp mark hernandez who headed sort was charged with misbehaviour in public office as it related to the deaths of balcon and morris he was then removed from his position as head of sort and replaced by supt roger alexander on wednesday night christian chandler who headed a revamped legal unit under griffith at the cop s office was detained with three special reserve police officers the arrests arose out of an incident aboard chandler s yacht off the chaguaramas coast on august 5 chandler had proceeded on leave on august 16 pending the outcome of an investigation into the matter on friday he was slapped with five criminal charges arising out of the incident pca complaints one of the areas that griffith s tenure as commissioner has come under intense scrutiny is police related killings while sort s successes were lauded by many the unit faced severe criticism from some for its alleged involvement in several fatal police shootings during 2019 2020 there was a surge in police killings there were 66 fatal police shootings and 31 non fatal police shootings the most recorded in the previous eight annual reports on june 27 2020 came arguably the commissioner s biggest test when three men israel clinton joel jacobs and noel diamond were allegedly shot by police in morvant when that footage of the shooting went public protests erupted across port of spain it appeared in the cctv footage that the men were shot with their hands in the air the officers at the scene maintained they were shot at first the claims of extrajudicial killings sparked widespread outrage roads and the beetham highway were blocked gunshots were fired while protesters marched through the capital city then during protests in sea lots a pregnant mother ornella greaves was killed relatives claimed she was shot by an officer but police denied the claim saying there was no evidence to prove that theory the protests lasted for three days in the end more than 70 people were arrested the pca called for more than a dozen officers involved to be suspended but the officers were placed on administrative duty leave the incident continues to be investigated by the pca dss in september 2020 sort officers raided the popular drugs sou sou operation in la horquetta police initially seized 22 million but the money was given back hours later investigations revealed there were police and defence force officers involved in the alleged illegal scheme days after the raid the operation faced public scrutiny after videos were leaked allegedly showing a member of the team stuffing evidence allegedly money into his bulletproof vest the video placed griffith on the backfoot although it was a sort operation he insisted the accused was not a police officer but a defence force member in october 2020 police raided the operation again they seized more than 7 million in cash as well as documents and electronics four officers were suspended while 11 others were transferred dss founder keron clarke was later charged with two counts of money laundering in early 2021

by afp staff president donald trump during a press conference on april 12 told reporters when somebody is president of the united states the authority is total trump s off the cuff comment harkens back to when former president george w bush declared fourteen years ago on april 18 2006 i m the decider and i decide what is best when it comes to the iraq war and who he had running it at the time but is the chief executive of the united states really the ultimate decider on all things related to the country the reality is they are not and we can thank our founding fathers for that sen rand paul r ky was quick to blast trump for claiming that he was the one who would decide when and how the country would end the strict measures put in place by states to control the spread of the novel coronavirus known as covid 19 in a tweet that has since gone viral paul wrote the constitution doesn t allow the federal government to become the ultimate regulator of our lives because they wave a doctor s note powers not delegated are reserved to states and the people if we dispense with constitutional restraints we will have more to worry about than a virus the constitution doesn t allow the federal gov t to become the ultimate regulator of our lives because they wave a doctor s note powers not delegated are reserved to states the people if we dispense with constitutional restraints we will have more to worry about than a virus senator rand paul randpaul april 14 2020 paul is correct and trump should know this considering in the earliest stages of the pandemic in the united states trump rightly said that it was up to the states to manage their situations based on what was going on in their regions earlier in april trump said the federal government was there to back up states but that it was state government s responsibility to manage the outbreak now after weeks of strict measures that have tanked the stock market and caused jobless claims to spike trump is angling to push to get americans back to work sen marco rubio r fla also blasted trump for his claim rubio took to twitter to state how and when to modify physical distancing orders should and will be made by governors federal guidelines issued by and will be very influential but the constitution and common sense dictates these decisions be made at the state level how when to modify physical distancing orders should will be made by governors federal guidelines issued by cdcgov whitehouse will be very influential but the constitution common sense dictates these decisions be made at the state level pic twitter com 6izvqinx9z marco rubio marcorubio april 14 2020 the question now is not whether trump is right or wrong about opening up the country again it is does he have the authority during a national emergency to dictate health policies to states most constitutional scholars do not believe he does trump is not backing down though he has promised to release legal documents showing that he is the one who calls the shots as of april 13 his office has not published any legal arguments proving that the president has the power to overrule state authorities however in founding this country the founding fathers were careful in their wording to give states considerable power in managing their affairs the federal government through the commerce clause related to business among states has considerable power but that is specifically delegated to congress not the president in federalist paper no 45 james madison wrote the powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government are few and defined those which are to remain in the state governments are numerous and indefinite over the years the federal government has chipped away at states powers but when it comes to the health and safety of citizens today it will be the governors and not the president who will be the ultimate deciders here tell us what you think do you think trump is right and that he has the authority to force states to end restrictive measures or should he be quiet and let the states decide for themselves tell us your thoughts on this important issue in the comment section below

paytm s ipo is closer than ever after regulatory approval and reliance is prepping more investments towards its super app the biggest buzz this past week was created by the approval for paytm s massive ipo which is seen as a litmus test for fintech as a sector in india elsewhere reliance jio announced major gains in arpu and profits for q2 fy22 and is preparing further investments towards its super app before we go into paytm s ipo and jio s plans here are two stories that caught our attention under fire from indian startups and app developers over its commissions tech giant google has announced a 50 cut in its share of app revenue fintech unicorn phonepe has started charging users a commission for mobile recharges as a small scale experiment see what it means here paytm plans big bang ipo after zomato s ipo in india and freshworks listing on nasdaq all eyes are on the paytm ipo the fintech giant got the final nod from sebi for its ipo and we expect paytm to go for listing close to diwali founded by vijay shekhar sharma in 2000 paytm began its journey as a value added service provider but it has evolved over the years with an array of fintech products and services with more being added each day paytm is today one of the biggest digital payments companies in india with its offering spread across digital payments like upi credit and debit cards wealth management through paytm money banking services through paytm payments bank and more this is considered a key strength for the company the fintech giant is said to be on track to break even in 12 18 months and analysts expect paytm to lead the payments and fintech market because of its diversification but the valuation sought in the ipo has also been called too rich by many it was back in july that the fintech giant had filed its drhp in a bid to raise inr 16 600 cr and since then there has been plenty of debate on whether paytm s business stands up to this tall ask famously valuation guru stern school of business new york s aswath damodaran valued the fintech major at 20 bn as per its revenue track record and the typical trading multiple associated with fintech companies according to inc42 sources paytm is seeking a 20 bn 22 bn valuation for its ipo it was valued at 16 bn in november 2019 paytm plans to use inr 4 300 cr from the ipo proceeds to grow and strengthen its ecosystem by acquisition and retention of customers and merchants and it plans to invest inr 2 000 cr for new business initiatives acquisitions and strategic partnerships the big challenge for paytm is that other companies are cognisant of its diversified services base and are gunning for it too walmart owned phonepe is looking beyond upi towards wealth management insurance broking asset management license and more sachin bansal owned navi technologies is another competitor and is also looking for a universal banking license in recent weeks bharatpe has emerged as another rival with its small finance banking license which gives it more flexibility in banking operations than paytm which only has a payments bank license but paytm s depth in each fintech vertical is also a key strength for the company in the fintech slugfest this is largely down to the fact that paytm is often one of the early movers in new segments it capitalises on its massive user base and technology stack to double down on new plays there s a feeling that its competitors will take several years to match this scale across payments wealth management insurance stock broking and more indian startups ipo corner after the unicorn buzz created in the first half of october the past week was about the ipo and related buzz nykaa paytm and policybazaar received sebi s approval for their ipos nykaa will be making its stock

a column of candy left featured in tiktok videos is displayed at it sugar candy store on the upper east side of new york ap photo mary altaffer near the twizzlers and sour patch kids at it sugar are random items fidget toys fruit shaped soft jelly candies that earned a spot on the candy store s shelves because they went viral on tiktok a flood of videos last year showed people biting into the fruit gummies plastic casing squirting artificially colored jelly from their mouths store staffers urged the company to stock up and the gummies did so well that it sugar decided to make tiktok part of its sales strategy the chain now has signs with the app s logo in stores and goods from tiktok make up 5 to 10 of weekly sales that s an insane number said chris lindstedt the assistant vice president of merchandising at it sugar which has about 100 locations tiktok an app best known for dancing videos with 1 billion users worldwide has also become a shopping phenomenon national chains hoping to get tiktok s mostly young users into its stores are setting up tiktok sections reminiscent of as seen on tv stores that sold products hawked on infomercials at barnes noble tables display signs with booktok a book recommendation hashtag on tiktok that has pushed paperbacks up the bestseller list amazon has a section of its site it calls internet famous with lists of products that anyone who has spent time on tiktok would recognize the hashtag tiktokmademebuyit has gotten more than 5 billion views on tiktok and the app has made a grab bag of products a surprise hit leggings purses cleaners even feta cheese videos of a baked feta pasta recipe sent the salty white cheese flying out of supermarket refrigerators earlier this year it s hard to crack the code of what becomes the next tiktok sensation how tiktok decides who gets to see what remains largely a mystery companies are often caught off guard and tend to swoop in after their product has taken off showering creators with free stuff hiring them to appear in commercials or buying up ads on tiktok it was a little bit of a head scratcher at first said jenny campbell the chief marketing officer of kate spade remembering when searches for heart spiked on kate spade s website earlier this year the culprit turned out to be a 60 second clip on tiktok posted by 22 year old nathalie covarrubias she recorded herself in a parked car gushing about a pink heart shaped purse she d just bought others copied her video posting tiktoks of themselves buying the bag or trying it on with different outfits the 300 heart shaped purse sold out i couldn t believe it because i wasn t trying to advertise the bag said covarrubias a makeup artist from salinas california who wasn t paid to post the video i really was so excited and happy about the purse and how unique it was kate spade sent covarrubias free items in exchange for posting another tiktok when the bag was back in stores that video was marked as an ad it turned what was supposed to be a limited valentine s day purse into one sold year round in different colors and fabrics such as faux fur tiktok is a powerful purchasing push for gen z because the creators seem authentic as opposed to instagram where the goal is to post the most perfect looking selfie said hana ben shabat the founder of gen z planet her advisory firm focuses on the generation born between the late 1990s and 2016 a cohort that practically lives on tiktok users trust the recommendations she said this is a real person telling me a real story instagram youtube and other platforms connected people with friends or random funny videos before marketers realized their selling potential for tiktok losing the veneer of authenticity as more ads and ways to shop flood the app could be a risk if ads are blatant or awkward it s more of a problem said colin campbell an assistant professor of marketing at the university of san diego influencers who get paid to shill for brands are getting better at pitching goods to their followers telling them that even though they get paid they re recommending a product they actually like they feel like they are our friend even though they aren t he said channah myers a 21 year old barista from goodyear arizona bought a pair of 50 aerie leggings after seeing several tiktok videos of women saying the cross banding on the waist gave them a more hourglass like figure it s funny i shop religiously at aerie and i had no idea they existed until i saw them on tiktok myers said after those aerie leggings went viral on tiktok in 2020 the teen retailer expanded the same design to biker shorts tennis skirts and bikini bottoms all of which can be found by searching tiktok on aerie s website it wouldn t say how many of the leggings sold tiktok along with other tech companies like snapchat is gearing up to challenge facebook as a social shopping powerhouse shopping on social media sites known as social commerce is a 37 billion market in the u s according to emarketer mostly coming from instagram and its parent company facebook by the end of 2025 that number is expected to more than double to 80 billion last month tiktok began testing a way for brands to set up shop within the app and send users to checkout on their sites but tiktok has hinted that more is coming it may eventually look more like douyin tiktok s sister app in china where products can be bought and sold without leaving the app just like you can on facebook and instagram over the past year we ve witnessed a new kind of shopping experience come to life that s been driven by the tiktok community said tiktok general manager sandie hawkins who works with brands to get them to buy ads on the app and help them boost sales we re excited to continue listening to our community and building solutions that help them discover engage and purchase the products they love that includes the pink stuff a british cleaning product that wasn t available in the u s last year that all changed when videos of people using it to scrub rusty pots and greasy countertops went viral on tiktok pushing the brand to cross the atlantic it launched in the u s in january on amazon with 1 3 million tubs sold monthly and is getting calls from major stores wanting to stock it according to sal pesce president and chief operating officer of the the pink stuff u s i ve never seen anything like this he said candy featured in tiktok videos is seen at it sugar candy store on the upper east side of new york ap photo mary altaffer
by noriyuki suzuki kyodo news oct 24 2021 09 14 all japan japanese prime minister fumio kishida may have witnessed the harsh reality of how investors react when his suggestion of higher capital gains tax rates apparently sent japanese stocks lower shortly after he was elected president of the ruling party last month heading into the house of representatives election at the end of october japan s ruling and opposition parties are making campaign promises that if realized could also have ramifications for financial markets some items are more feasible than others because they are already in the works but there are also ambitious ideas that experts deem difficult to realize one of the more controversial ones is a review of the requirement for companies in japan to disclose quarterly earnings reports in his first policy speech in parliament kishida who became prime minister on oct 4 touched on the idea as part of his efforts to focus on redistribution the key theme for his goal of creating a new form of capitalism the liberal democratic party led by kishida also included that promise in its election platform behind the call is the view that companies should be relieved from the time and resource consuming task of compiling financial reports every three months and that the practice makes them focused on chasing short term profits on the flip side however the rule change could make japan and companies look like they were taking a step back in terms of information disclosure experts say for investors the more information they have the better said shoichi tsumuraya a professor at hitotsubashi university tsumuraya an expert in finance and accounting said the change will require a revision to the country s relevant law adding it is unrealistic to do so because he doubts it is a pressing issue still i m of the view that the disclosure of reports every quarter should be left to each company because they can spend more time with shareholders talking about mid to long term plans instead japan has been pushing for corporate governance reform since the time of former prime minister shinzo abe who was mindful of the considerable presence that foreign investors have in the country s stock markets his abenomics policy mix entailing bold monetary easing by the bank of japan fiscal stimulus and structural reform helped weaken the yen lift japanese shares and boost corporate earnings masakazu tokura chairman of the japan business federation said quarterly disclosure is a tool for companies to communicate with shareholders striking a cautious note a rapid change to the system would cause unwanted confusion in markets and we believe the issue should be considered carefully the keidanren chief told a recent press briefing kishida is also seeking to expand what is known as a university fund to 10 trillion yen by the end of march 2023 the fund which is scheduled to be launched in the current fiscal year aims to bolster research at universities with its investment profits media polls show the ruling coalition of the ldp and komeito is expected to secure a majority of the 465 seats up for grabs in the election making some pledges more attainable the ruling parties support developing a green international financial center in japan for bonds issued to address climate change and help attain carbon neutrality the japanese government has already unveiled the idea japan pledged to bring carbon dioxide emissions to net zero by 2050 when kishida s predecessor yoshihide suga was prime minister putting it on par with the united states and europe it s not just japan that needs to work toward carbon neutrality and expand markets for sustainable bonds said takuya nomura a senior economist at the japan research institute japan is still in the phase of developing a framework but needs to move it forward if it wants to raise its presence while hong kong and singapore are running far ahead nomura said britain luxemburg hong kong and singapore are among the leading markets for green bonds used to finance environmentally friendly projects government support is seen as critical to developing something similar in japan some opposition parties are proposing more drastic ideas in their campaign platforms for the election in which they aim to show they can be a viable alternative to the ruling coalition the major opposition constitutional democratic party of japan wants to introduce progressive corporate tax rates meaning that the more a company earns the more tax burden they should shoulder the cdpj is also calling for higher capital gains tax rates an idea that kishida has apparently entertained but the ldp did not include in its campaign platform the democratic party for the people is floating the idea of education bonds to make education free from preschool through high school it plans to secure 50 trillion yen over a decade by using the bonds taking issue with the current government spending on education the smaller opposition party also proposed to make some of the boj s massive holdings of japanese government bonds perpetual to reduce debt servicing costs though kishida appears to have reservations about it the boj owns over 40 percent of japanese government bonds as part of its aggressive monetary easing with total state debt twice the size of the economy my focus is on whether or how the country s fiscal stance would change said takuya hoshino a senior economist at the dai ichi life research institute there are items that are particularly geared toward appealing to voters raising the capital gains tax may be controversial but its impact on tax revenue would only be limited after all hoshino said
deal on biden s 2t plan edges closer harris is confident president joe biden participates in a cnn town hall at the baltimore center stage pearlstone theater thursday oct 21 2021 in baltimore ap photo evan vucci washington ap a deal within reach president joe biden and congress top democrats edged close to sealing their giant domestic legislation though the informal deadline appeared to slip as they worked to scale back the measure and determine how to pay for it negotiations were expected to continue into the weekend all sides indicating just a few issues remained unsettled in the sweeping package of social services and climate change strategies biden met at the white house on friday with house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader chuck schumer joined by video call from from new york trying to shore up details the leaders have been working with party moderates and progressives to shrink the once 3 5 trillion 10 year package to around 2 trillion in child care health care and clean energy programs pelosi said a deal was very possible she told reporters back at the capitol that more than 90 of the package was agreed to the climate change components of the bill are resolved but outstanding questions remained on health care provisions vice president kamala harris sounded even more certain on a visit to new york city she said tensions often rise over final details but i am confident frankly not only optimistic but i am confident that we will reach a deal no agreement was announced by friday s self imposed deadline to at least agree on a basic outline biden wants a deal before he leaves next week for global summits in europe pelosi hoped the house could start voting as soon as next week but no schedule was set sticking points appear to include proposed corporate tax hikes to help finance the plan and an effort to lower prescription drug costs that has raised concerns from the pharmaceutical industry democrats are in search of a broad compromise between the party s progressives and moderates on the measure s price tag revenue sources and basic components at the white house the president has rolled up his sleeves and is deep in the details of spreadsheets and numbers press secretary jen psaki said biden was to spend the weekend at his home in wilmington delaware psaki compared the work to starting social security and other major federal programs decades ago then building on them in following years progress here is a historic package that will put in place systems and programs that have never existed in our society before she said noting the effort to expand child care and provide free prekindergarten for all youngsters negotiations are proceeding as biden more forcefully appeals to the american public including in a televised town hall for what he says are the middle class values at the heart of his proposal in a senate that is evenly divided between the democrats and firmly opposed republicans biden can t afford to lose a single vote he is navigating his own party s factions progressives who want major investments in social services and centrists who prefer to see the overall price tag go down when you re president of the united states you have 50 democrats every one is a president every single one so you gotta work things out he said during a cnn town hall thursday still he expressed optimism about the process it s all about compromise compromise has become a dirty word but bipartisanship and compromise still has to be possible he said on one issue the taxes to pay for the package the white house idea seemed to be making headway with a new strategy of abandoning plans for reversing trump era tax cuts in favor of an approach that would involve imposing a 15 corporate minimum tax and also taxing the investment incomes of billionaires to help finance the deal biden has faced resistance from key holdouts in particular sen kyrsten sinema d ariz who has not been on board with her party s plan to undo president donald trump s tax breaks for big corporations and individuals earning more than 400 000 a year the president was unusually forthcoming thursday night about the sticking points in the negotiations with sinema and another democrat conservative sen joe manchin of west virginia while the president said sinema opposed raising a single penny in taxes on the wealthy or corporations a white house official later clarified that the president was referring to raising the top tax rates not the range of tax proposals which sen sinema supports if so that could unlock a key piece of a deal with a better understanding of the revenues available democrats can then develop a topline amount of spending for the package and adjust the duration and sums for various programs accordingly biden said manchin doesn t want to rush the transition to clean energy so quickly it will result in major job losses in his coal producing state even still biden acknowledged major reductions to his original vision he signaled the final plan would no longer provide free community college but said he hoped to increase pell grants to compensate for the loss of the policy he also said that what had been envisioned as a federally paid months long family leave program would be just four weeks another work in progress the idea of expanding medicare to include dental vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors is a priority for sen bernie sanders the independent of vermont biden said he likes the idea but with manchin and sinema objecting the proposal is a reach instead democrats he said are considering offering seniors an 800 voucher to access dental care as well as another program for hearing aids that sinema may support however the vision care component biden said has been harder to resolve and there is no consensus yet overall biden and his party are trying to shore up middle class households tackle climate change and have the most wealthy americans and corporations pay what he calls their fair share for the nation in the mix are at least 500 billion in clean energy tax credits and other efforts to battle climate change 350 billion for child care subsidies and free prekindergarten an extension of the 300 monthly child tax credit put in place during the covid 19 crisis and money for health care provided through the affordable care act the newly proposed tax provisions though have rankled democrats who have long campaigned on scrapping the republican backed tax cuts that many believe unduly reward the wealthy and cost the government untold sums in lost revenue at a time of gaping income inequality many are furious that perhaps a lone senator could stymie that goal under the changes being floated the 21 corporate rate would not change nor would the top individual rate of 39 6 on those earning 400 000 or 450 000 for couples however the white house is reviving the idea of a corporate minimum tax rate that would hit even companies that say they had no taxable income a frequent target of biden who complains they pay zero in taxes the new tax on the wealthiest individuals would be modeled on legislation from sen ron wyden d ore chairman of the senate finance committee he has proposed taxing stock gains of people with more than 1 billion in assets fewer than 1 000 americans

and programs that have never existed in our society before she said noting the effort to expand child care and provide free prekindergarten for all youngsters negotiations are proceeding as biden more forcefully appeals to the american public including in a televised town hall for what he says are the middle class values at the heart of his proposal in a senate that is evenly divided between the democrats and firmly opposed republicans biden can t afford to lose a single vote he is navigating his own party s factions progressives who want major investments in social services and centrists who prefer to see the overall price tag go down when you re president of the united states you have 50 democrats every one is a president every single one so you gotta work things out he said during a cnn town hall thursday still he expressed optimism about the process it s all about compromise compromise has become a dirty word but bipartisanship and compromise still has to be possible he said on one issue the taxes to pay for the package the white house idea seemed to be making headway with a new strategy of abandoning plans for reversing trump era tax cuts in favor of an approach that would involve imposing a 15 corporate minimum tax and also taxing the investment incomes of billionaires to help finance the deal biden has faced resistance from key holdouts in particular sen kyrsten sinema d ariz who has not been on board with her party s plan to undo president donald trump s tax breaks for big corporations and individuals earning more than 400 000 a year the president was unusually forthcoming thursday night about the sticking points in the negotiations with sinema and another democrat conservative sen joe manchin of west virginia while the president said sinema opposed raising a single penny in taxes on the wealthy or corporations a white house official later clarified that the president was referring to raising the top tax rates not the range of tax proposals which sen sinema supports if so that could unlock a key piece of a deal with a better understanding of the revenues available democrats can then develop a topline amount of spending for the package and adjust the duration and sums for various programs accordingly biden said manchin doesn t want to rush the transition to clean energy so quickly it will result in major job losses in his coal producing state even still biden acknowledged major reductions to his original vision he signaled the final plan would no longer provide free community college but said he hoped to increase pell grants to compensate for the loss of the policy he also said that what had been envisioned as a federally paid months long family leave program would be just four weeks another work in progress the idea of expanding medicare to include dental vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors is a priority for sen bernie sanders the independent of vermont biden said he likes the idea but with manchin and sinema objecting the proposal is a reach instead democrats he said are considering offering seniors an 800 voucher to access dental care as well as another program for hearing aids that sinema may support however the vision care component biden said has been harder to resolve and there is no consensus yet overall biden and his party are trying to shore up middle class households tackle climate change and have the most wealthy americans and corporations pay what he calls their fair share for the nation in the mix are at least 500 billion in clean energy tax credits and other efforts to battle climate change 350 billion for child care subsidies and free prekindergarten an extension of the 300 monthly child tax credit put in place during the covid 19 crisis and money for health care provided through the affordable care act the newly proposed tax provisions though have rankled democrats who have long campaigned on scrapping the republican backed tax cuts that many believe unduly reward the wealthy and cost the government untold sums in lost revenue at a time of gaping income inequality many are furious that perhaps a lone senator could stymie that goal under the changes being floated the 21 corporate rate would not change nor would the top individual rate of 39 6 on those earning 400 000 or 450 000 for couples however the white house is reviving the idea of a corporate minimum tax rate that would hit even companies that say they had no taxable income a frequent target of biden who complains they pay zero in taxes the new tax on the wealthiest individuals would be modeled on legislation from sen ron wyden d ore chairman of the senate finance committee he has proposed taxing stock gains of people with more than 1 billion in assets fewer than 1 000 americans ___

the bilsdale mast operators are considering offering to pay for a dongle for the probable more than 40 000 households in a not spot not covered by the temporary mast but is this one step forward and three steps backward i have been able to get online to find out what these dongles can do they seem to require a tv with the version of something called hdmi first introduced in november 2017 and not widely fitted to new tvs until mid 2018 if your television is more than three and a half years old it seems tough luck a second requirement is an internet connection ideally with a signal strength of more than 15 mb 15mb in the dales is something many can only dream of wait a minute though if you have broadband you are 99 per cent likely to have a computer with a computer you can watch many tv programmes including bbc but not ceefax red button for free either on your computer or on your tv if both accept an hdmi cable if you have either slow broadband or no broadband as is true for many elderly people and cannot get a tv signal at home then thinking a free dongle is a solution indicates a complete lack of understanding of the real world problems for many people caused by no signal availability some say the performance so far of the mast operators arqiva has not been fit for purpose they could be right len shepherd leyburn crossing danger jay walkers in northallerton are risking serious injury at the pedestrian crossing leading to tesco car park on east road close to the former prison when traffic stops on red on east road some pedestrians assume wrongly that it is immediately safe to cross however traffic then comes from the link road round the corner unaware some pedestrians fail to wait for the lights round the corner to turn red drivers from the link should of course drive with appropriate care but it would only take one to knock down an unaware pedestrian stepping out in front of them the problem is that pedestrians cannot see vehicles waiting on the link having a puffin crossing near a junction compounds the risk puffin crossings lack the more obvious pelican style red green man showing clearly on the opposite side of the road instead pedestrians need to watch for a green light on a post on the side opposite tesco car park entrance and adjacent to the junction the post is actually behind them given that some seem to know better than the puffin when it is safe to cross i hope that you and your readers will support action to reduce pedestrian exposure to a crossing accident i have contacted north yorkshire county council you can add you support at northyorks gov uk request highways improvement njl gardener northallerton town congestion now that north yorkshire county council nycc highways has cancelled the regulations that effectively banned through traffic from northallerton high street on the wednesday and saturday markets with very little notice to all concerned it s worth noting that one of the reasons quoted for this action was the increase in traffic and subsequent congestion due to the relaxation in the covid regulations if the nycc highways could be bothered to investigate further the reasons for congestion they would find that it occurs in four main areas the roundabout at the bottom of south parade the roundabout in friarage street that goes up brompton road the pedestrian crossing at the junction of the high street and friarage street and the roundabout at the junction of the high street and friarage street the main reasons for congestion are inconsiderate drivers who block access and egress at these roundabouts frightened they may lose their place and the heavy use of the pedestrian crossing particularly at lunchtimes and school leaving times this is particularly galling as the nycc highways have been approached many times about the problems and dangers to pedestrians using this crossing over the years their stock answer being the solution would be worse than the problem surely congestion would be eased if some drivers were more considerate to others the roundabouts wouldn t get blocked up and nycc highways can give some considerable thought to solving the problem of the pedestrian crossing rather than just saying we ve looked at this before and it can t be fixed without making things worse john prest northallerton inspirational i read with interest your article about dr barningham returning to richmond school to talk about antarctica antarctica survey leader inspires future experts d s times oct 8 it reminded me so much of my own experience many years ago when i was at school i attended a similar lecture that so enthused me it turned into one of those life changing events as i too went to work for the british antarctic survey measuring ozone in the days before robots perhaps someone from richmond school will be similarly inspired robin harmar great ayton waste removal fees i read with interest your article warning to fly tippers d s times oct 15 it brought to mind my own recent experiences my granddaughter lives in washington tyne and wear and needed three large items removed from her home i booked this with the local council who charged 10 which could include up to five separate items no problem two weeks later the council collected said items a couple of weeks later we had to purchase a new tumble dryer i contacted our council to arrange removal of the old one and to my surprise for up to five separate items the cost was 47 of course i had to make other arrangements now i fully condemn any illegal tipping especially in our beautiful countryside however it makes me wonder which council has the best policy in their efforts to eradicate fly tipping ken parkinson hunton development sites frances stone has indeed had a short sharp introduction to the local planning process regarding the large scale application for a country store and hotel in leyburn planning debacle d s times letters oct 15 the democratic system is clearly undermined by the need to make a large profit in this case it will be at the cost of a textbook example of a fine meadow with dry stone walls and a long established ecosystem however it isn t making money the worked out quarry in leyburn is clearly brownfield and it is out of sight it would be the obvious solution i am unclear as to why this particular field must be developed presumably it is the gateway for more infill housing and more money making i feel sorry for the objectors who are happy to live in a small dales town which has now clearly been designated as a tourist parking point however why will tourists flock to see yet more urban sprawl rather than a pretty dales community given the large amount of planned development eg at scotch corner and colburn both deliberately destroying green field sites for all future generations and again simply to make money may i suggest that richmondshire district council now formally re names itself richmondshire urban district council susan chipping catterick early lockdown the government delayed for several weeks before deciding the country should go into lockdown my wife and i had been very concerned for a long time before then that we should be doing that two weeks before the government eventually took its decision my wife and i locked down it was not easy cutting ourselves off from friends and family like that but it had been obvious it was the right decision from what had been happening abroad the government denied that it had a policy of herd immunity but it was clear from what several ministers had said that such was in their minds it is now confirmed in the parliamentary report that the government s inaction cost many thousands of lives was not this the government putting money before saving lives mervyn wilmington harmby climate threat in response to alastair welsh cancel culture d s times letters oct 15 i was not proposing that climate change deniers should be denied freedom of speech the editor of these august pages has given mr welsh and his one or two fellow travellers more than enough space to spread their defeatist and anti science message more than enough ninety seven per cent of scientists say that anthropogenic climate change is a real and present threat ninety five per cent of us believe the scientists and that rational response is confirmed by the evidence of global weather patterns even to those of us who are not scientists the comparison with the flat earth society was a little unfortunate for him i am pretty sure that most of us would agree that it is the deniers who sound like flat earthers similarly it is not just the green party every serious political party including the conservative government has for some time recognised the reality and seriousness of the threat to civilization and nature the climate crisis is certainly very difficult to face and it will probably take the equivalent of a war effort over several decades to meet the challenge at cop26 all the nations of the world are coming together to work out how humanity tackles this enormous challenge and our local mp is a pivotal figure much more serious than mr welsh and co does mr sunak get it does he want to be the villain of the piece or the hero of the hour if unlike mr welsh you take climate change seriously and care about the future of your children and grandchildren please write to rishi sunak house of commons london sw1a 0aa or email rishi sunak mp parliament uk to tell him as your representative to take urgent and effective action on climate change now rd hildyard colburn climate debate r d hildyard asks whether climate change deniers should be given space to air their views positive message d s times letters oct 8 but goes on to say the views of citizens and voters on climate change do matter an old saying comes to mind i may disagree with what you say but i defend your right to say it i disagree with the views of climate change deniers but giving space to people with whom we disagree should and does stimulate debate which is a positive thing as long as it does not descend into a slanging match as to whether their letters should appear so often another saying comes to mind give a man enough rope and he will hang himself g cunningham ripon plant changes alastair welsh is right to comment regarding the changes in plants affected by increased co2 emissions cancel culture d s times letters oct 15 the facts are there for all to see if we look the university of washington has recently carried out studies on the thickening of leaves in trees as co2 emissions increase as a professor of atmospheric science and biology abigail swann the author of said report has my attention she says because of that thickening trees and plants have become less productive in the area of co2 removal the global carbon sink or capture capability of those plants has decreased by a little over a phenomenal six billion tonnes per year because of this thickening global temperatures could rise by even more than predicted estimated between 0 3 and 1 4 c on top of those temperature rises already feared through the burning of fossil fuels she goes on to say plants are crucial modulators of their environment without them the earth s atmosphere would not contain the oxygen we breathe the d s times has a duty to publish

how nigeria can maximise oil price increase despite the gradual increase in global oil prices in recent times there are indications that this development may not bode well for nigeria s economy this is the damning verdict delivered by austin okere the founder of cwg plc the largest ict company on the nigerian stock exchange entrepreneur in residence at cbs new york in a statement entitled nigeria and oil looking beyond price collapse towards post recovery savings okere said the surge in crude oil prices surpassing 82 a barrel on october 11 2021 presents nigeria with another golden opportunity that should not be floundered going down memory lane okere who also serves on the advisory board of the global business school network and on the world economic forum global agenda council on innovation and intrapreneurship recalled that the recurrent mistake we keep making as a nation is failing to anticipate and plan for our oil windfalls there have been many boom opportunities since nigeria joined the organisation of petroleum exporting countries opec in 1971 oil prices increased by 400 in six short months after the yom kippur war following the arab oil embargo crude prices doubled from 14 in 1978 to 35 per barrel in 1981 following the iran iraq war the price of crude oil spiked in 1990 with the uncertainties associated the iraqi invasion of kuwait and the ensuring gulf war the so called gulf war windfall under then head of state ibrahim babangida data from the u s energy information administration shows that the latest windfall happened between february 2011 and august 2014 under the goodluck jonathan presidency when oil prices were much in excess of 100 per barrel another golden opportunity was squandered characterised by organised kleptocracy of epic proportions as has now come to light interestingly he noted that during this same period saudi arabia has amassed a whopping 593b in foreign exchange reserves and has recently announced that it is creating a 2 trillion mega sovereign wealth fund while lamenting that nigeria by far the biggest producer in africa with 2 5mbpd has only managed foreign reserves of 28b and a sovereign wealth fund of a paltry 2 9b about 5 that of algeria noting that the major difference being that while the algerians saved for a rainy day during the boom years nigeria was busy squandering her wealth with nothing to show by way of infrastructure or any solid investments it is bothersome that with the same level of oil price nigeria today is struggling to balance her budget and has resorted to aggressive borrowing to finance the deficit inadvertently driving us back to where we were before escaping from the huge burden of sovereign debt and the attendant debilitating impact of debt servicing

new york love cryptocurrencies or hate the very idea of them they re becoming more mainstream by the day cryptocurrencies have surged so much that their total value has reached nearly 2 5 trillion rivaling the world s most valuable company apple and have amassed more than 200 million users at that size it s simply too big for the financial establishment to ignore firms that cater to the world s wealthiest families are increasingly putting some of their fortunes into crypto hedge funds are trading bitcoin which has big name banks starting to offer them services around it paypal lets users buy crypto on its app while twitter helps people show appreciation for tweets by tipping their creators with bitcoin and in the latest milestone for the industry an easy to trade fund tied to bitcoin began trading last week investors can buy the exchange traded fund from proshares through an old school brokerage account without having to learn what a hot or cold wallet is it s all part of a movement across big businesses that see a chance to profit on the fervor around the world of crypto as a new ecosystem further builds up around it whether they believe in it or not the one thing you can say for certain is that the advent of the era of the bitcoin etf opens up the opportunity for wall street to make money on bitcoin in a way that it hadn t been able to previously said ben johnson director of global etf research at morningstar the winners in all of this are the exchanges and the asset managers and the custodians whether investors win or not is a big bold question mark bitcoin has come a long way since someone or a group of someones under the name satoshi nakamoto wrote a paper in 2008 about how to harness computing power around the world to create a digital currency that can t be double spent the price has more than doubled this year alone to roughly 62 000 it was at only 635 five years ago supporters of cryptocurrencies say they offer an ultraimportant benefit for any investor something whose price moves independently of the economy rather than tracking it like so many other investments do more high minded fans say digital assets are simply the future of finance allowing transactions to sidestep middlemen and fees with a currency that s not beholden to any government critics meanwhile question whether crypto is just a fad say it uses too much energy and point to all the stiff regulatory scrutiny shining on it china last month declared bitcoin transactions illegal for example the chair of the u s securities and exchange commission gary gensler said in august that the world of crypto doesn t have enough investor protection and it s more like the wild west that hasn t been enough to halt the immense momentum for crypto as it s gone from an online curiosity to a bigger part of the cultural and corporate landscape u s bank earlier this month said it has begun offering a cryptocurrency custody service for big investment managers that means it essentially holds their bitcoin in safekeeping for them and it expects to offer support for other coins soon other name brand banks have also announced intentions to offer custodial services for crypto it s not just in the fringes and dark corners of the web that it s happening said kashif ahmed president of american private wealth in bedford mass ahmed doesn t recommend his clients invest in crypto before then he said he ll need to be able to go to my local supermarket and buy things for my family and offer crypto and not be laughed out of the store but others are more willing to try it in a survey by citi private bank of family offices around the world that manage money for wealthy people roughly 23 said they have made some investments in crypto another 25 said they are researching it the growing acceptance of crypto on wall street has created a new crop of darlings that help people buy it crypto trading platform coinbase has a market value of roughly 64 billion for example putting it on par with such established companies as colgate palmolive fedex and ford motor at robinhood markets meanwhile the company that became famous for getting a new generation of investors into the stock market is increasingly becoming a place for crypto trading this spring was the first time when new robinhood customers were more likely to make their first trade in cryptocurrencies rather than in stocks in the end what many on wall street see lasting may not be as much bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as the technology that underlies them called the blockchain it allows for a public ledger that everyone can check and trust and many expect it to lead to a wealth of innovations it s akin to today s netflix facebook and other services that sprung out of the infrastructure built during the boom and bust of the dot com bubble the applications built on this new software architecture appear to be growing more quickly than past technologies bank of america strategists alkesh shah and andrew moss wrote in a recent research report positing that digital assets are only in their first inning of growth new companies are likely to emerge and poorly positioned companies will exit creating significant upside potential for some and downside for others jpmorgan chase for example is already using blockchain technology to improve fund transfers between global banks that s the same jpmorgan chase run by ceo jamie dimon who said in an interview with axios this month that bitcoin has got no intrinsic value
section 113 of the dodd frank act9 gives the fsoc the authority to determine that a u s nonbank financial company shall be supervised by the board of governors and shall be subject to prudential standards if the fsoc determines that material financial distress at the u s nonbank financial company or the nature scope size scale concentration interconnectedness or mix of the activities of the u s nonbank financial company could pose a threat to the financial stability of the united states 10 as mentioned the u s code does not define the term financial stability separately section 120 of dodd frank authorizes the fsoc to make recommendations to the appropriate financial regulators most of which are on the fsoc to apply heightened regulations the fsoc can make such recommendations for a financial activity or practice conducted by bank holding companies or nonbank financial companies if the fsoc determines that the conduct scope nature size scale concentration or interconnectedness of such activity or practice could create or increase the risk of significant liquidity credit or other problems spreading among bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies financial markets of the united states or low income minority or underserved communities 11 given the uncertainty surrounding how it might review financial firms and activities the fsoc has issued rules and guidance to clarify how it might fulfill its statutory duties based on interpretative guidance it issued in 2019 the fsoc now generally pursues an activities based approach for section 113 recommendations rather than singling out specific companies 12 this guidance states that the fsoc will pursue entity specific determinations under section 113 of the dodd frank act only if a potential risk or threat cannot be adequately addressed through an activities based approach 13 still no statutory requirement binds the fsoc to using the activities based approach and any future fsoc can issue new guidance that outlines an alternative method the 2019 guidance explains that to implement the activities based approach for nonbank financial firms the fsoc will examine a diverse range of financial products activities and practices that could pose risks to u s financial stability 14 the guidance also states that when monitoring potential risks to financial stability the council intends to consider the linkages across products activities and practices and their interconnectedness across firms and markets and that its monitoring may include among other items information such as historical data research regarding the behavior of financial market participants and new developments that arise in evolving marketplaces 15 separately the guidance notes that the fsoc will assess the extent to which several characteristics could amplify potential risks to u s financial stability arising from products activities or practices where these characteristics include credit risk leverage liquidity risk counterparty risk operational risks growth in nonregulated financial sectors and the risk to stability from essentially any financial instrument 16 partly because it is difficult to objectively evaluate even these specific characteristics the fsoc s guidance explains that it will generally focus on four framing questions how could the potential risk be triggered how could the adverse effects of the potential risk be transmitted to financial markets or market participants what impact could the potential risk have on the financial system could the adverse effects of the potential risk impair the financial system in a manner that could harm the nonfinancial sector of the u s economy 17 arguably this framework does provide more transparency and certainty than previously issued fsoc guidance still congress gave the council enormous discretion to issue new rules and regulations and even to restrict the ability of firms to offer a product or service simply put the dodd frank act gave federal regulators the authority to selectively define financial stability and to impose new regulations based on subjectively determined potential threats to their own concept of financial stability giving federal regulators the power to designate firms for special regulations and to outlaw or curtail specific economic activities based on ill defined concepts is inconsistent with a system of free enterprise or of limited government a brief comparison of the current risks in the housing market versus the theoretical risks in stablecoin markets helps demonstrate why congress should not have delegated this sort of authority to federal regulators

terrifying weather events had brought a renewed sense of urgency to the matter then the energy crisis struck leaving asia and europe scrambling for fossil fuels forcing china to double down on coal

covid safe distance article content where it all begins rome cop will be held in glasgow scotland but the group of 20 summit in rome just a few days before will set the tone as climate will dominate the agenda with talks on coal use net zero goals and climate finance so far the g20 which includes major emitters china and india has little to show for many summit hours meetings this month even

jinping russian president vladimir putin and brazilian president jair bolsonaro still almost 200 countries will be represented some delegates will be there in person some will dial in from home and there will be strict rules on masks numbers allowed in negotiating rooms and covid testing the pandemic has added extra obstacles and some countries go into the talks resentful of what they perceive as unequal access leaders mark their homework under the landmark paris agreement of 2015 countries have to regularly review their pollution reduction pledges in order to ensure the world stays on track to limit the rise in temperature to close to 1 5 degree celsius the first promises called nationally determined contributions or ndcs were submitted in 2016 but it was clear that they were well short of what science says is needed while some nations have already submitted new pledges over the past year several major economies including china and india haven t the plans made so far would lead to a 2 4 degrees increase in temperature by the end of the century according to the nonprofit research group climate action tracker at the start of cop there s a moment of taking stock to see just how far away we still are from keeping 1 5 degrees within reach u s climate envoy john kerry has already acknowledged the plans probably won t be enough and one aim of glasgow is to make sure countries

bloody hard that s the bad news the goals the u k hosts describe the aims for this cop as coal cars cash and trees that means ending the use of the most polluting fossil fuel phasing out the internal combustion engine raising cash to help developing countries transition to cleaner energy and protect against the ravages of climate change and reversing deforestation they also aim to figure out global rules for pricing and trading carbon globally expect posturing and grand statements in the first two days along with perhaps some new pledges then the leaders leave and the real work starts priority coal my personal priority coal says cop president alok sharma the u k presidency has set a target for the meeting to consign coal to history and has been pushing for the goal at g7 and g20 meetings this year with mixed success so far but coal is still a massive part of the energy mix and the recent surge in energy prices has forced countries into even greater reliance on the fuel china

raise us 100 billion per year to help developing nations transition to cleaner energy but they still haven t delivered on the promise a failure that enrages poor countries and undermines developed world leaders credibility as they push others to make expensive changes total climate finance was us 79 6 billion in 2019 an increase of just 2 per cent from 2018 according to the oecd we absolutely need to meet the us 100 billion says tina stege climate envoy for the marshall islands the delivery of that is a foundational element of the success at cop last month biden doubled the latest u s pledge to us 11 4 billion annually beginning in 2024 but that still has to be approved by congress and activists argue it doesn t come close to the u s s fair share for the fund odi a think tank puts that figure closer to 43 billion based on the u s s wealth emissions and population size finance day follow the money finance ministers central banks and wall street bank ceos will be in glasgow on nov 3 for finance day with a focus on how to green the global financial system and funnel money away from polluting industries and into cleaner ones watch out for pledges to phase out or stop

article content paris loose ends carbon market the paris agreement left some unfinished business that negotiators still haven t been able to tie up how to standardize rules on carbon trading across the world the buzzword to watch is article six referring to those lines in the paris deal that paved the way for a global carbon market but are so complex and controversial that they are yet to be finalized the good news is negotiators are edging toward a deal on this the basic idea is to match carbon sucking projects that reduce pollution with counterparties who need to reduce emissions via a market of so called offsets which could be worth as much as us 100 billion in 2030 according to some estimates the mechanism in theory should drive money to places where the biggest gains can be made most cheaply photo by philippe desmazes afp via getty images offsets are becoming an increasingly important element of decarbonization strategies says lidia wojtal of think tank agora energiewende while there are already various voluntary carbon markets that can provide such credits a deal on article six would make a difference it would guarantee a truly global standard advertisement 7 story

emissions reduction pledges into comparable exchangeable units the framework needs to be flexible enough to attract investment palatable to a range of countries with different priorities and credible some negotiators say a bad deal would be worse than no deal if the rules that emerge aren t robust enough there are two big sticking points one is the need to avoid double counting the other is how to deal with old credits from a now defunct system launched way back in 1997 under the kyoto protocol a good deal would result in a net reduction of emissions globally and the risk is that a bad deal does the opposite broadly speaking developing nations are eager to reap the funds that would come from a new program while richer nations led by the european union are focused on the integrity of the

your article continues below article content the endgame at the end of talks there s likely to be some kind of glasgow declaration the u s and u k have both said they want to make sure countries keep ratcheting up their plans while several leaders are framing cop as a make or break deal for the planet the reality is probably more nuanced a clear win on just one issue will probably count as success and it s possible there will be progress that can be built on down the line meanwhile the role of business and finance is increasingly important banks are mobilizing finance to green the economy and that momentum is likely to be sustained saving face the side deals but as the main goals of ending coal and getting a net zero commitment slip out of reach work is underway to hatch a series of side deals that would go some way to salvaging the talks or at least saving face there s a plan on curbing methane for example which the u s and eu are cajoling others to join and others in the works on aviation and forests the risk though is that if the main communique is so weak that all the action is in the mini deals it raises questions about what s the point of cop and whether climate

might also like stock investors remain unfazed by supply chain snarls retail investing had been on the rise even before the pandemic hit the world but covid 19 gave just the push required to send young investors all over the world to the financial markets in the uk and usa the government stimulus packages put money into the hands of the people who were stuck at home due to the lockdowns with no other way to enhance financial security than try their hand at trading of course retail investors put in much smaller amounts into the markets as compared to institutional investors but their sheer numbers in 2020 21 surprisingly moved the markets consider the january 2021 flashpoints where gamestop was soaring and the term meme stock was coined reddit users took on institutional traders backing gamestop s stock and sending the share price up more than 1 700 compared to december in fact credit suisse estimated that a third of all stock market trading in the us in 2021 is accounted for by retail investors source bloomberg intelligenceindia hasn t been left behind in the worldwide surge in retail investors take a look at the state of the retail investor in india a major shift in investment trends started in post pandemic 2020 when active investor accounts increased by a record 10 4 million in india at the same time retail stock ownership in the 1 500 companies listed on the national stock exchange nse rose 9 in q3 2020 the highest rise since march 2018 retail investor participation continued to grow exponentially in fy21 as well with almost 4 5 million retail investor accounts being added in just the first two months of the fiscal year the total number of retail investors increased by an astonishing 14 2 million in fy21 with 12 25 million new accounts being opened on cdsl 1 9 million in nsdl the result is that the indian stock market is now dominated by retail investors the nse alone saw retail investors share grow from 33 in 2016 to 45 in 2021 the interest isn t abating either with monthly registration of new investors increasing to an all time high of 1 5 million in june 2021 the rise of the retail investment isn t limited to stock trading on exchanges equity mutual funds have also seen a jump with individual investments rising 16 in february 2021 as compared to the same month in the previous year the futures and derivatives markets have also seen unparalleled retail interest the index futures markets which accounts for a major share of the indian derivatives market saw individual investors overtaking institutions in fact 39 of the index futures market is accounted for by retail investors with foreign investors fiis making up only 15 this rise of individual investors is a part of a broader shift among indians away from the traditionally preferred physical assets such as gold and real estate as well as bank deposits this isn t the first time that india has seen a retail investment boom but it certainly is the first time that these first time investors are joining the financial markets from outside the metros of delhi and mumbai brokers and investment firms are seeing an increasing number of new customers coming in from the smaller towns and cities of the country the investing pattern has also changed across regions over the past two years although the northern and western indian regions continue to dominate in terms of the total number of new registrations as of june 2021 northern india accounted for about 37 of the total registrations while east and south india saw an increase in retail interest as compared to 2020 source nseone of the key reasons for this unprecedented increase in individual investors has undoubtedly been the pandemic this is a trend that has been witnessed all across the world salary cuts job losses and an uncertain economic future coupled with lockdowns left millions of people stuck at home looking for ways to augment their financial situation but the pandemic alone couldn t have had such a significant effect without the support of technology firstly the penetration of the internet to the remotest corners of the nation opened up a whole new world of online access for indians this also meant improved accessibility to investment education market news and growing awareness of various forms of investment in addition a significant percentage of investors from tier 2 and 3 cities gained access to newer asset classes and means of portfolio diversification the entry of investors from smaller towns and cities has played a pivotal role in the changing investment landscape in india technological advancements have also empowered investors with robust tools for online trading which offer transparency and access to real time price movements this is a huge shift from the past when real time trade execution was rare given that the only access to the markets was through multiple phone calls to brokers and other market participants tech advancements have also brought us easy to use investment apps while social media has provided access to all the chatter in the investment community twitter telegram reddit etc are home to large and very active investor communities that are always ready to offer their market analysis and investment opinions in addition low interest rates have made traditional investment avenues such as fixed deposits and debt instruments less attractive investors are therefore looking at new avenues that will offer inflation proof returns so is this a transitory occurrence that will revert when the economy recovers or is it the beginning of a behavioural change in india and worldwide it certainly seems like retail investors are here to stay and grow in number this shift will be fueled by more and more millennials and gen zers joining the financial markets their approach to investment is very different from that of their predecessors in fact as the digital infrastructure continues to grow and digital natives continue to enter the markets in droves some experts predict that online trading could reach a value of 14 3 billion in india by 2025 another factor fueling this trend and ensuring that it will continue for the long term is social media from the subreddit wallstreetbets that moved gme and amc to record heights to the active trading community on twitter and even whatsapp messaging groups there is an entire ecosystem supporting today s retail investors i think it could be safe to say that we are seeing a revolution in the financial markets that will alter the future of investing the

washington ap a deal within reach president joe biden and congress top democrats edged close to sealing their giant domestic legislation though the informal deadline appeared to slip as they worked to scale back the measure and determine how to pay for it negotiations were expected to continue into the weekend all sides indicating just a few issues remained unsettled in the sweeping package of social services and climate change strategies biden met at the white house on friday with house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader chuck schumer joined by video call from from new york trying to shore up details the leaders have been working with party moderates and progressives to shrink the once 3 5 trillion 10 year package to around 2 trillion in child care health care and clean energy programs pelosi said a deal was very possible she told reporters back at the capitol that more than 90 of the package was agreed to the climate change components of the bill are resolved but outstanding questions remained on health care provisions vice president kamala harris sounded even more certain on a visit to new york city she said tensions often rise over final details but i am confident frankly not only optimistic but i am confident that we will reach a deal no agreement was announced by friday s self imposed deadline to at least agree on a basic outline biden wants a deal before he leaves next week for global summits in europe pelosi hoped the house could start voting as soon as next week but no schedule was set sticking points appear to include proposed corporate tax hikes to help finance the plan and an effort to lower prescription drug costs that has raised concerns from the pharmaceutical industry democrats are in search of a broad compromise between the party s progressives and moderates on the measure s price tag revenue sources and basic components at the white house the president has rolled up his sleeves and is deep in the details of spreadsheets and numbers press secretary jen psaki said biden was to spend the weekend at his home in wilmington delaware psaki compared the work to starting social security and other major federal programs decades ago then building on them in following years progress here is a historic package that will put in place systems and programs that have never existed in our society before she said noting the effort to expand child care and provide free prekindergarten for all youngsters negotiations are proceeding as biden more forcefully appeals to the american public including in a televised town hall for what he says are the middle class values at the heart of his proposal in a senate that is evenly divided between the democrats and firmly opposed republicans biden can t afford to lose a single vote he is navigating his own party s factions progressives who want major investments in social services and centrists who prefer to see the overall price tag go down when you re president of the united states you have 50 democrats every one is a president every single one so you gotta work things out he said during a cnn town hall thursday still he expressed optimism about the process it s all about compromise compromise has become a dirty word but bipartisanship and compromise still has to be possible he said on one issue the taxes to pay for the package the white house idea seemed to be making headway with a new strategy of abandoning plans for reversing trump era tax cuts in favor of an approach that would involve imposing a 15 corporate minimum tax and also taxing the investment incomes of billionaires to help finance the deal biden has faced resistance from key holdouts in particular sen kyrsten sinema d ariz who has not been on board with her party s plan to undo president donald trump s tax breaks for big corporations and individuals earning more than 400 000 a year the president was unusually forthcoming thursday night about the sticking points in the negotiations with sinema and another democrat conservative sen joe manchin of west virginia while the president said sinema opposed raising a single penny in taxes on the wealthy or corporations a white house official later clarified that the president was referring to raising the top tax rates not the range of tax proposals which sen sinema supports if so that could unlock a key piece of a deal with a better understanding of the revenues available democrats can then develop a topline amount of spending for the package and adjust the duration and sums for various programs accordingly biden said manchin doesn t want to rush the transition to clean energy so quickly it will result in major job losses in his coal producing state even still biden acknowledged major reductions to his original vision he signaled the final plan would no longer provide free community college but said he hoped to increase pell grants to compensate for the loss of the policy he also said that what had been envisioned as a federally paid months long family leave program would be just four weeks another work in progress the idea of expanding medicare to include dental vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors is a priority for sen bernie sanders the independent of vermont biden said he likes the idea but with manchin and sinema objecting the proposal is a reach instead democrats he said are considering offering seniors an 800 voucher to access dental care as well as another program for hearing aids that sinema may support however the vision care component biden said has been harder to resolve and there is no consensus yet overall biden and his party are trying to shore up middle class households tackle climate change and have the most wealthy americans and corporations pay what he calls their fair share for the nation in the mix are at least 500 billion in clean energy tax credits and other efforts to battle climate change 350 billion for child care subsidies and free prekindergarten an extension of the 300 monthly child tax credit put in place during the covid 19 crisis and money for health care provided through the affordable care act the newly proposed tax provisions though have rankled democrats who have long campaigned on scrapping the republican backed tax cuts that many believe unduly reward the wealthy and cost the government untold sums in lost revenue at a time of gaping income inequality many are furious that perhaps a lone senator could stymie that goal under the changes being floated the 21 corporate rate would not change nor would the top individual rate of 39 6 on those earning 400 000 or 450 000 for couples however the white house is reviving the idea of a corporate minimum tax rate that would hit even companies that say they had no taxable income a frequent target of biden who complains they pay zero in taxes the new tax on the wealthiest individuals would be modeled on legislation from sen ron wyden d ore chairman of the senate finance committee he has proposed taxing stock gains of people with more than 1 billion in assets fewer than 1 000 americans ___ associated press writers alex jaffe kevin freking and zeke miller contributed

outside of romania especially in the english speaking world transylvania is a land associated with vampires inside romania where vlad dracul or vlad the impaler is a national hero the story of the vampire is not as popular though transylvania is arguably still known for being home to one of the creepiest forests in the world this forest also happens to be near the oldest neolithic archaeological site in the country the hoia baciu forest whether it is deserved or not has earned the reputation of being the bermuda triangle of romania and probably all of eastern europe map showing location of gura baciului archaeological site near hoia forest in romania m rotea and t károly plos one archaeological sites and early human inhabitation near hoia forest outside of paranormal activity hoia baciu is known for being part of a wilderness area just outside the bustling romanian city of cluj napoca it is also a recreational area with numerous hiking trails and biking paths other nearby attractions are an open air museum and the oldest neolithic archaeological site in romania gura baciului gura baciului dates to perhaps 6 500 bc it is associated with the starcevo koros cris archaeological complex which is believed by most researchers to represent some of the earliest farmers in europe this makes the site significant for understanding how agriculture came to europe and how much immigrants from anatolia contributed to the genetics of modern europeans beginning about 9 000 years ago the proto sesklo culture in greece began to cultivate crops and raise livestock which had been domesticated in in the ancient near east over the next several thousand years the use of middle eastern domesticates spread across europe until the continent was mostly populated by farmers two main hypotheses are used to explain how middle eastern agriculture and technology spread through europe one hypothesis is that farmers from anatolia settled europe possibly displacing or absorbing the pre existing hunter gatherer populations over time this is the demic diffusion model the other model is that anatolian settlers contributed little to the genetics of european neolithic populations in this case it was mainly a migration of ideas rather than people this is the cultural diffusion model genetic and archaeological evidence suggest that it was most likely a combination of both with cultural or demic diffusion being more dominant depending on the region or point in time hoia forest in romania has become known for strange happenings hauntings and paranormal activity daniel m adobe stock gura baciului and its archaeological significance the gura baciului archaeological site is significant in this area because transylvania is believed to have been one of the first areas in europe settled by people carrying a neolithic culture or ideology the starcevo koros cris archaeological culture is believed to have been derived from the proto sesklo neolithic culture of the aegean which gradually spread through balkans into central europe the settlement at gura baciului probably existed in a context of intersection between neolithic farmers coming from the south and the east and pre existing hunter gatherers in the plains to the west it is not clear that the people of gura baciului are related to modern romanians modern romanians may be more closely related to a later wave of settlers from anatolia gura baciului also existed at an ecological intersection point transylvania makes up the western central part of romania and is located near a boundary between two topographic and ecological zones the hills to the east that are covered in old oak forests and the hungarian plain to the west that extends almost to vienna the plain was formed by the pannonian sea during the miocene and pliocene epochs the hungarian plain historically experienced inundation during the spring and summer and it is likely that a third of the hungarian plain was covered in swamps and marshlands before the 18th century in prehistoric europe these wetlands would have been inhabited by red and roe deer wild boars waterfowl and wild cattle the drier part of the plain consisted of steppes which would have been inhabited by wild horses onagers and lions if the neolithic farmers of europe were descended from settlers from the middle east it would have been challenging for them to adapt agricultural techniques developed for the more arid climate of anatolia to the wetlands of the hungarian plains as a result the comparatively drier transylvanian highlands may have been considered a relatively clement area to live gura baciului is located in the hilly forested heart of transylvania this is just speculation but gura baciului may have been considered valuable real estate compared to the more challenging terrain to the west modern reputation of hoia baciu as a paranormal hotbed while archaeologists associate the wilderness area surrounding cluj napoca with the neolithic and early european farmers the locals associate it with something more sinister outside of cluj napoca is the hoia baciu forest a forest that is said to be the bermuda triangle of romania over time the forest has gained a reputation for being hauntedby unfriendly spirits a site of ufo activity and a place where cultists open portals to other dimensions the forest is said to have been named hoia baciu after a shepherd by the same name went missing in the forest with 200 of his sheep in the late 1960s a biologist by the name of alexandru sift is said to have taken pictures of a disc or flying saucer hovering over the forest in 1968 a military technician by the name of emil barnea is said to have taken a picture of a ufo it is claimed that he had no reason to make the story up since he had nothing to gain the communist government at the time considered belief in the paranormal to be a sign of insanity and a threat to the state in the 1970s the forest was allegedly a hotbed of ufo activity other strange stories have also been told about the forest in one story a young girl disappeared for five years only to re appear again with no memory of where she had been in another tale over 60 visitors were seen trying to open a portal to another dimension people also report seeing strange lights in the forest hearing footsteps from unseen figures capturing otherwise non existent faces in photographs and hearing laughter or female voices it is stories like these which have given it the distinction of being the creepiest forest in the world furthermore people who have gone into the forest report having feelings of nausea strange rashes unexplained fatigue and the feeling that they are being watched some people also report missing time and have no recollection of what they did during that missing time the vegetation is equally strange the trees are said to be in twisted shapes which allegedly at least experts are not able to explain the stumps of trees are also said to have unexplained charring because of the forest s strangeness it has been the subject of several media presentations on the paranormal including one documentary that was aired in japan in 2015 based on excursions into the forest tour guides will take people on tours of the forest and some of them have even been brave enough to spend the night there tour guides who have stayed overnight have reported hearing strange things in one account they heard a sound that resembled a thumping hoof which stopped whenever they looked outside their tents to some the hoia forest shares some of its characteristics with the bermuda triangle gemini adobe stock the hoia baciu forest and the bermuda triangle the two most popular explanations for the strange nature of the hoia baciu forest seem to be that it is either haunted or a realm with portals to other dimensions some people claim that the forest is haunted by the ghosts of peasants that were murdered and who now wander the forest in anger from being trapped within it another explanation appears to be that the forest is the location of portals to other dimensions similar to explanations of the bermuda triangle it may be helpful to compare the phenomenon of hoia baciu to the bermuda triangle to gain a better understanding of what might be happening in the seemingly haunted forest the bermuda triangle does not have any universally accepted boundaries and is not recognized as an official name for any region by the u s board of geographic names it is generally considered by believers to be a maritime area stretching between the florida atlantic coast the greater antilles and the island of bermuda forming an approximate triangle hence the name since the mid 19th century there have been stories of ships going into the bermuda triangle and never returning at least 50 ships and 20 airplanes have famously disappeared within this region seemingly without a trace ships have also been found adrift in the bermuda triangle with no clear explanation for why they were abandoned aircraft have disappeared without any evidence of wreckage fringe explanations of the bermuda triangle include alien abductions connections to atlantis and vortices which suck ships and aircraft into other dimensions the hoia baciu forest parallels the bermuda triangle in many ways like the bermuda triangle the hoia baciu forest is a place where people have mysteriously disappeared it is also a place that is claimed to be a realm where portals to other dimensions exist like the bermuda triangle the forest is also associated with ufo activity could it be that hoia baciu and the bermuda triangle are both inter dimensional zones where it is easy to accidentally find oneself in another universe could there be a perfectly normal and mundane explanation to the strange activity and legends associated with hoia forest in romania mirko macari adobe stock mundane explanations for the bermuda triangle and hoia baciu when stories about the disappearances in the bermuda triangle are more closely examined however many if not most incidents appear to have more mundane explanations most atlantic storms pass through the bermuda triangle for example in the days before accurate weather prediction it is possible that ships could have encountered bad weather that was not expected the conditions of the bermuda triangle are also believed to produce sudden waves that can be up 100 feet high called rogue waves these waves could take out a ship and leave little or no evidence the gulf stream is also known to cause weather to shift rapidly and violently furthermore there are many shallow regions within the caribbean around the islands which can make the region a treacherous area to navigate in a ship another factor is the possibility that compasses sometimes point to true north instead of magnetic north within the bermuda triangle this could have led to miscalculations in navigation which could have been disastrous all these factors would have made it easy for a ship or airplane to be lost seemingly without a trace in the days before reliable radio communication and accurate weather prediction although there could be something genuinely strange going on in the bermuda triangle most disappearances can be explained by known environmental factors making more fanciful explanations unnecessary it should also be noted that although ships and airplanes have gone missing in the bermuda triangle the vast majority that have passed through the area have not could the situation be similar for the hoia baciu forest could most of the disappearances and ufo sightings have natural or mundane explanations it is true that people have gone missing in the forest but hoia baciu is a dense forest and hikers go missing all the time could it just be that people tend to notice when people go missing in the hoia baciu forest because of the mystique that is already associated with the place could the strange lights be part of some kind of atmospheric phenomena could the visions of ghosts be due to a natural hallucinogen that exists in the area this is also speculation but when dealing with strange events should not the more likely and less fanciful explanations be considered first hoia baciu is a place known for unexplained paranormal activity and a nearby archaeological site that is significant for understanding the origins of modern europeans in many ways it is shrouded in mystery because of the many strange phenomena which are seen there whether these turn out to be natural or genuinely supernatural the hoia baciu still has a powerful hold on the imagination whether you are into archaeology or fascinated by the paranormal top image the hoia forest in romania has become connected to paranormal activity in local legends and is said to be haunted by unfriendly spirits source артур ничипоренко adobe stock by caleb strom

it s alarming to see half built new farm equipment sitting idle car dealerships vacant and store shelves empty but this is the harsh reality behind president biden s current supply chain crisis across the country we are seeing bottlenecks and cargo backups at ports and terminals as well as an abundance of workforce shortages causing massive delays throughout our supply chain it is critical we take action now to address the stalemates preventing american products from both being produced and reaching consumers before matters worsen the global and our national economy runs on a complex web of supply chains a process by which inputs are manufactured distributed and ultimately sold to the end consumer these international supply chains rely on transportation networks to move goods making ports terminals and border crossings crucial hubs since consumers expect to receive their purchased goods immediately and manufacturers want to maximize profits we are seeing just in time manufacturing this is when facilities keep a bare minimum of stock to save costs and increase efficiency however they do not store any backup inputs meaning these companies are vulnerable if any delays occur in receiving shipments this will result in companies being unable to fulfill contracts and serve customers both at home and abroad we need to get americans back to work we need to stop paying people to stay at home which is precisely what democrat policies have done by destabilizing our workforce and creating new welfare benefits instead we should be encouraging the american workforce by connecting people with employers who will train and hire them through temporary assistance for needy families tanf reform like my jobs for success act while our supply chains are increasingly delayed and our economy is struggling to rebound the last thing our country needs right now is employers being forced to fire their employees as a direct result of federal overreach with the biden administration s vaccine mandates with the onset of the pandemic we saw a massive surge in consumer spending on goods this occurred at the same time facilities and transportation hubs had to cut back production times and capacity due to social distancing and labor shortages the ability to find space for goods for export on shipping containers was severely strained while american manufacturers were left waiting for crucial imports to arrive to put it into perspective the long beach and los angeles ports two of our biggest usually have no ships waiting to anchor right now 100 ships are waiting taking 10 days on average just to get into port this does not include unloading and putting these goods on rail or trucks to reach their destination all these delays add up increasing costs at the cash register it is not hard to see how dangerous broken supply chains can be to the national security and economic resiliency of the united states that is why we cannot afford to wait any longer we need a solution or at the very least a plan we need to prioritize traditional infrastructure roads bridges and waterways not multi trillion dollar spending sprees on social projects improving port infrastructure and road and rail capacity would go a long way toward addressing the supply chain crisis it is time for the white house and my colleagues in congress to come together and prioritize finding a sensible solution the health of the american economy depends on us acting now and i assure you as the holidays grow closer it will only get worse

medical cost trends medicare enrollment should continue to grow at double digits at unitedhealthcare meanwhile the company s optum segment should be able to help bend the cost curve if indeed post

the estates were developed from the late 1940s until the late 1970s with a mix of walk up flats and medium and high rise this was seen as slum clearance creating better housing and a leg up for mostly young families following european and particularly uk post war reconstruction models by the early 1970s however high rise social housing for families was being questioned in europe and then in australia and the last of the high rise towers in waterloo were for the elderly a battle erupted between the older estates with the last of this development in waterloo south of phillip street over

a new round of global climate talks starts this week with the aim to the goal of 1 5 degrees of global warming within reach key to the talks will be a decade old pledge by developed nations to raise 100 billion per year to help developing nations transition to cleaner energy this has not happened at the end of talks there s likely to be some kind of glasgow declaration but if it s too weak all the talks won t be of much use cop climate talks were always going to be difficult 200 countries in search of a plan to prevent catastrophic warming of the planet with time running out fast the backdrop of terrifying weather events had brought a renewed sense of urgency to the matter then the energy crisis struck leaving asia and europe scrambling for fossil fuels forcing china to double down on coal and giving climate laggards another excuse not to engage in the us president joe biden s green ambitions have gotten bogged down in domestic politics undermining his credibility as he tries to push others to curb their emissions the aim of cop the acronym for the conference of parties that s now in its 26th round is to curb emissions keep the goal of 1 5 degrees of global warming within reach reduce coal use sort out rules for a global carbon market and raise billions in climate finance but at the heart of talks is the issue of fairness developing nations say rich countries wrecked the planet as they industrialized and it s now unfair they re thwarting others economic progress and failing to provide enough cash to help poor countries adjust that s why there s so much talk about how much money will be on the table here is our guide to what s shaping up to be a fraught two weeks of talks we ll take you from the grand aims to the small detail from a leaders summit in rome to the backroom deals where masked delegates will hash out carbon market rules while trying to keep at a covid safe distance where it all begins cop will be held in glasgow scotland but the group of 20 summit in rome just a few days before will set the tone as climate will dominate the agenda with talks on coal use net zero goals and climate finance so far the g 20 which includes major emitters china and india has little to show for many summit hours meetings this month even showed signs of backsliding if leaders can make progress it will be a major boost for cop they wrap up in rome on october 31 and head straight for glasgow roll call some key leaders are going to be missing including china s xi jinping russian president vladimir putin and brazilian president jair bolsonaro still almost 200 countries will be represented some delegates will be there in person some will dial in from home and there will be strict rules on masks numbers allowed in negotiating rooms and covid testing the pandemic has added extra obstacles and some countries go into the talks resentful of what they perceive as unequal access under the landmark paris agreement of 2015 countries have to regularly review their pollution reduction pledges in order to ensure the world stays on track to limit the rise in temperature to close to 1 5 degree celsius the first promises called nationally determined contributions or ndcs were submitted in 2016 but it was clear that they were well short of what science says is needed while some nations have already submitted new pledges over the past year several major economies including china and india haven t the plans made so far would lead to a 2 4 degrees increase in temperature by the end of the century according to the nonprofit research group climate action tracker at the start of cop there s a moment of taking stock to see just how far away we still are from keeping 1 5 degrees within reach u s climate envoy john kerry has already acknowledged the plans probably won t be enough and one aim of glasgow is to make sure countries keep coming back with improved goals we need to change and we need to change radically and we need to change fast says eu climate chief frans timmermans that s going to be bloody hard that s the bad news the goals the uk hosts describe the aims for this cop as coal cars cash and trees that means ending the use of the most polluting fossil fuel phasing out the internal combustion engine raising cash to help developing countries transition to cleaner energy and protect against the ravages of climate change and reversing deforestation they also aim to figure out global rules for pricing and trading carbon globally expect posturing and grand statements in the first two days along with perhaps some new pledges then the leaders leave and the real work starts the uk presidency has set a target for the meeting to consign coal to history and has been pushing for the goal at g 7 and g 20 meetings this year with mixed success so far but coal is still a massive part of the energy mix and the recent surge in energy prices has forced countries into even greater reliance on the fuel china is ordering miners to dig up as much as they can and in the us a key lawmaker from coal rich west virginia is getting in the way of biden s plans the key cash more than a decade ago developed nations pledged that by 2020 they will raise 100 billion per year to help developing nations transition to cleaner energy but they still haven t delivered on the promise a failure that enrages poor countries and undermines developed world leaders credibility as they push others to make expensive changes total climate finance was 79 6 billion in 2019 an increase of just 2 from 2018 according to the oecd we absolutely need to meet the 100 billion says tina stege climate envoy for the marshall islands the delivery of that is a foundational element of the success at cop last month biden doubled the latest us pledge to 11 4 billion annually beginning in 2024 but that still has to be approved by congress and activists argue it doesn t come close to the us s fair share for the fund odi a think tank puts that figure closer to 43 billion based on the u s s wealth emissions and population size finance day follow the money finance ministers central banks and wall street bank ceos will be in glasgow on november 3 for finance day with a focus on how to green the global financial system and funnel money away from polluting industries and into cleaner ones watch out for pledges to phase out or stop financing for coal already we ve seen a series of promises in the runup including jp morgan chase co joining an alliance of lenders aligning their portfolios with net zero by 2050 as always though what matters is the detail and just how rigorously investors hold companies to account paris loose ends carbon market the paris agreement left some unfinished business that negotiators still haven t been able to tie up how to standardize rules on carbon trading across the world the buzzword to watch is article six referring to those lines in the paris deal that paved the way for a global carbon market but are so complex and controversial that they are yet to be finalized the good news is negotiators are edging toward a deal on this the basic idea is to match carbon sucking projects that reduce pollution with counterparties who need to reduce emissions via a market of so called offsets which could be worth as much as 100 billion in 2030 according to some estimates the mechanism in theory should drive money to places where the biggest gains can be made most cheaply offsets are becoming an increasingly important element of decarbonization strategies says lidia wojtal of think tank agora energiewende while there are already various voluntary carbon markets that can provide such credits a deal on article six would make a difference it would guarantee a truly global standard the difficulty is in creating a robust financial instrument that would translate work on national emissions reduction pledges into comparable exchangeable units the framework needs to be flexible enough to attract investment palatable to a range of countries with different priorities and credible some negotiators say a bad deal would be worse than no deal if the rules that emerge aren t robust enough there are two big sticking points one is the need to avoid double counting the other is how to deal with old credits from a now defunct system launched way back in 1997 under the kyoto protocol a good deal would result in a net reduction of emissions globally and the risk is that a bad deal does the opposite broadly speaking developing nations are eager to reap the funds that would come from a new programme while richer nations led by the european union are focused on the integrity of the system the endgame at the end of talks there s likely to be some kind of glasgow declaration the us and uk have both said they want to make sure countries keep racheting up their plans while several leaders are framing cop as a make or break deal for the planet the reality is probably more nuanced a clear win on just one issue will probably count as success and it s possible there will be progress that can be built on down the line meanwhile the role of business and finance is increasingly important banks are mobilizing finance to green the economy and that momentum is likely to be sustained saving face the side deals but as the main goals of ending coal and getting a net zero commitment slip out of reach work is under way to hatch a series of side deals that would go some way to salvaging the talks or at least saving face there s a plan on curbing methane for example which the us and eu are cajoling others to join and others in the works on aviation and forests the risk though is that if the main communique is so weak that all the action is in the mini deals it raises questions about what s the point of cop and whether climate multilateralism is coming to the end of the road
chapter 1 in an e2 nightmare called remfs i was sick really really fucked up and feverish i had been afraid to go on sick call my last week of basic training because of what might happen the army could refuse to process my orders to fort huachuca a nice safe place in the american desert re cycle me which would mean going through basic again and then do what they probably always wanted to do in the first place send my raggedy ass to vietnam a very dangerous place in the indochinese jungle this was in 1969 and it was the very definition of bad karma so temperature soaring alternating shivers and sweats i found myself on a little apache airlines commuter plane bouncing and jouncing through the arizona skies on the final leg of my trip from fort dix new jersey to fort huachuca arizona looking down i could see a landscape unlike anything i d ever imagined but really i was too sick to care the in processing and attendant ceremony once i got to the post was an hallucinogenic blur i was out of my head with fever and when i finally saw a doctor maybe three days after i got there he prescribed antibiotics and put me on light duty which is where my real problems began in the days before computers the military used a torturous system of supply and demand based manpower management the toa table of allotment dictated how many soldiers and how much equipment any given duty section could obtain the section chief would put in for x men and y equipment and eventually maybe months later his wish would be fulfilled to the best of the army s ability my military occupational specialty mos was 03b20 entertainment specialist based on my civilian acquired skill a b a in acting and directing and a bunch of summer stock and regional theater i had been assigned to the entertainment section at fort huachuca which was a ragtag bunch of actors directors and misfits headed up by a hot tempered bi polar civilian named mickey d angelo d angelo or d as he was called hated my east coast guts from the minute we met i wasn t the kind of 03b20 he was looking for you see though i never really found out why the entertainment section in the parlance of the day had the military dicked we wore our hair long slept in cause we worked at night and generally made life miserable for the real soldiers and even for our brethren in leisure the 03 c 20 s the guys who handed out towels and volleyballs at the gym the 03b s and c s were billeted with a bunch of adjutant general s office types some clerks and librarians and military policemen the people who make the army run but don t do any shooting they called us rear echelon mother fuckers or remfs we were more likely to die in a car crash on the way to tucson drunk as skunks in a basket than in combat i think d loathed remfs basically he d put in twenty years as a soldier in the old brown boot army had failed to be promoted at some point had left the military and now as a civilian was doing a job he hated surrounded by people he hated more it was not a recipe for peace love and understanding in the greater scheme of things the entertainment section existed to piss d off artists and musicians potheads and drunks these were not the sort of people the military gives too much latitude but the table of allotment said the garrison at fort huachuca must have entertainment and there we were at the height of the vietnam war producing and directing plays requisitioning lightboards and sound equipment all according to the toa d tried to run his section like a real military operation but it was hopeless and he knew it he chain smoked and drank coffee all day anxiously trying to keep things under control in his type a personality sort of way it was a fool s errand he was a prisoner to the regulations and so were we all the other guys in the billet liked to party army life was like one continuous new year s eve for them and after about a week they got pissed at me cause i never went out the fact of course was that i was still sick but these fun loving bastards these master cooze hounds bloody well kidnapped me one night just before christmas i was trying to get a little rest cause d was having a christmas party later that night and attendance was mandatory for all the 03b s these guys came up to my bunk ignored my sickly protests threw a blanket over my head and gleefully carried me bodily down the stairs to their car at which point i had to endure a long ride somewhere they made me smoke smoke and drink drinks and what with the drugs that were already in my beleaguered system i was in pretty sad shape by the time we crossed the border into mexico it was anything can happen day and i didn t even have a map through sleep encrusted eyelids i could see a narrow sliver of green neon pulsating on the horizon the car bumped sickeningly on the dirt road janis joplin was still wailing on the eight track stereo when the driver switched the engine off we were parked in front of an adobe roadhouse in agua prieta dirty water mexico with no other buildings in sight my drunken g i buddies sloshed out of the car somebody pulled me along for the ride of my life inside was depressing it was too bright and hot and there were four or five mexican cowboys drinking cervezas along with maybe half a dozen of the skankiest women i d ever seen hard old mexican whores with way too much makeup skinny legs and skirts and blouses stretched beyond the laws of physics in self defense i ordered a beer dos equis one x for my ears the other for my eyes i felt miserable my compadres wasted no time like niños in a candy store they peeled off one after the other with these damas de la noche geezus i thought to myself i ve gotta remember this maybe write it down someday more cars pulled up more g i s from the post i was a virtual prisoner in a mexican whorehouse a couple days before christmas what next as if by cue from the almighty above lola walked in through the same door all my buddies had gone out she was five two or three hair black as night eyes like diamonds that looked into mine and burned their way through the back of my skull she had great legs and a beautiful body and her high heels clitty clattered all the way over to me she put her hand on my thigh and ordered a drink never looking away from me the barkeep took a bill from my pile but before i could enjoy a simple conversation with this mexicana whose drink i d just bought another guy from the post came up and off she went with him the little whore my enfeebled brain tried to wrap itself around the circumstances though i was supposed to be at d s christmas party in a couple hours i had instead found myself somewhere south of the border totally crocked egotistically assuming moral superiority over everybody else in the room and this puta had just walked up to me and rocked my world i am a pig i am lower than low damn she was cute gimme another x barkeep and so it went all night long whore after whore after whore soldier after soldier after soldier patterns developed there was a kind of hierarchy here the oldest whores turned their tricks the quickest which one supposes means they made the most money none of the mexican men were doing anything but drinking lola turned every head in the room every time she came back some of my buddies went back for seconds all of them eventually went with lola so much for true love the combination of penicillin cannabis alcohol tobacco and pine bros coughdrops had spiraled into something approaching insanity i was feeling like vincent van gogh and i wanted to cut something off just to ease the pain when she came over to me again why don t you come with me she taunted in good english i will make you so happy why gee i can give you a dozen reasons you just fucked everybody in the room except those guys who must be your brothers and uncles i was feeling less than seasonal good will when she started to run those slender fingers up and down my leg again her nail polish was quite lovely her breath smelled so good come on g i you re so handsome and strong she punctuated that one with a squeeze i was disgusted with her and with myself for wanting her but i bought us both another drink with any luck i d pass out and be out of this misery before the drinks came lola played her hole card as she was whispering in my ear she playfully removed my glasses and shoved them between her breasts tongue tipping between her lips she wriggled away from me fingers fingering the air come on g i i ll be so good for you it pissed me off i think i must ve yelled hey but the next thing i knew all the mexican men were on their feet in an extremely not good way i heard a ker click behind me turned around and found myself staring down the black eyed barrel of a very bad trip the gunman waved towards lola who was waving my glasses at me to think i could ve been safe in vietnam and now because of some lousy cold medication and bad timing i m gonna end up on the floor of a whorehouse in dirty water mexico courtesy of samuel colt there was some tension in the room you could say it was all up to me they say a man s got to do what a man s got to do and it appeared to me and everybody else that i was going to have to do lola if i wanted to get my glasses back which i did cause i was gonna have to drive to d s party later if i was alive to drive i followed that beautiful young girl through the door drafting along in the wave of her perfume the doorway opened onto a courtyard there were maybe twelve rooms each with a blue light over the door flanking a garden with a fountain what a pretty place i thought this doesn t look like a mexican whorehouse lola clattered happily down the left side of the courtyard twittering along in spanish as though this were something she did every day come to think of it it was something she did every day death comes from the left death comes from the left my feeble brain warned i guess i was remembering something from school something academic aesthetic philosophical a theory that s the trouble with schools they don t get you ready for the big transition the real world is a theory in school for me and lola right about then the real world was a small room at the end of a not unpleasant walk in the garden lola s room was crowded with stuff toy animals and perfume and makeup and photos on the wall whatever persona she had cultivated out in the bar melted away in her room she was just a girl doing a woman s business i paid her fifteen dollars wash she commanded i looked around there was a sink in the corner no running water a five gallon jug stood there some soap a wash cloth wash heem up she ordered shaking my glasses and pointing at my unit i have to tell you i d never been in any situation even remotely like this before the only thing going through my mind was that if i played my cards right i could still get to d s christmas party alive we begin the dance that men and women dance she was so young and beautiful i was so drunk and confused i remembered i had protection in my wallet the same one that had been in there since college probably but this is where things got really weird she wouldn t let me use it she was hushing me and kissing me and nibbling me and soothing me and she wouldn t even think of letting me do the safe thing it was weird she moved languorously under me and she seemed to be enjoying herself and i realized i was committing a crime for which someday i would have to pay and in a very short amount of time it was over and lola smiled a girlish guileless smile and i got my glasses back and as soon as i got back in the car i knew i had the clap those assholes who d got me into this thought it was really hilarious all those watered down drinks i d bought for what three minutes with lolita they referred to her as lolita i hadn t thought about that so much it bothered me all the way back home everything what was the point of all this god and i have had lots of dialogs over the years this was one he didn t want to talk about janice joplin scored my private little psycho movie so come on come on break it i got to d s party after midnight here are some things that i ll never forget d was sweating profusely as i came through the door his white shirt was soaked through and he didn t smell good his tie was loose and he had a big wad of bills in his hands he was counting he licked his lips he smiled and he said hey you made it come on in this is a night you ll never forget the party felt good young americans far from all the bad stuff in a church basement in southeastern arizona on a chilly december night i took a deep breath and was about to go get some food when i was enveloped in the most beautiful scent from out of the blur of the crowd and the music came a young woman a woman who took your breath away when she smiled i held out my hand who was she where had she come from what was she doing for the rest of her life these were some of the questions that i wanted to ask but somehow i couldn t because we danced and we danced and we danced she felt so good next to me her body fit mine so well she was so pliant when she needed to be so forceful when that was the thing required we talked easily together and she made me forget everything and everybody there was no question in our minds that we would marry and grow old together once our souls had gotten that squared away and after we d kissed our first kiss at the end of a whiter shade of pale we agreed that it might be good to eat for the night was young we turned toward the food fingers entwined and had not taken but a step or two into our future when a kind of shock a palpable slap came out of the crowd to my left i saw d forty feet away clutching his chest and falling heavily to the floor there was an enormous thud when his head hit and all hell broke loose people crowded around there was confusion and then crying d s face was grey grey as an old cold sidewalk there was no question he was dead one of the g i s had been a paramedic he worked on him till the ambulance got there the two of them were covered in d s vomit and beer by then but it was hopeless we buried d three days later i never got her name the entertainment program at fort huachuca fell apart and the army treated me free of charge for v d it wasn t long before i got my orders for vietnam and for this happily very long time after when the night is cold and christmas is in the air whenever i hear that song i think of the girl i left and the woman i lost the night d angelo died and so it was that later as the miller told his tale that her face at first just ghostly turned a whiter shade of pale on vietnam remfs
