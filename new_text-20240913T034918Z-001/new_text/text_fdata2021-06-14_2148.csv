on june 3 u s president joe biden signed an executive order blacklisting 59 chinese companies including huawei semiconductor manufacturing international corporation and the china aerospace science and technology corporation using the reasoning of responding to the threat of china s military industry the order prohibits americans from investing in the listed companies the order will take effect on aug 2 the wall street journal commented that the action is one of the firmest to date taken by the biden administration amid a broad review of china policy senior u s and chinese economic officials had just made two calls to fully resume communication just when the international community had not yet fully digested the news washington has struck at china again giving us more insight into the complexity of u s china relations and washington s paranoid attitude toward suppressing china s development one impression that chinese society has of the u s has been repeatedly proven by the facts no matter who owns the white house there are only superficial changes in u s strategy toward china and an increase in aggression in some areas one other realization has been constantly reinforced the chinese must drop the wishful thinking and strengthen themselves this blacklist is version 2 0 of the chinese communist party military related enterprises list created during the trump administration it should be noted that the list was introduced after donald trump s election loss last year and the circumstances at the time dictated that it was an arbitrary and politically motivated ad hoc move in fact this list immediately sparked chaos in the united states when it came out for example the new york stock exchange first delisted the three major chinese telecom operators then revoked the order and finally delisted them again turning back and forth in such a short period of time is not at all how a mature market should act the fact that xiaomi and basket technology won the case and were removed from the blacklist in the first instance also proves that the list lacks a legal basis such a damaging blacklist should have been abolished when washington was stabilizing its political footing but the biden administration did not do this instead it intensified its efforts by creating a version 2 0 first the number of chinese companies and entities involved has increased from 48 to 59 second the scope of the executive order has also been expanded prohibiting u s investors from buying the securities of listed chinese companies but also from investing in the funds of these companies third the enforcement department has been changed from the department of defense to the department of the treasury in addition the new ban also claims to add the considerations of democracy and human rights overall the new ban is easier to implement and is more severe in nature it seems that the biden administration lacks the courage and ability to break free of the confines of populism toward china or simply does not have the will to do so many of the blacklisted companies have nothing to do with the military industry which means that this is just one of washington s gimmicks it is a normal economic activity between countries and enterprises but washington is looking at the economy out of the context of the economy making economic issues a security political and ideological issue without any bottom line abusing state power undermining market rules and order and suppressing and restricting chinese enterprises by any means why do they do this in fact we all understand that washington just wants to bring down these outstanding chinese companies with strong integrated strength in science and technology one thing is certain washington is unlikely to achieve this goal the u s has been suppressing china s technological development for a while but instead of slowing down chinese technology is only getting stronger and stronger this is first of all because chinese technology has been based on independent research and development from the very beginning thus gaining a strong ability to survive and develop second because this suppression from the u s is fundamentally against the laws of the market and lacks international morality its force is limited and unsustainable to a certain extent it can be said that the reason why the u s has resorted to improper competition is a type of expression of its lack of confidence in proper competition if the united states is willing to play with ideology let it play by itself eventually it will find that it is the one left out to dry and also the one that suffers the biggest loss editor s note this quote though accurately translated could not be verified

taptejdeep singh came to san jose to pursue the american dream like thousands before him he was drawn to the capital of silicon valley for its wealth technology and innovation what he found instead was a deeply unequal city where housing prices have skyrocketed economic inequality is spiking and residential segregation divides communities in this economically perilous place singh s job at the santa clara valley transportation authority was a lifeline a union job with stable hours that paid a living wage for people without a college degree it even offered benefits like health care and pension a rarity in the area last month a shooter killed singh and eight others on the job an attack that has shaken the region and left mourning families longing for answers it was also an assault on a workplace that attracted immigrants from across the city helping them find their financial footing in an increasingly unaffordable region advertisement there s a great divide here san jose mayor sam liccardo said in a recent interview housing has become so horrifically expensive and there s no question that is the greatest threat to our economic mobility going forward bagga singh an indian immigrant and taptejdeep s cousin was proud of his cousin s work at the vta it was among the more stable jobs held by members of their extended immigrant family in silicon valley their life in california is decidedly better than the life they had in the punjab region of india he said but it doesn t compare to the lifestyles of the wealthy tech professionals in the area it s a good place to live singh said if you can afford it american nightmare before the large office parks sprang up and the tech professionals moved in san jose was primarily known for its rich diversity advertisement the city which has a population of about one million is 35 percent asian 31 percent latino 25 percent white and 3 percent african american according to the u s census more than half of the families here speak a language other than english at home césar chávez the labor leader got his start in san jose in 1948 as an agricultural worker he soon became an organizer for a civil rights group black communist activist angela davis was imprisoned here before a local jury found her not guilty in 1972 a native of the region she s now a professor at the nearby university of california santa cruz the narrative of san jose as a welcoming melting pot is a story that likes to tell itself said juan pedroza a sociology professor at university of california santa cruz and that was mostly pretty true until recently advertisement the internet boom of the late 1990s changed all that though some of the wealthiest companies in the world flocked to the bay area their arrival didn t translate into jobs that benefit all residents you think about the high tech industry it s globally connected with incredible economic returns because of the global economic markets they re serving and a lot of the returns come in the form of stock markets and investments and ownership and not so much in labor said chris benner sociology professor at uc santa cruz and director of the santa cruz institute for social transformation there s not a whole lot of jobs created in the industry compared to the economic size of the industry the influx of wealthy workers has also caused the price of necessities to spike today housing costs in san jose are so high that a family of four making nearly 100 000 is considered low income according to the 2019 state income limits which helps determine affordable housing eligibility advertisement a measure of economic inequality called the gini coefficient found that economic inequality increased two times faster in silicon valley than in the united states as a whole between 2010 and 2019 and a 2018 university of california berkeley study found that while san jose is one of the largest and most diverse cities in the region its segregated neighborhoods don t reflect that diversity asians and latinos in particular are incredibly segregated the report found city councilman raul peralez who is running for mayor grew up in affordable housing in san jose and watched the city transform around him he said that because his parents were able to live in the city instead of being pushed into the suburbs he had access to a better education and opportunities he would not have had otherwise advertisement the biggest challenge has been the growing divide between the haves and have nots those who are wealthy in the tech industry are able to buy homes in this area and everybody else he said it s continually stacking odds against those that are already challenged or struggling share this article share survival is particularly hard for those city residents without college degrees who often work lower wage jobs at the vta for example drivers can be stuck on site for 12 hours working two four hour shifts with a four hour break in between said john courtney president of the amalgamated transit union 265 which represents vta employees many cannot afford a home in the city so they must commute hours to distant towns or cram into an apartment with several other people sometimes employees spend the night in their cars showering at the worksite or in campers at the vta campus advertisement it s brutal it really is courtney said when the difficult work lifestyle is combined with the high cost of living particularly housing prices benner said the result is that the american dream has become an american nightmare for people unless you re in the tech industry standing on their feet the vta is one workplace where many of the city s ethnicities and nationalities converge you walk through the vta you hear tagalog spanish punjabi my philly accent all different kinds of languages courtney said many of the employees start as drivers and work their way up through maintenance or operations departments to become mechanics or dispatchers whole families work at the vta sometimes through generations of immigrants taptejdeep who went by taptej first lived with his cousin bagga when he arrived in the united states in 2004 bagga helped him get his driver s license and fill out paperwork for a green card after a few months taptej started to work first at an assembly line then as a security guard and eventually at the vta advertisement slowly slowly slowly they stand on their feet bagga said of immigrants arriving in the united states the two grew up together in the same house in the fields of northern india and remained very close throughout their lives the funerals that followed the massacre were a wide array of san jose cultures reflections of the multiculturalism at the vta there were hymns in different languages clothes from black to bright and adornments spanning religions from all parts of the globe mexican filipino indian and middle eastern vta employees all attended services to mourn the loss of their colleagues bagga noticed their presence at his cousin s funeral all our communities all management and employees from different temples from the churches from the sikh temples everyone came there he said advertisement taptej was killed at 36 with dreams left unfulfilled he had gotten his real estate license and was hoping to eventually work in that field full time he wanted to one day purchase land to grow vegetables nuts and fruits similar to the fields of india where he grew up when you move to america the main thing you re looking for is a peaceful life a big dream bagga said if the area you are living or country you are living is not good you re not going to have a dream over there you can only have a dream if you re happy

good morning ladies and gentlemen jared has asked me to speak today about china a subject in which i have some small expertise to keep my talk on topic for american renaissance i ve titled it china america and the chinese in america so this talk is a three parter here s part one china china china is a big country in the far east who knew currently trading under the name people s republic of china if you look at the statistics the interesting thing is that china and the u s a are almost precisely the same size 3 7 million vs 3 8 million square miles china is of course much more populous 1 356 million people v 319 million other stats those for china given first gdp 13 4 trillion v 16 7 trillion gdp per capita 9 800 v 52 800 total fertility rate 1 55 per woman v 2 01 mean iq 105 v 98 the numerically dominant ethny in china is han chinese 92 percent this is american renaissance though and what we talk about is race and ethnicity so let s look at a different map i ve taken this one from hermann s historical atlas of china a classic of historical cartography first published in 1935 but updated many times since china base ethnies this map shows the base populations in various regions by ethnicity the big pale yellow area at the left is tibetans the pink and purplish area above is central asian peoples mostly turkic the strip of beige coloring across upper center is mongolians most of the rest the darker yellow coloring is han chinese you can see that less than half the territory of the people s republic is chinese in base ethnicity one quarter is tibetan one sixth turkic one tenth mongolian metropolitan china the part of the people s republic that is han chinese in base ethny is basically china of the ming dynasty 1368 1644 plus manchuria china in ad 1580 there has of course been much settlement in these non chinese areas in recent decades mongolians are now actually outnumbered in inner mongolia that beige strip in the first map the base populations still push back against chinese occupation though even in inner mongolia there are occasional ethnic riots these non chinese populations although they occupy big areas are numerically small ignoring chinese settlers the density of tibetans in the tibetan region is about eight per square mile which is very low equivalent to australia or iceland the u s a population density for comparison is 83 the uighurs etc in east turkestan are about 20 per square mile the mongolians in inner mongolia about 12 the density of chinese in metropolitan china by contrast is 660 people per square mile the same density as britain but of course in an area twenty times bigger that s a sensational number for such a big region some of which is desert mountain or forest that is the first key fact about china for many centuries china has been operating at the malthusian limit population was less in former times but agricultural technology was also inferior the han chinese are autochthonous they have always been in china at any rate north china always of course means since the great out of africa dispersals of 50 to 30 thousand years ago genetically the han are a mix of ancient northeast asian and southeast asian stocks in proportions 72 28 much of that mix happened in historic times north china was the arena for power struggles to control the empire when the empire was weak it was also subject to invasion from further north and west these episodes sent floods of refugees to the south where they mixed with local populations cavalli sforza et al in the history and geography of human genes give a finer cut than my powerpoint slide which i took from national geographic s geno 2 0 project they emphasize the genetic distance between north and south chinese north china and south china belong to different major clusters thus confirming the suspicion that despite millennia of common history and many migrations a profound initial genetic difference between these two regions has been in part maintained the authors subdivide the north chinese into north and east central groups the south chinese into south central and southeast groups they buttress their findings with an analysis of chinese surnames that shows good agreement with the genetic groupings the characteristic feature of chinese history has been what the discredited marxist paleontologist stephen jay gould in a different context called punctuated equilibrium spells of unchanging stability interspersed with periods of great disorder the dynastic cycle the core han ethny and its culture always remained intact but there was essentially no constitutional progress as the historian demetrius boulger observed very pithily in 1881 it is the peculiar and distinguishing feature of chinese history that the people and their institutions have remained practically unchanged and the same from a very early period all is now as it was a more recent historian s a m adshead has described this as the triumph of state over society schools in britain used to teach and perhaps still do a subject called british constitution in the late 1950s the standard textbook was by a scholar named taswell langmead confusingly titled english constitutional history it took the student through all the developments from the tribal councils of the old teutons through magna carta parliament cromwell s commonwealth the glorious revolution political parties all the way to universal suffrage and the modern cabinet system for a 15 year old schoolboy taswell langmead was a formidable book over 800 pages of small print a book titled chinese constitutional history would be much slimmer you could not possibly fill 800 pages on that subject i don t see how you could fill eight as a land empire the chinese system of course included some border peoples of non han ethnicity some of these persons played significant roles in chinese history here is just one an lushan a chinese general of sogdian origin the sogdians were a central asian people speaking an indo european language alexander the great married one an lushan ignited a terrible civil war that broke the back of the glorious tang dynasty in the middle of the eighth century the great swedish botanist carl linnaeus in his typology of the major races listed east asians as severe haughty desirous and ruled by opinion that kind of classification is of course deeply deplored nowadays but linnaeus in that last point was on to something a good way to study national character is through the nation s proverbs and idioms chinese is very rich in expressions urging conformity the leading bird is the first to be shot and so on we nowadays know that natural selection has been operating across historical time so there are speculations as to the evolutionary origins of the chinese national character one of the best of such recent speculations is by ron unz in an interview a few years ago casually mentioned his speculation that the socially conformist tendencies of most chinese people might be due to the fact that for the past 2 000 years the chinese government had regularly eliminated its more rebellious subjects a suggestion that would surely be regarded as totally obvious and innocuous everywhere in the world except in the west of the past half century or so like britain and unlike china or indeed most other countries france for example the u s a has undergone constitutional evolution across its history treasuring the forms words and principles of our original constitution while adapting the details to changing times the chinese in america now the chinese in america this final section comes with some editorial matter up front my point of view here is one i call salt in the stew multiculturalism i take for granted that a stable nation with a healthy culture needs a single ethny in confident unapologetic supermajority 90 95 percent small minority populations add flavor interest instruction entertainment genetic variation the supermajority is maintained by strict controls on settlement and a strong assimilationist ethic this is the outlook expressed in the 1924 immigration act s national origins quotas it is close to the outlook of present day japan except that the japanese do not want foreigners to assimilate in regard to the first of those bullet points note that the han people of china at 92 percent are within the supermajority range the whites of 1950 america were at the lower boundary of it that said let s look at the history of chinese people in the u s a the nineteenth century saw inflows from coastal regions of south and east china this was not the model minority of our own times the incomers were mostly low class males seeking work as laborers or miners resentment by american workers led to the 1882 chinese exclusion act willard espy in his 1975 book an almanac of words at play tells the tale of one who should have been excluded the 1882 act was aimed at laborers taking the jobs of american workers plenty of chinese were not excluded by this legislation especially those who had connections with christian missionary activity in china one such was soong may ling who was educated in the u s a 1907 17 mainly in the south and who later married chiang kai shek she spoke perfect american english with a georgia accent one interesting aspect of this pre 1965 era of chinese immigration was that one single county predominated this was taishan county in guangdong province near hong kong in 1970 more than 60 percent of chinese in the u s a had origins in this one county during ww2 the u s a was allied with china against japan and the exclusion act became an embarrassment it was repealed by the 1943 magnuson act with further relaxation under the 1946 chinese war brides act the 1965 immigration act placed china in the same status as other eastern hemisphere nations this didn t at first do the mainland chinese much good as emigration was very difficult under the mao tse tung dictatorship the numbers only turned up in a major way following the normalization of diplomatic relations in 1979 the doubling of chinese numbers in the 1980s had a big mainland component there are now close to four million people of chinese ethny in the u s a one side effect of the mainland inflow was the night school wars of the late 1990s chinese immigrants like others had been sending their children to evening classes in chinese culture usually at local high schools prior to mainlanders coming in these classes were run by chinese from taiwan and hong kong where the characters of written chinese have their traditional forms and pronunciation is taught using a japanese style alphabet developed in the 1910s the chinese communists simplified the characters to aid the spread of literacy the noun hall for example went from to from 25 brush or pen strokes to four the communists also switched to a latin alphabet transcription for teaching pronunciation mainlanders wanted their kids to use these newer forms there were conflicts leading in some places to the establishment of separate schools for mainlanders and others mainlanders quipped that there ought to be an offshore island for the traditionalists to retreat to the high mean iq of chinese immigrants and their culture s ancient enthusiasm for book learning caused distortions in american higher education most universities established quotas for east asian undergraduate numbers the ivy league colleges holding them below twenty percent even as actual numbers of college age east asians doubled from 1990 on the universities of course lie about doing this in china itself the fever to get one s child into an elite american university was typified by the book harvard girl liu yiting which was a major bestseller in china in the early 2000s it described how a chinese couple had raised their daughter from birth with the aim of being accepted to harvard she was the book ignited a genre of similar titles princeton boy how we got our child into yale and so on to the credit of the chinese it also brought forth a counter genre of which my favorite was titled i m mediocre and i m ok the pushback can be seen in the reader reviews at the amazon style bookseller website with more negative than positive reviews with china s rise as a military and industrial power espionage has become an issue the wen ho lee case of the late 1990s is only the best known there have been many others the first happened right after the communist takeover in 1949 rocket scientist tsien hsue shen was placed under house arrest in 1950 on his release five years later he went to china and founded the nation s ballistic missile program in recent years the chinese government seems to have concentrated its efforts on cyber espionage although in country operations both military and industrial undoubtedly continue another issue related to the chinese in america is what might be called politics with chinese characteristics there are of course honest chinese american politicians and crooked white black and hispanic ones but china s political tradition has been more tolerant of corruption than the anglo saxon norm as the prominence of chinese and chinese americans in the clinton era funding scandals illustrates just this month we have seen the case of california state senator leland yee now under indictment for racketeering a lesser issue arising from the chinese presence in america of curiosity value rather than any possible social harm niche sinicization i always smile to see pictures of the u s team at the annual international math olympiad five of the seven team members in 2012 bore chinese names that s 71 percent with chinese at 1 2 percent of the u s population there is over representation of sixty times i m not aware of any significant anti chinese hostility in the present day u s a and with sensible immigration policies to keep numbers low i think prospects for assimilation would be excellent however sensible immigration policy seems to be something we have forgotten how to do as a caution against proceeding in our present reckless path i ll just note one peculiarity of american thinking about racial frictions because of our nation s history and much assisted by more than half a century of relentless anti white propaganda the common assumption is that the arrow of racial hostility points from a more capable more socially successful race to one less capable and less successful in fact this is hardly ever the case taking humanity at large the usual attitude of more capable races to those less capable is somewhere on a line from pity to contempt depending on the behavior of the less capable the arrow of real hostility points upwards to the more successful historical examples are easy to find representatives from the far west were concerned about the competence and competitive threat presented by japanese immigrants and their rhetoric suggests they viewed the japanese as racially equal or superior further reading finally some book recommendations i have been the china books guy for literary editors at magazines and newspapers since the early 1980s i get em all not only have i read a million china books i ve gotten paid for reading them most recently just last week here are four that made a particular impression on me recently thank you ladies and gentlemen

economist david rosenberg believes the bond market is getting inflation right and yields shouldn t trade at higher levels his reasoning inflation is a temporary phenomenon caused by enormous pent up demand and supply chain issues connected to the coronavirus pandemic the numbers have been shocking to the upside no doubt about it but it s pretty easily explainable the rosenberg research president told cnbc s trading nation on friday i don t understand why people want to superimpose these last couple of months into the future get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters so far the bond market is shrugging off inflation the benchmark 10 year treasury note yield hit its lowest level since march 3 on friday and closed at 1 45 the yield is off 7 over the last week and down almost 11 over the past month sliding yields have been on rosenberg s radar for months in late february on trading nation rosenberg called the bond market radically oversold and predicted the 10 year yield would retreat to 1 at the time the yield was around 1 5 there is just so much noise and distortion in the data said rosenberg who served as merrill lynch s top north american economist from 2002 to 2009 the most dangerous thing anybody can do is extrapolate what s happening now in a note to investors on friday he wrote i refuse to hyperventilate over inflation he believes the other side of surging growth is a plateau that s the story for the second half of the year the bond market is sniffing that out right now rosenberg said my forecast is slower growth inflation peaking out and rolling over and a bull flattening in the yield curve it s an outlook that would spell trouble for the reopening trade rosenberg predicts consumer cyclicals a major part of it will fall out of favor later this year growth should reclaim leadership over value in the stock market he said you want to be more in defensive growth and in areas of the market that are going to benefit from a lower bond yield bitcoin breakout ahead rosenberg may be expecting trouble for the reopening trade but he also believes bitcoin is prime for a resurgence the cryptocurrency has been getting walloped down 38 over the past two months he also wrote on friday about encouraging signs that show bitcoin is getting ready for another shot upwards he further suggested technicals indicate overbought conditions are unwinding yet he still won t completely embrace the asset i don t own bitcoin i never recommended anybody to buy it it seems to me that crypto is here to stay there is no doubt about it as a facilitator of a medium of exchange he said bitcoin to me is a speculative trade i don t see it as a bonafide investment rosenberg prefers gold an asset he has owned for years i just say buy the gold rosenberg said gold has 1 5 of the volatility that bitcoin has gold is up 8 over the past two months however it s off about one percent so far this year disclaimer

when maxine hyde was a child she used to travel with her mother yasmin in a battered old lada to agricultural fairs around west cork and watch as farmers were encouraged to taste a newfangled thing called relish she recalls that farmers reared on singularly smooth sauces that were identified exclusively by their brown or red colour looked at the funky chunky relish with suspicion some tried it many did not the relish was made in the grounds of ballymaloe with tomatoes from the farm and using a recipe devised by yasmin s mother myrtle allen in her grand country house in the 1940s peter mosely managing director of the porterhouse brewing company at their brewery in dublin a far more recent addition to supermarket shelves is a range of beers from the company this time last year the beers beloved among beer stout and ale purists were mainly available in the handful of bars owned by the company photograph alan betson porterhouse brewing company s craft beers are now being listed in supermarket chains including lidl tesco and supervalu a step which almost immediately makes the brand accessible nationally my mum almost had to beg people to taste it hyde recalls read more after trialling ballymaloe relish among wary west cork farmers yasmin called to her local supermarket in midleton which was coming under the umbrella of the recently rebranded supervalu chain the shop agreed to stock some of the relish because of the way is it run individual supervalu s are allowed to buy a certain percentage of products direct from suppliers and it is just one of the most wonderful things says hyde the old lada her mother drove to a few back doors of supermarkets in the old lada to kick off a bit of demand and that gave us a chance to realise what we could improve on her daughter continues then ballymaloe relish got a bit of trial in a quinnsworth in dublin in the run up to christmas 1990 it sold very well and then there was the famous roches stores who opened their arms to us but it was very hard work and it was very gradual people weren t really that familiar with relishes and if there was any in supermarkets there would be just a few dusty jars in the corner of a shelf after trialling ballymaloe relish among wary west cork farmers yasmin hyde called to her local supermarket in midleton which was coming under the umbrella of the recently rebranded supervalu chain things started to take off for the brand when o brien s sandwich bars started adding ballymaloe to the fanciest of its deli sandwiches at the turn of the millennium while centra also started boasting about its appearance in its deli rolls the rolls were the height of fashion back then and they gave us a massive boost hyde says we didn t have money for national advertising she credits supermarkets with helping her family to grow the brand including tesco ireland which she says has been massively supportive of getting ballymaloe into its uk stores if you don t have outside investors and a lot of marketing money then taking it slow by getting a little bit of space in a supermarket is brilliant she says a far more recent addition to supermarket shelves across ireland is a range of beers from the porterhouse brewing company this time last year the beers beloved among beer stout and ale purists were mainly available in the handful of bars owned by the company shift from the pubs company director elliot hughes says the sudden shift from the pubs owned by the porterhouse to supermarket shelves was a pretty big departure and was certainly accelerated by covid 19 it quickly went from something we had casually discussed pursuing to one which we actively went out to achieve elliot hughes of the porterhouse brewing company its craft beers are now being listed in supermarket chains including lidl tesco and supervalu a step which almost immediately makes the brand accessible nationally he says it should help it to grow its off trade business which has become increasingly important due to covid 19 it also meant that we could continue to produce and safeguard jobs at a really difficult time for the hospitality sector he describes the biggest challenge the company has faced so far as making sure it has the volume of beer to fill initial orders nationally and then following that there is nothing too different from other partners we have things have gone as smoothly as a fine stout so far and hughes is optimistic the supermarket sweep could see the brand grow even bigger our beers are marketable across the eu and we have had success there with different partners and a multiple deal with the likes of lidl can only help that for her part and having travelled a long road to grow the ballymaloe brand hyde stresses the need for people to take it slow if for instance you can get to all the supermarkets in cork and making it work there then that is a healthier way to grow than trying to take a brand national too fast taking chances supervalu which took a chance on the unfamiliar relish in the 90s is still in the business of taking chances on local suppliers although that business has got much slicker in recent times last month it announced 45 new irish food producers who have completed the food academy programme supported by bord bia and the local enterprise offices leos now in its eighth year food academy is a food business development programme between supervalu bord bia and the local enterprise offices participants in the programme receive training in food safety market research and branding marketing finance sustainability and business development at the virtual graduation ceremony of the new recruits tánaiste and minister for enterprise leo varadkar said the combination of brexit and covid 19 had truly tested irish food producers our supermarkets and their supply chains the industry has remained remarkably strong and resilient throughout what has been a really challenging period adapting and responding as things have changed ireland s food and drink producers are known around the world for the quality of their produce he said the food academy programme was a fantastic example for those with smaller operations to sell to a wider audience future growth according to recent research by supervalu irish food and drinks start ups are optimistic about their future growth with 93 per cent indicating they expect revenue growth in 2021 while 71 per cent said they would hire more people this year the study showed that increased consumer demand for irish products was the number one driver of growth the programme currently supports 290 irish food and drink producers including 140 female entrepreneurs generating 170 million in sales in 2020 there was a 15 per cent growth in supervalu food academy sales with participants earning 28 million the food academy programme supports 1 500 jobs in local communities nationwide food academy is a very important brand asset for us says supervalu s anne hurley local has had whole new push since the start of covid and that has made the academy even more important this year s batch of graduates joined the programme last autumn and took part in an online learning programme the topics have evolved over the eight years she says sustainability is a huge part of the programme now as is selling yourself online would be food producers also learn about packaging branding and have ongoing mentoring before they are released into the retail wilds they go on to the shelves of a couple of stores in their area to see how they work it is a safe place to try their products the producers can then establish a rate of sale in a few supervalus if things go well or if they have the ambition to scale up then can tweak their supply chain and sell to a wider circle of the shops before eventually making into into the national food chain after the trial period there is mentoring and then it is based on rate of sales and what the brand wants to do and if they feel they are ready they can go into the next tranche of stores she says she has a note of caution there have been times when people have been very ambitious and raced to get into loads and loads of stores but brands don t happen over night while supervalu is all about the food academy the route taken by ballymaloe relish also remains open because of the unique structure of the store network the back door is still there and that still happens the food academy was born out of that and really it was created to give the producers their best shot and the retailers their best experience this is where the food ecosystem comes from these are the brands and producers of the future and that is why we need to support them we have seen what brexit can do and it so important to support the indigenous proposition we need to maintain the integrity of the food chain here in ireland because it is unique and it is special damien o reilly is a retail analyst and tu dublin academic and he echoes much of what is at the essence of the supervalu food academy model it can be very important to local economies if a small brand can get onto the shelves of a big supermarket they can expand and then create employment if people chose to spend just an additional 5 of their grocery spending on irish sourced product then that could lead to as many as 30 000 new jobs being created if you are selling into a supermarket and it is working then it benefits all the people in the supply chain he does have some caveats and notes that while getting into bed with a supermarket can be hugely rewarding for a small supplier it does not come without its challenges the challenges are big and the margins are low and the costs of operating in that market can be high often companies are not properly prepared and they can run out of money or they can run out of stock he says apart from all that he says they are fantastic he points out that if a brand can establish a presence in the top three supermarkets they can ensure their products are seen by 70 per cent of shoppers and that is a big deal he notes that in the supervalu food academy producers are expected to bring in your product and maintain your own shelf space and if you have a small space that can be very demanding he says that while some businesses might think having their products in large supermarkets will open avenues but ultimately it closes them down and maybe they would have been better off in smaller outlets where they could get a better price because supermarkets work off very small margins it is excellent but you have to work it very carefully maybe not overly ambitious at the start lidl and aldi development programmes when it comes to leaning on locals to boost business supervalu is not alone lidl has a kickstart programme its 2021 programme saw 46 suppliers added to it with 71 products going onto the shelves including 48 which are new to the retailer with kickstart the focus is not just on getting products onto shelves we really want to help suppliers get more out of the experience so we hold seminars every year on topics such as packaging labelling quality and marketing pr spokeswoman aoife clarke says as we needed to host these online this year we took it once step further and introduced bespoke digital marketing training in conjunction with facebook and gave each supplier free ad credit to practice what they learned she said that it has been working even harder also to facilitate exports abroad into the lidl group a 42 per cent increase in exports of irish beef is planned for 2021 last year ourselves and our exclusive beef supplier cavan based liffey meats secured exports to the value of 14 million despite the ongoing challenges of covid 19 and the uncertainty brexit was bringing to the agricultural industry we have 21 fresh items and nine frozen items being delivered to 20 countries across europe and usa in total we will be exporting over 20 000 000 irish beef burgers all over europe and usa notable export stories she said other notable export stories from the past 12 months were in the drinks area where they had a substantial investment totalling more than 50 million with supply contracts in 27 countries for suppliers of craft beers cream liqueurs and spirits last year also we were aware through bord bia about how many artisan cheesemakers were left without business due to hospitality being closed so our buying team quickly pulled together an irish cheese promotion with five producers supplying 11 cheeses to us then there is the grow with aldi producer development programme which a spokesman says is specifically designed to give small and medium irish producers a leg up and the chance to have their products listed nationally across all our stores it was introduced four years ago in partnership with bord bia and has delivered more than 3 million in sales for irish producers the spokesman said this year had been the biggest year for the grow with aldi programme so far with 289 companies applying up by more than 30 per cent on last year he said that 57 of ireland s most innovative producers won a place on the programme with 108 of their exciting irish made products being placed on sale in our 145 stores last sunday june 6th for two weeks as part of our grow with aldi specialbuys event the food service sector was also encouraged to enter the sector has had such a difficult time due to covid 19 providing an opportunity for them to diversify into retail was something we wanted to support we have some amazing products on sale created by restaurateurs including a spicy carolina style bbq sauce and kansas city style bbq sauce produced by white rabbit which is a family owned restaurant based on maccurtain street in cork city the spokesman said after the two week grow with aldi specialbuys event five of these grow with aldi suppliers will be given a further opportunity to win a long term 12 month contract with aldi the real impact of the programme lives beyond the specialbuys event and the suppliers that secure the long term contract grow with aldi has put additional irish producers on our radar and presented us with more opportunities to work with the applicants at different stages of the year he pointed to pascal and sinead gillard of jinny s bakery they run holiday cottages and tea rooms in leitrim they initially supplied aldi as part of the 2020 grow with aldi programme they were outside of the five suppliers that received a 12 month contract but they were listed again as a specialbuy in our stores this year likewise ballyvourney pudding entered right back in 2018 and was listed as a specialbuy in june 2018 they won a 12 month contract for 2019 and returned again in 2020 with a different product the programme has produced some real long term success stories take walls honest chips based in whitegate co cork for example it is run by kieran wall who developed chips to rival any chipper in ireland the fakeaway chips are made with potatoes and beef dripping meaning customers can have the authentic chipper chips taste at home one of the overall winners in the 2019 programme kieran recently signed another contract with aldi worth more than 1 million to his growing business which continues to go from strength to strength based on the reassurance of this long term contract he has had the security to expand his production facilities and hire more employees we also contacted tesco and dunnes stores because they also have support schemes for local producers but at the time of writing we had heard nothing back from either

the old pueblo mine also known as the quien sabe oxide copper deposit was one of the earliest and last operating mining properties in what is known as the amole mining district it is 7 miles west of downtown tucson in the tucson mountains and is a prominent landmark in the form of a scar from mining operations over a century ago today it is panorama for hikers and bikers on the richard e genser trail and visitors and residents at the starr pass golf course the area is part of a large volcanic complex known as the tucson mountains volcanic caldera formed around 65 million years ago original claims were staked in the 1870s by miners who spotted mineralization characterized by copper colorant along rock fractures at the surface the first recorded development and production of the mine began in 1907 under the tucson consolidated mining co which oversaw the property under a stock agreement with the old pueblo mining and milling co that year the main shaft was dug to a depth of 70 feet and workings totaled 600 feet fifteen tons of chalcocite ore was sampled to assay at 33 copper and 16 ounces of silver and 2 50 of gold was recovered mining operations would remain sporadic over the next 63 years sunk on a thin seam stained with green copper mineralization the quien sabe shaft was reported in 1912 at a depth of 517 feet a second shaft was 100 feet northeast of the main shaft on the northernmost outcrop of the main vein and 100 feet deep with tunnels and open cuts by 1936 67 tons running as high as 5 copper was reportedly produced geology of the area is volcanic comprising rhyolite overlain by andesite a well fractured host rock intruded by sericitized quartz monzonite the volcanic complex is comprised of thick welded ash flow tuffs and chaotic megabreccia coarse grained rock composed of angular rock fragments in finer grained matrix formed from vents and volcanoes volcanic rocks date from the early tertiary to the late cretaceous time period minerals found onsite include chalcocite and chrysocolla evident in mined open cuts along with pyrite chalcopyrite and bornite first documented in retrieved core samples oxidation of the chalcocite by descending acidic ground water from the surface mixed with silica may have produced the chrysocolla deposits gangue materials limonite and quartz are also found argillization or the breakdown of minerals to clay from weathering due to water and air above ground is common throughout the mine site the mine was also one of the last producing mines in the tucson mountains as reported in a combined production with the nearby battle axe mine from 1969 to 1970 over 14 000 tons of smelter flux was shipped from the mine by mcfarland hullinger of toole county utah the shipment contained a few tenths of a percentage of copper along with traces of silver and gold decorative stone was also produced further exploration efforts undertaken by cominco consolidated mining and smelting company of canada included several drilling rigs on the property drilling of nine holes showed a large amount of copper oxides along with enriched chalcocite copper sulfide ore beneath barren looking surface outcrops further drilling in the surrounding area revealed weak copper mineralization evidence of a leaching operation using oxide materials from open cuts can be found in the wash west of the mine site cominco dropped its option on the property in 1971 while the property is documented as an interesting geological occurrence it did not warrant further development based upon the disseminated ore values being too spotty and low grade for profitability along with the increase in urbanization resulting from the starr pass golf resort aptly christened quien sabe translated to english as who knows the deposit is classified as protore meaning that the rock contains potential economic material that may be mined at a profit at a later date under favorable economic circumstances coupled with technological innovations in mineral extraction the deposit may also become more enriched yielding greater economic value through the natural processes including supergene enrichment caused from chemical weathering and precipitation above the surface

tim cohen is editor of business maverick he is a business and political journalist and commentator of more years than he likes to admit his freelance work has included contributions to the wall street journal and the financial times but he spent most of his life working for business day after a mid life crisis that didn t include the traditional fast car cohen now lives in the middle of nowhere in the karoo first published in the daily maverick 168 weekly newspaper what propublica obtained was a vast cache of us internal revenue service data which showed that the 25 richest americans paid tax over the past decade at a total rate of 3 4 of their wealth this is big news because like in sa individual tax records are supposed to be very secret how they got the records they are not telling nobody is disputing the accuracy of the records so one presumes the records were leaked by an irs insider who was just pissed off as we all are about the ongoing highway robbery rich people get away with it should be noted that propublica is not suggesting any of the 25 richest people in the us necessarily broke the law or evaded tax the problem it turns out is a simple one stock market gains are not taxed until they are realised which most often happens when they are sold and very very rich don t typically need to realise their stock market gains so they just sit there getting bigger and bigger for at least some of the rich people involved this is a little embarrassing investment icon warren buffett ceo of berkshire hathaway declared income of 125 million between 2014 and 2018 and paid tax of 23 million a tax rate of 18 4 that s a little on the low side but it doesn t suggest aggressive tax planning the problem is that his wealth has increased over the same period by 24 billion which means the actual tax paid compared to the increase in his overall wealth was 0 1 apart from famously never selling any of his stock buffett also reduces his tax bill because berkshire hathaway doesn t pay dividends which would have been taxed as income in his hands this is kinda embarrassing for buffett who openly advocated changes to the us tax system to close loopholes but buffett was one of the very few people who responded in detail to propublica s scoop saying he continued to believe that the tax code should be changed substantially and that he thought huge dynastic wealth is not desirable for our society buffett also plans to give away almost all of his wealth this model of not paying dividends and holding almost all your wealth in shares has been emulated by the icons of tech investment which is partly why the world s two richest men amazon ceo jeff bezos and tesla founder elon musk are also among the world s lowest taxpayers at least by the propublica methodology bezos paid tax of just under a 1 billion over the four year period but his wealth increased over that time by 99 billion suggesting a wealth increase to taxation paid ratio of 0 98 musk paid more in tax but his wealth increased during 2014 to 2018 period by much less these numbers would have changed massively by now so he paid a higher rate around 3 27 musk in typical musician style responded to propublica s inquiries with a single letter a questionmark the crux of the problem and south africa and much of the rest of the world has followed this approach goes back to a century old us court case involving a woman named myrtle macomber who received a dividend for her standard oil shares at the time only about 15 of the population paid tax and they paid a lot about 80 of their income the dividend was paid in the form of new shares so she argued she had got richer but hadn t got any money four years later the us supreme court agreed and henceforth tax only becomes due when you sell an asset including a bond a building or equities and reap the income what should we make of all this what has happened is that two important changes have taken place first the utility and ubiquity of stock markets has now overtaken the planet for huge chunks of society the stock market has become something akin to a bank the consequence is that those able to take advantage of this fabulous resource are literally making out like bandits the second change is the ethic of the master entrepreneur somehow policymakers have become convinced that master entrepreneurs are such an important species that they should be protected and mollycoddled and here is the problem they are but i also sense the winds are changing it s fabulous that great entrepreneurs get rich in my opinion but their wealth is just so ridiculously extreme it s just outrageous at the g7 meeting this weekend the wheels are going to start spinning to reverse this process and the risk is ironically both that it won t go far enough or that it will go too far bm dm this story first appeared in our weekly daily maverick 168 newspaper which is available for free to pick n pay smart shoppers at these pick n pay stores
