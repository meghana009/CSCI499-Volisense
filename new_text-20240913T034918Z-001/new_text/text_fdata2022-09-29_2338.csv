a volatile market is traditionally a strain on active managers as they navigate their clients portfolios but 2022 has proven to be an unconventional year for their operations according to the spiva u s scorecard a new study by s p global large cap active managers are experiencing the best year against their benchmarks since 2009 on average about 68 of large cap managers underperform their benchmarks but the study found that only 51 underperformed in the first half of this year get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters historically beating the benchmark is very tough anu ganti senior director of index investment strategy at s p dow jones indices told cnbc s bob pisani on etf edge on monday and there s a few key reasons why we saw this tail wind in the first half of the market ganti said the declining market has brought losses across equities and fixed income as well as rising rates and rising inflation this type of trading environment enhances the value of active management skills she said no 1 is rising dispersion which measures the spread among returns in an index she said the greater that dispersion is the greater the opportunity to add value from stock selection according to the spiva study higher dispersion implies a greater possibility of generating above average performance through judicious stock selection but it also implies a magnified risk of selecting a laggard resulting in plenty of opportunities to both add and lose value two other points for you ganti said historically we ve seen that active portfolios tend to be closer to equal in cap weighted so perhaps that was another tail wind of the underperformance of mega caps and finally we ve seen the recovery in value after decades of underperformance these are all some of the reversals this year that potentially played a role not only is 2022 a slightly better year for individual advisors but larger firms like capital group and morgan stanley are also entering the etf space it is good news for the etf space tom lydon vice chairman of vettafi said in the same segment we hope that we re going to see less fees we think we re going to see a lot more tax efficiency he said trading costs have come down which are all things that work against you trying to beat that benchmark but lydon also questioned why managers seeking to outperform aren t looking beyond sectors with diminishing weighting in the s p 500 like energy and utilities if you re reading the tea leaves and just getting the signals from economists in the markets you think you would have pushed a little bit more in he said i think there s too much sector hugging which is impeding the ability of advisors and managers to beat their benchmarks since first being released in 2002 the spiva u s scorecard has monitored the debate between active versus passive management while the results of the first half of 2022 show promise for fund managers the long term results are telling eighty four percent of active managers underperform benchmarks after five years that jumps to 90 after 10 years and 95 after 20 years so far this year ganti said it s been a disappointing cycle for large mid and small caps growth managers across the board it s interesting because initially you would have thought that perhaps they could have tilted towards value which outperformed she said and perhaps these growth managers were more concentrated in the growthier names compared to our index and hence they were hurt by that weakness and growth disclaimer

by julia horowitz cnn business the federal reserve is laser focused on stemming price increases in the united states but countries thousands of miles away are reeling from its hardball campaign to strangle inflation as their central banks are forced to hike interest rates faster and higher and a runaway dollar pushes down the value of their currencies we re seeing the fed being as aggressive as it has been since the early 1980s they re willing to tolerate higher unemployment and a recession said chris turner global head of markets at ing that s not good for international growth the federal reserve s decision to raise rates by three quarters of a percentage point at three consecutive meetings while signaling more large hikes are on the way has pushed its counterparts around the world to get tougher too if they fall too far behind the fed investors could pull money from their financial markets causing serious disruptions central banks in switzerland the united kingdom norway indonesia south africa taiwan nigeria and the philippines followed the fed in boosting rates over the past week the fed s stance has also pushed the dollar to two decade highs against a basket of major currencies while that s helpful for americans who want to go shopping abroad it s very bad news for other countries as the value of the yuan the yen the rupee the euro and the pound tumble making it more expensive to import essential items like food and fuel this dynamic in which the fed essentially exports inflation adds pressure on local central banks the dollar doesn t strengthen in isolation it has to strengthen against something said james ashley head of international market strategy at goldman sachs asset management the punishing consequences of the rapid appreciation of the dollar have become clearer in recent days japan intervened last thursday for the first time in 24 years to shore up the yen which has plunged 26 against the dollar year to date the bank of japan has remained an outlier among major central banks and has resisted hiking rates despite an uptick in inflation china is watching currency markets after the yuan trading onshore slid to its lowest level against the dollar since the global financial crisis while european central bank president christine lagarde warned monday that the euro s sharp depreciation has added to the build up of inflationary pressures the united kingdom shows just how quickly the situation can spiral out of control as global investors choked on a new government s economic growth plan the british pound fell to a record low against the dollar on monday after the unorthodox experiment of implementing large tax cuts while boosting borrowing triggered alarm the ensuing chaos forced the bank of england to announce an emergency bond buying program to try to stabilize markets and led to an admonishment from the international monetary fund which said the uk government should reconsider its proposals the global financial system is like a pressure cooker right now turner said you need to have strong credible policies and any policy missteps are punished the threat to emerging markets the world bank recently cautioned that the risk of a global recession in 2023 has risen as central banks across the world hike interest rates at the same time in response to inflation it also said the trend could result in a series of financial crises among developing economies many still reeling from the pandemic that would do them lasting harm the biggest fallout may be felt in countries that have issued debt denominated in dollars paying back those obligations becomes more expensive as local currencies depreciate forcing governments to cut back spending in other areas just as inflation savages living standards waning currency reserves is also cause for concern a shortage of dollars in sri lanka has contributed to the worst economic crisis in the country s history and forced its president out of office earlier this year the risks are laid bare by the size of interest rate hikes in many of these countries brazil for example kept interest rates steady this month but only after 12 consecutive increases that left its benchmark rate at 13 75 nigeria s central bank hiked rates to 15 5 on tuesday much higher than economists had expected in a statement the central bank noted that ongoing monetary policy tightening by the us federal reserve bank is also putting upward pressure on local currencies across the world with pass through to domestic prices can the pain be stopped the last time the dollar went on a similar tear in the early 1980s policymakers in the united states japan germany france and the united kingdom announced a coordinated intervention in currency markets that became known as the plaza accord the dollar s recent rally and the ensuing pain it s caused for other countries has sparked chatter that it may be time for another agreement but the white house has thrown cold water on the idea which makes it look unlikely for now i don t anticipate that that s where we re headed brian deese the director of the national economic council said tuesday in the meantime the federal reserve is expected to stay the course that means the dollar could yet climb further and other central banks won t be able to relax additional dollar strength and higher us rates is absolutely something that we should be anticipating and the consequences of that are really quite profound ashley of goldman sachs asset management said the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warner bros discovery company

the history of inflation and of how policymakers and pundits responded to it reveals plenty of motivated reasoning for decades people have argued that inflation is not so bad that it happens because of greed or that the best solution is price controls i d assumed that we had become wiser but here we are today with core inflation excluding volatile food and energy costs at 6 3 percent unemployment at 3 7 percent and the inflation adjusted federal funds rate still negative yet many observers think that it s a mistake to raise interest rates any further and some even believe that monetary policy should be looser raising rates to curb inflation is never popular farmers drove their tractors into washington to protest paul volcker s rate increases people hate higher rates for good reason they can chill the labor market and they certainly drag down the stock market which is down 23 percent this year federal reserve chairman jerome powell has finally admitted that reducing inflation will probably cause economic pain and the worst could be yet to come the tight labor market is still contributing to inflation getting the price level under control will probably mean not only a falling stock market but also lost jobs it s tempting to call off the dogs one might argue that higher inflation is better than higher unemployment and falling gdp another might say that because this bout of inflation is driven by supply chain problems and expensive oil monetary policy is an ineffective tool but today s inflation is also driven by demand by too much stimulus and by shutdowns and even if rising prices were strictly a supply issue curtailing them would still be the fed s job a contraction in supply that pushes inflation higher requires the fed to dampen demand before inflation becomes endemic inflation is largely determined by expectations if people view the fed as ineffective or unable to curb inflation then markets consumers and workers expecting higher prices will ask for higher wages that causes firms to increase prices making high inflation self fulfilling uncertainty about the future price level also discourages firms from investing thereby hindering productivity wages may rise but they won t keep up with inflation failing to attack the problem may therefore generate an even worse recession than the country currently faces such a negligent fed would lose credibility and need to raise rates even higher to get inflation back down later on what the fed is doing now raising rates by 0 75 percentage points at a time eventually to reach somewhere around 4 or 5 percent is a superior alternative it is administering a mega dose of antibiotics to kill an infection rather than letting the infection run rampant before cutting off the patient s leg suppose the fed didn t continue raising rates it would effectively be admitting that it can t achieve its congressionally mandated mission of low unemployment and stable inflation in such a world why would the fed even bother with monetary policy a credible and effective fed is a very powerful tool but a fed that won t raise rates when the economy is overheating is a central bank that can t cut rates when it is in a recession and if it gives up on inflation it also gives up on full employment its power depends on its credibility to make hard choices some observers have become so accustomed to policymakers doing all they can to boost demand that they ve forgotten there is no free lunch the fed is independent and powerful so that it can make the hard choices nobody wants but everybody needs recessions have happened for many reasons sometimes they are unavoidable owing to big external shocks other times they stem from over investment and the natural business cycle but the most frustrating recessions come from policy mistakes a soft landing is still a possibility if a seemingly remote one and a fed caused recession will not be popular even if is necessary the hope is that such a contraction will be less painful than the alternative but powell s institution does deserve some blame a series of policy errors including loose monetary policy well into the pandemic helped put the economy in its current position if the looming threat of recession and the current market turbulence feels like the result of a policy mistake that s because it is but the mistake isn t raising rates now it was failing to do so earlier photo by drew angerer getty images

it s been a rough couple of weeks in the energy market as potential energy company investors we are not sorry to see the back of last week in particular that s the understatement of the year pretty near every negative sentiment recession fed tightening dollar strength china demand inventory builds or what amounts to the entire oil price closet of anxieties came to pass this week oil wti took a tumble below 80 for the first time since jan 11th of this year closing friday below its 200 day moving average of 89 00 this move has wti nearing an important psychological level in the lower 70s past which producers will sharply curtail capex to raise prices in this article i will argue that the selling is overdone and neglects one basic truth about the oil market it is under supplied and it is only the spr releases that have been masking that fact we are on the verge of an energy calamity that will begin to manifest itself in the coming months as the economy of the world begins to accelerate in 2023 the era of energy insecurity will begin the important takeaway is that there is nothing that can be done to prevent this train from barreling into the station a recent ny times article put it succinctly that s because there s just no extra supply out there today at all there s a very little extra supply that the saudis and the emiratis can put on the market and that s about it we ve used the strategic petroleum reserve and that s coming to an end in the next several months there s just no extra cushion in the oil market right now how did we get here the short answer is that for the period since 2014 producers have been disincentivized to explore for or sanction the mega project that was the mainstay of the 2000 2013 era the graph above is telling us that for a lot of reasons low oil prices for much of the period governmental preferences shifting to alternative energy and discouraging production of fossil fuels and capital restraint by producers globally that we have under invested in upstream supply by hundreds of billions longer term we are confident that oil prices will rebound probably toward the end of the year as the spr releases that have put excess oil on the market come to a halt the graph above compiled from sp global and worldometer tells a compelling story every year approximately 80 mm new people join the nearly 7 9 bn folks already here all needing but not always having energy to power their lives in six years from 2014 to 2020 spending on new upstream sources fell by 55 while the world s population rose by 8 the math doesn t work the oil market is undersupplied as the eia graph below shows since march when the government announced the spr releases to bring down domestic gas prices inventories have risen about 15 mm barrels if you back out the 172 mm barrels withdrawn from the spr over this time inventories would have shrunk to 248 mm bbls that may sound like a lot but in reality with our 19 mm bod habit it s a 13 day supply less than 2 weeks not only are inventories being artificially inflated by spr releases the productivity of new wells as reported in the eia drilling productivity report is on the decline this is an admittedly simplistic measure as it just takes active rigs at a given point and divides into new well production as reported by various sources usually state regulatory agencies the fact the yardstick is done in 4th grade arithmetic without sophisticated modeling doesn t mean it s not instructive it does reveal an undeniable trend in new well production across every key basin with the exception of the north dakota and new mexico basins there is a pronounced decline in spite of steady growth in the rig count for most of this year reading it carefully a case can be made that the drilled but uncompleted well duc count withdrawal that occurred from mid 2021 through january of this year was largely responsible for gains in production registered so far this year there is certainly an observable trend that well performance in the shale basins began to fall off as ducs declined this is true regardless of the underlying reason which i have postulated in the past could be due to exhaustion of premium drilling inventory this has been documented several times recently in widely read publications that include the wall street journal here and here the data from the dpr is confirmed by information compiled from the eia 914 monthly report only in north dakota and in the gulf of mexico gom do we see a gain from may to june in the case of the gom murphy oil s nyse mur kings quay production contributed about 80k bopd and bp s herschel provided another 20k boepd toward the 179k boepd shown for the month higher drilling costs are also beginning to impact profitability as was noted in an even more recent wsj article what this means is that maintaining or increasing production will come under a sharper lens as margins compress and operator s balance sheet priorities come into play almost without exception shale drillers have told us that their priorities are returning capital to shareholders through special dividends and share buybacks paying down debt and holding production to low single digit growth if oil prices hover in the 70 s for any time expect cuts in operating budgets which will show up in the rig count soon the takeaway from this section is that u s production will rise to 12 6 mm boepd in 2023 as the eia suggests in this month s edition of the steo isn t very high current trends are heading in the other direction and the catalysts for a reversal of course are just not present the current weakness in oil prices has producers sharpening their budgetary knives inflation is eating at already tight budgets and nature itself may intervene with poorer quality rock than was available in the past is any help coming from opec opec and its sometime collaborator when interests align russia have fallen short of producing up to full quota levels by a significant amount some reports have this shortfall at more than 3 mm bopd at present in fact the ceo of aramco made a widely read pronouncement earlier this month that the world was on the precipice of an energy shock of massive proportions but when the global economy recovers we can expect demand to rebound further eliminating the little spare oil production capacity out there and by the time the world wakes up to these blind spots it may be too late to change course the dallas fed put out a report documenting the opec shortfall as well that points to key source of underperformance at the feet of none other than saudi arabia it only runs through february of this year but shows clearly the kingdom of saudi arabia producing about 1 2 mm bopd below quota to put a cap on this discussion of whether the kingdom can dig deep and come up with more oil when the world needs it we have commentary from the defacto saudi leader himself prince mohammed bin salmon also known as mbs advertisement the kingdom will do its part in this regard as it announced an increase in its production capacity to 13 million barrels per day after which the kingdom will not have any additional capacity to increase production he said in a wide ranging speech related central asia grapples with influx of russians fleeing conscription in his address the prince noted that it would not be able to reach the 13 mm bopd capacity level until 2027 this should knock on the head any notion that opec or its primary member saudi arabia can turn a valve and add significantly to world oil supplies any time soon your takeaway no one can predict what the oil market will do over the short haul of the next few months there are so many factors many of which we noted in the opening paragraphs of this article that it s impossible to say when this selling pressure will be relieved my best guess it will happen with a massive inventory draw when the spr releases finally cease perhaps it could be a fed pivot these interest rate hikes are crushing consumers and driving adjustable rate mortgages and heloc payments higher every month at some point the fed will pause if history is any judge a stock market that s declined 50 in a few months hundreds of thousands of people without work inflation in the double digits will all demand it that will spark an intense rally in oil prices in my view or it may be something else entirely in the scope of things i ve highlighted or an outlier i missed what i can confidently say is when market sentiment shifts we are in for a sharp surge in oil prices it will be led by a crushing demand globally for oil and gas the steady supply of which is increasingly in doubt by david messler for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com

click here to listen to the audio in the latest installment of ropes gray s etf podcast series asset management counsel ed baer and jennifer choi discuss one of the hottest trends in the etf space single stock etfs transcript jennifer choi hello and thank you for joining us today on this ropes gray podcast i m jennifer choi a counsel and senior policy adviser in the washington d c office of ropes gray joining me today is my colleague in the asset management practice group ed baer a counsel in the san francisco office in this podcast which is part of a series of podcasts on etf issues we will discuss one of the hottest trends in the etf space single stock etfs single stock etfs allow investors to use leverage or make inverse bets on companies such as tesla nvidia paypal and others there are even some single stock etfs designed to provide exposure to so called meme stocks ed can you tell me about how these single stock etfs work ed baer sure jennifer single stock etfs use leverage to magnify or trade at the inverse of the daily performance of the single stock they track for example there are etfs that seek to deliver up to 2x the return or 2x the inverse of the return of individual stocks often widely traded ultra market cap stocks jennifer choi so these etfs track some of the largest and most liquid stocks in the market why would an investor need to invest in an etf and pay a management fee when she can just invest directly in the company s stock what does a single stock etf offer that investing in the underlying stock can t ed baer well the short answer is increased or in the case of inverse single stock etfs decreased exposure to the daily returns of the individual stock or in the case of inverse single stock etfs the opportunity to benefit from depreciation in the stock the investment case for these etfs as well as the risks and benefits are similar to those of other existing leveraged or inverse etfs in delivering desired returns over a specified period only which is typically one day similar to traditional index based leveraged and inverse etfs these single stock etfs use derivatives to seek to achieve their desired returns jennifer choi okay so unlike leveraged and inverse etfs that seek to deliver a leveraged or inverse return of the diversified index these products focus on a single stock if held for more than one day the returns can vary significantly from the exposure because these etfs reset the leverage daily in addition because the returns of these funds are tied to the returns of individual stocks the volatility of the underlying stocks will be magnified due to the leveraged or inverse nature of the etfs ed baer that s right these are not buy and hold vehicles the issuers of these products have attempted to make it clear that these are sophisticated investment tools designed to provide active traders who are focused on making very short term trading decisions and who have a strong directional view on a certain stock the opportunity to make tactical trading decisions based on company news such as earnings announcements or regulatory developments jennifer choi speaking of regulatory developments the sec and finra have their eyes on these products shortly before the first single stock etfs came to market sec commissioner crenshaw warned because of the features of these products and their associated risks it would likely be challenging for an investment professional to recommend such a product to a retail investor while also honoring his or her fiduciary obligations or obligations under the regulation best interest however retail investors can and do access leveraged and inverse exchange traded products through self directed trading at the same time the director of the office of investor education and advocacy cautioned that holding a levered and or inverse single stock etf is not the same as holding the underlying stock a traditional etf or even a non single stock levered and or inverse etf it is riskier for several reasons she then went on to talk about the short term nature of the exposure and the lack of diversification in underlying exposures and at a conference recently senior sec staffers noted that chair gensler has asked the staff to focus on complex products such as leveraged and inverse etfs including single stock etfs so there may be additional regulation forthcoming we understand that the division of investment management is working with the division of trading markets and the division of economic and risk analysis to understand the market impact of single stock etfs another concern of the sec is that issuers looking to launch single stock etfs on foreign stocks that don t have to meet the same financial reporting standards as a u s listed company the sec is concerned about american investors gaining access to foreign companies that wouldn t be able to access them directly ed baer exactly while it s unclear whether the sec can do anything to stop the launch of single stock etfs on non u s stocks they re definitely concerned that u s investors could be harmed interestingly one of the firms that filed a registration statement for a series of single stock etfs on non u s stocks in early september withdrew the registration statement for those etfs about two weeks later it is unclear whether the withdrawal was voluntary or whether the sec asked the sponsor to withdraw the registration statement i expect there will be more to come on these products in the near future in addition to the sec focus finra s recent complex products proposal focused on an extremely broad list of complex products including leveraged and inverse etfs this may result in additional sales practice restrictions or new disclosure obligations unsurprisingly the etf industry reacted very negatively to the finra proposal especially the portion of the proposal that suggested that self directed investors might not be permitted to invest in complex products like leveraged and inverse etfs jennifer choi what i find curious is the timing of the launch of these products in the u s products like these have existed in europe for years but they ve only recently found their way to the u s there are about two dozen of these single stock etfs in the market already and there are dozens more in registration including single stock etfs that track non u s securities and all of these have launched since july why now ed baer for starters the adoption of the etf rule as well as the derivatives rule really opened things up for years the sec refused to permit new exemptive orders allowing leveraged and inverse etfs so product innovation in this area was stifled the etf rule when combined with the derivatives rule permits additional issuers to launch new leveraged and inverse etfs including single stock etfs so there are a number of issuers that have entered the leveraged and inverse etf market at the same time i wouldn t be surprised if these products are seeking to take advantage of some of the trends related to meme stocks and the gamification of trading two areas the sec is definitely focused on one thing i ve noticed about single stock etfs is that the amount of targeted leveraged or inverse return tops out at 2x leverage or 2x leverage for years there have been 3x leveraged or inverse etfs why aren t there 3x leveraged or inverse single stock etfs jennifer choi what it boils down to is how much leverage can you achieve consistent with the 40 act s derivatives rule under the new derivatives rule funds have to comply with one of two different value at risk or var tests the relative var test or the absolute var test a fund will satisfy the relative var test if its portfolio var doesn t exceed 200 of the var of its designated reference portfolio or drp a fund that doesn t have a drp will satisfy the absolute var test if its portfolio var doesn t exceed 20 of the value of the fund s net assets as a result 2x leverage or 2x inverse leverage is the maximum leveraged or inverse exposure attainable by open end funds under the derivatives rule however at the time the derivatives rule was adopted the sec grandfathered in existing index based 3x and 3x leveraged and inverse etfs ed baer that makes sense but not all of these single stock etfs seek up to 2x leveraged or 2x inverse leveraged exposure instead issuers of single stock etfs appear to have concluded based on the volatility of the underlying stocks that less than the maximum permitted leveraged or inverse exposure is desirable so there are products out there that establish lower leveraged and inverse targets such as 1 5x leveraged or 1 5x inverse leverage i think the lesson for investors is that if you are thinking about purchasing a single stock etf understand what the precise exposure of the etf will be and do not view the single stock etf as a buy and hold investment jennifer choi that s right these things can be risky and even more volatile than the underlying stocks so invest carefully well that brings us to the end of the podcast ed and i want to thank you all for joining us on this discussion of single stock etfs
treasury minister chris philp said that a commitment by former chancellor rishi sunak to uprate benefits in line with inflation was under consideration after reports that different government departments have been asked to draw up plans for efficiency savings the move reported by the bbc and others would be aimed at reducing future government borrowing after the economic turmoil following the mini budget liz truss is expected to face public questioning about her economic plans for the first time following the fallout from the mini budget on thursday as the prime minister tours regional bbc radio stations in a morning round of interviews on wednesday the bank of england launched an emergency government bond buying programme to prevent borrowing costs from spiralling out of control and stave off a material risk to uk financial stability the bank announced it was stepping in to buy up to 65 billion worth of government bonds known as gilts at an urgent pace after fears over the government s economic policies sent the pound tumbling and sparked a sell off in the gilts market the bank of england launched an emergency government bond buying programme to prevent borrowing costs from spiralling out of control yui mok pa the market turmoil had forced pension funds to sell government bonds to head off worries over their solvency but this was threatening to see them suffer severe losses following the bank s intervention mr philp insisted there would be no consideration at all for a change of course by the government getting britain s economy growing is so important important to raise wages and important to pay the tax bills of the future he told sky news responding to reports that cabinet ministers would be asked to draw up efficiency savings for their departments mr philp told itv s peston we are going to look for efficiencies wherever we can find them chris philp said the government would not consider changing course on its plans after an intervention by the bank of england aaron chown pa he added the objective of the exercise would be to make sure the government stays within its existing three year spending limits those efficiency savings will firstly make sure we do stick to those spending limits mr philp said and secondly it will enable us within those spending limits which we are going to stick to to target things which are going to stimulate growth the minister defended the cut to the 45p rate of income tax which is set to have most benefit for high earners claiming it was only one twentieth of the fiscal firepower announced last friday but mr philp told itv that the treasury would not commit to an expected uprating of benefits in line with inflation pressed about the decision mr philp said i am not going to make policy commitments on live tv it is going to be considered in the normal way we will make a decision and it will be announced i am sure in the first instance to the house of commons liz truss is expected to face public questioning about her economic plans for the first time following the fallout from the mini budget toby melville pa mr philp was earlier joined by his junior ministerial colleague andrew griffith in defending the government s plans with neither the prime minister nor the chancellor anywhere to be seen or heard on the economy his cabinet colleague kemi badenoch described the situation as the elephant in the room during her first overseas visit as trade secretary but before i go into what we are doing it would be odd not to address the elephant in the room and the financial instability in markets over the last few days the former tory leadership candidate told us investors in new york you would by now have heard the bank of england taking short term measures to provide stability as is their job for decades we have been too focused on how we divide the pie and not enough on growing it the pm and chancellor are right to change that with their growth plan tax cuts for all energy support for people and business business investment unleashed kemi badenoch kemibadenoch september 23 2022 my colleagues including the chancellor continue to work very closely with our institutions to support them in their aims while maintaining their independence and we must look at all of this in the context of the fundamentals which are that the uk economy is strong and we have a plan a growth plan to cut taxes promote enterprise and cut red tape for business ms truss is likely to face close scrutiny on thursday morning however as she is due to tour bbc regional radio fielding questions from the british public as the markets open it all comes just days before tory mps and thousands of members will descend upon birmingham for ms truss first party conference as prime minister some of the party s big beasts including defeated leadership candidate mr sunak are reportedly not attending the conference other tories including treasury select committee chair mel stride have warned there s a lot of concern within the parliamentary party there s no doubt about that about the economic outlook mr stride also called for ministers to bring forward an independent analysis of their economic plans for the office for budget responsibility as soon as possible labour leader sir keir starmer meanwhile called on the government to recall parliament to deal with the escalating crisis before any more damage is done as his party s conference in liverpool came to an end sir keir said the move by the bank of england is very serious and i think many people will now be extremely worried about their mortgage about prices going up and now about their pensions the government has clearly lost control of the economy it was a message echoed by former tory justice secretary david gauke who said the government has caused a crisis but the pain is still to come the mp for south west hertfordshire from 2005 to 2019 told the bbc now we have what can only be described as a crisis and it is directly as a consequence of decisions made by the conservative government the pain is still to come in truth the pain of higher interest rates of tougher decisions on public spending is yet to be felt added the 50 year old who also previously served as secretary to the treasury

treasury minister chris philp said that a commitment by former chancellor rishi sunak to uprate benefits in line with inflation was under consideration after reports that different government departments have been asked to draw up plans for efficiency savings the move reported by the bbc and others would be aimed at reducing future government borrowing after the economic turmoil following the mini budget liz truss is expected to face public questioning about her economic plans for the first time following the fallout from the mini budget on thursday as the prime minister tours regional bbc radio stations in a morning round of interviews on wednesday the bank of england launched an emergency government bond buying programme to prevent borrowing costs from spiralling out of control and stave off a material risk to uk financial stability the bank announced it was stepping in to buy up to 65 billion worth of government bonds known as gilts at an urgent pace after fears over the government s economic policies sent the pound tumbling and sparked a sell off in the gilts market the bank of england launched an emergency government bond buying programme to prevent borrowing costs from spiralling out of control yui mok pa the market turmoil had forced pension funds to sell government bonds to head off worries over their solvency but this was threatening to see them suffer severe losses following the bank s intervention mr philp insisted there would be no consideration at all for a change of course by the government getting britain s economy growing is so important important to raise wages and important to pay the tax bills of the future he told sky news responding to reports that cabinet ministers would be asked to draw up efficiency savings for their departments mr philp told itv s peston we are going to look for efficiencies wherever we can find them chris philp said the government would not consider changing course on its plans after an intervention by the bank of england aaron chown pa he added the objective of the exercise would be to make sure the government stays within its existing three year spending limits those efficiency savings will firstly make sure we do stick to those spending limits mr philp said and secondly it will enable us within those spending limits which we are going to stick to to target things which are going to stimulate growth the minister defended the cut to the 45p rate of income tax which is set to have most benefit for high earners claiming it was only one twentieth of the fiscal firepower announced last friday but mr philp told itv that the treasury would not commit to an expected uprating of benefits in line with inflation pressed about the decision mr philp said i am not going to make policy commitments on live tv it is going to be considered in the normal way we will make a decision and it will be announced i am sure in the first instance to the house of commons liz truss is expected to face public questioning about her economic plans for the first time following the fallout from the mini budget toby melville pa mr philp was earlier joined by his junior ministerial colleague andrew griffith in defending the government s plans with neither the prime minister nor the chancellor anywhere to be seen or heard on the economy his cabinet colleague kemi badenoch described the situation as the elephant in the room during her first overseas visit as trade secretary but before i go into what we are doing it would be odd not to address the elephant in the room and the financial instability in markets over the last few days the former tory leadership candidate told us investors in new york you would by now have heard the bank of england taking short term measures to provide stability as is their job for decades we have been too focused on how we divide the pie and not enough on growing it the pm and chancellor are right to change that with their growth plan tax cuts for all energy support for people and business business investment unleashed kemi badenoch kemibadenoch september 23 2022 my colleagues including the chancellor continue to work very closely with our institutions to support them in their aims while maintaining their independence and we must look at all of this in the context of the fundamentals which are that the uk economy is strong and we have a plan a growth plan to cut taxes promote enterprise and cut red tape for business ms truss is likely to face close scrutiny on thursday morning however as she is due to tour bbc regional radio fielding questions from the british public as the markets open it all comes just days before tory mps and thousands of members will descend upon birmingham for ms truss first party conference as prime minister some of the party s big beasts including defeated leadership candidate mr sunak are reportedly not attending the conference other tories including treasury select committee chair mel stride have warned there s a lot of concern within the parliamentary party there s no doubt about that about the economic outlook mr stride also called for ministers to bring forward an independent analysis of their economic plans for the office for budget responsibility as soon as possible labour leader sir keir starmer meanwhile called on the government to recall parliament to deal with the escalating crisis before any more damage is done as his party s conference in liverpool came to an end sir keir said the move by the bank of england is very serious and i think many people will now be extremely worried about their mortgage about prices going up and now about their pensions the government has clearly lost control of the economy it was a message echoed by former tory justice secretary david gauke who said the government has caused a crisis but the pain is still to come the mp for south west hertfordshire from 2005 to 2019 told the bbc now we have what can only be described as a crisis and it is directly as a consequence of decisions made by the conservative government the pain is still to come in truth the pain of higher interest rates of tougher decisions on public spending is yet to be felt added the 50 year old who also previously served as secretary to the treasury

alex brummer it s 12 years since the end of the financial crisis how can such risky trading be happening all over again after days of sitting on its hands and months of refusing to tackle the looming spectre of inflation the bank of england has finally acted it had no choice in the aftermath of kwasi kwarteng s badly received mini budget last week financial markets went into a tailspin the pound falling to historic lows against the dollar yesterday the carnage intensified with the long term interest rates on government bonds soaring to such an extent that a new credit crunch was threatened in britain s private sector pension funds in which trillions of pounds are invested in promising to buy some 65billion of government debt the old lady of threadneedle street has sought to prevent a meltdown about one trillion government bonds known as gilts are held in risky specialist funds these have halved in value in recent days leading to fears that a chain reaction of insolvencies could follow threatening the entire pension system after days of sitting on its hands and months of refusing to tackle the looming spectre of inflation the bank of england pictured has finally acted the bank s new intervention will limit that damage and ensure that the pensions of up to ten million people with gold plated final salary schemes are protected the worst for now has been averted but we have to ask how it is possible 12 years after the end of the financial crisis that institutions at the core of the consumer economy could be involved in such risky behaviour as investing in these specialist funds the bank of england through its financial stability committee created after the 2008 crash is meant to inoculate consumers and markets against such serious risk it has patently failed to do so and once again the taxpayer may have to pick up the tab the bank s governor andrew bailey and its stability chief jon cunliffe may yet find themselves in the political firing line as they try to explain how these funds found their way into the core of the financial system but that is for another day in the meantime and in spite of the market s bearish response to their tax cutting mini budget last week liz truss and mr kwarteng are determined to stick to their guns the pm and chancellor not only believe that the costly energy price cap for households and business which limits the ravages of high international gas prices is critical if britain is to avoid economic collapse they also regard tax cuts as essential to lifting the uk out of its growth stupor with its plans to buy government bonds on whatever scale is necessary and at an urgent pace the bank is seeking to settle some of the alarming volatility of recent days the intervention will be welcomed by pension funds and the very banks that have financed some of the risky activities while homeowners fearful of surging monthly mortgage payments may also feel less panicked but it still marks a big u turn only a week ago at the last meeting of its rate setting monetary policy committee the bank said it would end its programme of buying government bonds known as quantitative easing and aim to reduce its vast holdings of these assets by some 80billion within days it has been forced back into the market this is all deeply unusual the bank almost never intervenes to calm the gilts market let alone back this up with a public statement and mr bailey has also acted with unusual speed for months he has been accused of showing insufficient grit in raising interest rates particularly compared with his international peers in the aftermath of kwasi kwarteng s picturerd badly received mini budget last week financial markets went into a tailspin the pound falling to historic lows against the dollar his most recent dovish rise by just half a percentage point struck many as too little too late given that america s federal reserve has repeatedly raised rates by three quarters of a percentage point bank of england chief economist huw pill is now cautioning that a hefty rise in its base rate is on the cards for november it has been desperately resisting an emergency increase this week for fear of causing even more panic the fact is that much of yesterday s drama could have been avoided had the bank acted more boldly last week the old lady knew that an expensive energy bailout for consumers and businesses was on the cards and that a raft of tax cutting growth measures was also on the way given all this it should have acted faster so what next first of all we need a prompt investigation into how pension funds came to invest billions in the risky assets i mentioned earlier the bank s oversight on this has been lax second the bond buying will work in the short term speculators betting against the british economy may be inclined to think again nevertheless the bank s dramatic action shows how difficult it will be to guide the markets back to normality and this may not be the last time the old lady rouses from her slumbers to surprise us all

treasury minister chris philp said that a commitment by former chancellor rishi sunak to uprate benefits in line with inflation was under consideration after reports that different government departments have been asked to draw up plans for efficiency savings the move reported by the bbc and others would be aimed at reducing future government borrowing after the economic turmoil following the mini budget liz truss is expected to face public questioning about her economic plans for the first time following the fallout from the mini budget on thursday as the prime minister tours regional bbc radio stations in a morning round of interviews on wednesday the bank of england launched an emergency government bond buying programme to prevent borrowing costs from spiralling out of control and stave off a material risk to uk financial stability the bank announced it was stepping in to buy up to 65 billion worth of government bonds known as gilts at an urgent pace after fears over the government s economic policies sent the pound tumbling and sparked a sell off in the gilts market the bank of england launched an emergency government bond buying programme to prevent borrowing costs from spiralling out of control yui mok pa the market turmoil had forced pension funds to sell government bonds to head off worries over their solvency but this was threatening to see them suffer severe losses following the bank s intervention mr philp insisted there would be no consideration at all for a change of course by the government getting britain s economy growing is so important important to raise wages and important to pay the tax bills of the future he told sky news responding to reports that cabinet ministers would be asked to draw up efficiency savings for their departments mr philp told itv s peston we are going to look for efficiencies wherever we can find them chris philp said the government would not consider changing course on its plans after an intervention by the bank of england aaron chown pa he added the objective of the exercise would be to make sure the government stays within its existing three year spending limits those efficiency savings will firstly make sure we do stick to those spending limits mr philp said and secondly it will enable us within those spending limits which we are going to stick to to target things which are going to stimulate growth the minister defended the cut to the 45p rate of income tax which is set to have most benefit for high earners claiming it was only one twentieth of the fiscal firepower announced last friday but mr philp told itv that the treasury would not commit to an expected uprating of benefits in line with inflation pressed about the decision mr philp said i am not going to make policy commitments on live tv it is going to be considered in the normal way we will make a decision and it will be announced i am sure in the first instance to the house of commons liz truss is expected to face public questioning about her economic plans for the first time following the fallout from the mini budget toby melville pa mr philp was earlier joined by his junior ministerial colleague andrew griffith in defending the government s plans with neither the prime minister nor the chancellor anywhere to be seen or heard on the economy his cabinet colleague kemi badenoch described the situation as the elephant in the room during her first overseas visit as trade secretary but before i go into what we are doing it would be odd not to address the elephant in the room and the financial instability in markets over the last few days the former tory leadership candidate told us investors in new york you would by now have heard the bank of england taking short term measures to provide stability as is their job for decades we have been too focused on how we divide the pie and not enough on growing it the pm and chancellor are right to change that with their growth plan tax cuts for all energy support for people and business business investment unleashed kemi badenoch kemibadenoch september 23 2022 my colleagues including the chancellor continue to work very closely with our institutions to support them in their aims while maintaining their independence and we must look at all of this in the context of the fundamentals which are that the uk economy is strong and we have a plan a growth plan to cut taxes promote enterprise and cut red tape for business ms truss is likely to face close scrutiny on thursday morning however as she is due to tour bbc regional radio fielding questions from the british public as the markets open it all comes just days before tory mps and thousands of members will descend upon birmingham for ms truss first party conference as prime minister some of the party s big beasts including defeated leadership candidate mr sunak are reportedly not attending the conference other tories including treasury select committee chair mel stride have warned there s a lot of concern within the parliamentary party there s no doubt about that about the economic outlook mr stride also called for ministers to bring forward an independent analysis of their economic plans for the office for budget responsibility as soon as possible labour leader sir keir starmer meanwhile called on the government to recall parliament to deal with the escalating crisis before any more damage is done as his party s conference in liverpool came to an end sir keir said the move by the bank of england is very serious and i think many people will now be extremely worried about their mortgage about prices going up and now about their pensions the government has clearly lost control of the economy it was a message echoed by former tory justice secretary david gauke who said the government has caused a crisis but the pain is still to come the mp for south west hertfordshire from 2005 to 2019 told the bbc now we have what can only be described as a crisis and it is directly as a consequence of decisions made by the conservative government the pain is still to come in truth the pain of higher interest rates of tougher decisions on public spending is yet to be felt added the 50 year old who also previously served as secretary to the treasury
in the next month natural gas may become cheaper by nearly 32 percent and cost around bgn 240 eur 122 per megawatt hour this was said by the executive director of bulgargaz denitsa zlateva during the public discussion of prices in the energy regulator the main reason is that from october 1 the bulgarian greek gas connection is expected to be operational and our country will receive the entire amount of azeri blue fuel through it the current increase in the price of international stock exchanges will affect the price in november said denitsa zlateva she added that there is great interest in the announced 4 tenders for the supply of liquefied natural gas both short term and for a 10 year period the very fact that we have companies from america europe the middle east china shows that this is the right approach i hope that through these open transparent competitive procedures we will also achieve a good price for november we have no worries that it will not be provided the necessary amount of natural gas what we aim for is to be at a competitive price bulgargaz will submit its final application for prices on october 1 follow on and write to us at bnr copyright c novinite com published with permission via big news network news agency
ronald reagan building washington d c 10 27 a m edt the president jimmieka she please sit down sit down laughter she s awful good isn t she she was really good jimmieka thank you for joining us and for this historic conference on hunger nutrition and health before i begin though i speaking of health you all have been reading and hearing about the hurricane and hurricane ian and its impact it s going to have on our fellow americans down in florida yesterday i spoke with governor desantis for some time my team has been in constant contact with him from the very beginning and the mayors of tampa st pete s and clearwater and my message has been absolutely clear is that we are on alert and in action we ve approved every request florida has made for temporary assistance emergency assistance long term assistance that i ve received we discussed what we have done to prepare for the hurricane that includes dispatching hundreds of fema personnel and activating thousands of national guard members i have also developed the search and rescue teams and deployed them from multiple federal agencies and they re already on the ground and ready to help as we speak fema pre positioned millions of literally millions of liters of water millions of meals and hundreds of generators we have scheduled everything we can possibly do and we think and so do the mayors and the governor that and we ve had put up shelters they re ready we re not sure exactly where it s going to hit but we ve pretty it s getting pretty clear exactly where it s going to hit i made it clear to the governor and the mayors that the federal government is ready to help in every single way possible and i want to repeat what i said yesterday to the people of florida this storm is incredibly dangerous to state the obvious it s life threatening you should obey all warnings and directions from emergency officials don t take anything for granted use their judgment not yours evacuate when ordered be prepared the storm warnings are real the evacuation notices are real the danger is real and when the storm passes the federal government is going to be there to help you recover we ll be there to help you clean up and rebuild to help you get florida get moving again and we ll be there at every step of the way that s my absolute commitment to the people of the state of florida applause and if you ll forgive me i want to add one more warning that s a warning to the oil and gas industry executives do not let me repeat do not do not use this as an excuse to raise gasoline prices or gouge the american people applause the price of oil has stayed relatively low it kept going down the price of gas should be going down as well my experts inform me that production of only about 190 000 barrels a day has been impacted by this storm thus far that s less than 2 percent of the united states daily production impacted for a very short period of time this small temporary storm impact on oil production provides no excuse no excuse for price increases at the pump none if gas companies try to use this storm to raise prices at the pump i will ask officials to look into whether price gouging is going on america is watching the industry should do the right thing as a matter of fact they should move more quickly now to bring down the price at the pump because gasoline is down the price of gasoline is down a great deal there s too much of a delay between the price of barrel of ga of gas being pro oil and the price of gasoline at the pump now to why we re all here for this on this historic day the secretary of agriculture said everything so i m leaving laughter you really did so i apologize to you for any repetition that may occur here but all kidding aside you know it s been over 50 years to state the obvious you all know it well since president nixon convened the original white house conference on hunger nutrition and health and the single that single conference and the laws that inspired it it inspired led a transformational change that has helped millions of americans live healthier lives for generations since that time advances in research and medicine have taught us so much more about nutrition and health and today i m convening this conference again because i believe we can use these advances to do even more to make america stronger and a healthier nation and so many of you know so much about this as well and you re committed and i want to thank all of you here including bipartisan elected officials like representative mcgovern senator braun senator booker representative jackie are you here where s jackie i didn t think she was she wasn t going to be here to help make this a reality and thanks to senator stabenow representative delauro for their leadership and here today we have advocates and activists josé andrés you ve heard of him haven t you applause la last time we hung out on the ukrainian border in poland and leaders of business labor agriculture faith and philanthropy and to achieve ambitious goals that i know we can do if we work together i really do know we can do this end hunger in this country by the year 2030 and lower the toll applause lower the toll that diet related diseases takes on for too many americans this goal is within our reach just look at how far we ve come on child poverty thirty years ago as was referenced 1 in 4 children lived below the poverty line today 1 in 20 live below the poverty line so i know we can take tackle hunger as well and i ve released a national strategy to meet that bold goal the strategy that has three key three key principles first help more americans i ll say this again help more americans access the food that will keep their families nourished and healthy a lot of food deserts out there second give folks the option and information they need to make healthy dietary choices thirdly help more americans be physically active people want to be lots of times of times there s no places to go to be active from where they live the good news is that we ve already been laying a strong foundation for this work soon after i came to office i signed what was called the american rescue plan into law it helped put food on the table and keep a roof over the heads of millions of american families it helped our economy create nearly 10 million new jobs most jobs created in that timeframe in american history we kept a pri a key price of of the a piece of the american rescue plan is the expanded childcare tax credit applause where is she the gentlewoman from connecticut i overwhelmingly working families used the child tax credit to buy food and other basic needs for their families and it helped cut child poverty by nearly 50 percent in the united states 50 percent applause and it cut food insecurity for families by 26 percent applause look folks people are constantly looking at federal programs to see which ones are working and which ones are ineffective well during the pandemic we had a real world example right in front of us the expanded childcare tax credit is one of the most effective programs we ve ever seen and that s why my national strategy calls on congress to expand the child credit permanently applause permanently we got to do it applause we tried we couldn t get it done the first time we ll get it done this time applause at the same time i remain committed to protecting workers rights and fair wages and collective bargaining including workers who grow produce and process our food who transport it to grocery stores applause who stock the grocery shelves and so they too can afford to feed their families look folks my strategy would also make permanent the ameri an american rescue plan program that has made sure families including over 30 million children had money to buy groceries into the summer months so kids don t go hungry when school isn t in session it sounds silly for a person to hear that who doesn t have a child but full school programs food programs do a lot during the summer months things change within the next 10 years my plan as was already referenced would make at least 9 million more children eligible for free school meals a major first step for free meals for every single student applause and we re also supporting schools so they can cook more meals from scratch purchase more food from local farmers and ranchers applause and this will mean kids will have healthier meals and we ll strengthen rural economies at the same time you heard from senator from secretary vilsack senator excuse me i demoted you laughter all kidding aside he s doing a hell of a job earlier applause i not only thank him for leading on this iss he knows a great deal about it and he cares passionately about this issue the national strategy recognizes the critical role that nutrition plays in our health and our healthcare system and it acknowledges that we give we have to give families the tools to keep them healthy how many of you here are are medical people involved in research you know almost every single almost every single discipline from cancer to heart disease on down the line are finding out it s affected by diet and exercise applause i mean things we you all knew but we it wasn t proved before and so example heart disease is the leading cause of death in america nineteen states in 19 states more than 35 percent of adults are obese in 19 states nineteen for seniors and millions of folks on medicaid our national strategy would expand access to nutrition and obesity counseling so they can get the guidance they need to stay healthy it has only not only do people need to know what they should be eating what they should be eating our national strategy also calls for doctors nurses dentists to be trained to spot the signs of hunger and the food and drug administration is already using its authority around labeling so you know which food is high on trans fats and sodium so you can figure out which food is actually good for you and what isn t good for you and that only is going to increase informing people both in too many underserved communities urban rural and tribal there s nowhere to buy fresh food for miles or safe places for kids to play or adults to exercise i ve signed the bipartisan infrastructure law it creates space to live work and play safely it doesn t just build highways and build new ports and airports and the like it also has the ability to transform systems that are already over overworked right now where families can drink clean water breathe clean air use public transit so they can shop at nearby grocery stores that stock fresh and healthy foods we also know that too often healthier food cost more that s why that s why my strategy calls for congress to expand incentives to purchase fruits and vegetables for low income families applause who rely on who rely on snap benefits to buy groceries so it ll be easier to afford the food that s good for you you know until recently the way snap benefits were calculated hadn t been i think this was referenced already hadn t been updated for nearly 45 years actually over 45 years so last year my administration changed the formula and now folks are getting an average of 36 extra dollars in their pockets per month physical activity is part of living a healthy lifestyle and avoiding diet related diseases we re going to work with congress to increase access to county the country s parks county city national especially for americans in low income communities who need public transit to get there it will also give more families the chance to hike to bike to breathe fresh air through the inflation reduction act we re making historic investments in climate and public health so families can get outside and be physically active in the air that s clean not polluted with dirty diesel from buses and trucks and school buses as well the department of education and the centers for disease control and prevention the cdc are going to help schools expand physical education classes into the summer schools and summer programs so kids get off to a healthy start in life if they re in summer school they re also going to be have physical capacity they have gym the equivalent of gym and after school programs so we get kids off to a healthy start not just so we should take advantage of the opportunities when we have these children there s so much more in our strategy and so much more in our imagination but one thing is clear meeting our bold goals requires a whole of government approach a whole of government approach and a whole of society effort that s why i m so excited to see all of you here you represent society in a way that is touches every aspect of society every every part of the country and when i look out at all of you and the work you re doing in your communities i know i just know we we can do this people are becoming more aware i mean people who are who are getting hurt by the failure to know to have the access they re beginning to be aware and they re beginning to think in ways they didn t think before that as what their dietary habits should be and how they how they should fe be feeding their children if they can feed them well before we especially during the pandemic so many of you were there to help your fellow americans they lost their jobs closed their businesses faced eviction homelessness hunger lost control and maybe the worst of all lost hope and dignity but whether it s been your life s work or you re just getting started all of you are stepping up you collected food donations you served and saved baskets and lunches and breakfast foods and i mean just across the board you did everything in school school programs and summer school programs you found new ways to get food from farms to restaurants to dinner tables you gave other families hope in my church we have an expression when someone s doing something they say you re doing the lord s work a lot of people been doing the lord s work that s why each of you what each of you are doing and we re on our way in a way that i don t think that we have for a while and again you know science changes things and people are realizing not only whether or not they re overweight or obese or not healthy quote unquote but certain diseases are affected by what they eat what they intake and people are beginning the more we can the more we can spread that word and educate people of what s at stake the more we re going to see change but we have to be ready as a government as a people to provide the elements of change that are going to change things for them so thanks to the american rescue plan and the fact that the economy is turning around a high level of food insecurity we saw at the height of the pandemic is down but despite the progress 1 in 10 american households still do not have access to enough food one in ten we re working to deliver an economy that finally works for working families jobs are up people are back to work we re taking on inflation seriously enacting policies to bring down cost but there s always significantly more we can do that s why we re here today to harness our greatest resource our fellow americans everyone everyone has an important role to play local state territory and tribal governments and the federal government as well the private sector civil society agriculture philanthropy academia you know for example the rockefeller foundation and the american heart association are expanding research into the relationship between food health and health equity and the food nutrition and investor coalition is investing 2 5 billion into proven technologies and startup companies pioneering new ways for reducing hunger and improving nutrition today we re announcing over 8 billion in commitments from over 100 different organizations to help reach our goals applause eight billion and i also firmly believe the work ahead should be bipartisan there shouldn t be anything partisan about any of this applause just as it was when president nixon first convened this conference or when senator george mcgovern and bob dole transformed america s role in reducing hunger in america and around the world and this and this work on hunger and nutrition and physical health is critical to addressing our mental health and wellness as well which is a key pillar to my unity agenda that i called for in my state of the union address again bipartisan this is something that should we should be all rallying the country to work on together and thinking internationally global inflation and putin s war in ukraine have sparked a global food crisis so just last week at the united nations i talked about the commitments we re making to tackle food insecurity worldwide because in every country in the world and in every state in this country no matter what else divides us if a parent cannot feed a child there s nothing else that matters for that parent if you look at your child and you can t feed your child what the hell else matters applause i really mean it worldwide so folks let me close with this i believe america and you re tired of hearing me say it i m sure is at an inflection point it happens every six or eight generations where thi so much changes in the world that everything that comes after it is different than it was before you ve also heard me talk about the need to for us to restore the soul of america all i m talking about is just restore say the decency treating people with respect treating people in a way that you d expect you d want to be treated and by the way some of you have been around long enough to remember we used to be that way in politics we fought like hell applause no i m serious we fought like hell but ultimately the vast majority were decent one of my best friends was a guy who was like a brother i always fought with we d shout at each other on the floor of the senate and then go have lunch together his name was john mccain applause the point is every senator can mention can acknowledge that this should be an organizing element of how we start to talk to one another again dealing with food insecurity the task before us at this conference is the important work that follows and meeting this inflection point by nourishing the soul of america america in america no child no child should go to bed hungry no parent applause no parent should die of a disease that can be prevented applause this has always been a country at our best when we re at our best we think big it s almost like we don t think anymore that we can do big things no i mean it sincerely think about it i realize this is not directly related but one of the things that i say to my team my friends if i could wave a wand and change one thing that would change america s attitude about all we re able to do remember who we were i d wave a wand and say cure cancer why cancer everybody is scared to death of cancer and most people don t think we can do much about it we can but imagine if we did that people would say my god we re back well this could be a gigantic step a gigantic step and remind us who the hell we are this is the united states of america applause there is nothing nothing nothing applause i really mean it there s nothing beyond our capacity when we work together so let s work together god bless you all and may god protect our troops thank you thank you thank you applause 10 50 a m edt

on june 21 2022 president biden signed the bankruptcy threshold adjustment and technical corrections act into law as we reported here the bankruptcy corrections act revived the 7 5 million eligibility threshold for accessing the popular streamlined restructuring process set out in subchapter v of chapter 11 a less prominent feature of the legislation however has important ramifications for parent companies private equity investors and other shareholders seeking to restructure struggling subsidiaries and other affiliates as discussed below the bankruptcy corrections act clarifies that subsidiaries and affiliates may be eligible for subchapter v effectively abrogating caselaw holdings to the contrary this clarification may be of particular interest to foreign public companies that are not registered with the us securities and exchange commission sec but have privately held subsidiaries in the united states that they wish and now may be able to reorganize sell or liquidate through subchapter v of chapter 11 congress previously defined the small business debtors eligible for subchapter v by excluding any entity that was an affiliate of an issuer of securities under the securities exchange act of 1934 because the exchange act defines an issuer as any person who issues or proposes to issue any security which includes stock bonds and investment contracts certain debtors were prevented from accessing subchapter v simply because of their affiliation with a non publicly traded corporation that had issued securities for example in in re phenomenon marketing entertainment llc the bankruptcy court for the central district of california ruled that the debtor did not qualify for subchapter v and revoked its subchapter v election based on its affiliation with two non publicly traded companies that were issuers under the exchange act in re phenomenon mktg ent llc no 2 22 bk 10132 er 2022 wl 1262001 at 5 6 bankr c d cal apr 28 2022 modified no 2 22 bk 10132 er 2022 wl 3042141 bankr c d cal aug 1 2022 the court specifically remarked that it was the responsibility of congress to amend the law if affiliates of issuers were intended to be eligible congress has now done so by reconciling the text of the law with its intended purpose the bankruptcy corrections act retroactively amends the definition of debtor to block subchapter v elections for a any debtor that is a corporation subject to the reporting requirements under section 13 or 15 d of the securities exchange act of 1934 15 usc 78m 78o d or b any debtor that is an affiliate of a corporation as a result of the passage of the bankruptcy corrections act the phenomenon court granted the debtor s motion to reinstate its subchapter v election and access its streamlined restructuring process in re phenomenon mktg ent llc no 2 22 bk 10132 er 2022 wl 3042141 at 3 bankr c d cal aug 1 2022 the enactment of the bankruptcy corrections act together with the phenomenon decision recognizing the import of that legislation clears a path for an array of parent companies private equity investors and other shareholders to restructure distressed affiliates subsidiaries and portfolio companies using subchapter v the benefits of subchapter v are significant allowing equity holders to maintain their interests in the debtor without new value requirements while implementing a chapter 11 reorganization or sale process with relaxed confirmation requirements and typically without an estate funded committee of creditors that is a hallmark of the standard chapter 11 process notably the bankruptcy corrections act does not merely draw a distinction between privately versus publicly held affiliates rather subchapter v now excludes affiliates of corporations that are subject to reporting requirements under the exchange act thus there may be publicly held non us entities that are not registered with the sec but have subchapter v eligible subsidiaries or other affiliates doing business in the united states and having a domicile or property here the revisions to subchapter v create or at least clarify important restructuring optionality for these entities particularly when combined with the 7 5 million debt threshold which was temporarily extended and will sunset in two years as equity holders examine their portfolio assets there is a window of opportunity to utilize subchapter v to restructure underperforming assets quickly and efficiently 11 usc 1182 1 b

severe losses following the bank s intervention mr philp insisted there would be no consideration at all for a change of course by the government getting britain s economy growing is so important important to raise wages and important to pay the tax bills of the future he told sky news responding to reports that cabinet ministers would be asked to draw up efficiency savings for their departments mr philp told itv s peston we are going to look for efficiencies wherever we can find them chris philp said the government would not consider changing course on its plans after an

colleague andrew griffith in defending the government s plans with neither the prime minister nor the chancellor anywhere to be seen or heard on the economy his cabinet colleague kemi badenoch described the situation as the elephant in the room during her first overseas visit as trade secretary but before i go into what we are doing it would be odd not to address the elephant in the room and the financial instability in markets over the last few days the former tory leadership candidate told us investors in new york you would by now have heard the bank of england taking short term measures to provide stability as is their job for decades we have been too focused on how we divide the pie and not enough on growing it the pm and chancellor are right to change that with their growth plan tax cuts for all energy support for people and business business investment unleashed kemi badenoch kemibadenoch september 23 2022 my colleagues including the chancellor continue to work very closely with our institutions to support them in their aims while maintaining their independence and we must look at all of this in the context of the fundamentals which are that the uk economy is strong and we have a plan a growth plan to cut taxes promote enterprise and cut red tape for business ms truss is likely to face close scrutiny on thursday morning however as she is due to tour bbc regional radio fielding questions from the british public as the markets open it all comes just days before tory mps and thousands of members will descend upon birmingham for ms truss first party conference as prime minister some of the party s big beasts including defeated leadership candidate mr sunak are reportedly not attending the conference other tories including treasury select committee chair mel stride have warned there s a lot of concern within the parliamentary party there s no doubt about that about the economic outlook mr stride also called for ministers to bring forward an independent analysis of their economic plans for the office for budget responsibility as soon as possible labour leader sir keir starmer meanwhile called on the government to recall parliament to deal with the escalating crisis before any more damage is done as his party s conference in liverpool came to an end sir keir said the move by the bank of england is very serious and i think many people will now be extremely worried about their mortgage about prices going up and now about their pensions the government has clearly lost control of the economy it was a message echoed by former tory justice secretary david gauke who said the government has caused a crisis but the pain is still to come the mp for south west hertfordshire from 2005 to 2019 told the bbc now we have what can only be described as a crisis and it is directly as a consequence of decisions made by the conservative government the pain is still to come in truth the pain of higher interest rates of tougher decisions on public spending is yet to be felt added the 50 year old who also previously served as secretary to the treasury
china daily updated 2022 09 29 07 41 a pedestrian walks past an electronic quotation board displaying the numbers of the nikkei 225 index on the tokyo stock exchange l and a foreign exchange board showing the yen s rate against us dollar r in tokyo on april 19 2022 the bank of japan intervened in the yen s exchange rate for the first time in years briefly arresting the yen s decline against the backdrop of the us federal reserve s aggressive interest rate hikes but analysts believe that the long term effect remains to be seen after the fed announced an interest rate increase of 75 basis points on sept 21 the yen fell significantly against the us dollar prompting japan s central bank to announce it would continue to implement large scale quantitative easing making japan the only major economy to maintain negative interest rates after boj governor haruhiko kuroda said that the policy of continued quantitative easing has not changed and the adjustment of financial policy will be two to three years away the yen continued its decline against the us dollar approaching the 146 1 mark as of 5 pm that day a 24 year low however less than an hour later the yen briefly recovered to 140 1 prompting speculation that the japanese government had intervened to buy the yen and sell dollars senior finance officials later confirmed this was the case this is the first time in 24 years that the japanese government has intervened in the yen s exchange rate some argue that japan received prior approval from the united states for its intervention therefore the determination of japan to maintain its existing loose monetary policy may not change in the short term but that will further expand the interest rate gap between the yen and the us dollar and the euro as long as the boj continues to maintain its current monetary policy the general trend of the yen s depreciation will be difficult to reverse and japan s exchange rate intervention is in effect paying for its central bank s monetary policy the use of exchange rate interventions to keep a currency s foreign exchange stable is like removing boiling water and then returning it to keep the pot from boiling over some japanese economists believe that the yen s exchange rate intervention can only slow down the yen s depreciation but cannot stop it it is also believed that the japanese government s intervention in the yen s exchange rate is just a delicate agreement reached by the japanese government the boj and the us but cannot resolve the structural contradictions between the japanese government and the central bank over financial policies economic daily

photo credit ricardo figueroa flickr puerto rico is still reeling from the devastation left in the wake of hurricane fiona which hit the island on september 18 bringing with it historic flooding and landslides at least a dozen people have died and thousands more required emergency rescue fiona s arrival came only two days before the 5 year anniversary of superstorm hurricane maria which pummeled puerto rico in 2017 killing over 4 000 people and leaving millions more without power some for up to a year five years later the island is once again in darkness and puerto ricans are left to fend for themselves here are five things you should know about hurricanes in puerto rico and why this keeps happening puerto rico is one of the oldest colonies in the world originally inhabited by the taínos and known as boríken the island was invaded by the spanish 529 years ago during columbus second voyage later the united states would seize control of it in 1898 as an imperialist spoil of the spanish american war today over a hundred years have passed since its forced annexation yet puerto rico remains in a state of legal limbo and puerto ricans have second class citizenship puerto ricans have essentially no control over their economy they are unable to vote for president or congress and yet are forced to live under u s laws puerto rico has a poverty rate of 43 5 surpassing that of mississippi the poorest u s state as a result millions of puerto ricans have been forcefully displaced throughout the decades some 200 000 of whom were forced to evacuate the island as a direct result of hurricane maria in 2017 puerto rico s colonial status doesn t just exacerbate the island s myriad social and economic issues it is the root cause of them the underdevelopment that centuries of colonialism has caused makes puerto rico increasingly vulnerable to natural catastrophes hurricanes are an inevitable reality for many caribbean islands but their imminence means that local governments and federal disaster relief agencies like fema should be able to plan for them accordingly in puerto rico hurricanes have a habit of unmasking washington s refusal to do so and thus the dire reality of colonialism on the island hurricanes in puerto rico are inevitable disaster colonialism is not five years ago on september 20 2017 hurricane maria hit puerto rico it was a category 5 storm the strongest to impact the island in nearly 90 years and it left unimaginable damage in its wake while puerto ricans went months without power water or adequate shelter as a result then president donald trump lied about the death toll on his twitter account claiming that between 6 to18 people had passed away in reality over 4 000 puerto ricans died in the aftermath of maria most were not victims of the storm itself but of the gross government neglect that puerto rico experienced afterward as fema and the white house dragged their feet to deliver vital aid long after the storm subsided the number of fatalities continued to rise as a result of solvable secondary issues take for example the 26 post maria deaths attributed to leptospirosis a potentially fatal bacterial infection that spread through the island as survivors were forced to drink fluids containing rodent waste in the absence of clean drinking water some two years after maria tens of thousands of water bottles issued by fema were found abandoned in fields unopened and expired never having been distributed to those that so desperately needed them despite such blatant unpreparedness for maria the puerto rican colonial government has done little to prepare for the next storm in the five years since repairs to damaged homes and infrastructure across the island were slated to begin in 2017 yet today thousands of homes and roads have yet to be fixed the government has completed only 21 of more than 5 500 planned repair projects and much of what was completed was done poorly when fiona hit on sunday upwards of 3 600 homes on the island still did not have roofs in utuado a municipality in the central region of the island viral video footage showed a bridge rebuilt after hurricane maria being swept away by aggressive flood waters the arrival of fiona has put even more strain on this already weakened infrastructure the storm dropped record amounts of rain and caused catastrophic flooding early on sunday 100 of the island experienced power outages with no power people are forced to rely on cumbersome and unreliable backup generators that require expensive diesel fuel to operate making them inaccessible to many after maria some municipalities went for an entire year without power this time governor pedro pierluisi has publicly admitted that thousands will again have to endure several days without power from experience puerto ricans know that several days can easily turn into months currently nearly half of the island is still without electricity compare these abysmal relief efforts to the hurricane responses of another caribbean country cuba in 1959 cuba waged a successful revolution against imperialist forces on the island putting an end to the legacy of colonialism that had historically underdeveloped the nation shortly thereafter in 1966 the revolutionary government established a civil defense system that became a global model for disaster relief efforts today disaster preparation and response in cuba saves lives in 2004 for example hurricane jeanne killed 3 000 people in haiti but none in cuba even though cuba was hit harder a 2004 united nations press release praises the island as a leader in disaster preparedness despite the u s imposed blockade that makes it difficult for them to obtain emergency disaster supplies a side by side comparison of cuba and puerto rico s hurricane track record makes it clear that it is a capitalist response to disasters not the disasters themselves that pose the real problem u s corporations profit off disasters and privatization in puerto rico why does this pattern of disregard exist and what motive does the united states have to continuously fumble repair efforts and delay assistance simply put the u s ruling class profits from disasters in puerto rico after hurricane maria prepa puerto rico s government owned utility system awarded 4 4 billion in contracts to corporations for services related to hurricane reconstruction and necessary repair work to the electrical grid a whopping 3 7 billion of those contracts went to u s owned private companies prepa and the puerto rican government are notorious for favoring private companies over local workers and unions utier is the labor union that represents prepa workers and is one of the leading forces in the fight against the privatization of puerto rico s grid according to union leaders in one case prepa paid a florida based corporation to repair street lights in puerto rico at a rate of over 400 per unit even though local union workers offered to do the same work for only around 60 this trend extends beyond contracts awarded by prepa fema for example awarded 156 million to tribute contracting llc a one person company based out of atlanta who promised to deliver 30 million emergency meals to survivors of maria only 50 000 of those meals less than 0 2 percent were ever delivered such corruption plagues relief efforts in puerto rico purposeful mismanagement funnels life saving aid out of the island and into u s corporate accounts unsurprisingly the united states relationship with puerto rico has always been one based on extraction of profit u s corporations squeeze billions of dollars from the island annually yet mind bogglingly puerto rico owes a staggering 72 billion in debt to washington in june of 2016 president barack obama signed promesa puerto rico oversight management and economic stability act into law which established a fiscal oversight board colloquially known as la junta tasked with overseeing the repayment of the island s debt la junta itself is largely a foreign body its members are chosen by the u s president and congress and are unaccountable to puerto rican residents many of the board members have ties to multinational corporations and have increased a push towards privatization on the island as a way to line the pockets of foreign creditors with leeway to make sweeping executive changes to the island s economy la junta has established an austerity regime in puerto rico systematically cutting funding for vital public services in order to pay the colonial piper the privatization of prepa is a prime example on june 22 2021 despite puerto rico s house of representatives voting unanimously against the contract la junta announced that luma would assume control of the formerly public electrical grid the announcement was met with sustained outcry from puerto ricans who were kept in the dark regarding contract negotiations luma an american and canadian owned utility company laid off hundreds of utier workers refusing to honor their contracts and agreeing only to interview workers should they decide to reapply as a stipulation any workers who were rehired would have to relinquish their pensions and other benefits many of the workers most of whom had years of experience as linemen on the grid declined these arrangements resulting in a dangerous labor shortage leading up to hurricane season to justify layoffs puerto rico s government argued that luma would modernize the island s electrical grid and make the cost of electricity more affordable for residents in reality prepa s privatization was a way to outsource service and boost profits even in the absence of storms like fiona outages in puerto rico have been frequent and long lasting since luma took over utility bills for individuals have also skyrocketed luma s response to the public outrage like that of governor pierluisi has been entirely dismissive in june for example the corporation held a press conference to address the constant blackouts reprehensibly they conducted it entirely in english refusing to provide translation services and effectively ostracizing over 75 percent of the island s population who do not speak english in a statement after the fact luma s ceo wayne stensby minimized the incident insisting that english is one of the island s official languages pierluisi and his cohort have come under scrutiny for colluding with colonizers like stensby prioritizing the interests of foreigner corporations over the lives of puerto ricans themselves notably in light of fiona a number of former prepa workers have volunteered their expertise to perform the grid repair work that would restore electric service to those who are still without it pierluisi has said he will consider their offer but has yet to accept their help meanwhile these skilled electrical workers continue to perform unrelated labor while blackouts drag on in the wake of hurricanes puerto ricans get pushed out while the logical humanitarian response to hurricanes should be rapid relief for the most vulnerable in puerto rico post hurricane vulnerability has been exploited for the benefit of the rich after maría two different visions for recovery emerged while puerto ricans imagined an island rebuilt around land energy and food sovereignty a small group of elite foreigners saw an opportunity to cash in on disaster of course the latter were abetted by puerto rican government officials like ex governor ricardo roselló who in 2018 described post maría puerto rico as a blank canvas for investors and private corporations this drive to draw in foreigners and push puerto ricans out is nothing new in 2012 puerto rico s government introduced act 22 legislation designed to attract foreign investors to the island by offering them tax exemptions on assets like stocks and real estate after the mass displacement caused by maria the government expanded these incentives with the introduction of act 60 in 2019 increased tax breaks coupled with record low prices on land and damaged property has ushered in a wave of capitalists looking to profit amidst a backdrop of instability and collective trauma the incentives enjoyed by the likes of influencer logan paul and crypto bro brock pierce do not apply to native puerto ricans and have only fueled gentrification on the island driving up housing costs pushing people out of their homes and deepening inequality between disenfranchised natives and wealthy outsiders while proponents of act 60 argue that it will infuse needed revenue into puerto rico s hurting economy the reality is that it makes it harder for working puerto ricans to afford to live in their own neighborhoods puerto ricans are organizing to fight back and help one another disaster colonialism has created a land rush in puerto rico now more than ever the threat of a puerto rico without puerto ricans is looming but crisis can be a catalyst for change and puerto ricans find themselves at a crossroads time and again puerto ricans have shown their commitment to fighting for a better future puerto ricans have engaged in mass demonstrations as one form of resistance for example in the 15 months since luma took over protests demanding cancellation of the contract have not let up perhaps most dramatically in 2019 leaked text messages sparked massive protests and strikes calling for the resignation of ricardo roselló after only three days of mobilization the puerto rican people successfully ousted him in what some called a people s impeachment roselló s removal led by militant unions and the organized working masses was an expression of puerto ricans exhaustion with the current system and of their collective power faced with government inaction after maría networks of community organizations began occupying vacant buildings across the island transforming them into hubs for relief and solidarity efforts cams which stands for centros de apoyo mutuo or mutual aid centers in english are community managed centers that serve a dual purpose meeting the urgent material needs of those affected by disasters like fiona and building up consciousness around the political reality of colonialism cams across the island have organized according to local needs and as such their areas of struggle vary from one neighborhood to the next cam jibaro in lares for example focuses on political and practical education around agroecology food sovereignty and traditional farming techniques another in bartolo rallied local residents to repossess and renovate an abandoned school providing shelter for families whose homes have been destroyed by hurricanes no matter their individual struggles all of the cams have a shared vision self sustenance and independence for puerto rico today fiona like maría has crystalized the need for total transformation in puerto rico luma pierluisi and botched relief efforts are all symptoms of a larger colonial disease that must be pulled up by the roots in the struggle for a just recovery puerto ricans need more than federal aid and isolated victories if hurricanes in puerto rico teach us anything it is that puerto rico needs socialism a system that would place its poor masses ahead of profits and wealthy colonial elites end centuries of imperial pillage and allow puerto ricans to determine their own destiny free from u s meddling

treasury minister chris philp said that a commitment by former chancellor rishi sunak to uprate benefits in line with inflation was under consideration after reports that different government departments have been asked to draw up plans for efficiency savings the move reported by the bbc and others would be aimed at reducing future government borrowing after the economic turmoil following the mini budget liz truss is expected to face public questioning about her economic plans for the first time following the fallout from the mini budget on thursday as the prime minister tours regional bbc radio stations in a morning round of interviews on wednesday the bank of england launched an emergency government bond buying programme to prevent borrowing costs from spiralling out of control and stave off a material risk to uk financial stability the bank announced it was stepping in to buy up to 65 billion worth of government bonds known as gilts at an urgent pace after fears over the government s economic policies sent the pound tumbling and sparked a sell off in the gilts market the bank of england launched an emergency government bond buying programme to prevent borrowing costs from spiralling out of control yui mok pa the market turmoil had forced pension funds to sell government bonds to head off worries over their solvency but this was threatening to see them suffer severe losses following the bank s intervention mr philp insisted there would be no consideration at all for a change of course by the government getting britain s economy growing is so important important to raise wages and important to pay the tax bills of the future he told sky news responding to reports that cabinet ministers would be asked to draw up efficiency savings for their departments mr philp told itv s peston we are going to look for efficiencies wherever we can find them chris philp said the government would not consider changing course on its plans after an intervention by the bank of england aaron chown pa he added the objective of the exercise would be to make sure the government stays within its existing three year spending limits those efficiency savings will firstly make sure we do stick to those spending limits mr philp said and secondly it will enable us within those spending limits which we are going to stick to to target things which are going to stimulate growth the minister defended the cut to the 45p rate of income tax which is set to have most benefit for high earners claiming it was only one twentieth of the fiscal firepower announced last friday but mr philp told itv that the treasury would not commit to an expected uprating of benefits in line with inflation pressed about the decision mr philp said i am not going to make policy commitments on live tv it is going to be considered in the normal way we will make a decision and it will be announced i am sure in the first instance to the house of commons liz truss is expected to face public questioning about her economic plans for the first time following the fallout from the mini budget toby melville pa mr philp was earlier joined by his junior ministerial colleague andrew griffith in defending the government s plans with neither the prime minister nor the chancellor anywhere to be seen or heard on the economy his cabinet colleague kemi badenoch described the situation as the elephant in the room during her first overseas visit as trade secretary but before i go into what we are doing it would be odd not to address the elephant in the room and the financial instability in markets over the last few days the former tory leadership candidate told us investors in new york you would by now have heard the bank of england taking short term measures to provide stability as is their job for decades we have been too focused on how we divide the pie and not enough on growing it the pm and chancellor are right to change that with their growth plan tax cuts for all energy support for people and business business investment unleashed kemi badenoch kemibadenoch september 23 2022 my colleagues including the chancellor continue to work very closely with our institutions to support them in their aims while maintaining their independence and we must look at all of this in the context of the fundamentals which are that the uk economy is strong and we have a plan a growth plan to cut taxes promote enterprise and cut red tape for business ms truss is likely to face close scrutiny on thursday morning however as she is due to tour bbc regional radio fielding questions from the british public as the markets open it all comes just days before tory mps and thousands of members will descend upon birmingham for ms truss first party conference as prime minister some of the party s big beasts including defeated leadership candidate mr sunak are reportedly not attending the conference other tories including treasury select committee chair mel stride have warned there s a lot of concern within the parliamentary party there s no doubt about that about the economic outlook mr stride also called for ministers to bring forward an independent analysis of their economic plans for the office for budget responsibility as soon as possible labour leader sir keir starmer meanwhile called on the government to recall parliament to deal with the escalating crisis before any more damage is done as his party s conference in liverpool came to an end sir keir said the move by the bank of england is very serious and i think many people will now be extremely worried about their mortgage about prices going up and now about their pensions the government has clearly lost control of the economy it was a message echoed by former tory justice secretary david gauke who said the government has caused a crisis but the pain is still to come the mp for south west hertfordshire from 2005 to 2019 told the bbc now we have what can only be described as a crisis and it is directly as a consequence of decisions made by the conservative government the pain is still to come in truth the pain of higher interest rates of tougher decisions on public spending is yet to be felt added the 50 year old who also previously served as secretary to the treasury

important to raise wages and important to pay the tax bills of the future he told sky news responding to reports that cabinet ministers would be asked to draw up efficiency savings for their departments mr philp told itv s peston we are going to look for efficiencies wherever we can find them chris philp said the government would not consider changing course on its plans after an intervention by the bank of england aaron chown pa he added the objective of the exercise would be to make sure the government stays within its existing three year spending limits those efficiency

colleague andrew griffith in defending the government s plans with neither the prime minister nor the chancellor anywhere to be seen or heard on the economy his cabinet colleague kemi badenoch

what can only be described as a crisis and it is directly as a consequence of decisions made by the conservative government the pain is still to come in truth the pain of higher interest rates of

by ron kampeas september 28 2022 washington jta a number of orthodox jewish groups are filing friend of the court briefs on behalf of an evangelical christian postal worker who is taking his case to get sundays off to the supreme court the case groff v dejoy seeks to expand the standard the supreme court set in a 1977 ruling regarding what constituted undue hardship to an employer in providing religious accommodation five years earlier congress had expanded the 1964 civil rights act to guarantee freedom from discrimination based on religion as long as employers would not face undue hardship but it did not define the term groff v dejoy involves a pennsylvania mailman who sought accommodations after the u s postal service in 2013 started sunday deliveries on behalf of amazon at first gerald groff was able to work around sunday deliveries but as demand for the service grew usps disciplined him for declining sunday shifts he quit and sued louis dejoy is the postmaster general forwarding the news thoughtful balanced reporting from the forward and around the web bringing you updated news and analysis of the crisis each day terms required i agree to the forward s terms of service and privacy policy email required lower courts have ruled in favor of the post office which is arguing that not being able to schedule a mail career to work sunday shifts represents an undue hardship groff last month appealed to the supreme court which has yet to say whether it will consider the case three conservative justices samuel alito clarence thomas and neil gorsuch have indicated an interest in revisiting the 1977 decision but the court requires four of its nine justices to agree to consider a case now the orthodox groups are joining a number of conservative religious groups filing amicus briefs this week in support of groff they see the case as a chance to overturn trans world airlines v hardison the 1977 decision that ruled for the airline over a member of a christian sect who sought saturdays off rejecting as undue hardships three possible accommodations posited by a lower court allowing the employee a four day work week paying other employees overtime to fill his shift or setting aside in certain instances a seniority system negotiated with the union that would have allowed the employee to leapfrog more senior employees in seeking saturdays off religious groups have since then been seeking opportunities to reconsider twa v hardison saying that by rejecting those three accommodations the supreme court rendered meaningless the 1972 expansion of the civil rights act the orthodox union joined the seventh day adventist church in one amicus brief the adventists mark sabbath on saturdays the jewish commission on law and public affairs which represents a number of orthodox groups including agudath israel of america spearheaded another amicus brief nathan lewin a seasoned supreme court lawyer representing the jewish commission in the groff case also represented the group in the 1977 case the jewish coalition for religious liberty a politically conservative nondenominational group joined the thomas more society a roman catholic legal advocacy group in another amicus brief the jewish commission in its brief said that the 1977 twa v hardison decision has curtailed careers closed avenues to success and damaged the lives of many individuals who are unwilling to compromise their faith the orthodox union seventh day adventist brief notes that minority faiths which do not mark the sabbath on sunday are likelier to face discrimination because society tends to accommodate sunday worship majority religious practices are accommodated by default while minority religious practices like observing the sabbath on saturday rather than on sunday are not the brief says and that is where hardison hurts employees the most this article originally appeared on jta org

one of the most powerful storms to ever hit the u s 16 years to the day that hurricane katrina hit the same part of the country dramatically overtook the news on sunday right there in the middle of it was jim cantore you know cantore he s the weather channel meteorologist with a cult like following for going literally into the storm there s a joke that really isn t funny if there s nasty weather out there the last person you want to see in your town is jim cantore and there he was on sunday wearing a baseball helmet not a hat a helmet and rain gear cantore stood on canal street in new orleans shouldering against a driving rain and winds gusts of over 80 mph toppled and mangled garbage dumpsters were strewn around him shouting into a microphone cantore tried to describe the devastating power of the category 4 hurricane he looked like he might get blown down the alley at any second there were few more haunting images than cantore standing on a pitch black street in downtown new orleans on sunday night as power was out everywhere around him in some ways you might look at cantore s coverage as a cliche and possibly even reckless and it s something that all hurricane reporters replicate we saw dozens of reporters doing it on sunday they stand out in the open as the rain and wind whip around them behind them the trees buckle stoplights sway and street signs rattle the scenes are meant to show the powerful impacts of the storm they can be effective but can also be distracting there are times when it feels gratuitous take for instance nbc news weather guy al roker who started sunday morning s meet the press with a live update from new orleans roker was standing in a spot where he was hit by waves crashing over a sea wall the camera showed that roker could easily have taken just a few steps to his left and would ve been clear of the waves but where s the drama in that eh i cannot provide any good excuse for standing so close to the coast that you let waves hit you my poynter colleague al tompkins told me tompkins is the smartest guy i know when it comes to broadcast journalism he has been a reporter photojournalist news producer and news director he now teaches multimedia storytelling for poynter so i asked him about some of the things we see during hurricane coverage those reporters who willingly put themselves in the elements is it all really necessary there is some value to the viewer to be able to see the intensity of a storm tompkins said it can serve as a proxy for viewers who might have evacuated and want an eyewitness account of what they left behind if you were locked in a shelter you would be anxious to know what was happening outside there also is another important fact tompkins tells me if the world can see what is happening then help is more likely to follow so what about sunday s coverage let s start here sunday s tv news coverage of hurricane ida was impressive like many of you i spent sunday afternoon flipping between cnn msnbc fox news and the weather channel to watch the powerful category 4 hurricane rip through louisiana scenes from the storm were horrifying and heartbreaking and all the cable news channels especially cnn and the weather channel offered superb coverage it sometimes can be hypnotic to see video of nature s frightening power later the networks abc cbs and nbc put their full available resources into reporting the storm abc s lead anchor david muir anchored a special edition of world news tonight cbs news and nbc news as well as abc news had correspondents all over louisiana including abc chief meteorologist ginger zee who was in new orleans this is a storm we re going to be talking about through the midweek zee said and unfortunately throughout history all networks and cable news stations had various reporters in various locations filing essentially the same reports stand outside get pummeled by a major hurricane scream into a microphone so as i mentioned it has become increasingly cliched but as a dangerous storm is passing over this is usually all reporters can do they can t really drive around to different locations because it is simply too dangerous they are limited in movement and that limits their reporting all they can do is pick a spot and tell viewers what is going on right where they are literally standing cnn s jason carroll at one point did a responsible thing he took viewers behind the curtain carroll was in houma louisiana and like all these reports stood out in the open and let the weather swirl around him but then he showed viewers a big building next to where he was standing and said that he had his camera person take shelter there when they weren t doing their reports it s this kind of transparency that is meant to discourage people from going out into the elements it shows that even though it appears he is in danger he really is safe when you string the on the scene reports together you do get a good sense of what the storm looks like and feels like and must be like for the unfortunate citizens who didn t or couldn t evacuate the storm is powerful and that s an important story to tell occasionally we get footage often shot by citizens which shows dramatic events like roofs being torn off buildings or water flooding a building but journalists also have to be careful with their own safety and with their credibility the silliest reporting is when a journalist wallows in the floodwaters for no reason except to appear to be the nitty gritty journalist who will do anything to get the story tompkins said instead it can look like the journalist doesn t have enough sense to come in out of the rain pro journalists especially pro photojournalists can t stand to be paired with showoff cowboys i also worry that grandstanding storm reporters become a cliche it becomes a joke it undermines the work that pros take seriously the best part of sunday s coverage was when the networks turned over their broadcasts to their meteorologists who showed where the storm was where it was heading what the wind was like what the rain was like where the storm surge was piling up as well as what we could expect in the next hour two hours six hours and so forth the weather channel s hurricane expert dr rick knabb was the day s most outstanding on air personality constantly updating viewers on what the storm was doing and what it was likely to do next he also gave strong warnings to those who might have been in the storm and were able to watch imploring viewers to not go out into the eye of the storm in the end it s all important even when the coverage sometimes features reporters who purposely go out into the dangerous elements especially a guy like cantore at one point and in another example of why it s important for cantore to be out in the streets he noticed that water wasn t draining down the sewers as quickly as it had been raising questions about possible flooding for the entire area god bless the journalists who are away from their families who are walking around for days in wet socks while snarky bystanders shout fake news at them tompkins said let me tell you that live coverage
