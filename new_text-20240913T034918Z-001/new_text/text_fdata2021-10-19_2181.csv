builder nahb nlbmda call on white house to address price volatility supply chain issues builders and dealers are both expressing concerns about rising lumber prices and continued supply chain bottlenecks while lumber prices have recovered from the record high levels of may 2021 volatility in prices remains a key concern among builders in its analysis of the most recent producer price index released by the u s bureau of labor statistics the nahb estimated lumber price volatility was at an all time high for a 12 month period amid concerns over volatility and continued supply chain disruptions the nahb submitted a letter to president biden urging the white house to take action the letter called for action to redouble efforts to address lumber price volatility to address supply chain bottlenecks for lumber and other building materials and to return to the negotiating table with canada and develop a new softwood lumber agreement the nahb submitted a similar letter to the white house in january amid a period of historic lumber price escalation that negatively impacted housing affordability as recently as july the nahb estimated rising material costs directly added nearly 30 000 to the average price of a new single family home while lumber prices have recovered the nahb said cash prices for lumber have increased more than 27 over the last month and news of mill curtailments are stoking fears of another massive price spike this fall and next spring the association also highlighted how supply chain issues are causing delays and keeping home prices about 20 higher than a year ago ali wolf chief economist at zonda said the supply side challenges are holding the market back from reaching its full potential the buyer demand pool is robust but builders are finding themselves in a difficult place where the cost of building a home is substantially more expensive than before the pandemic and forecasting the price of inputs going forward is nearly impossible wolf said wolf said zonda data shows that 70 of builders are intentionally slowing their sales to better match their inventory with production capacity lumber price volatility and supply chain disruptions are major concerns on the supply side with the national lumber and building material dealers association nlbmda also submitting a letter to the white house the association called on the white house to address ongoing labor shortages which the nlbmda believes pose a very real risk to the long term health of the lumber and building material dealer industry and its supply chain nlbmda urges administration to examine free market solutions and eliminate any unnecessary rules and regulations that are hindering the lumber supply chain and labor market the association wrote in its letter to president biden the nahb stated lumber price volatility and supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks likely will be compounded should the u s be unable to reach a new softwood lumber agreement with canada the impending november decision from the commerce department concluding its administrative review of tariffs on softwood lumber imports from canada will do nothing but exacerbate these issues the nahb wrote in its letter projections are that these tariffs could double again which is extremely troubling given constraints experienced in the lumber supply chain coupled with the extremely high lumber prices we have experienced this year echoing the nahb s concerns about housing affordability the nlbmda said tariffs on lumber imports are a tax on american consumers that will further aggravate the affordable housing crisis the nlbmda specifically called for the department of commerce to reverse its preliminary determination to increase countervailing duties and antidumping duties on canadian softwood lumber imports from 9 to 18 expressing concerns about how the duties would impact both dealers and american consumers the nlbmda which met with the department of commerce secretary gina raimondo in june requested a second meeting with the secretary to specifically discuss the impact of lumber price volatility on lumber and building material dealers time is the true fix as the port congestion clears and building material availability becomes easier wolf said until then support for companies in the thick of the supply chain are imperative recruitment efforts at factories ports and for trucking companies can help alleviate some of the pressure but investment in factories and curbing the spread of covid 19 are also needed

s p energy sector still lagging far behind its 2014 levels from the last time oil crossed 100 per barrel buffett has added new shares in red hot e p companies occidental petroleum corp and chevron inc warren buffett is winding down some of his investments in american banks favoring energy and technology companies instead for decades berkshire hathaway nyse brk b chairman and ceo warren buffett maintained a pretty conservative approach to investing favoring retail and banking stocks while giving a wide berth to more volatile sectors such as tech and energy in fact big american banks have been warren buffett s favorite investment because they are part of the infrastructure of the country a nation he continually bets on as recently as late 2019 berkshire had large stakes in four of the five biggest u s banks with wells fargo remaining buffett s top stock holding for three straight years through 2017 but buffett appears to have changed his investing ethos quite dramatically over the past couple of years taking new multi billion dollar stakes in energy and computer corporations while shunning the banking sector after the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020 buffett unloaded wells fargo nyse wfc jpmorgan nyse jpm and goldman sachs nyse gs on the cheap despite many stocks in the sector becoming significantly cheaper to own i like banks generally i just didn t like the proportion we had compared to the possible risk if we got the bad results that so far we haven t gotten buffett told investors at last year s shareholder meeting various analysts have shared their takes on buffett s banking divestments what this is telling you is he thinks we need to batten down the hatches because we re looking at a long cycle of inflation and probably stagnation banks are very cyclical and all indications are that we re in a high inflation high rate environment for a while what that typically means is that lending activity is going to be compressed and investment activity is going to be depressed phillip phan a professor at the johns hopkins carey business school has told cnbc despite rising interest rates this year which typically boost banks because lending margins improve the banking sector has been hammered wfc is down 14 0 ytd jpm has cratered 26 2 while gs has lost 22 7 on concerns that the u s economy could stall as the fed combats inflation with interest rate hikes buffett s energy investments buffett has been doubling down on his energy investments while trimming his banking holdings despite oil and gas stocks being at multi year high valuations to wit the legendary investor has added new shares in red hot e p companies occidental petroleum corp nyse oxy and chevron inc nyse cvx despite both currently trading at multi year highs according to berkshire s latest 13f filing the company bought 118 3m oxy shares in multiple transactions from march 12 to march 16 bringing its stake in oxy to 136 4m shares or 14 6 of its shares outstanding berkshire also owns oxy warrants granting the right to acquire some 83 9m additional common shares at about 59 62 each plus another 100 000 oxy preferred shares earlier berkshire revealed that it purchased about 9 4 million shares of oil titan chevron in the fourth quarter boosting its stake to 38 million shares currently worth 6 2 billion oxy has more than doubled over the past 12 months while cvx is up 50 with both stocks trading near multi year highs but obviously buffet thinks they still have plenty of upside judging by the huge positions opened by his investment conglomerate buffett is hardly alone related how 3d printers could transform the energy industry oxy ceo vicki hollub has snapped up oxy shares in the open market even as shares trade near three year highs according to an sec filing hollub paid 798k on march 28 for 14 191 oxy shares at an average price of 56 24 raising her holdings to 467 282 shares and an additional 23 390 shares through a savings plan hollub last bought oxy shares on the open market nearly three years ago when she paid 1 8m for 37 460 shares at an average 48 15 share on june 10 2019 wall street is enthralled by oxy too raymond james analyst john freeman recently raised his oxy price target to 85 from 60 setting a new wall street high that s good for nearly 50 upside oxy has 9 strong buy ratings 2 buy 13 hold 1 sell and 1 string sell ratings on wall street meanwhile shale player apa corp nyse apa has popped to a 52 week high after mizuho upgraded shares to buy from neutral with a 56 price target up from 38 saying

longer term development suriname catalysts outside the u s energy is the only sector that is seeing quality growth and momentum scores improve simultaneously while maintaining an attractive value and income profile jpmorgan s dubravko lakos bujas has told business insider adding that current estimates are conservative and understate the strong macro fundamentals going forward according to jpm the energy sector still has considerable upside despite its massive runup over the past year jpm says that a combination of rapid earnings growth and re ratings for key multiples will help drive further

the store shelves might still be full of halloween candy but retailers are nudging shoppers to start thinking about the holidays rolling out a variety of offers and incentives to encourage people to sign up for subscription services to score sought after gifts walmart announced monday that members of its walmart subscription service will get a four hour head start to start snapping up black friday deals and amazon is promoting its prime early access feature which lets prime members buy lightning deals half an hour before everyone else gets a crack at them at 99 a year or about 13 a month if purchased monthly the walmart subscription price slightly undercuts the annual 119 price for amazon prime membership best buy is employing a similar tactic it rolled out a 200 membership program last month that it calls totaltech while the price tag includes tech support installation and other perks retail analysts said it s likely that a large number of new members will be motivated by the prospect of being able to score hard to find items like sony s ps5 gaming console people are ordering earlier and ordering more a survey conducted this month by the market research firm piplsay found that about one quarter of u s consumers have already started their holiday shopping supply and cost related concerns seem to be the primary motivations among those already shopping 23 percent said they were trying to score early deals 21 percent wanted to make sure their purchases arrived on time and 17 percent were worried that discounts or the products themselves would become scarce later in the season loyalty programs that charge membership or subscription fees and promise early access to hot gift items like gaming consoles would seem like win wins boosting the bottom lines of big brands while letting customers essentially pay to jump the queue and score black friday deals retail behemoths also will get an infusion of granular data that will let them see into the behaviors and spending patterns of their most loyal customers as well as more opportunities to promote their offerings essentially the loyalty program is a sales boosting model nearly as old as retail itself said margaret kidd the director of the supply chain and logistics technology program at the university of houston this is an old fashioned method to gain loyalty to your customers and get them to engage and stay with your brand she said retailers do buy merchandise that they pull aside to provide access to their loyalty customers according to forrester research close to 90 percent of people who shop online belong to at least one loyalty program in a report in june forrester said perks and exclusive access can foster repeat purchase loyalty better than just slates of discounts the 21st century enhancement of course is the access to reams of digital data that the programs can capture about how people shop all of which can be filtered through increasingly sophisticated target marketing programs theoretically if there are popular items that are in short supply this holiday that gives that shopper who s a member of that program a leg up said rachel dalton the director of e commerce and omnichannel insights at kantar consulting dalton said the benefit for retailers who can persuade shoppers to become loyalty program members is twofold from an online perspective they re tracking where you go and what you look at she said which means more and hopefully more accurate ad targeting and product suggestions over time in the longer term if shoppers are happy with the loyalty program they ll shop more at that retailer but the strategy isn t without risk retail consultants say that if brands fail to deliver or fail to manage consumer expectations during a season when supply chain bottlenecks have the potential to create a crisis for retailers angry customers can migrate away with a click or a swipe i think you re going to have some happy customers and others who will be disappointed from the retailer s perspective it is a great opportunity to deliver on something exclusive as long as they re communicating clearly and being transparent that it s not a guarantee dalton said mike webster a senior vice president and the general manager of oracle retail said i think the consumer will absolutely have high expectations of execution on any pay to play model a single bad experience will lead them to being more open to switching brands or buying a substitute item consumers have very high expectations kidd said the evolution of the retail landscape means stores have to find new revenue streams to make up for last minute and impulse purchases i think as we have pivoted from traditional brick and mortar stores and there s declining foot traffic these kinds of strategies help the bottom line for retailers trying to make up the difference she said the surge in e commerce triggered by the pandemic has only accelerated those trends kidd said the stores are packed the problem is there s shortages in certain items like electronics she said webster said shoppers are worried about paying higher prices if they can find the products they want at all gift givers this year are at a new peak of anxiety he said this could be the supply chain that stole christmas shoppers are already adopting new habits webster said people are ordering earlier and ordering more he said with the expectation that at least some of their attempts either would be canceled because items have gone out of stock or the items wouldn t arrive in time that s a really interesting consumer behavior we haven t seen before for shoppers hoping to score popular gifts the two options seem to be spend more money to access the sales or spend more time trying to track down popular products kimberly haire a mother of two who lives outside fort wayne indiana said her address is outside the delivery zone for walmart so she plans to do a lot more shopping around this year we are big on the educational stem toys she said by social media i m not sure how quick these types of items would go out of stock but i ve already started looking at deals haire who is expecting her third child in january said she is steeling herself for understaffed stores and empty shelves this holiday season i m sure across the board some stores will have things i need and others won t she said i feel as if the shelves are already showing signs of not being able to compensate the people this holiday season and the more popular items will sell quickly and more than likely won t be restocked in time for christmas without it being limited in quantities she said
municipals were a touch weaker 10 years and in on thin trading while u s treasuries pared back earlier losses the curve flattening continued triple a benchmarks saw one basis point cuts in spots inside 10 years while the five year u s treasury hit a high of 1 154 and the 30 year pared back earlier losses to land at 2 018 in the primary monday the north texas municipal water district aa1 aaa sold 201 835 million of water system revenue refunding bonds to morgan stanley co llc bonds in 9 2022 with a 4 coupon yield 0 14 5s of 2026 at 0 58 4s of 2031 at 1 36 and 3s of 2032 at 1 55 callable sept 1 2030 the tone of the market is apprehensive due to interest rates trending higher and fund flows weakening somewhat michael pietronico chief executive officer at miller tabak asset management said pietronico noted his firm believes the one to three year area of the municipal yield curve will be the best performer in the coming weeks as supply moves higher and the federal reserve begins to taper its bond purchases overall inflows have slowed down significantly but are still positive with high yield seeing some outflows roberto roffo managing director and portfolio manager at swbc investment company added most likely investors are seeing their statements from last quarter and pulling back a little he said with ratios backing up significantly from historic lows and spreads widening slightly there is a good opportunity for investors to restructure portfolios more advantageously according to roffo ratios were held to near friday s levels with the 10 year municipal to ust ratio at 74 and the 30 year at 83 according to refinitiv mmd ice data services had the 10 year at 73 and the 30 at 84 even with the decrease in inflows there is still significant cash on the sidelines to purchase new issues that present value he said this has been proven week as large deals priced cheaper than they would have been a couple of months ago were well subscribed for with little or any balances left over what taper does to aaa curves historically once the fed begins tapering or hiking overnight rates muni aaa curves like treasury curves would embark on a relentless flattening bofa securities strategists said in a friday report in the 2013 2014 tapering cycle the 1 30 year muni aaa slope flattened 32 from 408 basis points to 275 basis points a report from bofa s yingchen lin and ian rogow by january 2015 another 10 flattening was harvested indeed the curve flattening continued all the way to september 2019 when the 1 30 year aaa slope hit 75 basis points a total of 82 flattening what stopped the curve flattening in september 2019 it was the new fed qe purchases that month in the upcoming cycle although the fed indicated that tapering does not lead to a rate hike the fed s dots plot indicates that a rate hike may begin in 2023 the report said as such we would expect the muni aaa curve to embark on a long flattening process if we use the last cycle as a guide by mid 2022 the expected completion time of tapering the 1 30 year muni slope should flatten from its current 156 basis points to about 100 basis points the level we saw right before the covid 19 crisis if the fed carries out another rate hike program as shown in its dots plot and the 1 30 slope flattens 82 from its current slope it would mean a 1 30 aaa slope as low as 29 basis points eventually is it possible we certainly cannot rule it out they said the previous record low slope of 40 basis points was set in march 2007 when the curve bear flattened muni cusip requests fall monthly municipal volume decreased in september the third consecutive monthly decline in muni cusip request volume following seven straight months of increases according to cusip global services the aggregate total of all municipal securities including municipal bonds long term and short term notes and commercial paper fell 6 6 versus august totals on an annualized basis municipal cusip identifier request volumes were down 1 3 through september for muni bonds specifically there was a 9 9 decrease in request volumes month over month but they are up 3 1 on a year over year basis the three month decline in municipal identifier request volume is definitely a trend to watch said gerard faulkner direct of operations for cusip global services municipal issuers were tapping the debt markets at a strong pace for much of 2020 and the first part of 2021 but that pace has now fallen off considerably cusip identifier requests for the broad category of u s and canadian corporate equity and debt climbed 3 3 versus august totals the increase was driven largely by an increase in requests for domestic corporate debt identifiers on a year over year basis corporate cusip request volume

said john gentry senior portfolio manager at federated hermes consistent strong growth and growing inflation expectations would be required to push longer yields appreciably higher the 10 year treasury yield has risen above 1 5 from its lows of 0 5 in july 2020 wells fargo investment institute strategists michelle wan and doug beath suggest the current rising yield environment represents investor confidence in future economic growth and higher inflation expectations sustaining a positive correlation between the 10 year treasury yield and s p 500 index but wan and beath said they don t expect the rise to be a straight line they see consolidation and even pullbacks resulting from political and economic events while investors have been keyed on growth expectations more than inflation concerns that could be changing they said even so over the longer term we believe that bonds will continue to offer diversification benefits and should be held at allocations that are aligned with risk tolerance in data released monday industrial production declined 1 3 in september after a downwardly revised 0 1 dip in august while capacity utilization fell to 75 2 from 76 2 economists polled by ifr markets expected production to rise 0 2 and capacity use at 76 5 the decline reflects production bottlenecks as manufacturers fall further behind healthy gains in product demand said berenberg chief economist for the u s americas and asia mickey levy the drop sets industrial production back below its pre pandemic level he said underlining the various problems facing an array of manufacturing sectors motor vehicle and energy were two sectors showing big drops in production part of the drop can be attributed to weather said wells fargo securities senior economist tim quinlan and economist shannon seery while hurricane ida is partially to blame accounting for nearly half of the decline we cannot chalk up all of the weakness to its harsh effects they said severe supply constraints are limiting the pace of production and are showing little sign of meaningful improvement supply issues persist with little indication of easing they said additionally high prices and labor shortages are impacting manufacturers supply chain disruptions will continue to deplete inventories said kc mathews chief investment officer at umb bank this may impact consumption consumers that are willing and able to spend can t if items are not on the shelf and while this will remain an issue for gdp this year he said the issue is clearly transitory as bottlenecks are resolved and inventories restored spending will resume in the near future also released monday the national association of home builders housing market index jumped to 80 in october from 76 in september economists

shares of a fund itself are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors such as general economic conditions political events regulatory or market developments changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result of the risk of loss associated with these market fluctuations in addition local regional or global events such as war acts of terrorism spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues recessions or other events could have a significant negative impact on a fund and its investments such events may affect certain geographic regions countries sectors and industries more significantly than others the outbreak of the respiratory disease designated as covid 19 in december 2019 has caused significant volatility and declines in global financial markets which have caused losses for investors while the development of vaccines has slowed the spread of the virus and allowed for the resumption of reasonably normal business activity in the united states many countries continue to impose lockdown measures in an attempt to slow the spread additionally there is no gurantee that vaccines will be effective against emerging variants of the disease the debt securities in which the fund invests are subject to certain risks including issuer risk reinvestment risk prepayment risk credit risk interest rate risk and liquidity risk issuer risk is the risk that the value of fixed income securities may decline for a number of reasons which directly relate to the issuer reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the fund s portfolio will decline if the fund invests the proceeds from matured traded or called bonds at market interest rates that are below the fund portfolio s current earnings rate prepayment risk is the risk that upon a prepayment the actual outstanding debt on which the fund derives interest income will be reduced credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest and or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result interest rate risk is the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates liquidity risk is the risk that illiquid and restricted securities may be difficult to value and to dispose of at a fair price at the times when the fund believes it is desirable to do so a mortgage backed security may be negatively affected by the quality of the mortgages underlying such security and the structure of its issuer for example if a mortgage underlying a particular mortgage backed security defaults the value of that security may decrease moreover a downturn in the markets for residential or commercial real estate or a general economic downturn could negatively affect both the price and liquidity of privately issued mortgage backed securities a portion of the fund s managed assets may be invested in subordinated classes of mortgage backed securities such subordinated classes are subject to a greater degree of non payment risk than are senior classes of the same issuer or agency to the extent a fund invests in floating or variable rate obligations that use the london interbank offered rate libor as a reference interest rate it is subject to libor risk the united kingdom s financial conduct authority which regulates libor will cease making libor available as a reference rate over a phase out period that will begin immediately after december 31 2021 the unavailability or replacement of libor may affect the value liquidity or return on certain fund investments and may result in costs incurred in connection with closing out positions and entering into new trades any potential effects of the transition away from libor on the fund or on certain instruments in which the fund invests can be difficult to ascertain and they may vary depending on a variety of factors and they could result in losses to the fund investments in asset backed or mortgage backed securities offered by non governmental issuers such as commercial banks savings and loans private mortgage insurance companies mortgage bankers and other secondary market issuers are subject to additional risks the primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts are a the imperfect correlation between the change in market value of the instruments or indices underlying the futures contracts and the price of the futures contracts b possible lack of a liquid secondary market for a futures contract and the resulting inability to close a futures contract when desired c losses caused by unanticipated market movements which are potentially unlimited d the investment adviser s inability to predict correctly the direction of securities prices interest rates currency exchange rates and other economic factors and e the possibility that the counterparty will default in the performance of its obligations if a security sold short increases in price the fund may have to cover its short position at a higher price than the short sale price resulting in a loss repurchase agreements are subject to the risk of failure if the fund s counterparty defaults on its obligations and the fund is delayed or prevented from recovering the collateral or if the value of

the almost moon by alice sebold 291 pages little brown company i first read alice sebold when i took on the lovely bones she then had me reading more of her works there are very few contemporary writers who have that kind of power over writers now out with her next the almost moon sebold tells the after tale of a daughter killing her mother captured in the memoir style reminiscent of lucky the novel is immersed in a beautiful narrative that brings a lot more than a good story to the table as with her other works the novel s title is revealed in the story the protagonist helen knightly s father once told her the moon is whole all the time but we can t always see it what we see is an almost moon or a not quite moon we plan our lives based on its rhythms and tides later in the novel helen says the idea that my mother was eternal like the moon dead or alive a mother or the lack of a mother shaped one s whole life the novel begins with the spine chilling narration of the protagonist when all is said and done killing my mother came easily this then transcends to even more violence among a family of some likeable some non likeable characters helen works as a model for an art class the violence reverberates in the ghastly suicide of the helen s father the implication of her mother dropping her grandson on his head and the hit and run death of a boy the best part about the novel is that it surprises you the protagonist is not devastated guilty or remorseful over her mother s death the novel is not about her journey in finding closure yet she is not indifferent and cold either helen first suffocates her mother then breaks her nose yet she finds some universality in this she tells us thought of the uncared for bodies that lay strewn in the streets and fields of rwanda or afghanistan i thought of the thousands of sons and daughters who would like to be in the position i was in to have known exactly when their mothers died and then to be alone with their bodies before the world rushed in helen s mother was a wreck a mentally ill divorcee with colon and breast cancer but the apple doesn t fall far from the tree and no matter what helen can t escape her mother s messed life she fails as a wife and as a friend when she sleeps with her best friend s son right after killing her mother overall the novel will not make a lot of sense in fact sebold s works have gotten progressively incoherent maybe she was going for a modernist edge but what you will appreciate is the emotional and moral struggles through helen s eyes the novel will inevitably gain popularity because of its shocking content just look at the popularity of shows such as law and order svu and csi which draw us as they disgust but the real reason why this is a good read is because of sebold does best narrate her voice manages to touch you whether or not you relate to any character in the book and it is this ability that separates her from the thrillers that line up hot dog stands

toronto canada s main stock market moved further into record territory monday despite a relatively quiet day marked by a pullback in the key energy sector there was little conviction overall in equity markets to start the trading week even as investors are focused on earnings season which has started very strongly said craig fehr investment strategist edward jones while that led to a positive week last week we re seeing some consolidation today but i would say broadly it s a positive trend when we re going to see equities pivot their sights toward corporate profits because that continues to be probably the brightest element of the fundamental backdrop at the moment he said in an interview fehr said there s a lot more occurring beneath the surface with a rebound in communications and technology that favours the s p 500 and nasdaq over the dow the tsx has been on a roll he said pointing to the heavyweight financials services sector that has benefited from the prospects of higher rates and faster loan growth but at the same time obviously the tear that oil has been on has benefited energy stocks and so that s where we ve seen some divergences between the canadian stock market and the u s market the s p tsx composite index closed up 57 27 points to a high of the day at 20 985 37 in new york the dow jones industrial average was down 36 15 points at 35 258 61 the s p 500 index was up 15 09 points at 4 486 46 while the nasdaq composite was up 124 47 points at 15 021 81 technology and industrials led while energy and health care were the biggest laggards on the day technology rose 1 1 per cent with shares of shopify inc increasing 2 9 per cent industrials increased 0 7 per cent with tfi international inc and wsp global inc each up about 1 9 per cent energy lost 1 2 per cent on a dip in crude oil prices and a big loss in natural gas prices fehr said the sector s performance monday reflected investors catching their breath after a spectacular run so far in 2021 in which crude oil has surged 68 per cent to see them take a breather today is not particularly surprising given the run they ve been on crude s strong movement reflects the outlook for robust demand and the challenges of meeting that with adequate supplies the december crude contract was down four cents at us 81 69 per barrel and the november natural gas contract was down 42 1 cents at us 4 99 per mmbtu shares of birchcliff energy ltd were down 3 2 per cent followed by tourmaline oil corp and meg energy corp at 2 9 and 2 6 per cent respectively the canadian dollar traded for 80 78 us unchanged from friday materials was also lower on a dip in metals prices as new gold inc fell 4 1 per cent the december gold contract was down us 2 60 at us 1 765 70 an ounce and the december copper contract was down four tenths of a cent at nearly us 4 73 a pound the backdrop to monday s stock market results was a slowing of the chinese economy gross domestic product grew 4 9 per cent in the july to september period from a year earlier that was the weakest growth since the third quarter of 2020 while disappointing the trend isn t surprising given that world s second largest economy is becoming more consumption based and less investment focused said fehr the growth rate will likely outpace developed markets but be slower than investors have come to expect over the last 20 to 30 years fehr said the bigger question for markets is whether chinese policy makers will come to the rescue as they have done in the last two to three decades we will probably see a little bit more from the people s bank of china on the monetary side but i think broadly this is a reflection of the fact that stimulus isn t coming immediately to the rescue as has been the case in prior years this report by the canadian press was first published oct 18 2021 companies in this story tsx bir tsx tou tsx meg tsx shop tsx tfii tsx wsp tsx ngd tsx gsptse tsx cadusd x ross marowits the canadian press
four candidates are seeking the district 5 seat on spartanburg city council currently held by jerome rice who is running for mayor sevi alvarez years in spartanburg 2 5 age 38 occupation former accountant current stay at home dad office sought city council district 5 top issues facing the people you will represent the coronavirus pandemic is on top of everyone s mind right now i support mask wearing including by the vaccinated and i encourage everyone to get the vaccine if you haven t already i agree with the measures that the city has already taken and will continue to support mask wearing by city employees and implementing virtual solutions when possible i d like to work with the county and ensure that our schools are getting the support that they need to make things as safe as possible for students teachers and staff beyond that the growth of spartanburg and what it will mean for the residents of district 5 is something that we need to deal with as a city i want to make sure that the most vulnerable of our citizens don t get left behind and that we use our growth to lift them up rather than push them out i think the recently released comprehensive plan is a great blueprint to draw from and that its focus on equity is important to keep at the top of mind in everything we do mayor race cathy mccabe and jerome rice compete to replace junie white district 4 ceej jefferson challenges incumbent jamie fulmer for district 4 seat district 6 erica brown runs unopposed for district 6 seat what are your plans if elected if i m elected i plan to focus primarily on two issues that i hear about over and over when talking to my constituents first i want to see our public transportation system expanded and improved we paid for a study on this exact topic two years ago and i d like to see the plan finally implemented i ll fight for seven day bus service buses that run until at least midnight every day and an expanded number of routes i believe that a mobile population is one that is better suited to adapt to the changes that are bound to come to spartanburg as it continues to grow and to that end i will fight hard to get at least some of the funds from the american rescue plan applied toward enacting those goals second i want to get developers to build more grocery stores nearly all of district 5 meets the definition of a food desert and that s unacceptable to me i hope to leverage councilwoman littlejohn s experience in attracting developers as well as the looming renaissance we re about to see in the highland area to attract at least one developer to open up a grocery store ideally somewhere along reidville road why should residents vote for you first my background as a professional accountant makes it easier for me than most to read and interpret a budget my master s degree in accounting demonstrates my work ethic and i hope shows that i will do whatever it takes to lift up the people of spartanburg i m also a stay at home parent and therefore consider myself an expert at multitasking arranging schedules making plans and adjusting those plans on the fly when it becomes necessary my job affords me the flexibility to be there for the people of spartanburg when they need me i plan to have regular office hours two or three times per week as logistics allow when any of my constituents will be able to come and talk to me so long as they don t mind my baby being in the room with us i also intend to hold multiple town hall meetings in my district throughout each year i ll make time for my constituents finally having grown up in charlotte i saw firsthand what happens when a city starts growing very quickly and there is no one around to advocate for the vulnerable i believe that this gives me a unique perspective that

light of september quarter inflation data out of new zealand the headline kiwi cpi rose 2 2 quarter on quarter to the fastest pace in a decade up from 1 3 in june annual inflation jumped to 4 9 from 3 3 well exceeding the rbnz s forecast of 4 2 bear in mind the rbnz has already implemented one rate rise the main drivers were housing related costs followed by vegetables transport and fuel auckland has been in lockdown since august within half an hour the asx200 was down 7 points until someone noticed aussie bond yields were on the move this stirred the banks into action at midday the index was up 30 points and then came data out of china china s gdp growth slowed to 4 9 year on year in the september quarter down from 7 9 in june and missing 5 2 forecasts not a huge surprise really given chinese industrial production rose only 3 1 in the month of september year on year when 4 5 was forecast on the back of power shortages and beijing s clampdown on industry fixed asset investment gained 7 3 year to date down from 7 9 in august as credit availability tightened in light of evergrande the only bright spot were retail sales up 4 4 year on year when 3 3 was expected the asx200 ultimately gave up gains towards the close but the key move on the day was in bonds with the aussie ten year yield leaping 11 basis points to 1 75 the five year rose 17bps the two year rose only 3bps but this is where the rba is in buying it was always going to be a good day for the materials sector on commodity price moves and implications of slower chinese growth notwithstanding materials won the day with a 1 0 gain while energy rose 0 8 resources are not victims of inflation they are perpetrators higher bond yields expand bank margins and financials rose 0 9 yield payers for the most part went the other way property lost 1 1 and telcos 0 2 while healthcare fell 1 0 and technology impacted by higher yields fell 1 2 quite the mixed bag on the day the index top five losers board was also a mixed bag while the winner s board was rocks all the way coming back to the elephant in the room the bank of england governor said last night the bank would have to act to curb inflation the uk market now expects a rate hike as early as next month and the uk two year yield last night jumped to 0 75 from 0 57 on friday the rba is still hanging on to 2024 she ll be right buddy us equity futures were heading south overnight on china and the boe and it s rare to hear new zealand mentioned by wall street commentators if it s not to do with hobbits but when the market proper opened such influences were largely dismissed the us two year yield did rise by two basis points and the ten year by one so no sign of panic the us yield curve nevertheless continues to gradually flatten with the market pricing in the first fed rate rise in 2022 while slowing chinese growth and uk european inflation provide some cause for concern the us economy is largely insulated european gas prices have now risen almost five fold but while the us gas price has also surged henry hub is a closed shop domestic only market and the us is gas self sufficient and no us bank is on the hook for evergrande which leaves the us to focus on its consumer based economy following on from surprisingly solid retail sales numbers on friday last night shares in department store dinosaur macy s jumped 17 it wasn t an

new york ap â the u s stock market certainly shook when hundreds of thousands of regular people suddenly piled into gamestop early this year driving its price to heights that shocked professional investors but it didn t break that s one of the takeaways from a report by the securities and exchange commission s staff released monday about january s â meme stockâ mania as gamestop s stock shot from 39 to 347 in just a week some of the stock market s plumbing began creaking but the report indicated the market s basic systems and operations remained sound the surge for gamestop and other downtrodden stocks also laid bare how much power is being wielded by a new generation of smaller pocketed and novice investors armed with apps on their phones that make trading fun â the extreme volatility in meme stocks in january 2021 tested the capacity and resiliency of our securities markets in a way that few could have anticipated â the report said â at the same time the trading in meme stocks during this time highlighted an important feature of united states securities markets in the 21st century broad participation â many of the points in the report were already known such as how the extremely heavy bets made by some hedge funds against gamestop s stock actually helped accelerate its extreme ascent though they weren t the main driver the report also didn t make any recommendations for changes to how the market is structured but it pointed to several areas for further consideration they include topics that sec chair gary gensler has already cited in recent speeches such as whether the way some brokerages make their money encourages them to push customers to trade more often than they should the report also indicated the sec could further scrutinize events that may cause a brokerage to restrict trading in a stock during the height of the frenzy several brokerages barred customers from buying gamestop after the clearinghouse that settles their trades demanded more cash to cover the increased risk created by its highly volatile price that left many investors incensed the report also raised questions about whether investors are getting the best execution on their trades when so many are getting routed to big trading firms instead of to exchanges like the nasdaq or the new york stock exchange and perhaps in a disappointment to some of the investors who piled into gamestop to punish the financial elite the sec s staff said it doesn t believe hedge funds were broadly affected by investments in gamestop and other meme stocks during the run up of gamestop s price many people were bellowing on reddit and other social media platforms that this was their chance to stick it to the hedge funds they took aim at funds that had bet gamestop a struggling video game retailer would see its price continue to fall those hedge funds did that by â shortingâ the stock in such a trade a short seller borrows a share sells it and then hopes to buy it back later at a lower price to pocket the difference some of those short sellers were indeed burned and when they bought gamestop shares to get out of their suddenly soured bets the buying helped push the stock up even further but other hedge funds that had earlier bet on gains for gamestop s stock made profits as did others who jumped into the upsurge hedge funds as a group have been making money this year including a 1 2 return in january during the throes of the meme mania according to the hfri fund weighted composite index the sec s staff nevertheless said that improved reporting of short sales is another area worthy of further study particularly if it will help regulators better track the market copyright 2021 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed without permission
ever since the coronavirus pandemic began and the subsequent shutdown of live theater in march 2021 new york s irish repertory theatre has been at the forefront of keeping the art alive the company produced a series of plays on zoom that made creative use of the medium largely due to the video talents of sarah nichols foremost among them are conor mcpherson s the weir eugene o neill s a touch of the poet and the musical meet me in st louis with their computer generated effects and brian friel s molly sweeney a play that was seemingly written for zoom featuring three characters in three different settings now 19 months later the north american premiere of the 2017 play autumn royal by kevin barry which stars maeve higgins and john keating marks irish rep s return to live theater irish rep or any theater might be forgiven for taking the safe route after the pandemic producing a light comedy or scaled down musical but autumn royal is safe only its use of two characters the subject matter and barry s take on it make for a dark but very very funny evening set in the city of cork ireland autumn royal is the story of siblings may and timothy whose father is ill it s unclear how long he will even last it could be a week or a year or god forbid decades what s worse is that he lives with them they re not young and not eager to put their lives on hold any longer to top things off this is a family with issues volumes of them they stew they fret they argue and maybe worst of all they remember they consider a range of possibilities just this side and that side of murder and even when a solution seems at hand like placing the father into the titular assisted living facility which for some reason is named after a variety of grape things get bollocksed up it is a scary moment and yet it gets some of the play s biggest laughs this is an irish comedy after all so any shot of comedy is served with a chaser of bile and vice versa autumn royal like a lot of irish plays has echoes of anton chekhov lost characters and an undercurrent of sadness tim looks for an escape from this life a move to australia where he can start things over and yet one knows that he is a perpetually lost soul and australia will remain just a dream for may and tim there is no place like home that sentence for them seems like a lifetime sentence under the tight direction of ciarán o reilly autumn royal runs at a swift pace clocking in at 70 minutes and the pace serves the play well higgins a comedian and a regular panelist on npr s news quiz show wait wait don t tell me is much different from her radio appearances does one appear on radio regardless here her comic delivery is blunt but her timing is razor sharp the audience often laughs at her most horrifying lines keating is practically a member of irish rep s stock company if an actual company were to exist he has appeared in more than a dozen shows at irish rep in a variety of roles here he is front and center with higgins and the two seem to have a natural chemistry even if that chemistry could become combustible at any moment this is all the more surprising given that this is higgins north american stage debut comedians don t always perform well in personae other than those of their own creation but with only a couple of stage appearances to her credit higgins takes to the stage and may s character with unusual ease with autumn royal irish rep makes us happy for what we have been missing and sad for what we have missed this is a rich little play that is well worth a trip to the theater of course there are vaccination and mask protocols proof of vaccination and photo id are required inside the theater masks are required but getting into the theater and settled was no more difficult than before the pandemic also there are no paper programs but one can download one to your smartphone from a qr code posted inside it s worth it if only for the glossary of irish terms that may be unfamiliar to an american audience autumn royal runs through november 21 at the irish repertory theatre 132 west 22nd street new york for tickets and more information go to irishrep org john keating and maeve higgins star in autumn royal new york s irish repertory theater s return to live theater john keating and maeve higgins star in autumn royal new york s irish repertory theater s return to live theater carol rosegg

investors should be on the lookout for companies benefiting from america s robust infrastructure and housing markets the infrastructure in america our roads bridges wastewater systems and public buildings is in a never ending need of repair the american society of civil engineers has graded the country s infrastructure as being mediocre for many years and politicians are once again discussing a potential spending bill to address this investors don t have to depend on these developments though to benefit from investing in infrastructure stocks here are three companies that have leadership positions in their fields and benefit from some big picture growth trends if congress does pass an infrastructure bill they will benefit as well putting investors in a potential win win scenario let s dive in 1 caterpillar everyone is familiar with the famous yellow bulldozers and dump trucks you drive past at construction sites caterpillar cat 0 02 is one of the world s leading construction vehicle and equipment manufacturers the company would be a prominent benefactor from a surge in infrastructure spending rebuilding roads bridges and buildings all require a lot of dirt and rock to be moved which means increased demand for caterpillar s products industrial companies like caterpillar are cyclical meaning they do well during strong economic environments and suffer during recessions when customers pull back their spending making industrial companies potentially volatile investments however caterpillar pays a dividend and has increased it over the past 28 years proving its consistency for investors and making it a dividend aristocrat caterpillar s ability to navigate its business cycles and continually increase its cash outlay to investors is a testament to management s strong ability to steer the company through good times and bad this is a big deal for investors when looking at long term holding periods such as a decade and beyond the company s backlog of orders grew 5 5 billion in its most recent quarter the second quarter of 2021 investors will want to monitor how the backlog performs moving forward it can indicate upcoming revenue growth because caterpillar s products take time to make and deliver 2 chargepoint holdings as electric vehicles become increasingly mainstream there is a complementary need for charging stations just think about how many gas stations there are in your local neighborhood they are practically at every block someday we could be at this point with charging stations chargepoint holdings chpt 0 60 is north america s leading manufacturer of ev charging stations with more than 70 market share seven times its closest competitor there is still a significant need for charging stations even in california where evs are the most common there are less than 40 of the charging stations needed to meet its 2025 goals president biden s infrastructure plan includes 7 5 billion for investment in charging stations over five years at least a chunk of that could trickle through to chargepoint considering its status as the market leader building a national level network for ev charging could cost as much as 50 billion so as evs continue to see increased adoption it might incentivize lawmakers to continue increasing investments in charging stations 3 sherwin williams paints and coatings go on just about every wall floor ceiling and general surface to protect and maintain them sherwin willams shw 0 39 is the leading manufacturer of these paints and coatings selling its products through retail channels and its name brand stores all over the world sherwin williams is most famous for its paint but it sells coatings such as protectants powder coats tank liners water sealants and more whether it s coating under a bridge to protect against rust or painting classrooms in a remodeled public building sherwin williams touches just about every corner of infrastructure and would likely benefit from such investments it also has the benefit of exposure to a north american housing market that has been and could remain strong for years to come the ceo of taylor morrison one of america s largest homebuilders expects there to be a housing shortage for years because of low inventory levels since the pandemic began new houses being built and homeowners remodeling to potentially sell in a hot market are both potential boosts for sherwin williams similar to caterpillar sherwin williams can be sensitive to the ups and downs of the economy the company has also had success managing its financials to pay and raise a dividend that has been increased for the past 43 years making it another stock that long term investors can lean on for steady performance
a highly anticipated u s securities and exchange commission report on january s frenzied gamestop corp trading debunked some conspiracy theories that have swirled around social media for months and adds momentum to chair gary gensler s push to toughen rules the 44 page document released monday details the sec s assessment of one of the most remarkable periods of the pandemic economy when retail traders took on wall street and sent shares of gamestop and other meme stocks into the stratosphere advertisement agency officials didn t offer specific policy recommendations but they did say the episode warrants a close look at factors that prompt brokers to restrict customer trading video game like features popularized by online trading platforms short selling and payment for order flow all are areas in which gensler has said the sec might have to strengthen regulations as part of an aggressive agenda that s likely to ensnare hedge funds robinhood markets inc citadel securities and other firms a key narrative of the gamestop incident is that an army of retail traders set off a massive short squeeze by driving up stocks that hedge funds were betting against they did so by flooding the market with purchase orders forcing the hedge funds to also have to buy shares to cover their shorts pushing gamestop even higher yet the sec said that story isn t entirely backed up by the evidence gamestop purchases by those covering shorts were a small fraction of overall buy volume and the company s share price remained high even after the direct effects of such trades should have waned according to the regulator advertisement the underlying motivation of such buy volume cannot be determined the sec said whether driven by a desire to squeeze short sellers and thus to profit from the resultant rise in price or by belief in the fundamentals of gamestop it was positive sentiment not the buying to cover that sustained the weeks long price appreciation of gamestop stock perhaps the biggest victim of bullish investors banding together on reddit and other social media platforms to push gamestop higher was gabe plotkin s melvin capital the hedge fund had a big short on gamestop and its january losses led to the firm getting a 2 billion cash infusion from ken griffin s citadel and roughly 750 million from steve cohen s point72 asset management still the sec said the hedge funds mostly emerged from the situation unscathed staff believes that hedge funds broadly were not significantly affected by investments in gme and other meme stocks the regulator said in its report staff did not observe that any advisors to private funds and registered funds experienced liquidity issues or difficulties with counterparties advertisement one hotly debated topic also addressed in the sec report albeit less definitively is whether hedge funds pushed robinhood to restrict customers from adding to their gamestop positions in late january as the stock was surging robinhood has repeatedly argued that it halted buy orders because of demands from its clearinghouse that it post more capital to deal with the heightened risk the issue was a top focus when robinhood chief executive vlad tenev faced a barrage of questions from lawmakers during a house hearing in february in its report the sec did note that clearinghouses demanded billions of dollars in additional margin from member firms and that brokers temporarily barred clients from purchasing additional shares advertisement the document listed four areas that the sec believes need additional study factors that may prompt brokers to restrict trading the sec said the wild gamestop trading raises questions about thinly capitalized brokers ability to meet margin calls the sec said such risks could be mitigated by shortening settlement cycles for trades digital engagement practices and payment for order flow the sec questioned whether payment for order flow incentivizes online brokers to incorporate game like features into their apps to increase customer trading dark pools and market makers the sec may review the effect that market makers such as citadel securities and virtu financial inc have on the market and the trade execution that retail customers receive such firms paid brokers for the right to handle many of the gamestop orders and they also execute a lot transactions themselves rather than sending them to stock exchanges short selling the sec said increased disclosure of bearish bets on stocks would help regulators better track market dynamics january s events gave us an opportunity to consider how we can further our efforts to make the equity markets as fair orderly and efficient as possible gensler said in a statement accompanying the report the sec chief has signaled that he plans to take up many of the issues raised in the document notably the agency has signaled that it may propose rules by april targeting payment for order flow and the market dominance of firms that execute orders it also just finished collecting public comments on brokers digital engagement practices the sec s two republican commissioners hester peirce and elad roisman questioned the report arguing that few conclusions can be drawn from the data in a statement they said they ve seen no evidence that payment for order flow or off exchange trading caused the meme stock frenzy advertisement this report should have been an anodyne report on the events of earlier this year and if evident from the data an assessment of the causes of those events the gop members of the sec wrote surprisingly the report turned into an account of those events awkwardly intertwined with discussions of market practices and policies that mirror commission level conversations unrelated to the specifics of january s events
debate swirls in monetary policy circles over whether how and when to introduce central bank digital currencies e g allen et al 2020 auer and bohme 2020 auer et al 2020 agur et al 2020 see also the vox debate on the future of digital money this debate has a strong resonance with earlier crossroads in monetary history when major transformations took place in today s crossroad advances in technology digitalisation have led to the development of new forms of money these include virtual crypto currencies like bitcoin stable coins like libra diem and central bank digital currencies cbdc like the bahamian sand dollar today s innovations have a resonance with earlier major shifts in monetary history and in a new paper bordo 2021 i examine the case for cbdc through this lens my overview of the history of monetary transformations suggests that technological change in money is inevitable driven by the financial incentives of a market economy government has always had a key role in the provision of currency outside money which is a public good it has also regulated inside money provided by the commercial banking system this held for fiduciary money and will likely hold for digital money monetary transformations in history monetary transformations in history have been driven by changing technology changing tastes economic growth and the demands to effectively satisfy the functions of money money and finance has evolved with human history goetzmann 2017 three historical transformations set the stage for the current digital transformation in the 18th and 19th centuries new financial technology led to the advent of fiduciary money convertible bank notes which greatly reduced the resource costs of specie smith 1776 in addition the exigencies of rising costs of war finance in the early modern era led to the issue by governments of inconvertible fiat money cbdc as a social saving over fiat money promises to be the next generation in this progression the early record of poorly regulated commercial banks issuing notes ostensibly convertible into specie has been used to make the case for government regulation of commercial banking and for a government monopoly of the note issue friedman 1960 the record of free banking in the us was one of considerable instability gorton 1986 the high asymmetric information costs of a multiple currency system created an inefficient payments system 1 2 the note issue eventually gravitated towards a central bank government monopoly the present day rise of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins suggests that the outcome may also be a process of consolidation towards cbdc central banks from the 17th to 20th centuries evolved to satisfy several important public needs war finance an efficient payments system financial stability price stability macro stability through a slow and painful learning process monetary policy has evolved into the present day flexible inflation targeting based on credibility for low inflation cbdc could follow in this tradition the case for cbdc the basic case for cbdc defined as an asset in electronic form which serves the basic functions of paper currency with universal access and legal tender can be traced back to the classical economists argument that currency is a public good that would appropriately be provided by the government friedman and schwartz 1986 cbdc would satisfy the basic functions of money a unit of account a medium of exchange and a store of value bordo and levin 2017 the key factors driving interest today in cbdc include the following cbdc would be the 21st century version of adam smith s social saving of fiduciary money by reducing the costs of issuing and operating physical currency by between 0 5 and 1 0 of gdp according to imf 2020 and by reducing the monopoly rents earned by the commercial banking system barrdear and kumhoff 2016 andolfatto 2019 digitalisation has greatly reduced the use of cash in several countries e g sweden and norway cbdc would provide a payment media which has all the attributes of physical cash but is less subject to theft and loss cbdc would increase financial inclusion for disadvantaged groups that do not have access to bank accounts cbdc may head off the threat to monetary sovereignty from stablecoins issued by global digital services companies like facebook which would threaten central banks ability to conduct monetary policy cbdc would provide a secure reliable currency free from the dangers of fraud hacking money laundering and financing terrorism implementation of cbdc in the real world implementation of cbdc raises a number of important questions about its design which have been examined closely by central banks one issue is the choice of retail versus wholesale cbdc significant improvements in the wholesale payments clearing mechanism suggest that the key issue is retail cbdc here the public good aspect of currency provides a strong rationale for either direct provision or at least close regulation and supervision by government accounts at the central bank are eminently feasible but the private sector has a comparative advantage in financial innovation hence in advanced countries a two tiered or public private arrangement may be preferable designated institutions could offer cbdc accounts to the public or serve as conduits for the central bank tobin 1987 3 second concern among prominent officials carstens 2021 cecchetti 2021 that account based cbdc which is the most secure direct liability of the central bank would lead to disintermediation and runs from the commercial banking system research suggests that disintermediation could be offset by central bank balance sheet policy by restricting cbdc holdings or by tiering interest rates on cbdc and non cbdc accounts kiester and sanchez 2019 brunnermier and niepelt 2019 kumhof and noone 2018 bindseil 2020 moreover central banks have adequate lines of defence to deal with runs in the form of supervision and regulation deposit insurance and lender of last resort 4 cbdc and monetary policy researchers have argued that interest paid on cbdc could improve the transmission mechanism especially the lending channel barrdear and kumhoff 2019 williamson 2018 imf 2020 meaning et al 2018 it would also reduce and simplify central bank balance sheets and move us back towards a bills only policy using the interest rate on cbdc as the policy rate could allow central banks to move from the current floor system back to a corridor system meaning et al 2018 in bordo and levin 2017 my co author and i argue that allowing the interest rate on cbdc to go negative along with incentives to reduce cash holding would eliminate the effective lower bound as a constraint on monetary policy we also argue that interest on cbdc could be used to foster true price stability finally paying interest on cbdc could be used to improve the lender of last resort function and financial stability cbdc and the open economy cbdc has very important implications for the open economy first it could greatly improve cross border payments imf 2020 with digitalisation payments could be done almost instantly it would create a social saving similar to the first transatlantic cable in 1866 garbade and silber 1978 some stablecoins promise to arrange peer to peer payments through their established networks were stablecoin providers to dominate these arrangements this could threaten monetary sovereignty and also be a source of credit risk this makes the case for cbdc or some regulation but sovereign cbdcs would need to make arrangements for interoperability with their foreign counterparts second a system of cbdcs that closely links the monetary and payments systems of different countries could lead to an amplification of the spillover effects of domestic monetary policy on other countries third cbdc and stablecoins could lead to currency substitution dollar digitalisation which could impact the monetary sovereignty of state owned enterprises especially those with weak monetary and financial institutions effective currency competition could occur because of the ability of stablecoins to separate the functions of money brunnermier et al 2019 indeed stablecoins could challenge the dollar s dominance because of the superiority of their networks however currency competition from private platforms could run into the problems of interoperability and coordination that plagued multiple competing currencies in the 19th century like them information asymmetry would make the case for cbdc a system of interconvertible cbdcs would eliminate the imperfect substitutability of private digital currency eichengreen 2019 lessons from an historical perspective four key lessons follow from history on the case for central bank provided digital currencies 1 technological change in money financial innovation is inevitable driven by the financial incentives of a market economy 2 government has a key role in the provision of money outside money is a public good which it is necessary for the central bank to provide this holds for fiat money and digital money the ability to issue it depends on the credibility of the issuer if that falters currency competition from other cbdcs or stablecoins will erode monetary sovereignty 3 interest bearing cbdc could improve the transmission mechanism and transparency of monetary policy it could greatly simplify central banks balance sheets and help them move back to a simpler framework that existed before the global financial crisis moreover cbdc could revolutionise monetary policy if the interest rate on cbdc is used as the policy rate 4 cbdc is a global innovation it could transform international payments like the first transatlantic cable did in 1866 it could also exacerbate currency substitution and require international monetary cooperation cbdc and stablecoins could also challenge the international monetary system the fundamental forces leading to currency domination are unlikely to change but digitalisation could accelerate the shifts driven by them as occurred in the 20th century when the dollar eclipsed the pound digitalisation in money may promise to be the future central banks could learn the lessons from history and provide digital currency to effectively fulfil their public mandates references agur t a ari

file in this thursday jan 28 2021 file photo a gamestop sign is seen above a store in urbandale iowa the u s stock market certainly shook when hundreds of thousands of regular people suddenly piled into gamestop earlier in 2021 driving its price to heights that shocked professional investors but it didn t break ap photo charlie neibergall file new york the u s stock market certainly shook when hundreds of thousands of regular people suddenly piled into gamestop early this year driving its price to heights that shocked professional investors but it didn t break that s one of the takeaways from a report by the securities and exchange commission s staff released monday about january s meme stock mania as gamestop s stock shot from 39 to 347 in just a week some of the stock market s plumbing began creaking but the report indicated the market s basic systems and operations remained sound recommended videos the surge for gamestop and other downtrodden stocks also laid bare how much power is being wielded by a new generation of smaller pocketed and novice investors armed with apps on their phones that make trading fun the extreme volatility in meme stocks in january 2021 tested the capacity and resiliency of our securities markets in a way that few could have anticipated the report said at the same time the trading in meme stocks during this time highlighted an important feature of united states securities markets in the 21st century broad participation many of the points in the report were already known such as how the extremely heavy bets made by some hedge funds against gamestop s stock actually helped accelerate its extreme ascent though they weren t the main driver the report also didn t make any recommendations for changes to how the market is structured but it pointed to several areas for further consideration they include topics that sec chair gary gensler has already cited in recent speeches such as whether the way some brokerages make their money encourages them to push customers to trade more often than they should the report also indicated the sec could further scrutinize events that may cause a brokerage to restrict trading in a stock during the height of the frenzy several brokerages barred customers from buying gamestop after the clearinghouse that settles their trades demanded more cash to cover the increased risk created by its highly volatile price that left many investors incensed the report also raised questions about whether investors are getting the best execution on their trades when so many are getting routed to big trading firms instead of to exchanges like the nasdaq or the new york stock exchange and perhaps in a disappointment to some of the investors who piled into gamestop to punish the financial elite the sec s staff said it doesn t believe hedge funds were broadly affected by investments in gamestop and other meme stocks during the run up of gamestop s price many people were bellowing on reddit and other social media platforms that this was their chance to stick it to the hedge funds they took aim at funds that had bet gamestop a struggling video game retailer would see its price continue to fall those hedge funds did that by shorting the stock in such a trade a short seller borrows a share sells it and then hopes to buy it back later at a lower price to pocket the difference some of those short sellers were indeed burned and when they bought gamestop shares to get out of their suddenly soured bets the buying helped push the stock up even further but other hedge funds that had earlier bet on gains for gamestop s stock made profits as did others who jumped into the upsurge hedge funds as a group have been making money this year including a 1 2 return in january during the throes of the meme mania according to the hfri fund weighted composite index the sec s staff nevertheless said that improved reporting of short sales is another area worthy of further study particularly if it will help regulators better track the market

for 20 years the disappearance of jeff jones father gnawed at him he was 12 when his dad raymond jones went bowhunting in idaho s lemhi mountains with his buddies when raymond didn t return to camp one evening his hunting partners informed the local sheriff s department and a search was quickly launched raymond went missing on jeff s 12th birthday sept 7 1968 a birthday he shared with his father who was born in 1929 for days men on foot scoured the rugged terrain near hayden creek where he was last seen airplanes bloodhounds and helicopters were called in to assist a search that continued until bad weather shut efforts down fifty three years later on sept 17 a bowhunter trekking through rocky terrain in the same region discovered two weathered black boots the soles showing little wear sticking out from under a boulder he said when he found him he knew this was historic someone who had been missing a long time the hunter told jeff he s not a religious person but he said it felt like he was meant to be there the remains were easily identified by the discovery of some of raymond s belongings including a credit card with his name on it i m grateful for that little piece of plastic jeff said lemhi county sheriff steve penner said the discovery was unbelievable given the time that had elapsed it s kind of an amazing story growing up for years following raymond s disappearance jeff said he carried a chip on his shoulder as if he had to prove his worth his father and mother had been divorced for eight years when raymond went missing jeff was living in miles city raymond s hometown with his mother elizabeth who everyone knew as betty his parents were a tight couple when young jeff said hunting fishing racing stock cars and dancing together he was an outgoing person he liked to have fun jeff recalled when i was little i remember he would let me steer the milk truck as he was making deliveries before jeff was born his mother severed her spine in a wreck after the steering went out while driving a new stock car an accident that confined her to a wheelchair years later the marriage went south and the couple divorced when jeff was 2 raymond remarried and moved to salmon idaho where he ran a meadow gold delivery route while also operating an enco gas station it was an enco credit card that revealed raymond s identity after the divorce raymond would fly a plane he owned to pick up jeff and bring him back to salmon for a few weeks in the summer they would often fish together including one memorable trip when jeff landed a 28 pound salmon back in miles city jeff was estranged from his father s parents siblings and cousins after the divorce they may have grown up in the same small town but the families ignored each other divorce being more of a social stigma at the time jeff said betty married twice more and had one child with each husband neither relationship lasting long it was kind of us against the world back then he said of his siblings and mother we were very very close despite her disability and because she had five children to raise betty started the cottage phone answering service instilling in jeff an entrepreneurial and independent spirit that his father also shared she died of cancer in 1986 so i didn t have either one of my parents for very long jeff said of his two sisters only one is still alive terri bleacher died at age 48 following a fall in which she accidentally cut her jugular vein peggy lausche lives in enderlin n d after their divorce raymond also remarried and with his new wife donna adopted an infant son steven just days before disappearing in 1970 two years after going missing raymond was officially declared deceased although no body was found to bury a gravestone next to his parent s plot clyde and dora jones was erected in miles city to memorialize his presumed death raymond s disappearance was also a blow to his siblings and parents they were destroyed to lose a child said virginia streeper raymond s 89 year old sister who lives in havre we waited and waited and hoped he would be found virginia remembers her brother as a wonderful man loving who was also a terrible tease when it came to his younger sister virginia s granddaughter alerted her that raymond had been found i couldn t believe it she said i was very relieved and happy because it brought closure after all those years message as a child jeff heard about his father s disappearance from his uncles who helped pay for additional airplane searches after the official manhunt was called off they did everything they could to find him jeff said three days after raymond disappeared jeff received a pretty spooky birthday card his father had mailed before going hunting i kept expecting him to come through the door even 20 years later because there were rumors as there often is that he had run off jeff said i always felt being his only son that he would show up that he would let me know if he had taken off eventually jeff was successful in burying the painful thoughts that haunted him he worked as a welder and then started a business before selling it and starting another one he never thought about his father much until he received an unusual message from his cousin brad jones who lives in oak harbor washington brad had seen an internet story about a hunter s remains being discovered in idaho after 53 years he sent jeff a facebook message saying my prayers are with you jeff had no idea what brad was talking about so brad urged him to phone i hate to be the one to tell you like this but they found your dad brad told his cousin at the time jeff was stunned but grateful that s great news don t be sorry he said i d been waiting for that news since i was 12 since she was the spouse of record when the hunter went missing the sheriff s office had contacted raymond s widow donna who was in a memory care facility she had a hard time separating 1968 from now jeff said asking if raymond had been found alive for days after learning the news jeff said he was in a fog grief he had suppressed for years overwhelmed him with the help of his son he spent days tracking down relatives to let them know that a 53 year old mystery had been solved cliff a day after his discovery the idaho hunter led deputies from the lemhi county sheriff s office and a forest service law enforcement officer back to the site where he had stumbled upon raymond s remains a remote area at an elevation of about 9 000 feet your dad had to be a real bad ass bowhunter to be up where he was the discoverer of raymond s remains told jeff the hunter has asked authorities and jeff to keep him anonymous it was four miles in to the bottom of the slope and then a rugged climb up the mountain to the accident site the bowhunter speculated raymond might have been attempting to scale a cliff when a piece of rock broke off and crushed him you know it s hard to say what happened sheriff penner said it was a cliffy area he most likely fell things move around a lot so it s just speculation it took four men to lift the 18 inch thick rock that measured about 5 feet square underneath there was little of raymond left a few skull fragments some leg bones and one foot as well as the remains of what looked like a backpack a piece of a wooden arrow shaft a gnarled leather knife scabbard and rusted hunting knife a homemade elk bugle crafted from plastic a coiled piece of cotton rope a plastic sheath holding a hunting license and of course the all important credit card never found was raymond s bow most of his bones were gone i expect animals carried them off jeff said after receiving permission from steven jones raymond s adopted son jeff made the surreal trip to salmon idaho to retrieve his father s remains taking his two sons scott and ryan jones in salmon the four children of his father s friend and hunting partner ralph pehrson gathered from across the country to meet them they revisited the creek they had played in as children as well as their parents former homes ralph they confided had packed away his own bow never to use it again after raymond went missing despite the somber reason for the gathering it was really like a happy reunion a celebration jeff said they vowed to never let the jones pehrson connection die again picking up the few boxes that contained his father s remains and weathered belongings proved more emotional for jeff than he had anticipated despite 53 years to reconcile the tragedy it s still difficult for him to change a story he has told for all of that time now instead of saying his father disappeared when he was only 12 years old jeff has reframed it as his father was found after missing for 53 years jeff is now 65 his father had he survived would be 92 i find myself having to readjust my thinking it s a surreal kind of feeling jeff said i can say he was killed by a rockslide reconnect this spring jeff is planning a graveside service to have his father s remains interred at the miles city cemetery under the stone that long marked his life next summer he intends to return to the site of his father s death with his sons and maybe place a marker at the site jeff hopes the story of his father s discovery after so many years will let other families of missing people know there is a possibility however slim that their loved ones may eventually be found i really feel blessed that i know in my lifetime what happened to him he said i d given up hope of ever finding out jeff carries reminders of his mother and father everywhere he goes tattooed on his right upper arm is a portrait of his father with the green day song title wake me up when september ends arcing above and below the song was written by musician billie joe armstrong following his father s september death when he was 10 years old below the portrait are the dates raymond disappeared his birthday and jeff s birthday jeff s son ryan of bombshell tattoo inked the memorial on jeff s left upper arm is a portrait of his mother betty together the parents frame their son a survivor of heartbreak a man who has risen above troublesome circumstances loss of a loved one affects everyone differently for jeff one thing his father s disappearance underscored for him was safety in the outdoors when i grew up i hunted quite a bit he said and i was always super careful made sure of my bearings because i knew something happened to him that he couldn t control so i taught my boys don t take any risks don t take any chances in the back of his mind as jeff hiked in the gravelly mountains while elk hunting his father s disappearance unconsciously nagged at him he didn t want to vanish and leave his sons with unanswered questions that was foremost in my mind to not repeat history for my kids
toronto canada s main stock market moved further into record territory monday despite a relatively quiet day marked by a pullback in the key energy sector there was little conviction overall in equity markets to start the trading week even as investors are focused on earnings season which has started very strongly said craig fehr investment strategist edward jones while that led to a positive week last week we re seeing some consolidation today but i would say broadly it s a positive trend when we re going to see equities pivot their sights toward corporate profits because that continues to be probably the brightest element of the fundamental backdrop at the moment he said in an interview fehr said there s a lot more occurring beneath the surface with a rebound in communications and technology that favours the s p 500 and nasdaq over the dow the tsx has been on a roll he said pointing to the heavyweight financials services sector that has benefited from the prospects of higher rates and faster loan growth but at the same time obviously the tear that oil has been on has benefited energy stocks and so that s where we ve seen some divergences between the canadian stock market and the u s market the s p tsx composite index closed up 57 27 points to a high of the day at 20 985 37 in new york the dow jones industrial average was down 36 15 points at 35 258 61 the s p 500 index was up 15 09 points at 4 486 46 while the nasdaq composite was up 124 47 points at 15 021 81 technology and industrials led while energy and health care were the biggest laggards on the day technology rose 1 1 per cent with shares of shopify inc increasing 2 9 per cent industrials increased 0 7 per cent with tfi international inc and wsp global inc each up about 1 9 per cent energy lost 1 2 per cent on a dip in crude oil prices and a big loss in natural gas prices fehr said the sector s performance monday reflected investors catching their breath after a spectacular run so far in 2021 in which crude oil has surged 68 per cent to see them take a breather today is not particularly surprising given the run they ve been on crude s strong movement reflects the outlook for robust demand and the challenges of meeting that with adequate supplies the december crude contract was down four cents at us 81 69 per barrel and the november natural gas contract was down 42 1 cents at us 4 99 per mmbtu shares of birchcliff energy ltd were down 3 2 per cent followed by tourmaline oil corp and meg energy corp at 2 9 and 2 6 per cent respectively the canadian dollar traded for 80 78 us unchanged from friday materials was also lower on a dip in metals prices as new gold inc fell 4 1 per cent the december gold contract was down us 2 60 at us 1 765 70 an ounce and the december copper contract was down four tenths of a cent at nearly us 4 73 a pound the backdrop to monday s stock market results was a slowing of the chinese economy gross domestic product grew 4 9 per cent in the july to september period from a year earlier that was the weakest growth since the third quarter of 2020 while disappointing the trend isn t surprising given that world s second largest economy is becoming more consumption based and less investment focused said fehr the growth rate will likely outpace developed markets but be slower than investors have come to expect over the last 20 to 30 years fehr said the bigger question for markets is whether chinese policy makers will come to the rescue as they have done in the last two to three decades we will probably see a little bit more from the people s bank of china on the monetary side but i think broadly this is a reflection of the fact that stimulus isn t coming immediately to the rescue as has been the case in prior years this report by the canadian press was first published oct 18 2021 companies in this story tsx bir tsx tou tsx meg tsx shop tsx tfii tsx wsp tsx ngd tsx gsptse tsx cadusd x ross marowits the canadian press

biontech nasdaq bntx and illumina nasdaq ilmn 10x returns to investors biontech nasdaq bntx and illumina nasdaq ilmn are two of the biggest investment payoffs over the last ten years the equity analysts that correctly identified these big two winners for investors deserve a closer look soumit roy ph d is a vice president and healthcare analyst of jones trading institutional services llc dr roy is responsible for research coverage on biotechnology companies within the healthcare sector for jones trading prior to joining jones trading in 2018 dr roy was a senior research associate at suntrust robinson humphrey covering small and mid cap biotechnology companies with innovative technologies notably t cell therapy targeted medicines gene editing and next generation immuno oncology he was a postdoctoral fellow at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai new york in the clinical immunology department and his research was focused on understanding and discovering novel agents to

cancerous growth he holds two master s degrees in developmental biology and biochemistry and has published in the highest rated scientific journals in 2019 dr roy identified a company that was later purchased for stock by biontech nasdaq bntx and returned big for investors who followed his advice dr soumit roy in a 2 849 word interview on march 22 2019 exclusively in the wall street transcript correctly called out an obscure biotech stock for investors key names are neon therapeutics they are ahead by at least a year and a half over their peers they have already presented lung cancer data and melanoma data in io naive patients showing 25 to 40 improvement on top of opdivo in combination therapy regimen with opdivo so far neon is clearly ahead in the race right on its heels are gritstone and moderna that just ipo ed the reason i m mentioning these names is to give a sense how far ahead neon is over the peers what i would say is we have turned the corner it is the middle of the beginning as we see neoantigen companies are taking their place and bringing forward therapeutic candidates for the next two to three years we believe investors are going to put a lot of focus on these names like neon therapeutics gritstone nasd aq grts moderna therapeutics nasdaq mrna and genocea nasdaq gnca we would also keep an eye on the paris listed stock ose immunotherapeutics otcmkts orpof so what is happening is these companies like neon gritstone and moderna are using high throughput screening followed by artificial intelligence algorithms to figure out what really are the patient specific mutations on top of the background noise what they are learning is that there is a signature mutational profile for each individual patient we believe companies will be capitalizing on these findings and will be pushing personalized medicines in the coming years they may use that information to make t cell therapy or maybe small molecule inhibitors following this interview in

by jeff thomas via international man in spite of all the rhetoric we will go deeper in debt the fed will print more money and the value of the dollar will continue to plummet ron paul never in history have the economic and political structures been so manipulated by those who are responsible for their safekeeping never has so much been at stake in so many countries and facing collapse all at the same time the great majority of people in the first world recognise that the world is passing through an economic crisis however most are under the impression that there are some pretty smart fellows running the show and all they need to do is tweak the system a bit more and we ll return to happy days not so the smart fellows who are in charge of fixing the problem are in fact the very same people who created it understandably this a hard concept for most people to even consider let alone accept as the very idea that those in charge of the system might consciously collapse it seems preposterous so we might wish to back up a bit here and present a very brief history of the system itself in order to understand that the eventual collapse of the economic system was baked in the cake from the very beginning creating a central bank from the very earliest days of the formation of the american republic bankers along with inside help from george washington s secretary of the treasury alexander hamilton sought to create a banking monopoly that would create the country s currency and become the central banking system the first attempt at a central bank was a failure and strong opponents including thomas jefferson prevented a second central bank for a time later further attempts were made by bankers and their political cronies and each central bank was either short lived or defeated in its planning stages then in 1913 the heads of the largest banks met clandestinely on jekyll island georgia to make another try having recently lost yet another bid to create a central bank due to the public s understandable concern that the big bankers were already too powerful a new spin was placed on the idea this time they decided to present the idea as a government body that would be decentralised and would have the responsibility of restricting the power of the banks however the new bill was in fact the same old bill with a new title and some minor changes in wording but this time it would be presented by the new president who was a liberal the president woodrow wilson had in fact been handpicked by the banks the banks then scuttled their own conservative party s candidate got the democrat wilson elected then installed a secretary of the treasury whose job it would be to ensure that the federal reserve was created the bill was widely supported by the public even though in truth it was not a federal agency but a privately owned conglomerate controlled by the banks neither was it a reserve it was never intended to store money it was intended to give the biggest bankers control of the economy they followed the central principle of uber banker mayer rothschild let me issue and control a nation s money and i care not who writes the laws from the start the new institution peddled itself as the protector of the people s interests but it was quite the opposite its purpose from its inception was to control the economy and the government by controlling the issuance of the currency in addition it was to be a system of taxation typically a population accepts a certain amount of direct taxation but has its limits of tolerance yet the bankers understood that a less direct method of taxation was infinitely more profitable and infinitely safer from criticism inflation as a profit system inflation was not always the norm at one time prices were relatively static from one generation to the next but the federal reserve touted the idea that controlled inflation was in fact necessary for a prosperous economy of course the greater the debasement of the currency through inflation the more the central bankers profited but at some point the currency would have lost virtually all its value and it would be time for a reset the currency would need to collapse and a new one created we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us and so the fed set about its hundred year programme of continuous inflation although there have been periods of lower inflation and even deflation the programme stayed more or less on course and now its hundred year life has all but ended the dollar has been devalued almost 100 and so we find ourselves at the day of reckoning the economic crisis we are now facing not only in the us it will be felt to a greater or lesser extent worldwide is not a mere anomaly that we need to push past it s a systemic crisis it s been created by design and the system must collapse of course the central banks are in the process of protecting their interests to make sure that whilst this will be a major economic calamity they themselves will continue to profit the damage will be borne by the general public this began in earnest in 1999 with the repeal of the glass steagall act allowing banks to create a massive reckless mortgage spree it was backed by the government s too big to fail policy that guaranteed that when the banks predictably became insolvent as a result of the loans government would bail them out and by government we mean the taxpayer it was he who picked up the bill for the banks recklessness the next step in getting ready for the collapse is an all out effort to confiscate the wealth of the public this can be seen in the effort to push investors away from solid forms of wealth protection such as gold and silver and into stocks bonds and bank deposits more recently we ve seen the emergence of an effort to end the use of safe deposit boxes and a push to end the use of paper currency in making transactions the end objective is to force as much money as possible into deposits in banks then take it the us eu and a few other countries have passed confiscation legislation allowing the banks carte blanche to confiscate and or refuse to release deposits of course a reset of these proportions will not be without its fallout the public will be horrified at the outcome at the realisation that the very institutions they thought had been created to protect them had never been intended to serve their interests at all once they realise that the world s greatest ponzi scheme has been foisted on them they will be hopping mad and justifiably so those who had not had the foresight to internationalise themselves to remove themselves as much as possible from the system will most certainly want to get even in some way and this makes clear why governments particularly that of the us are working so hard to create a police state unless a totalitarian state can be created those who are presently taking the wealth may not be able to fully realise their objectives the coming train wreck is no accident it has long been planned that the smart fellows in charge will somehow save the day is therefore a vain hope indeed it s still possible to back out of the system but it s getting more difficult every day the window is closing and the time to internationalise is now editor s note a big part of any strategy to reduce your political risk is to place some of your savings outside the immediate reach of the thieving bureaucrats in your home country obtaining an offshore bank account is a convenient way to do just that that way your savings cannot be easily confiscated frozen or devalued at the drop of a hat or with a couple of taps on the keyboard in the event capital controls are imposed an offshore bank account will help ensure that you have access to your money when you need it the most in short your savings in an offshore bank will largely be safe from any madness in your home country despite what you may hear offshore banking is completely legal and is not about tax evasion or other illegal activities it s simply about legally diversifying your political risk by putting your money in sound well capitalized

that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of september 17 2021 frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee yeah hello everyone thank you for joining us today as the covid 19 pandemic continued in the third quarter our teams remain focused on delivering what we call the triple duty of care meeting customer needs safeguarding the health and safety of our employees and ensuring business continuity we remain extremely focused on implementing the necessary corrective actions for patients affected by the component quality issue that we announced earlier this year we have mobilized all necessary resources across the company to address this because patient wellbeing remains at the heart of everything we do at philips so this is a top priority for all of us our strategy and portfolio continue to resonate very well with customers in the third quarter we were encouraged by strong comparable order intake growth of 15 in diagnosis and treatment and 21 in connected care excluding the impact of the partial ventilator order cancellation in q3 of last year the strong momentum was driven by a positive hospital capex environment but also the strength of our portfolio resulting in an all time high order book for philips as shown on page 28 of our presentation we also signed 19 additional long term strategic partnerships across the world demonstrating the trust hospital leaders have in our ability to enhance health outcomes lowered cost of care and improved patient and staff experience our comparable sales declined 7 6 in the quarter on the back of 10 growth in q3 2020 as anticipated this quarter s sales were impacted by approximately eur150 million headwind as a consequence of the sleep recall as we are prioritizing the remediation of effective devices in use by patients in addition to that we faced intensified global supply volatility and issues such as the shortage of electronic components and increased shipping times this resulted in challenges to fully convert our opportunities to revenue which set our sales back by around eur150 million in the quarter with the bulk of the impact actually taking place in september year to date our comparable sales grew 3 and our adjusted ebitda margin improved 90 basis points excluding the sleep and respiratory care business year to date comparable sales growth was 10 and the adjusted ebitda margin improved almost 500 basis points abhijit will provide a more detailed overview of the numbers shortly now i would like to provide some color on some of our initiatives to respond to the needs of today s hospital leaders across the globe as they plan for the future as a pioneer in spectral diagnostics we have enabled our customers for many years to benefit from a reduction in follow up scans increased certainty in lesion characterization and reduced time to diagnosis our new spectral ct 7500 which we introduced earlier this year is attracting very strong customer demand and contributed to another quarter of double digit growth in the computed tomography business the university medical center in utrecht in the netherlands is among the customers who already installed these systems with the aim of enhancing outcomes in mainstream clinical diagnosis through image quality and detail for all patients and in all exams while speeding up scan time at the same time building on our leadership in image guided therapy solutions in cardiology we are further strengthening our position in fast growing adjacencies such as neurology and oncology for example the u s based piedmont health equipped it s neurosurgical operating rooms with specialized philips azurion solutions for the treatment of stroke and we also announced positive results of the clinical study aimed at setting a new standard of safety and accuracy the diagnosis of small peripheral lung lesions using the philips lung suite in combination with azurion in the quarter we launched two new key health suite informatic solutions which are scalable across the enterprise to support customers to achieve the quadruple aim of care the patient flow capacity suite a solution that helps manage the complete patient journey and the acute care telehealth which builds on our successful tele icu solutions importantly we continue to grow market share in our core businesses through deeper more comprehensive customer partnerships for example we provided a newly established yili chuanxin oncology hospital in xinjiang province china with a range of solutions to address the hospital clinical needs and screening diagnosis tweaking and rehabilitating cancer patients the solution includes intellispace digital pathology and the ingenia 3 0t mr iqon spectral ct incisive ct and ct big bore imaging systems in combination with the intellispace portal for advanced visualization and analysis as part of a 10 year partnership with rutherford health in the u k to open multiple community diagnostic centers the first center was actually opened in taunton for which we provided the innovative diagnostic imaging systems this included our 1 5 tesla ambition mr for helium free operations which obviously drives lower cost of care while providing confident diagnosis the recently acquired capsule business continued to add new device drivers to its medical device information platform which is now part of our health suite informatics platform with more than 1 000 unique types of medical devices capable of integrating with the platform customers can connect more devices to advance health systems digital transformation with intelligent vendor agnostic tools that turn complex data streams into actionable clinical insights in personal health we continue to invest in new product introductions and launched several oral healthcare innovations targeting different price points in china this included two new electric toothbrushes and our professional teeth whitening offering zoom which was launched through a local partnership with linkedcare one of the largest dental solution providers into chinese market and in latin america in a co branding partnership with colgate we see a strong take off of our oral care product range in line with our plans we successfully completed the sale of the domestic appliances business this concludes our major divestments allowing us to fully focus on extending our leadership in health technology and accelerating our transformation into a solutions company we reported an after tax gain of eur2 5 billion in discontinued operations related to this divestment in the third quarter let me now speak about the field actions in sleep we are doing everything we can to deliver a solution to patients and caregivers as fast as possible the repair and replacement program is well underway in the united states and several other countries we have produced more than 750 000 units of repair kits and replacement devices to date of which more than 250 000 units have reached customers we have substantially increased our overall production volume in the third quarter to 55 000 units per week and are on track to reach 80 000 units per week in the fourth quarter we expect to complete the repair and replacement programs within 12 months we have a strong program management in place to see the corrective actions through as fast as possible as you know several civil and personal injury claims related to this recall have been filed it is too early to draw any conclusions or to talk about the merits and the timelines to handle claims at this stage but i want you to know that we have competent legal team managing the litigation matters and right now we are focusing on the patients and the corrective actions required there first i would also like to remind you that when we announced the recall in june we acted on the assumption of a worst case clinical impact scenario assessment related to the pe pur foam issue based on the test data and information available at that point of time we continue with further research and testing to better scope any potential patient risk and are getting expert assessments on these we aim to make this information available to the competent authorities and healthcare providers as soon as possible which is still anticipated in the fourth quarter as leandro mentioned we have published frequently asked questions faqs on the recall to provide details and clarification on the progress there are some areas particularly related to litigation where we are not able to provide further details at this time and we will share additional information in a transparent and timely matter as the situation evolves now looking ahead we continue to see uncertainty related to covid 19 supply chain volatility has intensified globally which already led to longer lead times to convert our strong order book to revenue in the third quarter and we expect this headwind to continue in the fourth quarter this makes more challenging to deliver on incremental demand which we expected to compensate the shortfall in sleep in the near term therefore we now expect to deliver low single digit comparable sales growth with a modest adjusted ebitda margin improvement for the full year 2021 based on our strong customer demand and growing order book we expect to resume our growth and margin expansion trajectory in 2022 as we work through the headwinds our journey to leadership in health technology continues and i m pleased with the significant progress that we are making on our strategic roadmap we are executing on a clear strategy to help transform care along the health continuum and have a stronger than ever portfolio to serve our customers i remain therefore very confident on the medium term growth and margin opportunity of our company and with that i ll turn the call to abhijit abhijit bhattacharya executive vice president chief financial officer thank you frans and thank you all for joining us today let me provide some color on the third quarter comparable order intake growth of 47 you will remember in q3 last year we had the partial cancellation of the ventilator contract in the u s and that provides a favorable comparable base when taking out this effect order intake growth is still a strong 17 diagnosis and treatment order intake grew by 15 in the third quarter driven by double digit growth in in ct in ultrasound and in image guided therapy order momentum was very strong in north america europe asia pacific and most growth geographies china delivered mid single digit order growth with short term momentum affected by additional procedures required for importing healthcare products we have a strong position in china including our r d centers our factories local for local innovation and our fully chinese management team and are further investing in local for local products and capabilities order intake grew 270 in connected care and that is 21 when excluding the impact of the partial cancellation of the ventilator order last year patient monitoring orders grew 20 building on a similar growth last year as a result of a fundamental shift in adoption of our patient care management solutions in both high and low acuity care settings comparable sales declined 7 6 in the quarter on the back of 10 growth in q3 2020 as frans mentioned in addition to the high comparison base and the anticipated headwinds in our sleep business we also face stronger than anticipated supply chain disruptions at the end of the quarter i will elaborate further on that a bit later coming back to the performance of our businesses diagnosis and treatment comparable sales grew 10 in the quarter with double digit growth in image guided therapy and enterprise diagnostic informatics and high single digit growth in diagnostic imaging and ultrasound we expect strong momentum in these businesses to continue in the fourth quarter the volume of electric procedures tracked above pre covid levels during q3 even though they were below the levels seen in the second quarter due to the impact of the delta variant in parts of the u s and asia pacific early in the quarter we expect hospitals to continue to normalize their operations and work through the backlog of patients in the coming quarters although covid remains a risk of course the comparable sales for connected care businesses declined by 39 driven by a substantial decline in the sleep and respiratory care on the back of a very strong q3 last year as well as headwinds related to the recall patient monitoring comparable sales growth also declined on the back of a very strong q3 last year and an increase in the lead time to convert the order book into sales personal health comparable sales were in line with q3 2020 as anticipated sales growth in the quarter was impacted by two phasing factors the shift of amazon prime day from q3 last year to q2 this year and pre deliveries made in june due to the cut off period related to the legal and financial disentanglement of domestic appliances as of july 1 2021 as mentioned during the q2 earnings call we estimated that these factors had a negative impact of 5 percentage points of growth of personal health in the third quarter year to date growth was 15 with double digit growth across businesses underlying consumer demand for our strong portfolio and personal health remains very solid but the current supply issues are expected to affect revenue in the fourth quarter as well consequently we expect personal health sales in q4 to be in line with last year compared to mid to high single digit growth if we were unconstrained by supplies let me now turn to the profitability development in the third quarter adjusted ebitda for the group was eur512 million which is 12 3 of sales in diagnosis and treatment the adjusted ebitda increased by 450 basis points to 14 2 of sales mainly driven by sales growth and productivity in personal health adjusted ebitda was 15 9 up 100 basis points from last year mainly driven by productivity measures connected care delivered an adjusted ebitda margin of 6 2 of sales impacted by the sales decline in the high margin sleep business which was partially offset by our productivity programs it s important to note that connected care excluding sleep and respiratory care was up 600 basis points between 2019 and 2020 and we expect to hold on to that gain despite the decline in sales this year adjusted ebitda for the group was also impacted by higher than expected license income in the segment other mainly due to phasing of royalty settlements we continue to focus on driving productivity initiatives that delivered eur73 million savings in the quarter more specifically eur34 million through procurement programs eur16 million supply chain productivity and eur23 million overhead cost reductions these initiatives helped partly mitigate the impact of the increase of components and broader supply chain costs that we are experiencing adjusting items were eur53 million lower than guidance in the quarter due to lower restructuring and acquisition related costs and lower cost for the separation of domestic appliances financial income and expenses included the positive impact from the increase in value of our minority participations income tax expense was a gain in the quarter mainly due to the positive impact of the recognition of some taxes relating to business transfers the adjusted diluted eps from continuing operations was eur0 40 in q3 this year year to date adjusted eps grew by 19 and free cash inflow was eur45 million in the quarter mainly due to phasing as the inflow for the first half of the year was eur140 million higher than last year let me provide some additional guidance for certain areas of our business in the segment other we expect an adjusted ebitda loss of around eur80 million for the full year 2021 this is eur30 million better than our prior guidance due to higher cost savings year to date for q4 we expect a net loss of around eur20 million at the adjusted ebitda level for segment other restructuring charges are expected to be around 60 basis points in 2021 which is lower than our prior guidance of 70 to 80 basis points due to lower costs year to date acquisition related costs are expected to be around 30 basis points lower this year compared to our prior guidance of 70 basis points this is also due to lower costs year to date as we have optimized some of our integration processes in the fourth quarter we expect restructuring acquisition related and other charges of approximately eur105 million financial income and expenses are expected to be a net cost of around eur70 million euros in 2021 this is lower than our prior guidance of eur115 million largely due to the increase in value of our minority stakes we expect the effective tax rate to be between low to mid single digit in 2021 this is due to the impact of the recognition of tax assets relating to business transfers that i just mentioned earlier our mid term guidance of 24 to 26 effective tax rate excluding incidentals remains valid on capital allocation we are currently executing two share buyback programs for capital reduction purposes of eur1 5 billion each the program which was initiated in the first quarter of 2019 will be completed this year as more than eur20 million shares purchased through forwards are expected to be delivered and canceled by december 31 this will result in a reduction of 2 of the outstanding shares under the program announced in july 2021 we entered into a number of forward transactions in the course of q3 covering approximately half of the program and totaling 19 6 million shares with settlement dates in 2022 2023 and 2024 the remainder of the program will be executed through open market purchases by an intermediary with a significant part taking place during this quarter more details on the share buyback programs are available on our investor relations website to conclude i d like to take you through how the year has progressed so far and our outlook as frans mentioned our end markets remain very healthy and competitive momentum of our solutions is very strong as evidenced by the record order book in the first nine months of the year our comparable sales grew 3 and our adjusted ebitda margins improved 90 basis points excluding the sleep and respiratory care business comparable sales growth was 10 and adjusted ebitda margin improved by almost 500 basis points year to date we are delivering on our transformation initiatives as well as our digital programs we have been working through the global supply chain headwinds for some time now but in the earlier part of the year our ability to mitigate supply chain risk was higher especially during q3 as supplier inventory started depleting and global supply chain challenges intensified lead times to convert our strong order book to revenue increased impacting our ability to deliver on part of the revenue upsides we had planned in q3 and q4 to mitigate the shortfall from the impact is particularly strong on businesses like patient monitoring oral healthcare and image guided therapy which as you know are our high margin businesses and also the businesses which have been showing high growth for q4 for example we are challenged with suppliers that are unable to give full visibility on the component availability and shipping times and incremental short term demand remains difficult to fulfill we remain focused on driving necessary actions to deliver on our strategic performance roadmap due to the intensified supply chain volatility that we are working through we now expect to deliver low single digit comparable sales growth and a modest adjusted ebitda margin improvement in the full year i want to reiterate that based on our strong customer demand and growing order book we expect to resume our growth and margin expansion trajectory in the course of 2022 as we work our way through the recall and that we remain very confident on our medium term financial trajectory with that frans and i are happy to take your questions thank you questions and answers abhijit bhattacharya executive vice president chief financial officer thank you sir the first question comes from veronika dubajova from goldman sachs please state your question veronika dubajova goldman sachs analyst hi good morning frans abhijeet and leandro thanks for taking my questions i have two please my first one is i appreciate you ve not given us 2022 guidance but i m just trying to going to get your impressions and thoughts on the pulls and pushes as you head into next year on one hand looking at the order backlog i think this is the highest i remember seeing it and i followed your stock for a while so clearly there are some real revenue opportunities as we move into next year at the same time i think frans you were quoted on bloomberg this morning talking about wage inflation and i suspect some of the inflationary cost pressures on the supply chain side also continued to bite into next year so my first question is really kind of your degree of confidence both on the revenue and the mid term margin outlook as it as it translates into 2022 and maybe what are the incremental upside and downside risks that you see at this stage and my follow up i m going to ask it now so we don t have to go back and forth but just a quick word on the failure rate that you re observing at the moment with the dreamstation as you go through the repair and replace process how far is it off the initial figures you had given us and then any timeline for the voc studies if you can give us an update on that thank you frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee hi good morning veronika 2022 guidance right where shall i start order book indeed very promising underpins already significant part of revenue for next year innovation lineup very strong i would argue strongest in a long time and that also bodes well and we expect to continue to rack up good orders also on the consumer side we think we are well positioned then i think we need to take into account comparables i mean year on year comparison first half of this year strong comparable revenue growth that makes the year on year comparison in a bit more challenging then we need to take into account that the sleep business will only resume with revenue coming through in the second half as we complete the field action on the recall so therefore you have quite a few puts and takes in constructing the revenue forecast and we said in the press release that as we work through these headwinds we resume our upward trajectory on growth right we have not been more precise i think we should do that only at the end of the year but clearly at the second half of the year we want to be there right on the trajectory detailing out the first half of the year we d like to to keep that in our pocket for a moment as we do more calculations as we get closer to it then we also said we will have margin expansion next year and despite inflationary pressures we feel confident that we can drive margin expansion abhijeet referred to if you would exclude the sleep impact that actually we saw a 500 basis points profit expansion so we feel that seeing the forest for the trees has been a little bit difficult this year but that there is good underlying margin expansion possible and that we will see that come through next year even when taking into account some of these inflationary pressures now let s unpack that a bit we think that the shipping issues are not going to be structural we think that labor increases are probably a tad higher than this year and therefore something to be reckoned with we think that the semiconductor shortages will abate by second quarter so we need to be quite tactical on how we make our longer term contracts and we are doing that we have already started increasing prices especially also on the consumer side and passing on some of the temporary cost adders such as home shipping to our customers where possible now to make a long story short i hope that your takeaway of this story is that we are confident our ability to offset pressures productivity gains will continue and that we will get back on finally we get back on our cash i should say that we communicated to capital markets day in in 2019 okay then a question related to the sleep apnea devices you know complaint ratio has gone up post the announcement that is not unusual as people are made aware of the recall and put in their own complaint the nature and the severity of the complaints has not materially changed from before the field safety notice which reassures us that there is not suddenly very bad situations coming out of the woodwork no deaths has been reported we said that earlier the failure rate as a percentage has not materially gone up but as we previously reported the failure rate as a percentage of units shipped that doesn t make any sense now because we have stopped shipping devices since in may as we prioritize the production capacity for the remediation so therefore it s better to look at the complaints versus the units shipped in a cumulated manner cumulatively over the last years and we are still in very very very low failure rates yeah hundreds of what s the expression there beyond far below the decimal point let s take an action point to see what we can report to you guys in a written manner then on the the studies we ve always said that we want to create a body of evidence by further testing when we went out in april and may it was on a relatively narrow set of data taking a worst case scenario as to potential patient risk that is what you are required to do from a regulatory point of view in the meantime we have many more units out for test and we have involved more test houses and also third party specialists experts who can give their opinion about the compounds whether they are toxic or not so characterizing the risk in a much more sophisticated manner in july we said that that would probably take at least three months so august september october so we are getting beyond at the end of that three months forecast it may be having some delay but we still expect it to be the course of the fourth quarter and then we aim to share that as transparently as we can of course we first need to go to the regulators before we can go to public markets but we see advantage in being open and transparent to this also as it influences the assessment of litigation i mean we fully realize that investors and analysts find it difficult to assess the litigation risk but we don t want to add to speculation and therefore we think waiting for these test results will be the best way to go forward to help you assess the risk that we believe will be there i hope veronika that that answers your questions veronika dubajova goldman sachs analyst that was very comprehensive frans thanks can i just confirm as you think about 2022 i mean i guess you have the mid term guidance out there right which is the 5 to 6 sales growth and the 60 bps to 80 bps adjusted ebita margin improvement would you expect 2022 to be in that range already frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee well i ve tried to say that we need to grow into that range rather than be there on january 1st veronika dubajova goldman sachs analyst understood ok that s great thank you guys operator the next question comes from hassan al wakeel from barclays please state your question hassan al wakeel barclays analyst thank you for taking my questions i have two please so firstly following up on your commentary on 2022 and more specifically on connected care we ve seen a more meaningful impact to margins this year in connected care and i wonder how you think about this evolving into next year do you think the business can grow the top line or demonstrate margin expansion albeit from a low base as the recall continues to weigh for a significant chunk of 2022 and then secondly in d t do you expect a sequential acceleration of growth into q4 based on the current phasing of orders or could the supply constraints mean that this is now unlikely and then also what about 2022 are you confident about 5 to 6 growth in d t thank you frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee yeah let s start with connected care there we will have the complexity of comparables as the sleep business was affected from the second quarter onwards so obviously as the sleep business resumes we should see a very strong growth in the second half of the year i m looking at abhijit whether you want to say anything more to that abhijit bhattacharya executive vice president chief financial officer no i think i mentioned it earlier as well overall if you look at the connected care margins excluding the sleep and respiratory care business they are holding despite the lower sales on the back of tough comparables last year and the whole supply chain situation so i think we ve made a good step in margin and we will return to growth and q4 margins will be good as well given that it s a big quarter so similar to what you said frans and on the d t q4 yeah q3 was as we said already double digit growth we expect it to be in the similar range maybe slightly up but again depends a bit on the supply chain volatility current outlook is it will be a bit stronger than q3 hassan al wakeel barclays analyst and 2022 for d t based on the current order book frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee yeah 2022 will also be a strong year so the 5 to 6 is very doable given where we are in our order book at this point hassan al wakeel barclays analyst that s helpful and if i can just ask a follow up on sleep can you talk about the impact that you re seeing on the mask side of the business i remember this wasn t a significant impact in q2 and i wonder if that s changed in q3 frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee yeah we have focused our sales force more on masks now and of course on the other products that we still have whereas you would expect a decline in masks commensurate with the decline in systems actually that decline has been much less suggesting that we were able to sell masks on a stand alone basis into the installed base and i think that s great we didn t call it out in our report here because it s not that significant but still we are pleased that we have been able to ship more masks than you would normally assume hassan al wakeel barclays analyst perfect thanks a lot operator the next question comes from lisa clive from bernstein please state your question lisa clive bernstein analyst hi two qestions both on the recall you got fda approval for repairing the devices and also other international approval regulatory approval was that in line with your expectations in terms of the timing when it happened in september i m just trying to understand why you re still estimating that two thirds of the devices will be replaced is this just the most cost effective approach and then from a business perspective could you just give us an estimate of what percent of your cpap machine sales are generally replacement devices because i imagine if you are sending out a lot of ds2 s that the replacement cycle will be a bit lower in the next few years and then just last question on the voc testing what sort of information will you be disclosing is it things like how long the foam may release vocs when it s breaking down is it three days is it three weeks is it three months i m just trying to get a bit of a better understanding in terms of what kind of information we are likely to see next month frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee okay hi lisa the approvals were by and large in line with expectations maybe a tad slower in coming there were a ton of questions that we have to work through and also the paperwork to document all these processes was enormous and to a degree still is but we are out of the gate now and i think that s what matters and you have seen some of the numbers coming through already so maybe it could have been a few weeks faster but it is what it is the repair and replace cycle or repair and replace proportion is still roughly in line with what we signaled earlier we felt it was a bit too early to count on benefit there it could happen but for a repair process you need the return flow of units affected that return flow takes time to organize more and once we are fully underway with the circular model there we will be in a better position to tell you the quality of the units that are returned whether they are in fact worthwhile to repair you could argue that hey you know if a patient has unit in bad shape you should give back a unit of equal status but that s not how it works right you need to as we touch the unit and the repair protocol is classified as a remanufacturing process as opposed to a field repair that also means that high quality standards applied to the repair process and therefore not all units can be reworked so to speak that s taken as an assumption already into the provision so i m not flagging you a new risk but that is why we are cautious to already cry victory over a better repair replace ratio as perhaps you would have hoped for moreover as we don t want patients to wait we are able to produce ds2 dreamstation 2s we are basically shipping dreamstation 2 units into the field to get underway with this whole cycle right and therefore you should assume that in the early months of the repair replace program you will see an overweight of new whereas later on when that return path is well underway we will see more beneficial ratio of repair and hence we cannot give you more information at this time then the tests priority number one is to characterize the compounds and try to determine the level of toxicity obviously that s very important to the patients and to the doctors and to the regulators so that is where we are putting a lot of effort in furthermore we d like to understand how does the degradation process take place over time how does ozone effectuate that etc etc i think that is what you can can expect as i mentioned earlier we will prioritize of course communication to regulators and doctors but we are fully cognizant of the importance for you to be able to assess the health risks and therefore the litigation scope and i hope that we are in a much better place to help you assess that in a more reasonable manner later this quarter okay very helpful thank you operator the next question comes from scott bardo from berenberg please state your question scott bardo berenberg analyst yes thank you very much taking my questions the first one please just on again the sleep and respiratory franchise i think last quarter you provided an update that there were some 2 2 million active device registrations for dreamstation for your field action forgive me if i missed the update this quarter but i wonder if you could help us understand whether that s trending up or down just to get a sense of continuity and furthermore linked to this question please again on your broader study set that you are conducting currently can you help us understand the potential ramifications for this update could it indeed be enough to change the fda s current recommendations on dreamstation is that the sort of magnitude the data package we should expect some comments there would be appreciated and second question please if i may so thank you for the comments about sort of returning to your communicated trajectory of course this year we re not seeing much in the way of growth or margin expansion i think for obvious reasons but what i d like to understand is do you envisage any catch up effects for the margin and growth lost this year or are we actually going to be growing philips from a lower base now thank you frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee yeah hi scott on the sleep registered units we are currently at 3 3 million registered devices that does not mean that all registered devices are qualified devices for repair and replace because we basically after they are registered need to determine whether they actually have been used or whether they have just been taken out of the cupboard and put on the registration list but were not in active use the study set and you asked that in conjunction with will it be enough for the fda to change their view i need to understand a bit better what your question is because if you read the fda advisory on their website they actually say continue to use contact your physician consult your physician and then decide what to do so in fact the fda is not on the same page as philips field safety notice where we said basically stop use then consult your doctor and then decide what to do there is this discrepancy between the fda advisory and our own advisory it is something that doctors and patients have flagged as something that they would like to see aligned let s say we were of course the ones that put the advisory out in the first place and then we are not doctors we cannot do the risk benefit analysis as doctors and regulators can do so the fda came to a slightly different conclusion as to continued use whereas we said worst case scenario was a stop use scenario so there is that discrepancy out there already for quite some months actually the new data set that we are getting we cannot anticipate what is going to be the outcome of that right i mean if otherwise i would publish it today so we will need to get all the expert opinions in as to the nature of the compounds potential toxicity of the compounds and therefore what potentially the health hazard is if you move away from that kind of initial worst case scenario i m afraid we will still have to wait for that study to be published before we can expect also the fda to do their evaluation of that right so it will take a little bit of time then on your question on the trajectory we flagged that we resumed the trajectory we did not indicate a catch up benefit obviously i m ambitious and i would love to do that but with the inflationary pressures that we talked about earlier at this time we signal that we would like to come back to the 60 basis points to 80 basis points but we are not signaling any catch up effect scott bardo berenberg analyst okay thank you frans frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee you re welcome operator the next question comes from julien dormois from exane bnp paribas please state your question julien dormois exane bnp paribas analyst hi good morning frans thanks for taking my questions the first one would relate to the supply chain volatility i think you have stressed that you experienced eur150 million headwinds at the sales level in q3 i was just curious whether you could elaborate on which division is the most impacted by this so if you could detail that for each and every of your three divisions that would be very helpful and the second question relates to a comment you made also about the positive capex trends you see from hospitals would be very keen to get any sort of visibility on whether you believe this is just a recovery to a pre covid situation or whether there is really something structural happening at the hospital level and whether we should expect a stronger market for equipment going forward at least for a couple of years frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee okay abhijit you want to take the first and i ll take the second abhijit bhattacharya executive vice president chief financial officer yeah maybe frans you start with the second question and then i ll get the data i have it but not the exact one frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee sure sure the positive capex trend actually came on the back of quite some slowness in the market in the years before i think on the capital equipment on imaging we know that the installed base is quite aged and old i have heard many hospital systems wanting to build diagnostic centers in the community outside of the main premises of the hospital and that would coincide with a investment cycle that will take a few years rather than only a few months probably the older equipment units will stay in place in the hospital but these more efficient and more patient friendly diagnostic centers that can operate at a lower cost and would potentially also not be affected by a covid breakout seem to be a trend going forward that we recognize in multiple parts of the world so that i think is good news same with ambulatory surgical centers ascs where elective procedures can go in a patient friendly and safer manner for the main hospital campus so we also see quite a few plans there that i would imagine is there for at least the next few years also the backlog of elective procedures points to building more capacity the capex trend in china always a bit higher than the western world will continue there we see a strengthening of local for local rules which basically say that your product needs to be registered with the nmpa as a locally produced product so it does not mean that it has to be a local brand it has to be a company like us who produces it completely local and the nmpa saying it is a local product and then on monitoring and connected care related areas i think we all remember 2019 when we were saying what was flat and you guys challenged us you know when is it not going to be flat anymore well covid was a big accelerator for the inside the monitoring at other care settings is appropriate discharging patients faster with wearable sensors and then using command centers to oversee cohorts of patients remotely leveraging telehealth all of that has come to an acceleration and so basically we see finally this whole vision of connected care coming to fruition if we look at acquisitions like by hotel and capsule both of which are bellwethers for this kind of trend then i can tell you that strong double digit growth is continuing there across the board so we think that connected care will structurally have a higher growth rate going forward and of course in 2022 initially still with some puts and takes due to year on year comparisons but structurally should be at a higher growth rate i look to abhijit whether you have the data abhijit bhattacharya executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so julien just to be clear the eur150 million we talked about is the let s say the higher impact on the supply chain volatility right so out of that about eur20 million was personal health because some of it was already factored into the plan the unfactored element was about 20 and the rest was roughly evenly split between connected care and diagnosis and treatment with maybe connected care slightly higher than diagnosis and treatment julien dormois exane bnp paribas analyst okay thanks very much guys frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee yeah patient monitoring and idp in fact all three businesses are high profit businesses that were affected which is unfortunate julien dormois exane bnp paribas analyst yeah thank you frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee go ahead operator operator the next question comes from patrick wood from bank of america please state your question patrick wood bank of america analyst perfect thank you very much i ve got two please one just more top down i guess on china overall we got a lot on the news about different macroeconomic things happening we obviously saw the gdp data i m just curious what you guys are seeing given you have a huge business there from the chinese consumer you obviously have a lot of data and insights as to how the consumer is looking at that market i m just curious for your views there and then the second one just again on the supply chain situation i think it was eur150 million primarily in september i think that was and thank you very much abhijit for giving a sense for the personal health and the implication for q4 i mean should that mean that we should take that overall outside of just the personal health that eur150 million and say the q4 impact could be double or something like that i e eur300 million i m just trying to understand if it was just september that did the eur150 million is it a larger impact in q4 or is there a functional situation where the supply chains are getting a little bit easier actually as you guys have managed to work through some of the blockages there thanks frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee yeah let s not keep that hanging because the q4 issue is about eur200 million estimated abhijit bhattacharya executive vice president chief financial officer correct frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee so let s not have anybody think that it is going to get out of hand eur200 million is bad enough of course but we have mitigation actions in place to avoid a much bigger number there is some volatility around it so you could say eur200 million was for us a kind of a midpoint of some scenarios but shipping should get better gradually abhijit bhattacharya executive vice president chief financial officer and the eur150 million is not all in september bulk of it was in september so you can say two thirds was in september and a third in july august so you saw it accelerating in september frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee okay then on the china your question consumer demand is actually good we see a lot of interest in consumer devices of course we have to tackle local brands that have become stronger we also have seen a reduction of inventory in the channel so sell out has been strong we were hampered by supply constraints due to let s say the issue on components already flagged i think for the fourth quarter we are expecting abhijit are we able to say anything about fourth quarter china abhijit bhattacharya executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i mean like you mentioned order intake was good and i think that will continue also this sales momentum is slightly slower but for ph we continue to have growth so i think that will the trend of q3 will continue into q4 patrick wood bank of america analyst very clear thanks guys thanks for the color frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee you re welcome operator the next question comes from falko friedrichs from deutsche bank please state your question falko friedrichs deutsche bank analyst thanks very much good morning i also have two questions the first one on the product recall and would you be able to provide some feedback from doctors that you re getting doctors that used to prescribe your or still prescribe your sleep apnea products and with them do you sense that there is still a big appetite to definitely stick with philips post to recall or do you rather sense that it can be quite tricky to gain back some of the share you re probably currently losing to your big competitor so some qualitative info would be helpful here and then the second question on your free cash flow we know this that part of the decline was driven by the consumption of provisions most likely for the recall are you able to quantify that for us how much of the provision you released in the third quarter now thank you frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee yeah hi falko we have heard from both doctors as well as from dmes the distributors that they are judging us more on how we handle the situation rather than that it happened in the first place and we hear that doctors appreciate on how we do the communication and support them with intense information they also told us why they like us they for example the informatics applications around sleep devices and the ability to observe trend lines they liked that very much they ve also said that they don t want to end up with a situation where there is only one big supplier right so on the basis of all the feedback we expect to be able to recoup our market share maybe not immediately but over time and we are also planning already in parallel to the remediation a come back plan where we will go out of course with all energy to fight back and to regain and recoup our share then on the free cash flow abhijit abhijit bhattacharya executive vice president chief financial officer yeah for q3 i think we consumed around eur60 million out of the provision so that of course kept the cash flow down a bit in the quarter but like we said year to date for the first half we were well ahead so we remain in line to get to the target for the year excluding of course the cash impact of what we have to spend on the recall falko friedrichs deutsche bank analyst thank you operator the next question comes from james vane tempest from jefferies please state your question james vane tempest jefferies analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my questions firstly you ve lowered the restructuring cost guidance and i think you said expected to be lower next year just wonder if you can provide any more color around this is this because restructuring charges have been pushed back and what would you expect fewer changes are required in the underlying business and my second question is you mentioned sort of growing into the 60 bps to 80 bps margin expansion next year and given the first half comparison which you ve highlighted on the call is it fair to say you re more likely to see that more in the second half of next year thank you abhijit bhattacharya executive vice president chief financial officer so on the restructuring we have not pushed out any restructuring because of course that would impact the productivity programs going forward at the start of the year given the pandemic and let s say the longer term horizon we probably thought we may have to go deeper but with the resumed demand etc and the strong order book we don t need some of that restructuring so therefore it s good that we also bring that the adjusting items down a bit earlier than planned frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee and then on the phasing when veronika asked a question in the beginning i said we have to grow into that trajectory we will not be immediately on that trajectory on january 1 all right so the second half of the year will be stronger than the first half of the year i hope that answers your second question james james vane tempest jefferies analyst thank you operator the next question comes from wim gille from abn amro oddo please state your question wim gille abn amro oddo analyst yes very good morning wim gille abn amro oddo a pretty simple one i think the other segment was quite well this quarter in particular related to the phasing of royalty settlements taking also into account the disentanglement of domestic appliances this quarter can you give us a bit of feeling where we should pitch our adjusted ebita numbers for other going forward so moving more into 2022 is it fair to assume that we will have structurally better adjusted ebita results in other on the back of this thank you abhijit bhattacharya executive vice president chief financial officer yeah wim so what i said about the royalty was it s a phasing between q3 and q4 so overall we have kept costs lower this year and therefore we reduced our guidance by eur30 million lower going forward typically what i do is in q1 i gave a very explicit guidance for the year so i d just request you to be a bit more patient and then we will do all our puts and takes and come back with a view as we start next year wim gille abn amro oddo analyst okay maybe to put it differently then can you remind us what the impact is going to be of the royalty income from domestic appliances on an annualized basis thanks abhijit bhattacharya executive vice president chief financial officer it s going to be plus minus eur60 million or so wim gille abn amro oddo analyst thank you very much operator we have a follow up question from lisa clive of bernstein please state your question lisa clive bernstein analyst hi one follow up on the recall am i correct that every device that s returned for either replacement or repair will actually have its foam tested and if yes would you be able to disclose to us at some point the proportion that show any sign of breakdown once those results are available to you frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee hi lisa every unit that comes back will be photographed and inventorized tested is a big word because we are not necessarily putting millions of devices through a comprehensive test but they will be inspected lisa clive bernstein analyst okay that s clear thanks operator the next question comes from kate kalashnikova from citi please state your question kate kalashnikova citi analyst hi frans abhijit this is kate kalashnikova for imaging diagnostics on one hand the hospitals are under pressure due to covid on another hand your costs are increasing due to supply chain challenges higher logistics costs so how do you think about the net impact of this change and could you also comment on competitive dynamics when it comes to prices frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee yeah hospitals are under pressure but there is also a lot of government money going into shoring up hospitals and expanding the capacity of healthcare right so we should not take this pressure thing too much right i spoke earlier about diagnostic imaging change being built i spoke about strong capex environment a lot of the cost of radiology is actually not equipment but labor and there is a lot of efficiency to be gained in that whole workflow and this is also why the philips informatics solution is so appropriate i mean our radiology command center rocc and the radiology solutions suite can drive productivity in radiology centers by over 30 which is fantastic if you think about having more patients that need to be diagnosed etc so overall i look with optimism toward the the market there is enough to be done what you will see is that many hospitals will buy good enough rather than the most super duper machine it s all about diagnostic confidence and efficiency rather than only features what we observe with the spectral ct 7500 is that it gives a confident diagnosis in record time this is very important reconstruction time is very fast and given that you get spectral information without having to pre determine whether you want conventional or spectral imaging is a huge benefit the fact that our mri is helium free and doesn t need extensive quench pipes in the real estate is great especially when now new diagnostic imaging centers are going to be built that you can build basically structurally with lower real estate cost right and so some of our competitors continue to emphasize the academic centers as the only determining factor but i can tell you that most c suites are very focused on on productivity instead so overall we think that we can hold our own in terms of competitive position and yeah i think on pricing health economics play more and more a role and then it is important about lifetime cost and rather than only initial price so i think we can maintain our position there kate kalashnikova citi analyst thank you for that and as a follow up the proportion of your d t sales in china is produced in china currently frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee yeah quite a lot already i mentioned that the criterion is registered as a local product with the nmpa so it s not just are you let s say making it locally but is it also correctly labeled as a local product we are in line more or less in line with our competitors kate kalashnikova citi analyst any plans to increase it further frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee yeah somewhere around the 40 or so on a formal basis goes up rapidly as we understood that this was important so we have been on a path already to localize manufacturing and increase the local labeling the nmpa takes quite some time to process these requests so we are a bit dependent on the regulator there but otherwise i think we are on a good path forward kate kalashnikova citi analyst perfect thank you operator the last question is a follow up question from veronika dubajova from goldman sachs please go ahead ma am veronika dubajova goldman sachs analyst hi guys just a quick one follow up actually on the china topic i know you ve mentioned some softness in order momentum in q3 just curious if you ve seen improvements and that as you move through the third quarter and if you can give us sort of a first look on how the china order momentum is progressing in the fourth quarter and your best guess for when you might see a return to normalized order growth in this market thank you frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee we actually i think flagged that we had mid single digit order growth in china we flagged some revenue delays also in china partly also by the processing of all these hipaa regulations that s i think where we stand so it was more revenue recognition that was a bit slowed for the order momentum as such anything else abhijit abhijit bhattacharya executive vice president chief financial officer no i think last year i think the comparables in q4 we had 17 order intake growth so that will have some impact but in general i think china is slower than it used to be but as soon as the hipaa guidelines get clear though you will see momentum picking up there veronika dubajova goldman sachs analyst and any timeline for that is that q1 22 is a realistic expecation abhijit bhattacharya executive vice president chief financial officer very difficult to say veronika it s a thing that the government is working through and of course they see also the impact of things that are stuck in the pipeline so we ll have to wait and see veronika dubajova goldman sachs analyst okay understood thank you guys operator thank you mr van houten and mr bhattacharya that was the last question please continue frans van houten chief executive officer chairman of the board of management and the executive committee okay well thank you for all your questions let me summarize by expressing my conviction that we are going to be on a path upwards and work through the challenges that you have asked numerous questions about i do believe that the end goal of high teens profitability by 2025 remains intact we have a competitive set of innovations we are going to resume our growth and margin expansion and we hope that we will have let s say these sessions with you to go deeper on those questions as soon as possible in the meantime

coal fired electricity generation climbed this year in the u s for the first time since the obama administration spurred by spiking natural gas prices a setback for the biden climate agenda and a sign that the president s drilling crackdown may be backfiring the u s energy information administration said monday that electricity generated by coal fired plants is expected to jump by 22 in 2021 over last year s levels for the first year over year increase since 2014 the reason the rising cost of natural gas which began climbing in april and hit a 13 year high this month fueled by pent up pandemic demand that has overtaken production the u s electric power sector has been generating more electricity from coal fired power plants this year as a result of significantly higher natural gas prices and relatively stable coal prices the eia said in its october short term energy outlook given that natural gas emits 50 to 60 less carbon dioxide in combustion than coal the uptick in coal fired generation represents a move in the wrong direction for president biden reducing greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change is the cornerstone of his agenda coal is also making a comeback in china and europe the transition to green energy has exacerbated an energy crunch in some european nations it s no secret that the cleanest most reliable fuel nuclear was murdered by the greens clarice feldman said in an oct 10 op ed in the american thinker then natural gas the second cleanest became their target so now many places are desperate for coal the dirtiest option the eia predicted that the u s coal bump would be short lived given that utilities have retired about 30 of their coal generation capacity since 2010 no coal fired plants have been built since 2013 for 2022 we forecast that u s coal fired generation will decline about 5 in response to continuing retirements of generating capacity at coal power plants and slightly lower natural gas prices said the agency the independent data and analysis arm of the energy department u s emissions have declined steadily since 2005 thanks largely to the transition from coal to natural gas in power plant generation fueled by abundant domestic supplies unleashed by the shale revolution and driven by hydraulic fracturing or fracking the environmental protection agency reported in april 2020 that overall greenhouse gas emissions dropped by 10 from 2005 to 2018 and that power sector emissions fell by 27 since taking office in january however mr biden has sought to phase out fossil fuels in favor of solar and wind energy his administration has discouraged capital investment in drilling still global demand for natural gas is surging as nations rebound from pandemic shutdowns myron ebell director of the center for energy and environment at the free market competitive enterprise institute said the administration s policies have handicapped the energy market faced with higher demand for heating electricity and gasoline this winter shale producers would normally be able to respond by increasing output within six months mr ebell said but the actions already taken by the biden harris administration have made investors and producers unwilling to make major investments on drilling new wells when long term prospects for return on investment look so unpromising on thursday the white house released its road map to a climate resilient economy which includes mobilizing private and public institutions to address climate related financial risk if this year has shown us anything it s that climate change poses an ongoing urgent and systemic risk to our economy and to the lives and livelihoods of everyday americans and we must act now white house national climate adviser gina mccarthy told reporters western energy alliance president kathleen sgamma warned that the biden backed infrastructure bill includes the same energy policies that are threatening high energy prices and shortages this winter in europe in particular the biden administration is suppressing investment in natural gas by overregulating and denying access to capital ms sgamma said producers would very much like to help bring down high prices by investing in new production but they re being denied capital mr biden signaled his opposition to fossil fuels early on by canceling the keystone xl pipeline and freezing new drilling permits on federal lands the securities and exchange commission last month began pressuring companies to disclose more information about their climate risks the sec is planning climate change disclosure regulations that have the goal of reorienting financial markets to place climate change considerations over market return ms sgamma said this is an extension of shareholder and climate change activism that have pressured banks and other financial institutions to drop oil and natural gas from their portfolios she cited bnp paribas and bank of the west as examples of investors that have publicly announced no further financing of fossil fuels about 80 of u s energy generation comes from coal petroleum and natural gas but u s natural gas prices have been more volatile than coal prices so the cost of natural gas often determines the relative share of generation provided by natural gas and coal the eia analysis said between 2015 and 2020 the cost of natural gas delivered to electric generators remained relatively low and stable the eia said this year however natural gas prices have been much higher than in recent years the year to date delivered cost of natural gas to u s power plants has averaged 4 93 per million british thermal units btu more than double last year s price stan dempsey president of the colorado mining association said the increased reliance on coal is a reminder that low cost electricity generated from coal continues to serve americans as the most reliable source of energy it isn t too late to reverse the trend of prematurely closing coal fired power plants and coal mines especially when electric utilities are scrambling to secure energy needed for the upcoming winter mr dempsey said this article is based in part on wire service reports valerie

the u s food and drug administration is poised to clear the use of a covid 19 booster from a different manufacturer than the one that supplied a patient s original inoculation according to people familiar with the matter the fda is still considering the scope of the measure including whether to allow the widespread mixing and matching of vaccines or whether to narrow the parameters of use the people said speaking on condition of anonymity before any announcement the fda declined to comment and it s not clear when a decision will be announced allowing mixing and matching would be the agency s first such clearance for covid 19 vaccines advertisement the scope remains under discussion and may come with restrictions but the recommendation is expected to apply across all vaccine brands for instance that means someone who originally received johnson johnson s one dose vaccine could get a booster shot from moderna inc or pfizer inc and biontech which is based on a different technology or someone who received an initial two shots of the moderna vaccine could get a pfizer biontech booster mixing and matching would enable providers to stock fewer vaccines and more easily provide boosters to patients the new york times earlier reported that the fda is planning to allow mixing and matching preliminary results of a u s government sponsored trial found that mixing covid vaccines produces as much or more antibodies as using the same shot as a booster the findings were discussed at an fda advisory panel meeting on friday although no formal vote was taken many committee members said mixing and matching should be allowed advertisement bloomberg reporter robert langreth contributed to this report

workers students and young people in australia have issued strong statements of support for more than 10 000 john deere workers in the united states who are carrying out a courageous strike the stoppage is part of a wave of industrial action in the us and internationally as workers increasingly break out of the mechanisms that have been used by governments the employers and the unions to suppress the class struggle during the past forty years while john deere s stock price has doubled since 2019 on the back of record profits the company intends to reward workers with a pay rise that is well below the rate of inflation and attacks conditions workers have overwhelmingly rejected this rotten deal pushed by the united auto workers uaw union which is working to isolate and defeat the struggle in australia the unions together with the corporate media have said nothing about the john deere stoppage they are seeking to keep workers in the dark and have abruptly halted a series of strikes by truck drivers dockworkers and others before ramming through sell out deals when workers in australia were apprised of the john deere strike by the wsws and the socialist equality party they immediately recognised its international significance and close connection to their own struggles the following resolution was passed unanimously at a meeting of socialist equality party electoral members on sunday this meeting of sep australia electoral members held on october 17 2021 gives its full support to the 10 000 john deere agricultural and construction equipment workers who went on strike last thursday for the first time in 35 years over 90 percent of workers voted to reject a union backed agreement which cut real wages and put an end to pensions for all workers hired after november effectively creating a three tier workforce after the united auto workers uaw accepted a two tier system in 1997 the uaw is attempting to isolate the strike refusing to allow strike action by 3 500 dana incorporated auto parts workers despite repeated statements by workers in favour of a strike this action is part of a global resurgence of the class struggle it includes coles warehouse workers in australia who voted overwhelmingly to reject union management deals that likewise attack workers conditions as well as workers at general mills and mccormick foods who courageously struck for weeks before being sold out by the united workers union we fully endorse the decision of john deere workers to form a rank and file committee in order to conduct the strike outside of the hands of the unions we call on other workers to form similar committees as part of the international workers alliance of rank and file committees kirsten burns a worker from adelaide south australia a former auto manufacturing hub wrote as more than 10 000 autoworkers at 14 john deere plants in the united states battle the multinational corporation in a wage and benefits dispute the union that represents them the uaw is working hand in glove with the corporation to shut down the strike presenting an agreement to john deere workers the union falsely claimed that it contained economic benefits for the workers when the opposite is the case the agreement was soundly rejected with strike action called for the first time in over thirty five years as john deere plans to bring in scab workers the union is working to isolate the struggle and see it defeated workers have formed the john deere workers rank and file committee independent of the union as a first step to break from the conscious agents of corporate management i support the initiative of the john deere workers and urge the millions of auto workers internationally to join with those in the us struggle to set up their own rank and file committees in a common offensive of the working class against the attacks taking place now and against those to come zach diotte zach diotte a student and former windmill factory worker in sydney wrote we are watching intently as are workers internationally the workers movements brewing in the united states you are courageously fighting both the john deere corporation and the treacherous uaw and are leading the way forward in the workers struggle by establishing a rank and file committee you have many friends not just in the factories of illinois but the world over whether your demands are met or not you must fight the stand that you as well as the workers at dana and volvo put up will inspire and set precedents for the coming struggles every show of strength by you is a symbol to the working class of its power but you cannot fight in isolation spread the word far and wide and link up with your class brothers and sisters if unified the working class will move mountains the postal workers rank and file committee wrote the pwrfc fully supports the 10 000 workers at john deere in the us who walked off the job after overwhelmingly rejecting an agreement pushed by management and the united auto workers the agreement amounts to a significant cut in real wages and would eliminate pensions for new hires the uaw s attempt to ram through a sell out deal at john deere is a familiar situation for many workers for decades unions all over the world have lined up with management to sabotage every attempt by workers to fight for their interests at australia post and throughout the country the unions have enforced the destruction of tens of thousands of permanent full time jobs now casual and contract workers are increasingly forced to work for up to 14 hours a day as many as seven days a week if they raise issues of safety or take a day off to rest their contract can be immediately terminated the pathetic 275 a week strike pay which you will not receive for another two weeks is not enough you should be getting your full pay from the union strike fund for the length of the strike the uaw is attempting to isolate you and by applying economic pressure force you back under the company s terms the unions have become transformed into pro company organisations they no longer fight for workers interests in even the smallest way in this context the decision by john deere workers to establish their own rank and file committee is extremely important it is only through such committees operating independently of the trade union bureaucracy that the struggle can go forward attempts by management and the union to keep workers in the dark must be fought all workers must be fully informed about what is going on in the negotiations open democratic discussion must be welcomed and encouraged the john deere workers rank and file committee will provide information and a perspective not only to john deere workers but throughout the us and around the world john deere workers should draw strength and courage from the knowledge that they are part of a worldwide fightback of the working class we support your struggle and call on our brothers and sisters across australia and around the world to join us in this critical fight

police are investigating whether some bystanders recorded the assault on a commuter train in suburban philadelphia philadelphia a man charged with raping a woman on a commuter train just outside of philadelphia harassed her for more than 40 minutes while multiple people held up their phones to seemingly record the assault without intervening authorities said more than two dozen train stops passed as the man harassed groped and eventually raped the woman the police chief for the southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority said at a news conference monday police do not believe a single witness on the train dialed 911 they are investigating whether some bystanders filmed the assault both the man and woman got on the train at the same stop wednesday night in north philadelphia officers pulled the man off of the woman at the last stop they responded within about three minutes of a 911 call from a transportation authority employee authorities said what we want is everyone to be angry and disgusted and to be resolute about making the system safer septa police chief thomas j nestel iii said at the news conference arrest records show fiston ngoy 35 was charged with rape and related offenses the affidavit of arrest for ngoy detailed times of the assault including that during those 40 minutes the woman appears to repeatedly push ngoy away nestel would not give an approximate number of witnesses and it was unclear from the affidavit how many passengers were present for those 40 minutes authorities have not released the surveillance video i can tell you that people were holding their phone up in the direction of this woman being attacked he said elizabeth jeglic a psychology professor at the john jay college of criminal justice researches sexual violence prevention she said if people feel uncomfortable physically intervening there are other options like calling the police when we have multiple people people don t necessarily intervene she said however more recent research actually suggests that looking at video footage of more extreme circumstances that up to 90 of cases we do see people intervening so it was actually somewhat of an aberration in this case that somebody did not step forward to help this individual superintendent timothy bernhardt of the upper darby police department has said surveillance footage showed other riders were on the train and someone should have done something messages for bernhardt were left monday the new york times reported that bernhardt said that people who recorded the attack and failed to intervene could possibly be charged but that would be up to the delaware county district attorney s office to determine there were no calls made to 911 in philadelphia nestel said police were still waiting for delaware county 911 which covers the last two train stops to determine if it received any calls investigators said in the affidavit that ngoy sat down next to the woman about a minute after he boarded the train car shortly after 9 15 p m the video shows her pushing him away multiple times until he is seen ripping her pants down at about 9 52 p m bernhardt said officers arrived at the 69th street terminal on the market frankford line the busiest route on septa around 10 p m a septa employee who was in the vicinity as the train went past called police to report that something wasn t right with a woman aboard the train bernhardt said septa police waiting at the next stop found the woman and arrested ngoy who they had pulled off of the woman she was taken to a hospital according to the court documents the woman told police that ngoy ignored her pleas to go away ngoy claimed in his statement to police that he knew the victim but couldn t remember her name and said the encounter was consensual ngoy who listed his last address as a homeless shelter remained in custody on 180 000 bail his initial court appearance is scheduled for oct 25 court records show he had not requested a public defender as of monday septa issued a statement calling it a horrendous criminal act and urged anyone witnessing such a thing to report it to authorities by calling 911 pressing an emergency button on every train car or using the authorities emergency safety app there were other people on the train who witnessed this horrific act and it may have been stopped sooner if a rider called 911 the authority said ___

glasgow broader energy issues are having major impacts on global economies energy shortages and supply chain issues played havoc with chinese gdp china s gdp report yesterday showed growth in the economy slowed during the september quarter the problems in china are far reaching and are putting upward pressure on inflation seen by investors as a risk leading to central banks tightening their monetary policy settings in the us the clean energy revolution could take a hit with the country increasing the use of coal in order to generate electricity it is the first time since 2014 the us has made this move the uk is also restarting coal fired power stations due to the elevated cost of natural gas and low output from wind farms what does this mean is talk of being net zero by 2050 all bluff it is unlikely that is the case and even our politicians will come to some sort of agreement but it does highlight the difficulty in the transition to clean energy facilities especially when you see stories exposing the myth of how clean electric vehicles are this opinion piece by jurica dujmovic for marketwatch suggests although evs do not release carbon dioxide during their use their production exerts the same toll on the environment as that of conventional cars while the recycling of lithium ion batteries poses unique challenges lithium ion batteries are bulkier and take more space than their traditional counterpart lead acid batteries to make matters worse they re highly flammable and even explosive if dismantled incorrectly paypal nasdaq pypl eyes retail investment market paypal is looking to make a move into the growing retail investment market which saw 10 million new investors in the first half of 2021 but is it the right move for the payment giant according to freedom finance europe head of investment research maxim manturov this move could be successful but will no doubt attract regulatory scrutiny from the sec and have flow on effects the us securities and exchange commission sec has expressed concern about the growing popularity of securities markets accompanying the explosion in retail investing via applications manturov said these reservations could slow the approval process if paypal decides to partner with an existing brokerage firm meanwhile sec chairman gary gensler has stated that his agency is considering a ban on payment for order flow pfof which is the primary source of revenue for robinhood and many of its competitors pfof enables these brokers to eliminate visible transaction fees which they use as their key marketing tool of course paypal s primary business is still going strong with record payments last year and other growth accelerators in the pipeline total paypal or tpv payments increased by roughly a third on an annual basis in 2020 paypal s net payments in the second quarter of 2021 were almost 311 billion up 41 year over year thanks to more than 3 74 billion transactions processed during that time manturov said based on these figures paypal shows no signs of slowing down as a result of the post covid 19 economy the payment processor anticipates an increase in active users of approximately 50 million in 2021 and annual revenue of approximately us 25 5 billion which is significantly higher than the us 21 4 billion estimated by analysts when the pandemic hit isolated consumers had no choice but to shop online essentially a move into retail investment could bring extra scrutiny but shouldn t hurt paypal s underlying business particularly in a post pandemic world today the vast majority of consumers say that even after the pandemic they will continue to shop online because it is more convenient easier and saves time it is also worth noting that the acquisition of paidly a buy now pay later bnpl platform is a reliable strategic step manturov said bnpl is important both as a convenient payment method and a steppingstone to developing a bilateral payment platform paypal is also expanding its presence in europe in two ways its business debit partnership with mastercard nyse ma has expanded to four more european countries belgium finland the netherlands and portugal and euronet worldwide epay will use the paypal qr code as a selling solution at its points of sale the paypal business debit mastercard introduced in the united states in 2003 is now available in 11 european countries according to the company paypal business customers can now spend money in their paypal accounts at over 52 million mastercard locations worldwide these criteria indicate that if it enters the retail
