jin ding china daily after a strong rebound last year the world economy is entering a challenging 2022 the advanced economies have recovered rapidly thanks to big stimulus packages and rapid progress with vaccination but many developing countries continue to struggle the spread of new variants amid large inequalities in vaccination rates elevated food and commodity prices volatile asset markets the prospect of policy tightening in the united states and other advanced economies and continued geopolitical tensions provide a challenging backdrop for developing countries as the world bank s global economic prospects report published today highlights the global context will also weigh on china s outlook in 2022 by dampening export performance a key growth driver last year following a strong 8 percent cyclical rebound in 2021 the world bank expects growth in china to slow to 5 1 percent in 2022 closer to its potential the sustainable growth rate of output at full capacity indeed growth in the second half of 2021 was below this level and so our forecast assumes a modest amount of policy loosening although we expect momentum to pick up our outlook is subject to domestic in addition to global downside risks renewed domestic covid 19 outbreaks including the new omicron variant and other highly transmittable variants could require more broad based and longer lasting restrictions leading to larger disruptions in economic activity a severe and prolonged downturn in the real estate sector could have significant economy wide reverberations in the face of these headwinds china s policymakers should nonetheless keep a steady hand our latest china economic update argues that the old playbook of boosting domestic demand through investment led stimulus will merely exacerbate risks in the real estate sector and reap increasingly lower returns as china s stock of public infrastructure approaches its saturation point instead to achieve sustained growth china needs to stick to the challenging path of rebalancing its economy along three dimensions first the shift from external demand to domestic demand and from investment and industry led growth to greater reliance on consumption and services second a greater role for markets and the private sector in driving innovation and the allocation of capital and talent and third the transition from a high to a low carbon economy none of these rebalancing acts are easy however as the china economic update points out structural reforms could help reduce the trade offs involved in transitioning to a new path of high quality growth first fiscal reforms could aim to create a more progressive tax system while boosting social safety nets and spending on health and education this would help lower precautionary household savings and thereby support the rebalancing toward domestic consumption while also reducing income inequality among households second following tightening anti monopoly provisions aimed at digital platforms and a range of restrictions imposed on online consumer services the authorities could consider shifting their attention to remaining barriers to market competition more broadly to spur innovation and productivity growth a further opening up of the protected services sector for example could improve access to high quality services and support the rebalancing toward high value service jobs a special focus of the world bank report eliminating remaining restrictions on labor mobility by abolishing the hukou china s system of household registration for all urban areas would equally support the growth of vibrant service economies in china s largest cities third the wider use of carbon pricing for example through an expansion of the scope and tightening of the emissions trading system rules as well as power sector reforms to encourage the penetration and nationwide trade and dispatch of renewables would not only generate environmental benefits but also contribute to china s economic transformation to a more sustainable and innovation based growth model in addition a more robust corporate and bank resolution framework would contribute to mitigating moral hazards thereby reducing the trade offs between monetary policy easing and financial risk management addressing distortions in the access to credit reflected in persistent spreads between private and state borrowers could support the shift to more innovation driven private sector led growth productivity growth in china during the past four decades of reform and opening up has been private sector led the scope for future productivity gains through the diffusion of modern technologies and practices among smaller private companies remains large realizing these gains will require a level playing field with state owned enterprises while the latter have played an instrumental role during the pandemic to stabilize employment deliver key services and in some cases close local government budget gaps their ability to drive the next phase of growth is questionable given lower profits and productivity growth rates in the past in 2022 the authorities will face a significantly more challenging policy environment they will need to remain vigilant and ready to recalibrate financial and monetary policies to ensure the difficulties in the real estate sector don t spill over into broader economic distress recent policy loosening suggests the policymakers are well aware of these risks however in aiming to keep growth on a steady path close to potential they will need to be similarly alert to the risk of accumulating ever greater levels of corporate and local government debt the transition to high quality growth will require economic rebalancing toward consumption services and green investments if the past is any guide to the future the reliance on markets and private sector initiative is china s best bet to achieve the required structural

a coalition of st louis area community groups has withdrawn its opposition to the proposed merger of the holding companies of first mid bank trust and st louis based jefferson bank and trust saying an agreement reached with first mid will benefit low and moderate income residents the pact comes nearly three months after the st louis equal housing and community reinvestment alliance slehcra and two other consumer advocacy groups opposed the merger they alleged a pattern in which mattoon illinois based first mid made loans to minority borrowers and communities at a rate less than half their peers in multiple markets including the st louis area first mid denied the charges saying it was firmly committed to the principles of fair lending talks between slehcra and first mid resulted in a three year agreement announced tuesday in which the bank commits to reaching goals for consumer and small business lending in minority and lower income areas slehcra did not put a total dollar figure on first mid s commitments because of how the agreement is structured but said it includes 120 million in direct financial contributions it s among a dozen or so agreements the group has reached with banks in the st louis area or those with a presence here without our advocacy and our engagement with first mid these changes and commitments in communities that have been left out and underserved by mainstream financial services would not happen said elisabeth risch slehcra s co chair joe dively chairman and ceo of first mid bancshares inc the bank s parent company said there are parts of the community benefits agreement that would have been implemented without slehcra s involvement and many items were already in process before we first met dively said in an email that there was give and take in the negotiations with slehcra we are delighted to have the community benefits agreement in place and will continue to keep the work going to make an impact in the markets we serve he said the federal reserve board makes the final decision on the merger the seven page community benefits agreement includes at least two new service locations in the st louis and the champaign illinois market areas located in low and moderate income areas and minority communities the bank also committed to maintaining current branches in those areas target lending goals for consumer mortgage applications and originations to minority borrowers and those who lives in low and moderate income areas the bank will hire community mortgage loan officers in the st louis and champaign markets who are focused on communities of color and low and moderate income communities target lending goals for small business loans to low and moderate income communities as well as increasing financing opportunities to minority and women owned small businesses the bank will also provide 100 000 in small business loan subsidies to small businesses in low and moderate income and minority communities first mid agreeing to target community development loans and investments at 2 of the bank s asset size including providing 150 000 annually in federal community reinvestment act eligible donations that will increase by 5 each year agreements to increase racial and ethnic diversity within the staff leaders and board of directors of the bank commemorating the civil rights history of jefferson bank with a 10 000 donation to the griot museum of black history jackie hutchinson also a slehcra co chair said the commitments both recognize a need for change and also the historic nature of the jefferson bank protests she referred to the series of protests in 1963 by black political religious and activist leaders against the bank for not hiring enough blacks a protest which expanded to discriminatory hiring practices by several large employers in st louis we re especially happy to have secured a donation to the griot museum of black history which will help preserve the story of this and other civil rights struggles in our region hutchinson said unlike some other community benefits agreements which slehcra has reached with banks the one with first mid does not attach dollar figures to the lending goals it also does not include best effort language that has enabled at least one bank to say it complied with the goals even though the bank didn t hit the targets instead first mid commits to meet or exceed loan origination to minority borrowers and those living in low and moderate income areas compared with the percentages of lending by similar banks in the st louis area those commitments will be monitored through data compiled under the federal home mortgage disclosure act for small business lending first mid commits to meet or exceed loan originations in low and moderate income areas again based on percentages of lending by similar banks monitoring will be done through data collected under the community reinvestment act first mid has created a community development committee from its market areas including st louis it will be in charge of the bank s efforts to meet the lending goals if efforts fall short last july first mid bancshares inc nasdaq fmbh the mattoon illinois based parent of first mid bank trust announced it had agreed to acquire delta bancshares co in a cash and stock deal worth about 106 3 million the privately held delta bancshares is the parent company of jefferson bank and trust which operates five branches in the st louis area first mid bank trust has 67 locations throughout illinois missouri and texas as well as a loan production office in the indianapolis area last october slehcra and the other two consumer advocacy groups the chicago based woodstock institute and the national community reinvestment coalition of washington d c cited serious concerns with first mid s track record in complying with the community reinvestment act and fair lending laws risch slehcra s co chair said tuesday that the community benefits agreement enabled the coalition to drop its opposition to the merger we re having a productive relationship with first mid and seeing how they respond to our concerns and we re involved in the process the community benefits agreement is certainly not the end of our work it s in some ways just the beginning because this is an ongoing process she said dively the chairman and ceo of first mid bancshares said the bank does not believe that it needed the community benefits agreement to win approval of the merger first mid has a history of successful mergers and maintains strong regulatory relationships he said in an email
well what s joe biden going to say i did that biden has tried several strategies for messaging on inflation including outright denial discounting it as evidence of actual growth the transitory explanation and finally settling on corporate greed advertisement that s the bizarre message to which the washington post editorial board objected last night president biden is facing mounting criticism for inflation s rise to its highest level since 1982 unfortunately the white house s latest response is to blame greedy businesses economists across the political spectrum are rightly calling out the white house for this foolishness even some within the white house are questioning this approach the post reports inflation which was relatively low for years did not suddenly rise in recent months because businesses decided now was the ideal time to squeeze their customers what actually happened is that demand soared for many products as the economy recovered that s um not what actually caused this massive expansion in inflation it may be contributing to it but the true cause of this inflationary wave isn t even just the massive and unnecessary stimulus pushed by biden at the beginning of his term a couple of weeks ago politico offered an insightful profile of former federal reserve board member thomas hoenig who was the lone holdout against the fed s quantitative easing policies that began in the barack obama administration he warned at the time that the fed s monetary expansion would not just create an inflationary wave but leave them no recourse except to create a crippling recession to fix the problem at some point between 2008 and 2014 the federal reserve printed more than 3 5 trillion in new bills to put that in perspective it s roughly triple the amount of money that the fed created in its first 95 years of existence three centuries worth of growth in the money supply was crammed into a few short years the money poured through the veins of the financial system and stoked demand for assets like stocks corporate debt and commercial real estate bonds driving up prices across markets hoenig was the one fed leader who voted consistently against this course of action starting in 2010 in doing so he pitted himself against the fed s powerful chair at the time ben bernanke who was widely regarded as a hero for the ambitious rescue plans he designed and oversaw hoenig lost his fight throughout 2010 the fomc votes were routinely 11 against one with hoenig being the one he retired from the fed in late 2011 and after that a reputation hardened around hoenig as the man who got it wrong he is remembered as something like a cranky old testament prophet who warned incessantly and incorrectly about one thing the threat of coming inflation but this version of history isn t true while hoenig was concerned about inflation that isn t what solely what drove him to lodge his string of dissents the historical record shows that hoenig was worried primarily that the fed was taking a risky path that would deepen income inequality stoke dangerous asset bubbles and enrich the biggest banks over everyone else he also warned that it would suck the fed into a money printing quagmire that the central bank would not be able to escape without destabilizing the entire financial system on all of these points hoenig was correct and on all of these points he was ignored we are now living in a world that hoenig warned about the fed is now in a vise inflation is rising faster than the fed believed it would even a few months ago with higher prices for gas goods and automobiles being fueled by the fed s unprecedented money printing programs this comes after years of the fed steadily pumping up the price of assets like stocks and bonds through its zero percent interest rates and quantitative easing during and after hoenig s time on the fomc to respond to rising inflation the fed has signaled that it will start hiking interest rates next year but if that happens there is every reason to expect that it will cause stock and bond markets to fall perhaps precipitously or even cause a recession advertisement indeed and that should have been obvious from the start when it came to printing more money to deal with the pandemic congress had little choice but to adopt the pottery barn rule after the federal government drove shutdowns that cost over 20 million jobs and repair the damage washington did out of necessity the subsequent stimulus after the cares act likely was not just unnecessary but did more economic damage than it sought to repair especially biden s attempt to buy political favor through the third 1 9 trillion bill in march 2021 that monetary expansion accelerated the dynamics about which hoenig had been warning for over a decade to no avail in either republican or democratic administrations that doesn t let biden off the hook clearly for one biden was part of the administration that initially pushed for and cheerled the bernanke monetary policies biden s third tranche of pandemic stimulus appears to have been the catalyst that kicked off the inflationary wave this year too and his bungling of the supply chain crisis as well as a complete lack of focus on actual economic concerns rather than his progressive hobby horse bill contributed to inflation s amplitude as well rather than acknowledge all of that biden s gone the full elizabeth warren instead even while his own advisers can t all figure out what he s talking about as the post reported yesterday but the move to blame big firms for the price spikes has divided many supporters of the administration senior officials at the treasury department for instance have been unsettled by the white house s attempts to blame some large corporations for inflation skeptical of that explanation for the recent rise in prices according to four people with knowledge of internal administration dynamics senior treasury officials are generally supportive of the white house s broader antitrust strategy and believe it is possible that corporate consolidation is playing some role in higher prices but they are wary that recent white house efforts risk going too far there are some people at treasury all the way to the top that have a very strong analytical bent and recognize there is something to the notion that the lack of contestability in certain markets has driven up prices but also think that it s hard to imagine that s a significant factor in the current surge said eswar prasad an economist at cornell university and former senior official at the international monetary fund there is unease at treasury about pushing this line too hard he added there is a real concern there about this going too far advertisement that line got crossed a couple of months ago even at the post columnist catherine rampell blasted warren and the white house for the idiotic claim that corporate greed just happened to emerge at the same time that the biden administration was fumbling the supply chain crisis the left s rhetorical response to the rising political threat of inflation continues to evolve first they said the problem didn t exist and anyone who claimed otherwise was acting in bad faith or spouting republican propaganda then they said inflation is real but president biden s build back better plan would fix it now they tell us inflation might be happening but it s the fault of greedy corporations and those companies must be punished it s unclear whether this is a cynical comms strategy as circulation of a recent messaging poll suggests or if they actually believe this either way it s nonsense for corporate greed to be the culprit behind the recent spike in prices well you d have to believe either that businesses suddenly got much greedier that this is the greediest thanksgiving ever or that businesses somehow suddenly got much more effective at acting upon that greed clearly biden didn t read this criticism over the thanksgiving holiday will he pay attention to its echo from the post s editorial board given the lack of other options for blamethrowing over his utter incompetence the safe bet is on no update needless to say this doubling down on anti trust legislation won t impact the real drivers of inflation nor was it originally designed with that in mind it s more about big tech than corporate greed fueled inflation but it will let biden pretend to be doing something about the latter advertisement senate gets serious on antitrust supporters and critics of one of the senate s biggest tech antitrust bills can start the countdown clock for the judiciary committee s markup which a committee aide tells politico could occur as early as jan 27 the bill is listed on the committee s business meeting agenda for this thursday alongside a long slate of judicial and other nominees but is not expected to come up then the aide said the measure introduced last october by sens amy klobuchar d minn and chuck grassley r iowa would prohibit big tech companies from unfairly using their own online marketplaces to overwhelm their rivals it comes after years of accusations from smaller companies about amazon s abusive treatment of its vendors and apple s dominance of its app store the bill s primetime placement this week means it could move quickly through the committee as your host reports for pros s 2992 has the backing of 10 additional lawmakers from both sides of the aisle including chair dick durbin d ill as well as sen lindsey graham r s c a similar measure h r 3816 from reps david cicilline d r i and ken buck r colo advanced out of the house judiciary committee last june i ve advocated for several years for more robust anti trust enforcement had we taken that path ten years ago with big tech we d have at least a significant amount more distributed power in that industry this bill looks at least somewhat like closing a barn door after the horse has bolted and too narrow to really impact the free speech concerns over that concentrated power over public debate advertisement also worth pointing out this would enable biden s progressive ftc chair lina khan to exert a lot of regulatory power in this industry that s something to consider as well do republicans want to proceed on this considering the minimal cover it might provide biden on inflation in the short run anyway and the long term boost in power for his progressive regulators

argentine president alberto fernandez gestures at an event after midterm elections in buenos aires last november under him the country s public finances have improved even with a countercyclical recovery policy owing to the strong economic growth higher and more progressive tax rates on wealth and corporate income and the debt restructuring of 2020 reuters although covid 19 has been hard on everyone it has not been an equal opportunity disease the virus poses a greater threat to those who are already in poor health many of whom are concentrated in poor countries with weak public health systems moreover not every country can spend one quarter of its gdp to protect its economy as the united states did developing and emerging economies have faced hard financial and fiscal constraints and because of vaccine nationalism hoarding by rich countries they have had to scrounge for whatever doses they can get when countries suffer such acute pain officeholders tend to receive more blame than they deserve often the result is a more fractious politics that makes addressing real problems even harder but even with the deck stacked against them some countries have managed to deliver strong recoveries consider argentina which was already in a recession when the pandemic hit owing to a large extent to former president mauricio macri s economic mismanagement everyone had seen this movie before a right wing business friendly government had won the confidence of international financial markets which duly poured in money but the administration s policies turned out to be more ideological than pragmatic serving the rich rather than ordinary citizens when those policies inevitably failed argentinians elected a centre left government that would spend most of its energy cleaning up the mess rather than pursuing its own agenda the resulting disappointment would then set the stage for the election of another right wing government regrettably a pattern repeated over and over but there are important differences in the current cycle the macri government elected in 2015 inherited relatively little foreign debt owing to the restructuring that had already occurred international financial markets were thus was even more enthusiastic than usual lending the government tens of billions of dollars despite the absence of a credible economic programme then when things went awry as many observers had anticipated the international monetary fund stepped in with its largest ever rescue package a 57bn programme of which 44bn was quickly dispersed in what many saw as a naked attempt by the imf under pressure from us president donald trump s administration to sustain a right wing government what followed is typical of such political loans as i detailed in my 2002 book globalization and its discontents domestic and foreign financiers were given time to take their money out of the country leaving argentinian taxpayers holding the bag once again the country was heavily indebted with nothing to show for it and once again the imf programme failed plunging the economy into a deep downturn and a new government was elected fortunately the imf now recognises that its programme failed to achieve its stated economic objectives the fund s ex post evaluation places a significant portion of the blame on macri s government whose redlines on certain policies may have ruled out potentially critical measures for the program among those measures were a debt operation and use of capital flow management measures the imf s usual apologists will attribute the programme s failure to a lack of communication or clumsy implementation but better communication is no fix for poor programme design the market understood this even if the us treasury department and some in the imf did not given the mess that argentinian president alberto fernández s government inherited in late 2019 it appears to have achieved an economic miracle from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021 gdp growth reached 11 9 and is now estimated to have been 10 for 2021 almost twice the forecast for the us while employment and investment have recovered to levels above those when fernández took office the country s public finances have also improved even with a countercyclical recovery policy owing to the strong economic growth higher and more progressive tax rates on wealth and corporate income and the debt restructuring of 2020 there also has been significant growth in exports not just in terms of value but also in volume following the implementation of development policies designed to foster growth in the tradable sector these include reforms to credit policies a reduction in export duties to zero in value added sectors coupled with higher rates on primary commodities and investments in public infrastructure and research and development the kinds of policies that bruce greenwald and i advocate in our book creating a learning society despite this significant progress in the real economy the financial media has chosen to focus wholly on issues such as country risk and the exchange rate gap but those problems are hardly surprising financial markets are looking at the mountain of imf furnished debt coming due given the enormous size of the loan that needs to be refinanced an agreement that merely extends the amortisation timeline from 4 5 to ten years is hardly sufficient to alleviate argentina s debt worries moreover argentina is still experiencing the effects of the speculative portfolio capital that poured in during macri s presidency much of this was trapped by that government s capital controls resulting in constant pressure on the parallel exchange rate cleaning up the previous government s financial mess will take years the next big challenge is to reach an agreement with the imf over the macri era debt the fernández government has signalled that it is open to any programme that does not undermine economic recovery and increase poverty though everyone should know by now that austerity is counterproductive some influential imf member states may still push for it the irony is that the same countries that always insist on the need for confidence could undermine confidence in argentina s recovery will they be willing to go along with a programme that does not entail austerity in a world still battling covid 19 no democratic government can or should accept such conditions over the past few years the imf has gained new respect with its effective responses to global crises from the pandemic and climate change to inequality and debt were it to reverse course with old style austerity demands on argentina the consequences for the fund itself would be severe including other countries diminished willingness to engage with it that in turn could threaten global financial and political stability in the end everyone would lose project syndicate joseph e stiglitz a nobel laureate in economics is

economists expect inflation to have hit 7 yoy in the final report for 2021 political pressure around inflation makes headline prices more important than core cpi at this point the dollar has room to rise on growing chances for a rate hike in march a drop in gasoline prices poses a downside risk ignore the core that is seldom the message for traders when they face us inflation data but the times are changing the final consumer price index report for 2021 comes as sticker shocks are seen across america moving to the forefront of the political debate headline cpi rose by 6 8 yoy in november the highest since the early 1980s while core cpi excluding volatile food and energy prices hit 4 9 yearly that core figure is substantially above the federal reserve s average target of 2 the longer it lasts the harder it becomes to convince the public that current inflation compensates for previous weak price rises source fxstreet fed chair jerome powell changed his tune and said it is time to retire the term transitory from inflation he also acted by announcing the tapering of bond buys and then doubling its pace the timing of the first post pandemic rate hike and a reduction of the fed s 8 7 trillion balance sheet relies heavily on cpi figures political pressure means headline inflation is becoming more important than core cpi even for the fed powell has yet to be officially renominated for a second term and he seeks broad support from lawmakers something that would give him more credibility within the public president joe biden has vowed to fight higher inflation amid growing pressure from voters and criticism from republicans ahead of the previous release the white house was quick to say that november s inflation figures did not reflect a drop in gasoline prices that will come to a test now the economic calendar is pointing to a monthly increase of headline cpi by 0 4 half the 0 8 rate recorded in november the consensus sees the drop in fuel prices as a moderating factor on monthly increases not as one that would push cpi lower yearly expectations stand at an increase from 6 8 to 7 hitting that round and symbolic number or surpassing it would probably seal the deal on a march rate hike acting early opens the door to four raises of borrowing costs in 2022 it would also imply a quick squeeze of the fed s balance sheet source federal reserve that would spook investors and send the greenback higher instead of buying bonds with newly minted dollars the fed would shift to selling bonds effectively pulling money out of the markets fewer dollars mean a stronger currency on the other hand if inflation rises to 6 9 or even refrains from rising the dollar could suffer it would at least temporarily show that inflation has cooled down it would probably be insufficient to stop the fed from hiking in march but enough to provide some calm core cpi still matters especially if it substantially deviates from 5 4 expected a 6 level of a pace near that round number would be dollar positive while anything closer to 5 could weigh on the greenback however the high profile that inflation now means headline inflation is more important conclusion headline inflation of 7 would make headlines and also boost the dollar higher while a small miss could trigger a relief rally in stocks and weigh on the grenback

exponentially i invite shareholders to explore the simple comparison table showing grow relative to other investment advisors of various sizes that are also in the etf space based on relative comparisons i believe u s global looks not only deeply undervalued but also very attractive on a variety of metrics i look forward to explaining in greater detail during our webcast on january 12 explains mr holmes jets trading volume has remained strong despite new variant jets continued to attract assets ending the september quarter with 3 7 billion an increase of more than 125 compared to the same quarter end in 2020 despite concerns of new coronavirus variants disrupting commercial air travel jets trading volume has been strong on december 6 2021 the airlines etf saw a new daily record in volume with more than 33 million shares traded representing over 716 million in value the company remains optimistic that a full airline industry recovery can still take place in 2022 and a new forecast by airlines for america a4a appears to support this according to its most recent report the u s trade group says it believes airline revenues could fully recover to 2019 levels by the second half of 2022 this projection is based largely on monthly sales data from the seven largest u s carriers by the september quarter of 2022 ticket sales could be 3 above pre pandemic levels a4a believes in the meantime airlines continue to offset still recovering ticket sales not to mention higher fuel costs with ancillary revenues explains mr holmes such revenues include sales of services that go beyond simply transporting someone from a to b think frequent flyer programs credit card applications hotel bookings extra legroom and the like as expected ancillary revenues dipped dramatically in 2020 but like the airlines industry as a whole ancillary revenues appear to have ticked up in 2021 as of november according to ideaworks and cartrawler global ancillary fees are estimated to increase to 65 8 billion in 2021 or 7 7 billion more than last year although ancillary revenues are still below 2019 levels today they represent a larger share of total airline revenues than they did two years ago in 2021 these fees represented an estimated 14 4 of total revenues compared to 12 2 in 2019 a decade ago they represented only 5 4 of global sales underscoring just how important this revenue stream has become and will continue to be gold could be the ultimate contrarian investment right now compared to jets attracting new fund flows into goau has been more challenging nevertheless the company maintains its bullish position on the gold mining industry heading into 2022 especially as inflation in economies around the world has touched multi year highs right now gold is extremely unloved making it i believe the ultimate contrarian asset to own comments mr holmes a number of gold mining stocks also look very attractive at the moment with many of them generating remarkably higher free cash flow fcf yield than the industry as a whole and the s p 500 this number tells you how well a company can meet its financial obligations pay down its debts and potentially raise dividends there are quite a few gold producers that had exceptionally strong cash positions relative to the broader market and we owned a number of them in the quarter ended

by kevin liptak and jeremy diamond cnn as president joe biden was spending his holidays with family at the white house and in delaware he was frustrated to see images on television of americans waiting in long lines for covid 19 tests nearly a year after he had taken office the stubborn problem he had vowed to solve persisted exposing a testing system that was failing once again to meet demand and biden s own promises anger over testing shortages has been mounting across the country including inside the white house since early december when the omicron variant began spreading widely across the country and the demand for tests began far outstripping the supply in many areas according to people involved in the conversations biden himself has privately told top staff members in strong terms that he regrets that he and his team did not anticipate the shortfalls earlier something he s also made clear in public despite those regrets experts had been warning for months that testing capacity wasn t where it should be as the holiday season approached including during a virtual meeting with white house officials in october multiple experts argue that biden and his team did not move quickly enough to address the coming shortfalls and by then it was too late to dramatically increase supplies to levels that would have eased the current shortages everybody saw it coming we knew we needed more tests dr ashish jha dean of the brown university school of public health said on cnn last month i think the administration had dropped the ball on this while biden entered office with a plan to expand testing pouring in billions of dollars to boost manufacturing and ramp up testing in schools his top priority was vaccines which kept most people out of the hospital and even slashed the chances of getting infected with and spreading the virus but vaccine hesitancy remains stubbornly high and a new highly transmissible variant that sidesteps much of the vaccines protection against infection has spread across the country driving case counts to their highest levels to date by december it was evident biden was falling short of the promise he had made as a candidate that anyone who wants a test should be able to get one period that has prompted a hurried effort inside the white house to stand up a new test distribution program that officials say will provide free at home rapid tests to any american who orders them online federal testing sites have opened in cities across the country and a new requirement for health insurance companies to reimburse for the cost of tests takes effect this week the white house says a slew of investments it made in the fall including through the defense production act and efforts to speed up the authorization of new rapid tests have helped to dramatically increase the number of at home tests the monthly supply of at home tests has risen from 25 million to 28 million in august to 46 million in october to 300 million today the white house projects that next month the monthly supply will hit 350 million to 400 million according to a white house memo obtained by cnn still many experts say that even those ramped up numbers are not enough we re not going to stop there those numbers will keep going up in the months ahead dr tom inglesby the white house s newly installed testing coordinator said in an interview this week as the country shifts into a new phase of the pandemic focused less on eradicating covid and more on learning to live with it there is a renewed emphasis on the availability of testing to assure people they re safe to travel and engage in other normal activities it s a pivotal moment for the biden white house aides to the president know he and his party will be judged by how well they navigate a return to normal pivoting quickly to improve testing supplies is a test of biden s ability to shift the country into a new stage of a virus he s acknowledged is unlikely to completely disappear what we ve been hampered by is thinking that the role of testing is sort of secondary and optional where really the role of testing is foundational throughout the course of the pandemic and throughout the exit from the pandemic said dr thomas tsai assistant professor of health policy at harvard t h chan school of public health because the testing is the information is the early warning system on whether cases are rising or decreasing it s the information that informs behavior we ve always been chasing our tails within testing strategy tsai added it s never sort of coincided where we ve had the demand and supply of tests before the waves peak so we can actually alter the course of the pandemic it s always documented the course of pandemic as opposed to altering the course an october warning two months before christmas medical experts foresaw a frantic last minute shopping surge with millions of americans flooding stores in search of at home covid testing kits to tell them their holiday gatherings were safe a group of doctors shared that vision with the white house at a meeting on october 22 urging officials to expand the nation s testing capacity in a hurry the participants say they got what they wanted massive efforts to expand production and distribution of tests as one of those physicians described it to cnn yet it turned out the warning and the effort came too late by that point the doctors vision of 732 million tests per month by march 2022 was simply impossible to pull off demand for the tests had tumbled so low during the summer that manufacturers had dramatically reduced production and at that point only a handful of at home tests were available for purchase i think the bold initiative had it come to fruition would have been amazing said dr michael mina a physician who was part of that october briefing with the biden administration but it would have been very very difficult in the last two months inglesby who joined the white house this month as the covid 19 response team testing coordinator said the goals presented in the meeting were ambitious but impossible to reach in october because of the limited number of authorized over the counter tests we all wish it could have been sooner if it were feasible everyone would have liked it to be earlier he said in an interview this week inglesby noted that the testing shortage is not unique to the us if you look at newspapers all over the world every country is having challenges meeting demand administration officials have been working behind the scenes for weeks in a hurried effort to stand up the free test program including working with test manufacturers to solicit proposals and with website programmers to develop the portal where americans will be able to request the tests contracts between private companies and the federal government to procure the 500 million tests began being awarded on friday and more information about the website is expected in the coming days the white house said it expected the first free rapid tests to be delivered to the government early next week white house officials insist the steps biden took over the past months have made it possible to order the 500 million tests at all including purchasing 3 billion in rapid tests during the late summer and early fall to bolster the market and spending another 1 billion to secure key supplies for test makers using the defense production act they say those steps increased capacity when demand was low but they have acknowledged it wasn t enough to avert the omicron induced shortage we do not have the tests that we need to meet all the demand inglesby said of the current state of play echoing a blunt acknowledgment from the president creating a system that can scale 50 to 60 times is challenging we are working to meet that challenge but it s just really important to understand that this virus that we are working against now this strain of virus is moving and has accelerated in a way that was very different even from delta and certainly from the world before delta inglesby said we have all the levers pulled too late to help testing companies are poised to make the most of the moment manufacturers whose tests have been authorized by the us food and drug administration including abbott acon and ihealth had been increasing their capacity already and there have been significant changes in capacity for the start of 2022 it has taken a year and a half for the us to embrace the important role of rapid testing said a spokesperson for abbott who said the company was producing 70 million of its binaxnow products in january and prepared to scale significantly further in the coming months it is important for the us to maintain the testing manufacturing capacity and supply during periods of low demand so we can respond to future variants and surges we re on the right path now but we can t be complacent or think that testing won t play a critical role in our ability to gather safely later on yet even if tests begin reaching americans by the end of january that would be more than a month after the latest wave began hitting communities and the testing shortfalls became apparent some in congress have sharpened their criticism of the administration s testing approach in recent weeks in a letter last week addressed to us health and human services secretary xavier becerra two senior republicans on key health committees demanded answers on the biden administration s lack of strategy for covid 19 testing with over 82 6 billion specifically appropriated for testing and flexibility within the department to allocate additional funds from covid 19 supplemental bills or annual appropriations if necessary it is unclear to us why we are facing such dire circumstances now wrote sens roy blunt of missouri and richard burr of north carolina on monday a group of 50 lawmakers who included some high profile biden allies such as democratic sens elizabeth warren of massachusetts and amy klobuchar of minnesota along with independent sen bernie sanders of vermont wrote a letter to the president urging additional immediate steps to ramp up testing supply so that every american has access to one rapid test a week officials say the scarcity of at home tests this month was driven by a steep uptick in demand particularly in major cities where cases began surging at the same moment americans were entering the holiday stretch increased travel and family get togethers prompted fresh interest in getting tested which depleted stocks of at home tests at drugstores and online the plan biden announced in december to procure and distribute hundreds of millions of at home rapid tests developed quickly over a stretch of days that month as reports emerged of empty shelves and sold out notices according to officials familiar with the matter still when biden made that announcement several details of the plan remained unresolved administration officials were unable to provide any specific details about when the website to request the tests would launch or how quickly tests would be shipped pointing only to a broad timeline of early january they also did not detail a plan to get tests to those with limited internet access a problem biden promised to solve but hasn t a buildup of factors over the past two years led to a shortfall in testing that became apparent only as the omicron variant began spreading across the country in the weeks after thanksgiving according to administration officials and others familiar with the matter since the beginning of the pandemic testing has been an issue in the us pandemic response many public health experts say the first tests developed in the united states by the us centers for disease control and prevention in early 2020 were faulty keeping many local officials in the dark about the sizes of their outbreaks correcting these tests took nearly a month leaving the country in a blind spot about how to contain the growing pandemic there also were questions over who should be tested only those who had symptoms or close contacts of people with confirmed infections as well biden entered office vowing to remedy the testing issues that had plagued the previous administration and he signed an executive order on his first day in office meant to expand the availability of testing including in schools and other priority populations he established a pandemic testing board a campaign promise modeled on president franklin d roosevelt s war production board early in his term and in february he announced a series of investments meant to increase testing capacity by scaling up the production of raw materials and establishing regional centers to distribute test kits and collect samples but biden s central focus in the early days of his term ultimately was on getting as many americans vaccinated as possible a campaign that diverted public attention from the testing initiative he d entered office vowing to execute right from the start the cdc for lack of a better word screwed up testing they got the testing kits wrong they sent out the wrong kits then we finally built up an infrastructure but it came simultaneously with the vaccine and we thought the vaccine would solve the problem and we didn t need to maintain that infrastructure said dr ezekiel emanuel a physician at the university of pennsylvania who served on biden s covid advisory team during the transition the white house rejects the notion that it prioritized vaccination at the expense of testing that is not true at all inglesby said it was never zero sum between the two still without adequate testing public health officials and hospitals aren t in the best position to anticipate how many cases may be coming their way or how much treatment may be needed testing is taking on an additional importance with the introduction of antivirals such as the recently authorized product from pfizer paxlovid which can reduce hospitalization by nearly 90 in high risk adults for that medication to work properly the pills need to be taken within the first five days of symptoms occurring the only way to know if those symptoms are caused by covid is through testing if you don t have a strategy around testing you re just kind of shooting in the dark and really addressing issues as they come up said lori freeman chief executive officer of the national association of county and city health officials and i think we might be feeling the consequences of that right now the cnn wire 2022 cable news network

the amount of blood available for transfusions at hospitals in the richmond area and across the country has plunged to dangerously low levels because of the omicron variant which has canceled blood drives scared away potential donors and reduced the working staff typically the american red cross maintains five days worth of blood but recently the supply has dipped below one day s worth in what is being called the worst shortage in more than a decade doctors have been forced to ration blood consider delaying chemotherapy and delay non life threatening procedures there isn t just one problem and as a result there isn t just one solution said jonathan mcnamara virginia communications director for the american red cross a nonprofit organization that supplies blood to local hospitals the pandemic particularly the omicron variant has made people less likely to donate blood or volunteer at blood drives the red cross has seen the number of donators dip 10 both nationwide and locally the number of first time donors in the state has plummeted blood drives at high schools and colleges are some of the most energetic and reliable drives the organization hosts but more than half of those events have been canceled because of the pandemic before covid 19 the red cross operated approximately 110 drives per month between the richmond and charlottesville areas recently it has held 75 to 80 one event can bring in anywhere from 50 to 300 pints of blood the need to social distance has rendered blood mobiles unusable the red cross has shifted its events to larger venues such as the altria theater richmond raceway and large hotel ballrooms where beds can be spaced apart in the past week winter storms have limited operations even further like nearly every business the red cross has experienced a staffing crunch during the pandemic s latest wave on any given day about 20 of the staff has been in quarantine mcnamara said the american red cross employs about 55 richmond area employees dedicated to blood collection the red cross relies on volunteers too to check in donors or to drive the blood to hospitals volunteers have been in short supply in recent weeks at vcu health the shortage has particularly affected cancer patients said dr india sisler the clinical director of pediatric hematology and oncology for the children s hospital of richmond at vcu when patients undergo chemotherapy it suppresses the bone marrow where blood cells are made often causing the patients to become anemic their platelets drop and they can experience an increased risk for bleeding without a blood transfusion ready doctors are considering whether the chemotherapy should be delayed other patients are born with blood disorders and some can t produce their own blood cells a condition known as thalassemia these patients need transfusions every few weeks to survive vcu health is now considering stretching the time between transfusions perhaps from four weeks to five sisler said still other patients are anemic because of complications such as ulcers or hemorrhoids those patients won t die without a transfusion but they are uncomfortable with a low blood level often experiencing dizziness or headaches these patients are less likely to get blood right now sisler said it s making treatment a lot harder for patients the doctor added without a transfusion these patients with milder disease are putting strain on their heart and lungs potentially doing long term damage the shortage isn t limited to vcu sisler said health systems across the country are discussing how to distribute the limited blood in stock at hca health system which owns six for profit hospitals in the richmond area there is enough inventory to care for critical patients in need said pryor green a spokesperson for the health system but we are concerned about the blood shortage for the community at large green said a patient dying because from a lack of a transfusion isn t normal in modern medicine it s unclear how dire the shortage has become doctors are now asking if they can t provide an ideal level of care what must be done to keep their patients safe it might mean postponing a liver transplant because the procedure requires a large volume of blood and blood could be used to help multiple patients sisler said in her 15 years of practice she s never seen the volume get so low where triage is necessary vcu has delayed procedures that require blood and are considered elective for example a patient with sickle cell disease needed a central line revived to replace a malfunctioning port a cath central lines and port a caths allow hospital staff to easily deliver a medicine or chemotherapy into a patient s body but the patient would need a blood transfusion before the operation so the procedure was put off there are multiple components to blood that can be donated red blood cells aid anemic patients while platelets can stop an injured person from bleeding these are the most common forms of blood donation plasma can be donated for more specialized afflictions including trauma burns and cancer type o negative is the most useful and often the lowest in stock sisler said o negative blood can be donated to recipients with any blood type and when a patient arrives at a trauma center in need of a life or death transfusion the patient often receives o negative blood because there isn t time to determine the blood type the shortage comes mostly from the supply side sisler said while hospitals are near or at capacity now covid patients don t often need transfusions vcu health s blood bank which receives the blood and determines alongside administration who receives it is working around the clock to distribute its resources sisler said it s unclear how much time will take to replenish the supply mcnamara wouldn t speculate we are in an evolving situation with many unknowns he said staff and guests at vcu health have started booking appointments for blood donation recently and the spots have been filling up sisler said
public health officials say tests are being returned in 36 to 72 hours on average the omicron variant is sending a crush of people to testing sites and pharmacies across the country as the disease spreads uncontrollably but amid testing shortage concerns community testing in la plata and archuleta counties and in colorado has served as a bright spot according to public health officials la plata and archuleta counties and the state have seen a surge in demand for testing but have not neared capacity or the lengthy turnaround times that can render tests useless at this point in time in our community individuals who are looking to get tested can get tested and get tested very timely said liane jollon executive director of san juan basin public health covid 19 cases in colorado have ballooned in recent weeks to figures never before seen new cases have numbered in the thousands and broken 10 000 multiple times according to colorado department of public health and environment data skyrocketing cases have led to overwhelming demand for tests both over the counter and at community testing sites over the counter rapid tests have begun to disappear in durango with both city market and walgreens reporting they were out of stock according to their websites and phone calls to their pharmacies walmart in durango had availability on monday but no longer had abbott s binaxnow covid 19 antigen self tests on tuesday according to its website the binaxnow is the only test walmart carries in stores it was back in stock on wednesday while at home tests have been hard to come by community testing has remained robust and sites continue to administer tests under the unrelenting pressure the omicron variant coupled with holiday travel has created unprecedented demand and we continue to operate at full capacity joshua posner senior director of operations for covidcheck colorado which contracts with the state for many of its community testing sites said in an email last week covidcheck colorado locations administered more than 65 000 tests for context our weekly average prior to this surge was 35 000 tests per week colorado s 152 state sponsored testing sites are performing an average of 23 611 tests per day said kristen petitt stewart a cdphe spokeswoman that number is well within the state s capacity to administer 50 000 tests per day sjbph helps operate two community testing sites in la plata county at fort lewis college and the fairgrounds and one in archuleta county at pagosa springs medical center through the delta variant s surge the three sites were testing about 4 000 people per week jollon said the three sites registered more than 5 000 tests the last week of december as omicron spread according to sjbph data last week they conducted almost 9 000 tests but the sites have not yet neared their limits we have not maxed out our capacity at our local test sites at this point jollon said we feel very lucky to be in a community that has a well developed capacity for testing that is not overwhelmed yet like we are hearing in many urban areas in colorado and around the country she said testing delays have been another concern of public health officials delays can effectively continue to spread the virus as people who are positive continue to go about their lives while waiting for results but in la plata and archuleta counties and the state at large results are being returned with only modest delays our test results typically come back from our community test sites in 36 hours jollon said they can take between 36 and 72 hours weather is often to blame for any delays in testing not a surge in demand she said data analysis from the state can also add to longer covid 19 test return times the other issue that we are seeing is with the extremely steep increase of positive cases the state of colorado is having some difficulties keeping up with the data to get it back down to the local community jollon said covidcheck colorado s website warns that the current testing volume is forcing longer than normal turnaround times with some results delivered in the usual two to three day time frame and others taking up to five days to return while there may be delays on a case by case basis tests collected this past week at the state s community sites are being returned after two days on average which is well within covidcheck colorado s ideal two to three day time frame stewart said the effects of omicron are still being felt though the state s average test return is up from 1 1 days over the last 10 weeks jollon attributes the resilience of la plata and archuleta s community testing to the state s testing infrastructure and its foresight colorado s state lab increased its capacity more than eightfold over the first year of the pandemic according to jollon and cdphe the state also contracted with labs around the country so that as different regions of the country experienced covid 19 surges they could shift colorado s tests to places that were less inundated the specimens collected in colorado either go to the state lab which has increased its capacity tremendously or go to different laboratories around the country with an eye for moving them to the part of the country that has the most capacity at any given time jollon said we re really thankful that the state of colorado had the foresight to put in extensive infrastructure for community testing and make it widely available and make it free across the state she said all response to communicable disease starts with surveillance but even as colorado has weathered the initial testing surge brought on by omicron public health officials warn that the state s testing infrastructure could crack at this point our test sites are able to handle the demand and there are still some rapid tests available in our community jollon said but we can t guarantee through the duration of the omicron surge that will remain true amid the current testing demand posner recommends scheduling testing appointments a few days in advance while community sites can accommodate walk ups people may face long wait times the centers for disease control and prevention recommends that anyone with respiratory symptoms follow its covid 19 isolation guidelines according to the cdc s most recent guidelines people who have tested positive or are symptomatic should isolate at home for five days or until their fever resolves once their isolation is complete they should wear a mask around others for another five days for those struggling to secure a test or waiting for a test result jollon says there s only one option if you re symptomatic stay home she said ahannon durangoherald com an earlier version of this story and headline described the surge in demand for testing as applying to southwest colorado the surge described by public health officials applies to la plata and archuleta counties the story also did not clarify the locations of the city markets walgreens and walmart that were out of stock of tests the five stores are located in durango

you re not supposed to get high off cannabis in kansas but shops across the state sell vaping oil and gummies with cannabis ingredients that ll do the trick and now it appears that anyone caught with them could land in hot water in at least one county shop owners have been put on notice either hand over the goods or police could seize the stuff soon at issue are delta 8 products they often contain only trace amounts of the compound that people traditionally associate with marijuana delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol or thc but they promise buyers something else a molecular variation called delta 8 thc the trend adds a layer of complication for anyone trying to figure out what they can and can t legally do in a state that doesn t allow medical or recreational marijuana but does allow some hemp products with very small amounts of the compounds found in stronger stuff now attorney general derek schmidt says delta 8 is legal only in specific circumstances one of the biggest caveats a product can t contain very much delta 8 the results of his formal position are playing out in the city of hays where the city police and county sheriff could start taking products from shelves but deputy police chief brian dawson says officers plan to ask shop owners to voluntarily turn the stuff in still dawson made clear that police have the discretion to arrest anyone they find in possession of illegal delta 8 products the situation has prompted alarm among advocacy groups who fear law enforcement agencies will embark on a campaign of harassing people and disrupting their businesses we strongly believe the resulting persecution of kansas citizens retailers distributors and ancillary business owners is detrimental to our state and its people several pro cannabis and pro hemp groups said in a press release thursday they are the kansas cannabis chamber of commerce the kansas cannabis coalition planted association of kansas and kansans for hemp in an interview with the kansas news service ellis county attorney robert anderson in hays said the situation is a mess people don t know what s legal most people and these business owners believe that they re selling and possessing lawful products he said i think the legislature should act if they would just make everything legal or make everything illegal and that s in terms of marijuana and hemp it makes it much more clear cut on how we do our job he prosecuted one person who wasn t a shop owner for delta 8 distribution last year and then sent out warnings to shop owners several months ago and again last week cannabis advocates say anderson is imposing legally unjustified and overly strict criminal penalties on delta 8 that should only apply to traditional delta 9 but anderson says he s just doing his job my personal opinion is that marijuana and hemp should be legal or at a very minimum decriminalized he said however as the ellis county attorney i do have a duty to enforce the laws as written last week anderson wrote to local shops that sell delta 8 asking them to voluntarily hand over products with significant delta 8 levels to law enforcement and promising in return not to prosecute but to understand how things got to that point you have to back up nearly a year anderson says he first became aware early last year of shops selling delta 8 he was pretty sure the products were legal at the time months later the legislature made some tweaks to its hemp law that he felt muddied the waters and made certain delta 8 products illegal he tried asking lawmakers to clarify the matter and turned to the attorney general s office for answers but didn t get much then he prosecuted what may be the state s first delta 8 case a burglar who stole the stuff from a shop the district court judge agreed that the products were illegal because the manufacturer s own documentation showed high levels of delta 8 thc not simply traces of it meanwhile the kansas bureau of investigation prodded the attorney general s office like anderson they wanted schmidt to say how he reads current state law on dec 2 schmidt issued his formal opinion an attorney general s opinion isn t a court ruling but carries some legal weight he concluded delta 8 products are only legal if they contain less than 0 3 thc the same bright line that applies to delta 9 thc levels moreover delta 8 thc is only allowed in products produced from industrial hemp in other words the products can t come from the type of potent cannabis plants used to produce the typical intoxication inducing marijuana that people drive to say colorado for so the legality or illegality lies in the specifics of any given product and the cutoff is 0 3 the situation echoes past confusion over full spectrum cbd products research has shown delta 8 products are most popular in states where consumers can t get the real deal marijuana rich in delta 9 existing in that gray area has also drawn warnings from groups like the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws or norml it cautions consumers against buying delta 8 products because they are untested and may contain impurities anderson doesn t have much appetite for prosecuting business owners he says he asked local law enforcement to wait for months while he sought clarification they ve been very much ready to do their job and act he said and they ve been very patient with me in my requests for them to hold off and make sure that we are absolutely certain that we know what the law is and how to enforce it with schmidt s formal opinion he says the matter is now clear and he says many delta 8 vaping products and edibles exceed kansas 0 3 threshold according to lab analyses disclosed by the manufacturers so on dec 29 he sent letters to local shops informing them of schmidt s decision and offering a final warning this office cannot continue to request that law enforcement in ellis county not act the letter says the best thing you can do to rid yourself of these products is to call law enforcement advise them that you are in possession of these products and request that they come seize them dawson the deputy police chief says one shop owner has already

this basket of industrial ev and technology stocks is poised to grow over the long term we re only a few weeks into 2022 and it has already felt like months with market volatility causing stocks large and small to seesaw up and down seemingly at a moment s notice if you re looking for some worthwhile growth stocks to buy and hold through the storm you ve come to the right place lithium americas lac chargepoint holdings chpt 2 42 and cognex corporation cgnx 2 54 are three growth stocks that could be good buys in january power growth in your portfolio with this ev play scott levine lithium americas if you re like most growth investors you ve undoubtedly come across plenty of ink spilled about electric vehicles since the market is expected to grow considerably over the next decade the international energy agency estimates that there were 10 million electric vehicles evs on worldwide roads at the end of 2020 and it projects that the global fleet of evs will rise to between 145 million and 230 million with growth like this coming down the pike it s no wonder that investors are charged up about lithium stocks such as lithium americas the coming year is expected to be an important one for lithium americas while the company has two assets in its portfolio one in argentina and one in nevada neither of the projects has commenced operations yet but that should change in 2022 construction is advancing on schedule at cauchari olaroz and management expects operations to begin in the middle of the year the first stage of the project is expected to achieve average annual lithium carbonate production of 40 000 metric tons assuming a long range lithium carbonate price of 12 000 per tonne management forecasts cauchari olaroz will generate earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda of 308 million annually meanwhile the company also expects to begin construction of stage two representing annual lithium carbonate production of about 20 000 metric tons at cauchari olaroz in 2022 with operations commencing in 2025 while lithium americas is expected to begin operations in argentina this year investors will have to wait a little longer for the company s project in nevada to start up however investors can look for the company to make progress at thacker pass in 2022 management expects to begin early construction work in the first half of the year for a pre revenue company like lithium americas there are plenty of risks that surround an investment but with the company trading about 29 lower than the all time high of 41 56 that it reached in november growth investors have the opportunity to pick up shares while they re in the bargain bin a high risk high reward ev play worth considering daniel foelber chargepoint leading ev infrastructure company chargepoint has had a rough go of it as of late share prices of chargepoint stock are down 62 in the past year as investors question the path to profitability for ev charging chargepoint is losing money and doesn t plan to turn a profit for the next few years however like lithium americas its growth is finally picking up the pace as interest in evs rebounds after a covid 19 induced lull in 2020 chargepoint s fiscal year 2022 fy22 ends jan 31 2022 the company is expected to report those full year results sometime in early march its most recent guidance issued on dec 7 2021 said the company expects fy22 revenue between 235 million and 240 million for comparison it reported just 146 5 million in fy21 revenue and 144 5 million in fy20 revenue not only is chargepoint s top line growth improving but it s also increasing its gross margin a sign that it s charting a path toward profitability it s also opening more dc fast charging ports as opposed to its standard level 2 ports dc fast charging is what the tesla supercharger network is built upon although unnecessary in cases where a car is parked for an extended period of time think at home in a garage or at work chargepoint stands to benefit from increasing its dc port count to appeal to more customers in locations where faster charging is in high demand despite chargepoint s potential the company remains a high risk high reward option in the ev space even with revenue growing at a breakneck pace chargepoint s fy22 revenue guidance would give it a price to sales ratio of 22 5 which is expensive even for a growth stock therefore chargepoint could best be paired with other top ev stocks like lithium americas to diversify risk and still capture upside the machine vision company s long term growth drivers remain in place lee samaha cognex corporation beset with rising raw material and supply chain costs and coming off a year when it disappointed investors cognex doesn t appear to be the ideal growth stock candidate however do you buy a growth stock when it s firing on all cylinders and speculative investors are driving its valuation ever higher or do you buy it when it s lost some of its luster yet still has lots of growth potential if you favor the latter approach then cognex could be for you the third quarter earnings report indeed fell short of expectations and there s no denying that its elevated freight and component costs are likely to persist through the fourth quarter into 2022 that said there are three reasons one from each of its main markets why i think cognex could be one of the best industrial stocks in 2022 first the company s profit margin took a hit from extra costs incurred in helping a high profile logistics customer deploy cognex s solutions however cognex s management believes the customer could place multiple orders in the future and e commerce warehouse logistics is a strong growth industry so don t be surprised if cognex announces large logistics orders in 2022 second cognex had a good year in the automotive sector and demonstrated it would benefit from automakers spending on ev production lines throw in recovery in global automotive production in 2022 and cognex is likely to have another good year in the automotive market finally the company s consumer electronics orders apple is its largest customer disappointed in 2021 still

news analysis top u s health officials including dr anthony fauci scrambled in early 2020 to respond to public reporting of a potential connection between covid 19 and the wuhan institute of virology in china this response which included a secret feb 1 2020 teleconference was loosely detailed in previously released and heavily redacted emails those emails strongly suggested that fauci and a small group of top scientists sought to promote the natural origin theory despite having evidence and internal expert opinions that pointed to the possibility of a leak from the wuhan lab unredacted versions of some of the emails made public by lawmakers on jan 11 further confirm this the newly unredacted emails released by house oversight committee republicans confirm and illustrate a pattern of lies and coverup from the emails it appears the effort was spearheaded by fauci himself but also involved his boss recently retired national institutes of health nih director dr francis collins as well as jeremy farrar the head of the british wellcome trust it was previously revealed that at least two scientists both of whom had received funding from the nih had told fauci during the teleconference that they were 60 to 80 percent sure that covid had come out of a lab bothered by the furin site farzan an immunologist who in the most significant new revelations in the unredacted emails come from two of these scientists robert garry and mike farzan who both noted the difficulties presented by the presence of a furin cleavage site in the covid 19 virus a feature that would later be cited as the defining characteristic of the virus farzan an immunologist who in 2005 discovered the receptor of the original severe acute respiratory syndrome sars virus sent his post teleconference notes to farrar who then shared them with collins fauci and lawrence tabak top officials at the nih in those notes farzan wrote that he was bothered by the furin site and had difficulty explaining it as an event outside the lab farzan noted that it was theoretically possible the virus s furin cleavage site could have arisen in nature but that it was highly unlikely the furin cleavage site is the defining feature that gives covid 19 the ability to easily infect humans and has long been puzzled over by scientists since no such site has ever been observed in naturally occurring sars related coronaviruses farzan like scientist kristian andersen who has received funding from fauci s niaid works at the scripps laboratory as was already known from previously released emails andersen had privately told fauci on jan 31 2020 that the virus looked engineered andersen would later spearhead fauci s efforts to promote a natural origin narrative then nih director dr francis collins listens during a senate appropriations labor health and human services subcommittee hearing looking into the budget estimates for national institute of health nih and state of medical research on capitol hill in washington on may 26 2021 sarah silbiger pool getty images farzan told the senior members of fauci s teleconference group that a likely explanation could be something as simple as passage sars live covs in tissue culture on human cell lines for an extended period of time which could lead to the accidental creation of a virus that would be primed for rapid transmission between humans this mutated virus would likely have specific adaptation to human ace2 receptor via repeated passage recent study in the science journal nature noted that the covid 19 virus was uniquely adapted to infect humans as it exhibited the highest binding to human h ace2 of all the species tested in layman s terms farzan concluded that the pandemic likely originated from a lab in which live coronaviruses were passed through human like tissue over and over accelerating virus mutations with the end result being that one of the mutated viruses may have leaked from the lab farzan placed the likelihood of a leak from a wuhan lab at 60 to 70 percent likely can t figure out how this gets accomplished in nature further revelations in the newly unredacted emails came from garry another scientist funded by fauci s niaid who told the senior members of the teleconference group in no uncertain terms that i really can t think of a plausible natural scenario where you get from the bat virus to covid 19 the emails indicate that farzan was cognizant that the wuhan lab conducted these types of dangerous experiments in level 2 labs which have a very low biosecurity standard this fact was later admitted by the wuhan lab s director shi zhengli in july 2020 notably since the start of the pandemic farzan has received grants totaling almost 20 million from collins s nih and fauci s niaid further revelations in the newly unredacted emails came from garry another scientist funded by fauci s niaid who told the senior members of the teleconference group in no uncertain terms that i really can t think of a plausible natural scenario where you get from the bat virus to covid 19 garry cited the remarkable sequences that would have to occur naturally telling the group that i just can t figure out how this gets accomplished in nature do the alignment of the spikes at the amino acid level it s stunning he noted that a lab created virus would readily explain the data he was seeing telling fauci s group that of course in the lab it would be easy to generate the perfect 12 base insert that you wanted the p4 laboratory on the campus of the wuhan institute of virology in wuhan hubei province china on may 13 2020 hector retamal afp via getty images along the same lines of what farzan had said garry was telling fauci s group that it was extremely unlikely that the furin cleavage site could have evolved naturally whereas creating it in a lab was easy scientist s private views conflicted with public statements garry s privately stated view is even more remarkable because only a day earlier on feb 1 2020 garry had helped to complete the first draft of the the primary difference between farzan s and garry s view lies in whether the lab created the furin cleavage site through serial passage in human like tissue or through direct insertion of the site in either case both scientists thought it was likely that the virus came out of the wuhan lab rather than having originated in nature garry s privately stated view is even more remarkable because only a day earlier on feb 1 2020 garry had helped to complete the first draft of the proximal origin paper that promoted the idea that the virus had originated in nature that paper became the media s and the public health establishment s go to evidence for a natural origin for the covid virus it was published online on feb 16 2020 and firmly excluded the possibility of a lab leak one of garry s co authors for the proximal origin paper andrew rambaut also is cited in the newly redacted emails in congruence with the other two scientists rambaut told fauci s teleconference group that he also was bothered by the unusual furin cleavage site but unlike garry or farzan he speculated that the virus might have arisen in another animal a so called intermediate host peter daszak right the president of the ecohealth alliance is seen in wuhan china on feb 3 2021 hector retamal afp via getty images two years later no such host has been identified in the case of the original sars virus as well as the middle east respiratory syndrome mers virus the intermediate host was found within a few months rambaut also recognized immediately the peculiar fact that the furin cleavage site insertion has resulted in an extremely fit virus in humans we can also deduce that it is not optimal for transmission in bat species rambaut lamented the lack of data being shared by wuhan scientists and concluded that only the wuhan institute of virology knew what had happened fauci s group misleads national academy of sciences the day after these three scientists shared their views with the senior members of the group on feb 3 2020 fauci attended a meeting at the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine nasem that meeting had been urgently convened at the behest of white house director of science and technology kelvin droegmeier who wrote that he was seeking answers about the origins of covid 19 dr anthony fauci white house chief medical advisor and director of the niaid shows a screengrab of a campaign website for sen rand paul r ky while answering questions at a senate health education labor and pensions committee hearing on capitol hill on jan 11 2022 greg nash pool getty images the meeting which included a presentation by fauci was also attended by peter daszak the person through whom fauci had funded the wuhan institute of virology and kristian andersen fauci and his group promoted the natural origin theory to the academy despite having just been told on the teleconference and in subsequent emails that a lab leak provided the most likely explanation for the virus nih hiding behind unjustifiable redactions the new emails fill some of the gaps left by previous redactions but still only cover a small portion of the many emails that remain redacted a close examination of the newly unredacted emails reveals that none of the usual justifications for redactions such as private information about people or threats to sources and methods apply instead it appears that all of the redactions were made solely on the basis of shielding the nih from scrutiny over its coverup of the virus s origins while they were pushing their natural origin narrative to nasem and by extension to the white house fauci and his group made no mention of their private discussions which were taking place at the same time that the virus most likely originated in a wuhan lab the new emails fill some of the gaps left by previous redactions but still only cover a small portion of the many emails that remain redacted a close examination of the newly unredacted emails reveals that none of the usual justifications for redactions such as private information about people or threats to sources and methods apply instead it appears that all of the redactions were made solely on the basis of shielding the nih from scrutiny over its coverup of the virus s origins these efforts at obfuscation tie in with the fact that we only found out about these new emails after a months long battle between the department of health and human services hhs the parent organization of fauci s nih and niaid and house republicans the capitol building in washington in a file photo samira bouaou the epoch times in order to obtain this information house republicans were forced to avail themselves of a rarely used law from 1928 the so called seven member rule under this law an executive agency such as hhs is required to provide requested information when requested by seven members of the house committee on government operations now called the committee on oversight and reform it isn t known why republicans haven t used this law earlier or with greater frequency eventually hhs allowed the house republicans congressional staffers to view the unredacted emails in person the staffers then transcribed what they saw which is how we came to know about these new revelations nih silences dissenting views these new emails are crucial in that they confirm that by feb 2 2020 fauci s teleconference group had identified evidence pointing to a lab leak at the wuhan institute of virology these scientists knew that the virus s unique furin cleavage site was very likely the result of experiments conducted at the wuhan lab notably they also knew that these experiments were being conducted in minimum biosecurity level 2 labs these facts presented a major problem for the heads of the nih who had funded the experiments dr martin kulldorff a professor of medicine at harvard medical school and a biostatistician and epidemiologist at the brigham and women s hospital in connecticut on aug 7 2021 york du the epoch times as the new emails confirm their response was to cover up the lab leak evidence and push a natural origin narrative then nih director collins who would later call for the public takedown of the authors of the great barrington declaration asked his group for a swift convening of experts in order to prevent the voices of conspiracy from doing great potential harm to science and international harmony through public discussion of a lab leak theory collins s view was mirrored by another participant in fauci s teleconference dutch virologist ron fouchier who told the group that further debate about such accusations would unnecessarily distract top researchers from their active duties and do unnecessary harm to science in general and science in china in particular

commentary if you look beyond the numbers gov gavin newsom s budget proposal for fiscal year 2022 23 which begins on july 1 2022 further enmeshes government in the lives of everyone in the state at his monday announcement the governor was ebullient about the 213 billion in general fund spending as in previous budget announcements he spoke in detail for more than 90 minutes the proposed budget does balance with a 45 7 billion surplus if you ignore the more than 250 billion in unfunded liabilities the state still has for pensions and retiree medical care but the extra money goes largely to more government programs that control our lives or to tax credits for actions such as buying electric cars that coerce people in a direction desired by the governor the main area for prodding us is the environment he touted his executive order banning selling internal combustion vehicles in the state by 2035 this is dramatic this is profound he enthused to move people to electric cars he announced one of several new programs in the budget climate on the move a 10 billion state sub national commitment for two years on zero emission vehicles this will among other things install charging stations for all the new electric cars we re supposed to buy there also will be a new state climate corps the first in the nation part of the build back better program of president biden assuming that ever gets past the roadblocks from sen joe manchin d wv newsom said biden is trying for a national climate corps but california got there first this is the reason so many zero emission vehicles companies are moving here he said an apparent reference to such companies as rivian electric adventure vehicles as the company fashions itself based in irvine its r1t recently won motor trend s truck of the year award despite a recent stock plunge its market capitalization on monday was 73 billion that s compared to the 65 billion for stellantis the global vehicle company and parent of chrysler however newsom didn t mention the big daddy of electric car companies tesla market capitalization of 1 1 trillion recently announced it was leaving for austin tex we are quadrupling down an almost giddy newsom said of his new efforts we hope to inspire other states and countries we need to do more as we lead into the future education spending explosion this is the 34th state budget i ve worked on and the most eye popping number was not the so called surplus but newsom boasting the per pupil spending for education now is 20 855 that was almost triple the 7 171 number a decade ago folks i know in public education tell me a common classroom includes about 35 students so 35 20 855 729 925 per classroom throw in local spending especially from the frequent school bonds voters almost always approve and it s even higher and keep that 729 925 number in mind when schools officials and unions insist they need more money from tax increases but as with private industry newsom wants the gusher of cash to subsidize approved behaviors first he wants to spend 4 billion including 1 billion from this budget on universal pre kindergarten long a demand of the teachers unions it s no longer k 12 it s pre k to 12 he said he also wants to spend 4 3 billion for after school programs and six weeks of enrichment in the summer and he wants to give every student two free meals a day regardless of income supposedly that s to avoid the stigma subsidized students suffer newsom also wants more spent to re imagine children s behavioral health with 4 billion total for implementation including 1 4 billion last year and 1 5 billion for next year he was right to be concerned about the mental ramifications on the kids of covid 19 but he was the one responsible for locking the kids out of the schools for far too long will this become just another critical race theory brainwashing program and shouldn t students mental struggles better be handled by family members private physicians and clergy add up the programs students will be going to school including after school programs most of the day almost the whole year long and eating most of their meals there in between having their minds readjusted when will they see their families it s the replacement of the family with the government newsom called it the two generation whole family agenda explaining you invest in the parents just as you invest in the kids universal health care california will become the first state to achieve universal access to health care under his budget newsom said this will include full implementation to all low income californians regardless of immigration status the implementation date is pegged for january 2024 for this budget the cost is 614 million when fully implemented it will be 2 2 billion a year this is also a long term goal of the public employee unions and it will fend off such proposals as assembly bill 1400 sponsored by the socialist california nurses association for a single payer health system that would cost up to 170 billion a year in new taxes the good news there are a couple good things in the budget for the proposition 51 school bond from 2016 the final 1 4 billion will be allocated newsom said it should be studied whether a new bond should be put to voters meaning it probably won t be we re trying to go more cash avoid bonds he said due to inflation he wants to pause the mandated gas tax increase saving motorists 523 million but money to repair and build roads still will be spent backfilled from the surplus better to have cancelled the tax increase permanently but motorists ironically driving the gas guzzlers he wants to eliminate sure will appreciate the relief he also addressed spending more on items big in the news 2 7 billion on wildfires 2 3 billion on ports infrastructure 285 million fighting crime and of course 2 7 billion more on fighting covid with science to sum it up the governor is using the surplus to push the government ever further into our lives approved activities will be subsidized disapproved ones penalized everyone especially children will be roped into even more government programs their lives micromanaged there was close to nothing about just giving us back the tax money we after all earned and letting us deal with our own health education welfare families and even food views expressed in this article are

lina andersson walked into a giant grocery store near her home in mount pleasant on tuesday with a short list of things to pick up including chicken and milk she walked out settling for fish and plans to drink her coffee black it was a little confusing said andersson 25 it was just empty shelves the only milk they had left was nondairy and not even the good nondairy it was just like weird creamers grocery stores across the washington region as in other areas around the country and around the world have experienced a spate of shortages and delays in restocking shelves leaving many shoppers frustrated grocery stores and food service organizations attribute the problem to the surging omicron variant of the coronavirus and last week s winter storms on top of preexisting global supply chain issues there are several challenges all retailers are facing at the moment that have impacted our ability to execute our business to our normal standards a giant food spokesman wrote in a statement most significantly the prolonged pandemic and last week s weather has caused continued strain on our supply chain but our giant teams are working with our manufacturing partners to replenish shelves as quickly as possible advertisement shoppers said they have seen shortages at most major grocery stores in the region harris teeter safeway trader joe s and whole foods did not immediately respond to questions about stock challenges i literally left the grocery store 20 minutes ago i live in a dc suburb pic twitter com eg8xoirb2h chris mullett cmullett69 january 10 2022 which parts of the country have been left with empty shelves depends on weather and coronavirus transmission levels said doug baker vice president of industry relations at fmi a food industry association last week s snowstorm for instance caught much of the washington region unprepared and obstacles such as the shutdown of i 95 made it difficult to get groceries into stores anything that disrupts travel along the way is going to have an impact on a particular area baker said certain parts of the country they re not having these issues because they re not impacted by any of those weather related supply chain challenges and maybe they re not experiencing the omicron surge the same way another state is experiencing it advertisement baker said shortages are common in january as stores restock after thanksgiving and christmas the two biggest eating holidays of the year but with this year s added challenges he said he doesn t anticipate reaching a point of normalcy while shopping until the second half of the year it s going to take us a while baker said the supply chain holds a lot of food there s a lot of food out there but it takes a while to move it from one point to another over the weekend residents began posting photos of empty shelves and picked through produce on social media community pages and forums aggravated that they couldn t start the week with freshly stocked fridges the trader joe s in virginia missed their shipments because of the snow now i can t get my food accessories for the week pic twitter com jzitgkgcb7 janay they them janaythemack january 9 2022 cynthia snyder 65 went to the giant food by her home in north cleveland park in the district and was shocked to find rows of empty produce advertisement it was utterly shocking snyder said there was not one onion not one leaf of lettuce share this article share so synder got what she could at giant before heading to a whole foods where she said she was able to buy most things though there was still some scarcity andersson who also couldn t find eggs at her giant location said she would probably stop by bestworld supermarket a smaller grocery store in mount pleasant on her way home i feel like smaller ones tend to have groceries though it s more expensive she said campbell burns vice president of streets market an independently owned grocery store in the district maryland and virginia said its 11 locations hadn t experienced the same widespread shortages he was hearing about at some of the larger chain stores the snow last week caused some delays burns said but being independent gave streets the flexibility to work with other producers and bring food into stores advertisement not just us but for all independent grocers this is where we shine burns said still some members of the national grocers association a trade group representing independent grocers have been experiencing the same ongoing supply chain and labor shortage issues during the pandemic as their corporate counterparts many member grocers have reported working with less than half of their staff nga communications director jim dudlicek wrote in an email while there is plenty of food in the supply chain we anticipate consumers will continue to experience sporadic disruptions in certain product categories as we have seen over the past year and half due to the ongoing supply and labor challenges dudlicek wrote baker of fmi said shoppers can take a few extra steps to ensure they re still getting the items they need first he said meal planning for the week can help shoppers better utilize the items they have and ensure they have a plan before entering the store and as in the case of andersson choosing fish instead of chicken baker said that being willing to substitute can help some persistence might too

article 3 months old international jan 12 2022 part 2 of a deep dive in today s consequences from a decade and more of exceptionally low interest rates by ahead of the herd s rick mills the debt trap part 2 of 3 50 years of fiat folly richard rick mills ahead of the herd as a general rule the most successful man in life is the man who has the best information a year and a half into the covid 19 battle with no end in sight as countries hit with the delta variant are forced to re instate restrictions the world has never been more in the red the institute of international finance found that governments companies and households raised 24 trillion last year to offset the pandemic s economic toll bringing total global debt to an all time high at the end of 2020 of 281 trillion even with vaccine rollouts low interest rates worldwide are keeping debt above pre pandemic levels the federal reserve continues to purchase 120 billion per month in government bonds and mortgage backed securities as part of its quantitative easing policy the bank of canada s qe program was scaled back in july but is still being maintained at 2 billion per week despite over 80 of the country fully vaccinated against the coronavirus the iif estimated in february that governments with large budget deficits are expected to add another 10 trillion in 2021 pushing their global debt accumulation past 92 trillion by 2021 s end last year south africa and india had the biggest increases in government debt ratios with china seeing the biggest jump in emerging markets followed by turkey korea and the united arab emirates among mature economies france and spain had the sharpest increases in non financial industry debt to gdp ratios iif data showed another set of figures via the world economic forum wef found that falling revenues combined with costly pandemic relief measures increased global debt by 20 trillion between the third quarter of 2019 and the end of 2020 excluding the financial sector canada s debt to gdp ratio climbed by nearly 80 last year the highest of any developed country not only did the country s gdp plunge 38 in the second quarter the worst three month performance on record government borrowing surged with the canada emergency response benefit cerb ringing up a bill of 60 billion over seven months according to the wef in a december 2020 report rbc wealth management contributed more illuminating statistics that paint a grim picture of a growing global debt burden powered by pandemic related borrowing the canadian bank quoted the imf in stating that the public debt of advanced economies has climbed nearly 27 since january 2020 and now sits beyond the greater than 120 of gdp reached after world war ii the united states and japan are the two most indebted economies accounting for half of total global government debt see the pie chart below global debt is a tamer 102 of gdp because many of the largest emerging economies have lower debt burdens however it s still a record noted rbc the united states is the obvious poster child of excessive debt accumulation according to usdebtclock org the current national debt sits at 28 7 trillion and it is increasing with each tick of the clock source usdebtclock org the next round of government spending involves president joe biden s 1 trillion infrastructure bill just passed by the senate but not yet approved by the house and a 3 5 trillion anti poverty and climate plan senate democrats hope to get passed this fall debt is clearly a major limitation on a growing economy according to the world bank if the debt to gdp ratio exceeds 77 for an extended period of time every percentage point of debt above this level costs a country 0 017 percentage points in economic growth the us is currently at 125 7 so that is 48 7 basis points multiplied by 0 017 0 82 nearly a full percentage point of economic growth the balance notes that a combination of recessions defense budget growth and tax cuts has raised the debt to gdp ratio to record levels throughout the years us military spending has been a major contributor to the debt during the first iraq war in 1991 the debt to gdp ratio hit 54 between 2001 and 2020 america s war on terror consumed 6 4 trillion helping to elevate the debt to gdp ratio from 55 in the year of 9 11 to 127 in 2020 the current national debt of 28 7 trillion and the current debt to gdp ratio of 125 7 doesn t include the 1 trillion infrastructure bill before the house nor the 3 5t anti poverty and climate plan we also have to add the federal budget numbers president biden s budget for full year fy 2022 totals 6 011 trillion more than any other previous budget the us government estimates that for fy 2022 revenues will again fall short of expenditures leaving a 1 8 trillion deficit better than the projected 3 trillion deficit for 2021 almost the same as last year s 3t but it still means nearly 2 trillion will be added to the national debt cnbc notes the budgetary shortfall this year is equivalent to 13 4 of gdp the second largest level since 1945 and exceeded only by 2020 spending adding it all up you get 28 7t national debt 1 trillion infrastructure bill 3 5t anti poverty and climate plan 6t fy 2022 budget spending 3t 2021 deficit 1 8t 2022 deficit 44t by 2022 the national debt presuming all of the spending commitments use borrowed or printed money will be approaching 44 trillion the fed is severely constrained in how much it can raise interest rates to quell rising inflation due to ballooning debt following 4 5 trillion spent on pandemic relief and trillions more to come through biden administration spending along with the continuation of quantitative easing what i like to call quantifornication to the tune of 120 billion in asset purchases per month the fed has in one year doubled its balance sheet to around 8 3 trillion source us federal reserve according to the committee for a responsible federal budget the federal government this year will spend 300 billion on interest on the national debt this is the equivalent of 9 of all federal revenues collected or more than 2 400 per household a today s debt levels each 1 rise in the interest rate would increase interest expenditures by roughly 225 billion on a per household basis a 1 interest rate hike would increase interest costs by 1 805 to 4 210 quantitative easing or qe for short is a technique used by the us federal reserve and other central banks to stimulate the economy in times of crisis the fed buys up securities from its member banks thereby adding new money to the economy this is where the expression the fed is printing money comes from it s a way of funding new expenditures without actually dipping into the federal budget the idea is to free up more money for banks to make loans to individuals and businesses thus growing the economy the money is not cash but credit that is added to banks deposits when it wants to print money the fed lowers the benchmark federal funds rate and banks in turn lower their interest rates making capital more affordable so that businesses and investors are more likely to borrow the fed used quantitative easing in the wake of the 2008 09 financial crisis and it did so again in 2020 to deal with the coronavirus pandemic qe continues although the fed has stated it wants to start tapering its monthly asset purchases qe was successful in preventing a financial meltdown during 2008 and 2020 but the effect has been a reliance on cheap credit that has fueled both a stock market bubble and a real estate bubble that many observers believe is in danger of popping bond investors have also become addicted to fed stimulus excessive money printing not only in the united states but britain and the eu is continuing to devalue currencies at an alarming rate this by definition is inflation because it takes more units of currency to buy the same amount of goods as before for which precious metals namely gold and silver are the best defence the nixon shock the world s obsession with debt didn t begin with the coronavirus the seeds of government debt accumulation were planted five decades ago it seems fitting that the year we are seeing an unprecedented rise in us government spending and money printing to spur an economic recovery marks the 50th anniversary of the end of the gold standard done at the time to fight an economic crisis we are still feeling the effects of this disastrous decision in 1968 an excess of dollars in the global economy threatened the gold standard whereby the federal reserve redeemed us 35 for an ounce of gold as explained by the balance in 1968 the united states had over 45 billion in federal reserve note liabilities but held only about 10 billion in gold it was not enough to redeem the liabilities foreign holders turned in their dollars for gold depleting central banks gold reserves even more to make the dollar more attractive to hold the federal reserve raised interest rates to 6 but the run on gold continued it boosted inflation to 6 2 in 1969 nixon s first year in office the fed defended the gold standard by raising rates to 9 19 unfortunately it also created a mild recession that started later that year by the end of 1970 the unemployment rate had risen to 6 1 the mismatch of dollars to gold meant that governments or their central banks could show up at any time to the us treasury s gold window and demand gold for dollars in august 1971 the british ambassador did just that requesting that 3 billion be converted into gold in 1970 then federal reserve chairman arthur burns declared that the economy was no longer operating as it used to due to the growing power of corporations and unions which together were driving up wages and prices the answer in burns view was to impose wage price controls wherein an appointed wage price review board would pass judgment on major wage and price increases as nixon looked towards re election in 72 he wasn t going to let the economy bring him down again in a repeat of 1960 as pbs describes in an excellent essay titled nixon price controls and the gold standard the central economic issue became how to manage the inflation unemployment tradeoff in a way that was not politically self destructive in other words how to bring down inflation without slowing the economy and raising unemployment to figure out a way forward nixon and 15 advisors repaired to the presidential retreat at camp david the answer was the new economic policy wherein wages and prices would be frozen for 90 days as a way of attacking inflation the idea was that wage price controls would allow the administration to pursue a more expansive monetary policy thereby stimulating employment in time for the 1972 election without stoking inflation now i am a keynesian nixon declared in january 1971 before introducing a full employment budget which provided for deficit spending to reduce unemployment more ominously the gold window was to be closed something fed chair burns disagreed with pravda would write that this was a sign of the collapse of capitalism he warned but was over ruled closing the treasury s window for gold redemptions immediately weakened the dollar which added to inflation by driving up the prices of imported goods as the pbs essay reminds us going off the gold standard and giving up fixed exchange rates constituted a momentous step in the history of international economics closing the gold window was controversial but the naysayers were shouted down and nixon was re elected in 1972 winning every state except massachusetts how will nixon be judged for ending the gold standard as it turns out quite harshly in 1973 the president devalued the dollar making an ounce of gold worth 42 instead of 35 this resulted in a selloff in greenbacks for gold and by the mid 1970s inflation was in the double digits later in 73 nixon decoupled the dollar from gold completely which made the price of bullion soar to 120 per ounce and ended the 100 year history of the gold standard quitting the gold standard resulted in stagflation falling growth high inflation high unemployment was only cured by double digit interest rates which caused the 1981 recession removing the dollar s peg to gold also opened the door to allowing the us government to print money to solve every economic problem ensuring the greenback s value would fall indefinitely this is exactly what has happened inflation erodes the purchasing power of fiat currencies and eventually they become worthless the dollar has lost 90 of its purchasing power since 1950 by contrast since 1972 gold has gone from 35 oz to 1 800 source goldprice org in the 50 years since the gold standard was eliminated unemployment has stuck above 5 in all but 12 years these figures look particularly bad when compared to the gold standard era between 1947 and 1970 unemployment averaged less than 5 and never rose above 7 economic growth has been sluggish too whereas gdp grew 4 a year during the post war gold standard period between 1971 and 2011 real economic growth after inflation averaged 2 9 compared to 4 during the gold standard era since nixon killed the gold standard there have been 13 financial crises including the 1973 oil shock the financial crisis of 2008 09 and the coronavirus crisis of 2020 21 as forbes concludes the evidence is in the great experiment of a paper dollar managed by able men and women has failed and failed miserably to keep any of its promises conclusion our conclusion at aoth is much the same nixon was persuaded against his better judgment to try beating inflation in 1971 by imposing wage and price controls he did this essentially to get re elected but nixon went further in committing what must be seen in retrospect as a colossal blunder in removing the fixed link between the dollar and gold the move killed the dollar which has been losing value ever since why because successive governments and central banks have taken it upon themselves to create money ie the fed and spend money the treasury with no consequences something that could never happen if the dollar had a gold anchor going back to it monetary fiscal policy would be much restricted for sure but neither could the federal government be allowed to run up the debt to its current 28 7 trillion in the fall of 2020 exceeding the debt to gdp ratio by 100 for the first time since the second world war there would also be no unfettered growth of the money supply which is inflationary and no expansion of the fed s balance sheet to over 8 trillion nixon s historic decoupling of gold and the dollar has important ramifications for the current us economy and investors what happens when people realize the federal government has depreciated the greenback by spending at least 6 trillion using borrowed money plus the fed s 8 trillion meaning the purchasing power of the dollar has been cut in half the equivalent of half the 28 trillion national debt and with trillions more debt to come at aoth we believe there is only one direction for the dollar and only one way for gold yet people are being misled into believing that the us federal reserve is going to scale back its 120 billion per month asset purchase program qe and raise interest rates the fed can telegraph its intentions all it wants the fact remains that at such unsustainably high debt levels the interest payments will eventually cripple the federal government in 2019 before the coronavirus crisis the committee for a responsible federal budget crfb calculated that under current law net interest payments will nearly triple over the next decade to 928 billion by 2029 in 2019 the national debt stood at 23 2 trillion compared to the current 28 7 trillion so already we know the projections are too conservative remember the current debt doesn t include the 1 trillion infrastructure bill before the house nor the 3 5t anti poverty and climate plan nor president biden s budget for full year fy 2022 totaling 6 trillion more than any other previous budget under the crfb s alternative fiscal scenario which assumes that lawmakers extend the tax cuts and spending passed under the trump administration interest on the debt will exceed 1 trillion by 2029 as a concession to senate republicans joe biden earlier this year proposed keeping intact donald trump s 2017 tax cuts instead of raising corporate taxes to pay for the 1 trillion infrastructure plan his administration would work to ensure corporations don t exploit tax loopholes again this is before the 4 5 trillion already spent on covid and the trillions more to come the way we re going interest payments on the debt will almost certainly top 1 trillion by the end of the decade if not before some see the national debt going much higher given that the way it is calculated now doesn t include unfunded social security and medicare promises when that 129 trillion worth of bills is added the truth is closer to 133 trillion source truth in accounting now we are talking about interest payments of four to five times the current 300 billion ie 1 2t to 1 5t the people supposedly represented by the government can t afford that level of interest they will suffer higher interest payments on their own debt same as businesses cannot afford higher interest payments on their debt corporations will simply pass on the higher interest obligations to their customers cut dividends or in the worst case scenarios lay off staff the debt trap part 1 of 3 without a plan to reduce the debt the era of free money will continue benefiting gold and silver prices for the foreseeable future richard rick mills aheadoftheherd com

james magruder is a funny guy his wonderfully wicked sense of humor comes through in his plays most recently the 2018 broadway musical head over heels as well as his fiction including his 2009 lambda literary award finalist debut novel sugarless his new novel vamp until ready rattling good yarns press 2021 spans 1980 1992 isn t all fun and games in fact it has its share of heartache and heartbreak it also contains some incredible literary sexual tension cary and jon s budding romance and a marvelous tribute to none other than shirley booth james who also teaches at swarthmore college was kind enough to make time for an interview in advance of the publication of vamp until ready gregg shapiro early in your new novel vamp until ready there is a reference to a lily tomlin routine involving her characters lud and marie and tomlin is referred to again near the conclusion of the novel what can you tell the readers about lily tomlin and her influence on you james magruder somehow i got a hold of lily s on stage album when i was a junior in high school like many other gay boys i wore it out until i had memorized it please stop talking about that cake from the lud marie meet dracula s daughter routine is as much a 70s comedy flashpoint as cheech chong s my name is sister mary elephant or the coneheads we come from remulak a small town in france tomlin s earlier album modern scream was equally formative corrupting my husband and i saw her once in a taqueria in austin she moved past our table knew we had recognized her and blew steve a kiss for the most part vamp until ready is set in ithaca new york why did you choose this setting i went to college at cornell and spent three summers doing stock at the hangar theatre it s a town i ve loved for 40 years the way you write about it ithaca is a character unto itself was it your intention to make the city as much a character as the others that populate the novel absolutely tompkins county is the blue island in all red upstate new york like austin is for texas it s one of the great college towns a very special place for those who know it the other significant geographical location in the book is africa as someone who has traveled there was this an opportunity to share your knowledge and experience more autobiography i m afraid my husband who was monitoring hiv research studies for johns hopkins and i lived in kampala uganda for ten months in 2013 14 before dictator president museveni passed a kill the gays bill we were airlifted out with our cats by johns hopkins the character judy gabelson s experience in part three of vamp was a way for me to capture the things i liked about uganda and ugandans before things went downhill there s a line near the end of the book describing the life of cary dunkler one of the main characters prior to an important turning point as vamping until ready the phrase from which the book gets its title the book needed a theater term for a title for the longest time it was called save yourself which is what you do onstage if everything is fucking up lesbian comedian cameron esposito brought out a memoir with that title only last year and that felt too close in time vamping until ready is what the orchestra does until the singer is ready to begin the song what the major characters experience in the novel by making theater prepares them to begin life or begin again they ve been vamping but now they re ready the cary dunkler parts that bracket the novel are written in first person while the other three parts kristy schroyer isa vass judy gabelson and mark shinner are in the third person what was involved in the decision to utilize these devices a gay first person male narrator is my sweet spot so cary was easy to write kristy isa and judy were and are a departure for me they are functioning heterosexual women and i didn t feel it would be honest for me at least not yet to write them in the first person ditto mark shinner the first straight man with whom i spend meaningful time in my fiction vamp until ready is divided into five parts with each section having a specific time setting it isn t an aids novel per se but were these years chosen as a way to allow you to write about aids i ve written so much about aids and my own positive status in let me see it and love slaves of helen hadley hall that i backed away from it in vamp but it cannot and should not go missing in a novel about theater people in the 1980s at a time when the future of roe v wade is increasingly uncertain vamp until ready shines a light on adoption with the characters cary and david having been adopted by the same family in what is referred to as two for one orphan deal theater is a place where you form successive families that last as long as the show does sometimes you can make friends for life from members of a theater family i worked at a big regional theatre for 15 years and always thought of it as an orphanage peopled by birth family casualties who are looking for adoptive parents and siblings for a safe amount of time theater plays a large role pardon the pun in the novel there s a wonderful description of the emotions stirred up during closing night of a show as a playwright and someone who knows how a closing night feels was it easy or difficult to put this experience into words closing night for a playwright is very different than closing night for a chorus boy i ve been both rather than go on at length about how bizarre the experience is it was easier for me to have cary directly address the reader by saying i figure some of you have been in plays and so know how a closing night feels their common knowledge keeps cary from examining his own sad feelings about it he transfers them to mention that the damn yankees diva suzy skurnik was as red and leaky as a fire hydrant at the curtain call the musical head over heels for which you adapted the book features the music of the go go s who are being inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in october 2021 what do you think about the band finally receiving such an honor way way overdue for the first successful all female rock band that wrote and performed all of its own music regional productions of head over heels are being mounted in a variety of cities what does it mean to you to see the show being revived in post broadway runs since the show closed in january 2019 i have seen productions in atlanta chicago and sarasota i love that our big hearted musical for mean times has proven so popular one of the regional productions features lea delaria as king basilius and rupaul s drag race alum alaska 5000 as queen gynecia what do you think of that casting the co directors called me about alaska whose work i didn t know i heartily approved the choice when i found out that they weren t going to cast the non cis oracle part originated by peppermint as female presenting you can t have alaska and a peppermint type actor in the same show unless you re doing schiller s mary stuart i said that since they were messing even further with the gender spectrum than we had on broadway they could keep going hence lea delaria whose cross gender casting as the king was a lovely shock a few days ago have you started working on or thinking about your next theater or book project the hardest thing i ll ever do a non fiction chronicle about the first fifty years of yale repertory theatre has currently after five years of research and interviews entered the physical production phase with yale university press that should come out a year from now i m writing short stories after a long hiatus and have been writing the books for two new musicals that i can t talk about for the time being stay tuned help keep the bay area reporter going in these tough times to support local independent lgbtq journalism consider becoming a bar member

stacy shoemaker rauen hi i m stacy shoemaker rauen editor in chief of hospitality design magazine with hd s what i ve learned podcast erik nissen johansen is the founder and creative director of stylt trampoli ab in gothenburg sweden taking a film director like approach to his creative process he often cites never do the film without doing the script first every project is pitched with a short written story connecting emotion to physical design for more than 30 years erik and his firm have been pushing the boundaries of hospitality design worldwide recently they completed pater noster the revitalization of an 1868 lighthouse into a 10 room hotel which has gained worldwide attention since its opening ssr hi i m here with erik erik thanks so much for joining me today how are you doing erik nissen johansen thank you i m really good ssr alright so we always start at the beginning where did you grow up enj well i live in sweden but i am norwegian so i grew up in an island in the oslofjord ssr so were you a creative kid did you always have a love of design enj i definitely think so for me it was like a strong compass a pointing arrow at school i was the worst kid on most of the topics and then i was the best kid on 10 of the topics drawing and sketching and stuff like that so it was just a big message saying to me follow that path because you will be successful or not those or those or those because you will fail i m a proud dyslectic ssr oh yes were your parents enj makes you think faster ssr yes it does as a challenge were your parents creative as well or anyone enj yes enj yes my father he s an engineer but his education before that was a carpenter doing furniture and stuff like that and he s a wood after he kind of went into pension he s a wood carver he always been very fascinating walking with him in the forest because he sees a tree and then he tells me what he see that s a chair he envisions this thing he can make from it and he s really really good and my mother she passed away some years ago but she was a designer working she even did dresses for the norwegian queen and stuff like that ssr oh wow that s exciting so did you tinker with your dad while he was making things growing up enj yeah and he was over the generation that fixed things instead of buying new stuff which is more difficult today because it s so much electronic in things but i remember i told him we need a stereo in the house because my friend he has a stereo and i want the phillips one and he said no no i can make one and he bought parts and he made it and i was a little bit ashamed then but now i m really proud ssr i know you re like i just wanted the phillips one enj yes whatever ssr that s amazing so did you go to school for design then enj yeah i had a very inspiring drawing teacher in the seventh grade eighth grade and she talked very warmly about the italian renaissance so that s why i decided to go to florence to study there study art and design and so formally i m a trained artist and a designer and i met a couple of good friends from sweden there at the school we were sharing some of the art history classes and we decided to almost like the medici renaissance model or studio to start a studio and i moved to sweden after the school and we have over five artists having a manifesto saying that everybody s allowed to paint on everybody s painting without anybody being allowed to get angry ssr oh wow enj so it was all about collaboration and kind of accepting that your initial idea might change and become something different but different is good in our business i would tell that speaks out is the commodity today and that worked for three years but we also had a lot of friends in the restaurant business so we helped them with designing restaurants and we did everything from the invitation the logo we made a business card the menu we did interior designed we sourced the furniture we did kind of everything and i guess i fell in love with that process because i think also my art is actually collecting things and putting them together in assemblages or three dimensional collage boxes and it could be objects that have been thrown away from people and you find one and another and one might have some meaning to you and you put them together it creates a third space in a way that s exactly what you do with interior designer or hospitality design if you make a room you change the wallpaper behind it might be telling a totally different story and when i did my art or i still doing my art it s totally uncompromised because i m the boss i m the one who decides but i m really fond of that medici renaissance collaboration that people with different backgrounds are forced to collaborate because the results are getting different and so i almost get more reward from that from the struggle and collaborating with a client with a investors with my fellow designers with my opponent architect maybe we are interior architects so we have always almost always especially if it s a new build collaborating with an architect and other consultants of course and as you know i will tell or a restaurant is such a big project and complex so you can t do it yourself you cannot do it yourself you have to be good at doing it together with other people and you have to create the operators you have to give them a tool so their business can be even more successful than they would have been able to do alone or on their own so i m really fond of that and we kind of have an internal slogan at stylt saying let s make better mistakes tomorrow and it s trying to create a cultural it s legal to fail because that s the biggest threat towards creativity i think if you don t allow people to do mistakes they get afraid and they will be afraid of trying to new things so i also think it took a long time for me to have a profitable business i was always employing the best the most creative people and remember we started as an art collective very very disorganized and then i only in employed people that were really crazy and we did magical stuff but we didn t make much money and sometimes it was difficult but eventually we learned i realized that running a business is a totally different education so i think many of the successful companies like hospitality design companies are a group of people that founded it and they have different skills and also successful restaurants often have a variety of owners maybe one with a chef background and maybe one with economics or whatever i answer a lot of questions ssr i love it like wait so many questions off of that so for excuse me so when you launched your firm in 1991 so 30 years congratulations you ve survived for 30 years enj thank you i was like year two when i started it ssr how has your company evolved in the last 30 years how have you changed it or adapted it for the industry and what was the idea behind the name too enj the idea behind the name is very simple it means stilts the walking sticks that you become one meter taller than the rest a very cheap tool to get a new perspective but peter one of the guy that i founded the company with still a very good friend but we split up this is one of the paintings behind me that we did collaboratively we shared art history in italy and it was an old teacher that she was lecturing in italian and we were really bad at the language in the beginning so we never arrived in time for her lectures we were on in a bar outside and she knew that so she opened the window and screamed in italian i trampoli or hey stilt guys because we were taller than the rest in our class so that was her negative nickname and everybody started to call us i trampoli which means stilts or the stilt guys because we were taller and when we formed the art collective we needed a name and that was already stuck that the story behind the name ssr i love it and so how has it evolved from this art collective to where you are now i mean you ve done hundreds of fnb projects and hundreds of hotels how did you go from art to that enj i think a few things i think that i decided when i started this company in 1991 that i wanted to be really good at creating experiences that i wanted to experience myself through restaurants and hotels and i took the decision that the company is going to be focused on hospitality so if a company or a client comes to us and don t admit to the hospitality industry which is quite broad actually it could be a church it could be a gas station if the owner thinks that he wants to also sell the experience but obviously a restaurant or a hotel is very very but that was a decision from the beginning and then i also think that one so we stick to that but another thing that we had ability when i started in a very kind of effectively way that we had the ability to sprinkle tinker bells stardust artistic stardust on our projects which was a very drawback in the beginning because it made as very unprofitable but the project were sparkling they were fun people loved it fell in love with it and i think now we are efficient we can do the project within the timeframe and within the budget even if some clients would hold me on that point but we still have the ability to sprinkle the same amount of stardust and we also found an efficiency in that i think we have a great creative process with sharp elbows we fought us to a position to be able to have time to come up with ideas we say we can create a concept for you it ll take nine or eight months that s our point of negotiation and sometimes it doesn t work and then we have a strong project management that collect all the info and the background info of the project and we collect a broad group of creatives from our studio our directors copywriters storytellers interior architects interior designers project designers and me we read through the documents and the history and the background and we start throwing ideas and then after two hours we stop and then we wait at least three or four days until we sit again and stop and then we wait three or four days until we start again and then we can run these processes parallel for different sometimes we had 20 projects in the ids stage going on at the same time and the thing that they start to even though their result is really different because it s a kind of different recipe with the owner with the building s history and the purpose of the project they start to feed each other idea wise and also the time in between those four days in between your brain is still working on it because sometimes i notice we sit down again and people say i saw this film with my wife this weekend and they had this background or i went to london and i met a friend and he told me and then they start to kind of so it s an extremely efficient way of inventing the wheel every time ssr right i love it how did you come up with that the start stop start stop enj i think it was because everybody had it s very strong childcare in sweden so everybody is like to go and pick up your kids at the kindergarten is the holy thing that you cannot miss that you get the evil eye from the kindergarten lady if you re too late so i wanted everybody to be in the meeting i felt also we had a lot of interns that a great idea is very democratic you don t need a big long education or being an old person to come up with a great idea it can come from wherever and especially when people with different background are bouncing their heads together so in the middle of the process somebody said i have to go and pick up my kids otherwise i ll get the evil eye and we stopped the meeting and we rescheduled and i noticed that we can run this process as parallel and then we kind of try to make it as a rule because we notice that and i think it makes sense sometimes the clients are really really neglecting that if you want a high quality idea which is actually the thing that can create a huge cue outside your hotel or your restaurant then you have to respect that it takes time it s the most important kind of asset or the most important contribution that we add to the table of course and sometimes we even have our clients in those processes at some points some of the meetings and some other times we don t so i think that s a little bit of a creative process but also it ends up the first meetings we kind of get the also like a saying to explain how our method is that we never do the film without doing the script first so we try to create an emotional argumentation why people shall fall in love with this place before we start to use too much time before we start to invest and then we have one of our great storytellers to put it into a format our great story half a page not too long not too short lots of emotion in it and in the middle and it s such a great tool it s almost like a ton of mood board you could ask your client can you read through this and do you feel the magnetism in this narrative will that do the job you think will people fall in love with this and then we also notice if you do that first the process is so much more effective ssr right because you have this playbook to come back to right enj exactly and if you compare it which makes a lot of sense for people even not in the hospitality design business that you have to do the script before we do the film it s so easy to understand that it s really difficult for the set decorator to start his job without the script he could start to buy the decor and maybe you need cars in this film let s get some cars whatever but i really noticed that because you know exactly what you re looking for and it s a lot of shares in the world there s a lot of fabrics in the world there s a lot of patterns you have to kind of narrow it down and understand what kind of world are you trying to achieve and what story do you want to tell so that s something we ve really been doing from the beginning i also wrote a book many years ago now and it s like you know the hospitality educations here in sweden and norway and denmark it s called storytelling as a tool for the hospitality industry or something so it s like to get or i did illustrations and there was a professor that did the writing but i talked a lot and she took notes but we really worked with that very early on and we didn t find it somewhere else we just intuitively felt that this is the right way to approach it because it became easier and we also always take when we do the story which is half a page maybe we also synthesize it down to a sentence we also landed the name for that from the film industry the five word pitch if you can t sell your idea in five words it s not strong enough and i also think that our firm is you get almost for free in the bargain at pr strategy because it s so easy to talk about our project it s so easy to be very very early on we think about what is the one image that s going tell the story here and you work with this and i think the best asset you can have as a hotelier or a restaurant especially a hotelier if you can create one good image that is explaining in a split of a second the emotional argumentation as to why people should fall in love with it that s your pr strategy ssr yep i love it because you re an editor right you re actually editing it all down to what it should be and i think that s where places get that authentic voice right that everyone craves or wants but if you can distill down what you re doing into a simple sentence i think that sets you up for so much success enj because you have to do the thinking it s a lot of work behind that i was really impressed by norway which is my country because they boil down a slogan for the country for the argumentation of going as a tourist to norway and it s powered by nature it s three words and the more i think about it it works for oslo it works for a city it works for going to a restaurant it works for going to the fjords it works for hiking in the mountains whatever the produce in a restaurant in the center of oslo it s also powered by nature because you got the fish there you got the crops it contributes very few people it s a lot of nature so you get the barriers from the forest and whatever and that s really really difficult it s so easy when you hear it but the work behind is the top of the pyramid and you really need to finish your thinking first and i think it s like if you re an editor i m putting a great headline capturing the whole essence of the story that might run for 14 pages that s more difficult than writing the whole 14 pages i think ssr i think that s what we spend the most time on our headlines and decks and enj and also on an experience i think if you interview some of our successful clients then that s the biggest asset i think they would say that they got from us because it s such a good tool when you have to start to talk about your place and get it out ssr you re giving them free marketing advice that s great so you said that it took a while to get profitable for those starting out and creating their own businesses how did you turn it what was the trick to go from being an artist collaborative to a successful business design firm enj for me i think it was when i met elizabeth my wife not my late wife because she s not dead but we are kind of splitting up now but we are still collecting working together but when i met her many years ago her father was an accountant working for british petroleum he was the boss of british petroleum accounting in sweden and he was just retired and he retired overnight this is your last day of working and he was finished his fingers was itching so he started to kind of look through our papers and he told me that you have to pay the vat that s very important you have to pay tax and i said do i really have to yes you have to so he started to kind of clean it up he got rid of part of the dna of an artist collective thinking only creative things is good and the rest is shit and were never interested in being the ceo myself because i knew that i was as to remember i knew i was really bad at that direction so i always had other people taking care of business side of it but after that it started to go better and then the next lesson i think was that it s so so easy to lose money on the project especially when there are some project we sign is maybe four five years long and you have to negotiate a contract in the beginning before you start and you can do one wrong sentence in that contract and you fuck up the two last years and so you have to be really good at signing contracts and you have to put in stuff in the contract so you are able to get paid for extras that comes up and you have to know all the dirty tricks that the client side can have can possibly we come up with which is impossible so when you get better at that then you have a fair chance of making money on your projects and then i think we did a mistake i was really intrigued by working globally so right now we are working on five different continents we have live project in five different continents ssr wow enj and i thought that s really cool but it s tricky for the profits germany is a very close neighbor to sweden and when we did our refresh project in germany we were really caught by surprise by the actual responsibility of the interior designer it means something else than in sweden that we were used to and then you learn the lesson that if you want to we are doing a 25 hours in melbourne in the australia now and our project is four phases basically they start with a concept and there we said we learned our lesson australia is far away it takes two days to get there whatever so it s not possible for us to be on meetings every second week or whatever so we said we do the two first phases and then we have to find a local architect so that we can collaborate with and they will do under our supervision design wise they will do the two last legs in the adventure and then we will come down for the opening and drink champagne and that also secures the possibility to make profitable project around the world incredibly there s a lot of tricks but i think the best advice if i have to give one advice to people that want to start up is that realize that because i think most people like me they did it because they were creative and they thought i have the ability to create magic and do places that people want to go into but admit that running a business is a different education it s a different skill set you need to take care of your staff you need to encourage both the creativity and also the limits of the time you spend and they have to understand the relation to money how long time it would it take for this bar to get their return of the investment and understanding all these things and understanding the importance of paying bills in time and simple things like that but admit for yourself that it s a different skillset so maybe partner up with somebody who s good at that or buy those services or learn it yourself at least that was i think my biggest mistake in the beginning ssr got it enj i would have a nicer car earlier that s people s goal in the world it s a metaphor ssr do you have the five words for your company enj yes but it s not five it s ssr or the one sentence enj it s hospitality extraordinare which english word actually which is kind of borrowed for extraordinary with french spelling ssr french flair enj french flair right and i kind of learned that expression long time ago and it has like a connotation that it s extra everything ssr yep enj and we often say that we will fail if we are not able to create a love story between the user and the hotel and so it s emotional driven so that s why that sentence is really really important so that s our external kind of five word pitch and our internal and also maybe eternal is let s make better mistakes tomorrow ssr i love that one what is it about hospitality that you love so much you said early on you dedicated what you wanted to do or you dedicated your firm to doing hospitality what was it or what is it about hospitality that draws you to it enj my father was an engineer he was working on a company that took in imported vents and really kind of technical equipment and sold to the oil drilling industry in norway that was kind of growing and booming he represented different companies from different parts of the world so he often had to go out to take a drink with the people from abroad that came to oslo where i grew up and i really loved sometimes he took me to the bar at the sas hotel in oslo the coolest skyscraper i was mesmerized and one time i was not so old i was six years i think and it was gentlemen from the united states that were invited over and he d happened to tell me that he was like an american indian like a native american and i was so excited i told him i have to come and i came in and i was so disappointed because he had a suit and a tie on this gentleman but i really love that so i think this public spaces that make people feel different things i think it s my as i told you before my three dimensional collage is my art but in a big scale you can enter it and then we met on different events in the hospitality industry and it s really people they re from the hospitality so number one they need to be nice to people they need to be good huggers they need to be open arms they need to be inviting people they need to be good at conversation so i m in love with the people i m in love with the people from this industry it s really nice people i doubt that if i had been a car mechanics that the events in that world would ve been as fun ssr no i do always say that the hospitality world are people like no other that you ve ever met so okay let s talk a little bit about projects was there one project that you think was your big break or really put you on the map one that helped you grow your business enj i think yes there are a few milestones first time we did a restaurant with a good budget and i think our kind of international when people started to get eyes open for us as a company from sweden we got the hotel sonya is a radisson now in st petersburg in russia and it was the baltic countries the three baltic countries largest hotel group revol hotels that s the kind of name of the company and they wanted to i think your magazine did a story of this hotel and they wanted us to do their first venture in st petersburg and they told us that the baltics kind of turned back to russia they went towards europe and became members of the european union and things like that so we really don t have a emotional asset for the people of st petersburg to fall in love with us so we needed to kind of think of that so we went there to russia that was my first time in russia and we were there for a week i think we got paid for some of the days but not all of the days and we kind of started to soak in and i had a very very pre kind of stupid image i thought the russians were like the villains in the james bond movies but i found these people with double educations you went to school for engineering and then you went to school for poetry so you could have something to discuss in the bar when you met people and we also found a reason for that and the reason for that was that peter de great he didn t found a city he wanted to do rival paris as the cultural capital of the world so that was the purpose of doing this city and you can see it in the planning it s planned around the institutions it s planned around the big museums and the opera and stuff like that and it s also the official capital culture of russia and they have 30 of their leonard da vinci paintings in the world in their museums there and they got the mariinsky theater and what have you and at the same time we went to all hotels and they were either sheratons or hiltons or they tried to look like an american chain hotel ssr interesting enj that made a lot of sense after the iron curtain fell i think so we really said imagine if we could kind of build a hotel on this thing that people already were proud of so we found an interview with a very famous chef i think it was newsweek the magazine that interviewed him and the last question in interview was what is the best guidebook to st petersburg and he answered in a very russian manner he said read crime and punishment by fyodor dostoevsky it s the most accurate portrait ever written of this city so we thought if we can translate that book that is the most accurate portrait of this city into hotel experience that would be fantastic so we managed after a lot of convincing to our client that they should invest their 20 million dollar investment in the story of this student killing his pawn broker ssr and i was like have you read crime and punishment enj with an axe but it s very important book written 150 years ago from the great son of the city the greatest author from russia i think and it is a story that every russian and many many others already have a relation to so after a long kind of ramp like that they swallowed hard and said okay let s do it then so we did it and i think we did it in a clever way sometimes in your face sometimes very subtle sometimes you need to ask to understand it but the hotel almost exploded in the beginning they got a phone call after one week and it was ivan amachenku the mayor her assistant saying that ivan amachenku is coming tomorrow to open your hotel and they said it has to be a mistake and they said no she s coming tomorrow at noon and she came with i don t know but 20 journalists and she heard about this hotel in a blog and she said this is us this hotel is us this is what the story we want to tell to the world everybody thinks we are james bond villains but we are the cultural capital of the world i want to endorse this project she said and she brought two people to the opening and one was the manager of the dot mariinsky museum and they prepared a contract between hotel that they were together promoting the big son of the city and she also brought a tram driver who was called dimitri dostoyevsky he was the great great great grandfather of the author and he s basically working there now taking tours and eating dinner with i think he s only paid by free bar for life something like that and the investment the budget was the same budget they would have had anyway infusing this story into the mathematics it became a hotel that was really as respected and loved by the city which is the key to make it interesting for travelers that arrive there ssr that s amazing i mean as a designer that must make you feel so proud right that you created something that s helping a city as a whole enj i was there not long ago two years ago or something and it was 12 or 10 years old and i asked the manager that i never met because he was new and i asked him a question i usually ask what is the most negative thing on tripadvisor the critic that you get and he said it used to be the dark corridors and i said used to yeah because we got a student working in the reception half a year ago and she was a dedicated dostoyevsky fan and she knew everything about him and she came here because she heard the story and she asked can i work here and she got a job and she always starts by saying welcome to the world of crime and punishment of dostoyevsky and after that they raised two points in general on tripadvisor without investing anything because the dark corridors made sense because they are supposed to reflect the feverish walks of raskolnikov the main character that chopped head of the old lady ssr i mean i guess it s setting expectations right you come in the door she tells you that and then you re like oh well now i expect this right so instead of enj also i think the internet and the distribution of hotels has kind of forced it into a very generic set of information do you have a pool or not or do you have large other rooms do you have a bathtub or not so all this information that differentiates the hotel from all the others which this story does until somebody else becomes number two and do the same thing they are really really important i think that s one of the great asset of storytelling and trying to find something to attached id too when you start up and try to understand the emotional argumentation of why people should fall in love ssr has there been one project that you learned the most from that was the most challenging i mean i m sure you learned something at every project but one that you really kind of made you think and made you find an inventive solution enj it s a lot of them i think we did 12 years ago maybe klaus k in helsinki which was the first member of design hotels in finland and it was a big success and they asked us after interviewing a lot of finish designers and the finland has good designers they have a huge industry of designing cruise ship or building cruise ships but the manager he was a manager and owner he was from new york from americ he was kind of thinking a little bit outside the box compared to other fins on the market and the building was called klaus kuki which is a character from the north finnish national ipos so he said somehow i want to work with that narrative and nobody there all the finish designers thought that was too tacky or maybe they said tacky and felt it was scary a scary road to go i might become the laughing stock of my fellow designers because i took on this impossible task and we really liked it and we did a very kind of modern interpretation of that story which is extremely important finland was under russian rule for many many years and then under swedish rules so during the russian rule this book was a banned it was illegal because it was stories from 1600 years back in time when they were free so that s why it was so important for their freedom movement and it s like any genesis story it s really crazy shit and i would like to smoke the things that the person that wrote the book smoked and the genesis story is about a bird it s before land exists so it s a bird landing in the ocean laying an egg and it falls down to the bottom of the ocean and it cracks and the yoke becomes land so we have the seven eggs we have the reception desk looks very modern still looks modern but it s like one of eggs and it divided the hotel into the dark and fair side so the nightclub and the restaurants are on the dark side and half of the rooms were on the light side and i really learned there that there is also always like the same thing in st petersburg there is always something that unifies a group of people let s say in this case the films and it s their sense of pride or it s something that makes you american or that has a kinship to other americans and if you can find that and work with it it s super strong it s effective it s like from day one you open a hotel that s already famous because that book is already famous and it s liked and people from finland said that well i didn t really read it but i remember my grandmother read it to me when i was a kid and she figured it was very important but there also a risk going that path designing because you could end up becoming the laughing stock end up destroying their national ethos and making a very bad interpretation and so you have to kind of have to be brave and dare to do it but if you manage to land on your feet the reward is fantastic ssr you just have to land on your feet enj yes greatly ssr exactly okay let s talk about the one that just won an hd award so congratulations yay enj thank you ssr pater noster which was an old lighthouse i mean it s such a cool talk about an idea that or being super authentic that you can t replicate i mean tell us a little bit about it and how is an old lighthouse and how you turned it into a cool hotel and where it s located enj talk about that project that i talked about before having one image that kind of sells the whole emotional argument and there is a few drone pictures that i took on the little speco land this little tiny island in the big big ocean and nothing around it and i think the part of the success of pater noseter is the pandemic that was a rare time in history that every person on earth was sharing the same problem and this image kind of percented the solution somehow you can run away from everything out there and there s problem free but normally i present myself as a i m a fisherman trapped in the hotel designer s body so i really like going fishing and we have a summer house north of goberg and i have a boat there and when i have spare time i go there go fishing and to get the bigger fish you need to go far out where the lighthouse is is very dangerous reefs and the lease was up for grabs and it s the government of sweden that managed it and the branch that managed the royal castle and the fortresses and the importance historical buildings and it wasn t the case of bidding the highest paying the highest rent it was just a case of it was a fixed rent and case of them believing the people behind has the skillset because it s really really difficult to manage a nine room hotel on an island very far away every bottle of wine have to be brought there by boats and boats are very expensive and the glass have to be brought back with a boat and thrown away and we had some friends that also had a love or relationship with the island my business partner at stilt he really likes sailing and we had friends with a restaurants license liquor license and so we had a good skillset of people seven partners so we won the contract beginning of not last summer but the summer so we won the year and a couple of months they ve been running it and it was obviously in the middle of covid and the biggest crisis in the hotel industry s history so we thought what shall we do with it we didn t obviously have a huge budget we didn t want to risk too much but it s also the first project that i became a partner in also in the operations but still it was the design company that did the concept and we read an old book that talked about the lighthouse people and it was 1868 they opened and they opened after a long long debate 50 years debate that everybody said that it would be much better for the ships to put a lighthouse out there because the lighthouse was further in land and it was very inaccurate so people crashed in the reefs because of that and people said in the same sentence that but you can t live on that island it s too sparse it s too difficult to get food whatever and then they built the lighthouse and three families moved out because it was kerosene driven and it was like a clockwork mechanism that you had to wind up every hour that turned the whole thing around to make the blink sequence and so it was three people that had to run it and they were entitled to bring their families so it was family moving out and they proved all the skeptics wrong they had a really good life there all the kids that were born in the winter half of the year they were born on the island because they couldn t go into the hospital because of the weather and they were fishing they were hunting seals sea birds and they were never short of food and they had a really great life even they were growing tomatoes in lantern because it was kerosene driven it was very hot and they got fresh tomatoes all the way around and that story inspired us and then the lighthouse was abandoned in 1977 because it was a fully mechanical lighthouse that was built in the middle of ocean so the building started getting destroyed and everything and then the lighthouse itself which is in cast iron was supposed to be dragged out in the sea and then people started to protest because it was like a symbol of whatever and they managed to raise money to restore it so now it was beautifully restored and we said that we don t want to open hotel we just want to open the home of the lighthouse masters and invite people to live on terms and conditions of this island which means that you have to follow the chef down to the shore and pick the seaweeds and go back in the kitchen and help to prepare the eel grass seaweed that if you fry it in oil for 20 seconds it turns into truffle it tastes like truffle you can make fantastic stuff with it and we fish lobster and we fish without lines so that s what we wanted to do so we said that okay how can we make this an authentic home or the lighthouse master and we decided to buy a 70 of all the furniture it s second hand from the area to get the right dna and we bought new art contemporary art mixed that together with black and white footage from old people that we met that told us my father was a lighthouse master i grew up on this island we managed to take pictures of their albums at home and i was stuck there last summer because it was a lot of swedes that came that couldn t go abroad they couldn t go to their villa in france or whatever so they came to visit us because they thought it was exotic and people really really loved it and i was there with my drone i was there with my camera and one day i thought this sunset is the best sunset ever and i flew up with my drone i took the picture and then two days later it was an even better sunset and four days later it was even better so i kind of refined my album of footage the whole summer and then i started to send it out to a few people that i knew in end of august and it just exploded it just went by itself i think on the potential reach which is the way you measure digital newspapers we have until now 14 i m not saying the wrong thing but 14 billion people that we have met it s like double the number of people in the world ssr wow enj and then i think it s more than 6 000 articles written about it ssr well i can t wait to visit it it looks magical just watching time i could talk to you forever but you mentioned this has been the worst thing to hit the hospitality industry with covid what has the last year been like for you how has it changed you as a leader and how do you see the industry evolving or changing or just moving forward enj i think from the beginning i was very afraid i was petrified and all the employees and i think everybody in the industries had a wait and see attitude they stopped all the investments but then some brave people said that we did a restaurant locally here in goberg during the pandemic and it was a guy i made good money through the years and i never think the opportunity to close my restaurant and run away has been better than now so i was planning to run away in two years time but i m going to do it now because there is no clients anyway and then you have a lot of operators that have been struggling and that had the need to bring on more capital or more money which means actually more other people being in charge or owning part and new people means need for innovation they want to do things slightly different and i think there we could be relevant for them and that we see that enj but i think it has changed me as like a colleague or my other are partners and my employees said this was like one of the things i think it was almost like 9 11 for people living in new york that it was unimaginable before it happened and then actually after wow it can happen and i remember i read a protocol from a board meeting we had at stilt i think one month before it hit so it was in february or something and we sat there and we re like okay what about this virus from china there we don t see that as a threat at all it won t come here we didn t have it in our vocabulary so i think being humble that big change can happen and nothing will last forever ever and also this will pause that notion that feeling makes you much more prepared for the unexpected which i think is sometimes we have employees work as designers and architects and the project managers here that say that we have to find a way to work we have to find this we have to put down this blueprint of how we do things in which order we do things and i always thought that the set of people that are in a project would always be new and you have the client with the money a bag of money that he or she sorely earned through the times and you will have to pay us some of that money and you have to think that it s worth it but apart from that the process will be different because it s different people so you have to almost instead of creating a blueprint of how the project should be run you have to be prepared that it s going to be different every time and i think the pandemic taught us that the hard way and also a lot of tragic things in our industry for example that it s an eyeopener i think that we pay restaurant workers too low we don t treat and i think you see that in all the countries in the world that is difficult to find restaurant staff now because they were kicked out of their business and then they had to do something else and maybe they re working in a factory and they feel that well this factory is actually treating me better than before so it s a lot of learnings from it i think ssr how do you see the industry changing or adapting moving forward enj in respect to the crisis ssr after covid do you see it changing enj i think there are things that everybody are expecting everybody says that it seems like everybody tried to convert a hotel into some city resort destination with a lot of fun things to do so every boring business hotel need to be more colorful or something because they saw that that was the only hotels that worked during the pandemic that had like an entertainment content somehow or another and i think also that a lot of people think that the big conferences with thousands of people will be the last thing to return but then you have people being really really hungry for entertainment having a good time so if you try to find a trip a package trip now to a warmer climate during the winters everything is sold out and i think it s in many respect it was like an amplifier of existing trends so for example like we are doing now you are in new york and i m here and we talk to each other and that was much more alienated before and i remember in copenhagen it s three hours by car from here and we are doing a hotel project there also a 25 hours and the owners said that you really have to be here every week for a meeting and we know those meetings that is maybe a 2 or four 5 of the meeting is concerning interior design they have the electricity the vents and whatever and then he was forced to do them digitally and then he suddenly said that this is much more efficient it s cheaper so a lot of people were forced into that and i think also this programs zoom and skype and whatever it has become so much better and then i think if you have hotels like which is very very experienced driven and it s like entering a world with different terms and conditions and on the other side of the spectrum you have hotels that actually are delivering capacity of rooms to a big city where there is a big traffic they will be struggling more and more because there is no emotional argumentation and the unique experiences that actually gives you stories and ammunition to go back and tell your friends what you have experienced they will really really be the winners and i think when we read the briefs from all the big hotel companies about their brands and what us designers have to think about it seems like everybody s writing the same thing they want to kind of be relevant to the local community they want to be experience driven and of course it s difficult when you re called marriott but it s easier when you are actually a very small independent something that not even called a hotel so the experience driven hotels i think will have a faster renaissance than they had actually before and i think also a big takeaway for me is that i ve been really missing my industry and hugging my nice friends around the world and my mother had a very simple philosophy never forgets to hug if you remember that your life will be better you will die maybe with a smile on your lips it has a big consequence and i even realized and learned that she was even more right than i thought before this pandemic ssr i love that i m going to keep that in mind that is amazing well and i think that s a perfect place to stop erik thank you so much for taking this time to chat with me it s been such a pleasure as always enj thank you it was my pleasure it was fun ssr hopefully i ll see you in real life soon enj hopefully they will let europeans in before your next event ssr yes that would be lovely enj when they open up i ll be there i promise you ssr great we ll have a glass of champagne to celebrate the hd award enj maybe two awesome ssr yes we can do all right enj excellent ssr thank you so much see you soon keep in touch with everything you re working on please enj i will thank you so much

crude oil surged 4 on tuesday boosting crude etfs as well ahead of the much anticipated api crude oil inventory data report as well as predictions that spiking coronavirus cases and the dissemination of the omicron variant will prove less harmful to a global demand recovery than believed yesterday brent crude climbed 2 6 or 3 22 to 83 46 a barrel its highest level since early november after having shed 1 in the previous session meanwhile u s benchmark west texas intermediate wti ripped over 3 20 or 4 higher to 81 59 also notching its highest since mid november after dipping 0 8 in the prior session due to coronavirus concerns over the weekend the country of cyprus said it discovered a coronavirus variant that combines the omicron and delta variants which has been dubbed the deltacron variant specifically the variant has omicron like genetic signatures within the delta genomes according to cnbc leondios kostrikis professor of biological sciences at the university of cyprus said that 25 cases of the virus had been found any transmissibility and severity of the data remain unclear according to cnbc we will see in the future if this strain is more pathological or more contagious or if it will prevail kostrikis said experts were uncertain if the deltacron variant is real or not with biologist eric topol of the scripps research translational institute stating that deltacron might be a scariant resulting from an error or a new subtype of scariant that isn t even a real variant but scares a lot of people unnecessarily topol tweeted while kostrikis certainly disagrees it s a reminder to investors that the pandemic is far from over as covid 19 can continue to mutate and create new variants in the previous session crude fell along with stocks as deltacron worries generated demand fears for crude oil investors particularly with regard to china which has in the past aggressively closed off infected regions of the country to stem the spread of the virus on tuesday however the market had reversed any fears of demand on reports that deltacron may be the result of a lab error the cypriot deltacron sequences reported by several large media outlets look to be quite clearly contamination tom peacock a virologist with the infectious diseases department at imperial college london tweeted over the weekend according to peacock the reported new strain was most likely the result of a lab error that commingled samples from patients infected by omicron and others by delta adding to crude s rise is news that opec s excess capacity will diminish into the second half of 2022 as it gradually boost output targets between now and then at the speed of as much as an additional 400 000 barrels per day bpd each month a dearth of capacity in some countries signaled that supply increases by the opec are running beneath the allowable increase under a pact with its allies in addition federal reserve chair powell said on tuesday that he expects the economic impact of the omicron variant to be short lived he also commented that upcoming quarters could be very beneficial for the economy after omicron subsides combination of facts that demand is going to be stronger than anticipated and that opec s supply may not be grow as fast as the demand is why prices are climbing said phil flynn senior analyst at price futures group omicron has yet to wreak the havoc of the delta variant and may never do so keeping the global recovery on track said jeffrey halley analyst at brokerage oanda crude oil has been on a tear since last year with brent climbing by 50 in 2021 and gaining further traction so far this year with investors projecting increasing demand a weaker u s dollar also helped to bolster oil as it makes oil less costly for buyers holding other currencies and typically reflects higher risk appetite among investors the dollar weakened in part because traders are concerned with december inflation data that is scheduled to be released on wednesday as well as potential interest rate increases by the federal reserve upcoming reports on u s inventories are predicting crude stockpiles to drop by about 2 million barrels meanwhile the biden administration is hoping to minimize the region of land in alaska that is available for oil drilling potentially reversing trump era legislation that opened up 82 of the national petroleum reserve for drilling the hill writes according to reuters the trump administration failed to help reverse a decline in alaska oil production which fell to the lowest in 43 years in 2020 as oil companies focused on the lower 48 under the revisions made by the bureau of land management approximately 52 of the national petroleum reserve will remain open for oil drilling but the bureau also said that it will keep some stipulations from the trump era legislation namely certain more protective lease stipulations and operating procedures for threatened and endangered species this decision reflects the biden harris administration s priority of reviewing existing oil and gas programs to ensure balance on america s public lands and waters to benefit current and future generations the bureau of land management said in a statement all of these economic and geopolitical factors could be bullish for crude oil and investors looking to use etfs to trade a continuing upswing could consider employing crude etfs like the united states oil fund uso which is up over 3 4 on tuesday and the proshares ultra bloomberg crude oil uco which has climbed almost 6 5 thanks to leverage for investors looking for crude etfs to play the run up in oil which has been robust since november the united states 12 month oil fund usl and the ipath pure beta crude oil etn oil are two other funds to consider meanwhile for those investors with more bearish leanings the proshares ultrashort bloomberg crude oil sco offers opportunities for savvy investors if oil sells off for more news information and strategy visit

was the acquisition worth it for the fintech leader square now block sq 3 84 has gone through its fair share of changes lately its name change being the most obvious but the company is also taking another huge step in the form of a 29 billion acquisition of australian fintech company afterpay aftp f the purchase is expected to close later this quarter in this segment of backstage pass recorded on dec 17 fool contributors toby bordelon travis hoium jason hall and lou whiteman discuss 10 stocks we like better than block inc when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and block inc wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of december 16 2021 toby bordelon i like this one travis because it s in the news today or not the deal itself but the industry we re talking about you ve got square and afterpay what s going on here travis hoium this was one of the biggest deals that we re going to talk about i think lou beat me by a little bit but square acquiring afterpay this page in their presentation announcing the deal really sums it all up to me what square s business has really become was the square app for businesses for processing payments and the cash app which was primarily for consumers for individuals started out as transferring money to pay for pizza or something like that five six years ago now you can trade bitcoin you can buy and sell stocks you can do all kinds of financial it s become really a financial app for consumers more than anything else but they really lived separately it s been really interesting watching square s business grow over the last few years is you could have this cash app and not even realize that it s a square product because it doesn t really say it anywhere when they acquired afterpay the idea was really to have a bridge between those two products this is i think a precursor to not only what i think square s trying to build in the payments business i think they re trying to effectively cut out the middleman meaning visa mastercard american express and all the banks and have people pay directly with the cash app you can now pay with the cash app on square devices for some sellers i think we re going to keep pushing that forward ironically then a little bit later they renamed themselves block and i had to write this down because they said they re going to keep square the cash app title and tbd54566975 which is their bitcoin something or other business are all going to keep their own brands now i don t know if that tbd brand is a great brand right now the idea for them i think is we ve got all these really strong businesses and how are we going to pull them together afterpay was at least one thesis on how to do that now whether or not that succeeds long term is maybe another story but i think if we see square trying to find ways to cut out the credit card business and go directly from i should say block product to another block product where they re doing the transaction in the middle i think that could be a really interesting and really disruptive thing for the company long term jason hall i want to address the naming i have to hoium it s a mess hall alphabet got it right i think actually facebook may have gotten it right too we ll find out depending on their execution but jack just charlie browned this one he really did it s terrible hoium it s block xyz is their website hall he s embracing the block chain a little bit too tight lou whiteman square s ceo could learn something from the twitter ceo and what he did recently in my humble opinion bordelon step down whiteman look just real quick on this because i don t doubt that square is a great company i would not bet against them i wouldn t short them but i personally decided to buy paypal instead of square and this afterpay to me it backs up that decision they paid 29 billion for this which is a very attractive feature but it s a feature paypal has the same technology because looking forward back in 2008 they bought bill me later for 945 million they were proactive not reactive paypal in their history going back 15 years has bought a couple of dozen companies for a grand total of 13 billion jack spent 29 billion to play catch up on a feature it s such a huge market there s multiple winners i don t doubt square will be a winner but i don t trust jack and i don t trust square and afterpay the price they re paying for it that confirms my bias bordelon you re saying 945 million to you is a better deal than 29 billion whiteman also the foresight to buy it in 2008 versus oh shoot we re playing catch up in 2020 bordelon that s fair that s fair whiteman i don t know i m over simplifying terribly but i don t know hall i m so happy to be on a show with you lou whiteman jack you can look at me up on twitter if you d like i think you re still a user on there bordelon maybe he ll put you on his christmas card list whiteman i ll be the shadow guy bordelon actually take advice to retire from his second company right hoium this is one of those things though that i think one of the things with jack dorsey we don t really know what he s thinking necessarily with some of these things until maybe five years later we know that he is obsessed with bitcoin there s something going on here with their payments app the cash app bitcoin afterpay there s some sort of i don t know i can see hall misunderstood genius here right travis whiteman you didn t mention the music app hoium i m drinking the kool aid on some of the stuff crypto is here to stay i think that s pretty clear if you ve ever done transactions in some of the not necessarily bitcoin but some of the faster cryptos there s no reason that i can t just connect my crypto wallet to pay for dinner or whatever and effectively have a fee that s a fraction of a penny as opposed to paying almost three percent which is what you re paying square and square doesn t keep most of that money there s something potentially interesting here to lou s point i don t know if afterpay was really needed in that vision of the future but i want to withhold judgment too much because i think there s some integration and disruption going on here in jack s mind we just don t know quite what it looks like yet

this basket of industrial ev and technology stocks is poised to grow over the long term we re only a few weeks into 2022 and it has already felt like months with market volatility causing stocks large and small to seesaw up and down seemingly at a moment s notice if you re looking for some worthwhile growth stocks to buy and hold through the storm you ve come to the right place lithium americas lac chargepoint holdings chpt 2 42 and cognex corporation cgnx 2 54 are three growth stocks that could be good buys in january power growth in your portfolio with this ev play scott levine lithium americas if you re like most growth investors you ve undoubtedly come across plenty of ink spilled about electric vehicles since the market is expected to grow considerably over the next decade the international energy agency estimates that there were 10 million electric vehicles evs on worldwide roads at the end of 2020 and it projects that the global fleet of evs will rise to between 145 million and 230 million with growth like this coming down the pike it s no wonder that investors are charged up about lithium stocks such as lithium americas the coming year is expected to be an important one for lithium americas while the company has two assets in its portfolio one in argentina and one in nevada neither of the projects has commenced operations yet but that should change in 2022 construction is advancing on schedule at cauchari olaroz and management expects operations to begin in the middle of the year the first stage of the project is expected to achieve average annual lithium carbonate production of 40 000 metric tons assuming a long range lithium carbonate price of 12 000 per tonne management forecasts cauchari olaroz will generate earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda of 308 million annually meanwhile the company also expects to begin construction of stage two representing annual lithium carbonate production of about 20 000 metric tons at cauchari olaroz in 2022 with operations commencing in 2025 while lithium americas is expected to begin operations in argentina this year investors will have to wait a little longer for the company s project in nevada to start up however investors can look for the company to make progress at thacker pass in 2022 management expects to begin early construction work in the first half of the year for a pre revenue company like lithium americas there are plenty of risks that surround an investment but with the company trading about 29 lower than the all time high of 41 56 that it reached in november growth investors have the opportunity to pick up shares while they re in the bargain bin a high risk high reward ev play worth considering daniel foelber chargepoint leading ev infrastructure company chargepoint has had a rough go of it as of late share prices of chargepoint stock are down 62 in the past year as investors question the path to profitability for ev charging chargepoint is losing money and doesn t plan to turn a profit for the next few years however like lithium americas its growth is finally picking up the pace as interest in evs rebounds after a covid 19 induced lull in 2020 chargepoint s fiscal year 2022 fy22 ends jan 31 2022 the company is expected to report those full year results sometime in early march its most recent guidance issued on dec 7 2021 said the company expects fy22 revenue between 235 million and 240 million for comparison it reported just 146 5 million in fy21 revenue and 144 5 million in fy20 revenue not only is chargepoint s top line growth improving but it s also increasing its gross margin a sign that it s charting a path toward profitability it s also opening more dc fast charging ports as opposed to its standard level 2 ports dc fast charging is what the tesla supercharger network is built upon although unnecessary in cases where a car is parked for an extended period of time think at home in a garage or at work chargepoint stands to benefit from increasing its dc port count to appeal to more customers in locations where faster charging is in high demand despite chargepoint s potential the company remains a high risk high reward option in the ev space even with revenue growing at a breakneck pace chargepoint s fy22 revenue guidance would give it a price to sales ratio of 22 5 which is expensive even for a growth stock therefore chargepoint could best be paired with other top ev stocks like lithium americas to diversify risk and still capture upside the machine vision company s long term growth drivers remain in place lee samaha cognex corporation beset with rising raw material and supply chain costs and coming off a year when it disappointed investors cognex doesn t appear to be the ideal growth stock candidate however do you buy a growth stock when it s firing on all cylinders and speculative investors are driving its valuation ever higher or do you buy it when it s lost some of its luster yet still has lots of growth potential if you favor the latter approach then cognex could be for you the third quarter earnings report indeed fell short of expectations and there s no denying that its elevated freight and component costs are likely to persist through the fourth quarter into 2022 that said there are three reasons one from each of its main markets why i think cognex could be one of the best industrial stocks in 2022 first the company s profit margin took a hit from extra costs incurred in helping a high profile logistics customer deploy cognex s solutions however cognex s management believes the customer could place multiple orders in the future and e commerce warehouse logistics is a strong growth industry so don t be surprised if cognex announces large logistics orders in 2022 second cognex had a good year in the automotive sector and demonstrated it would benefit from automakers spending on ev production lines throw in recovery in global automotive production in 2022 and cognex is likely to have another good year in the automotive market finally the company s consumer electronics orders apple is its largest customer disappointed in 2021 still with the semiconductor shortage hopefully clearing up through 2022 it s possible customers may elect to ramp capital spending on new projects in time for production in the fourth quarter as such cognex could receive orders in the second and third quarters

candidate utilizing glaukos ilution platform s patented cream based drug formulations that are applied to the outer surface of the eyelid for dropless transdermal delivery of pharmaceutically active compounds for the treatment of eye disorders glk 302 s active pharmaceutical ingredient is pilocarpine the phase 2 multi center randomized double masked placebo controlled trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three different dose levels of glk 302 administered twice daily bid to the eyelid versus placebo over 28 days for improving mesopic high contrast binocular distance corrected near visual acuity dcnva while not deteriorating binocular best corrected distance visual acuity bcdva in presbyopic patients the company anticipates it will enroll approximately 120 presbyopic patients in the study across clinical sites in the united states we believe ilution has the potential to address the major unmet need for presbyopic patients by providing an effective easy to administer safe dropless transdermal therapeutic today s announcement represents a significant milestone in the development of our ilution platform and for our company said thomas burns glaukos president and chief executive officer the dosing of the first patient in the phase 2 study brings us one step closer to an innovative near vision solution for the millions of patients who suffer from presbyopia we are privileged to have the opportunity to explore what glk 302 can do for presbyopic patients in our phase 2 trial presbyopia is a natural part of aging due to the hardening of the eye s crystalline lens over time resulting in a loss of lens elasticity or the ability of the lens to change shape in order to focus incoming light on the retina with this loss of flexibility eyes are less able to adjust properly to focus on near objects presbyopia usually becomes noticeable around the age of 40 and there is no proven way to stop or reverse the progression of presbyopia glk 302 is a

walking around grocery stores like seattle s leschi market on monday evidence of the mountain pass and freeway closures could be seen in the gaps among milk juice and cereal on the shelves wet weather potholes in washington make grocery deliveries challenging the past weekend saw western washington turned into an island as snoqualmie stevens white and blewett passes closed due to avalanche danger and high snowfall with the north cascades highway already closed for the season twenty miles of i 5 in lewis county closed on friday as well due to flooding as an independent retailer a lot of our main wholesalers are located in the greater portland greater vancouver area and even some things coming out of california so that can create a real stalemate to get product here said paul wilcox co owner and manager of leschi market three shipments were late this past week because of weather and closures that left leschi market with about 90 of their usual stock to start the week wilcox would like to normally be at 100 but he still feels lucky compared to what has happened to some of the larger grocery stores because leschi buys from many small local mom and pop suppliers those wholesalers were able to come make deliveries in their cars with no need for a semi truck to cross a mountain pass still wilcox said a delivery that is late by even a day can have repercussions delivery times are dramatically impacted with adverse weather wilcox said if we re expecting a delivery on saturday and it doesn t arrive until tuesday which just recently happened obviously that s lost sales that s product not on the shelf paul wilcox of leschi market in seattle says they ve been dealing with late shipments due to the weather and freeway closures leading to gaps on the shelves like you see here and when the milk does finally arrive it s that much closer to its pull date smallbusiness wawx pic twitter com dv2hbno6lb nicole jennings nicolekirofm january 11 2022 often wilcox has to write orders for new stock before the first batch has even arrived what is known to grocery stores as ordering blind it can be hard to guess what will need to be replenished in the next shipments when the products are not even on the shelf yet then there is the problem of pull dates a shipment that is three days late can significantly eat into the shelf life of a carton of milk the most important one is perishable dairy items wilcox explained not only are you out of product but you re fighting the expiration date process of it too meaning that we re going to receive that product even though we re going to receive it four days late you ve lost an additional four days of sales against that date mayor durkan vetoes council s repeal of hazard pay ordinance at the same time the market still owes that money to their wholesalers even if some of the products have to be tossed out due to impending expiration before they are sold the bill still comes in we still have to pay for it wilcox said he is hopeful that with more typical weather on the way there may not be any more major thoroughfare closures but other issues are still at play wilcox said that pandemic staffing shortages have impacted the warehouses that their products come from which also can lead to late deliveries you ve got four people trying to do the work of 10 trying to build a pallet get it on a truck and also have the truck get here on time wilcox said so that factors into it as well and they re also waiting on the manufacturer to deliver the product to the warehouse it s one big puzzle and we re all connected follow nicolekirofm

operations the following table summarizes our operating results for the three month periods ended november 30 2021 and 2020 in u s dollars third quarter ended november 30 2021 the net loss for the three month period ended november 30 2021 decreased 4 07 million to 10 10 million as compared to the net loss for the three month period ended november 30 2020 which was 14 17 million the decrease is primarily due to lower write down and impairment of property plant and equipment pp e expenses of 5 03 million offset by increased research and development expenses of 0 56 million and increased general and administrative expenses of 0 37 million the 5 03 million decrease in write down and impairment of pp e is related to the decision in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 to dedicate the terrebonne facility to brand activation initial customer volumes and infinite loop demonstration research and development activities although the machinery and equipment will continue to be utilized at the terrebonne facility as it is an integral part of supporting the commercialization of our technology application of asc 730 research and development costs requires machinery and equipment assets to be written off and all future costs associated with the terrebonne facility to be recognized as a research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss the 0 56 million increase in research and development for the three month period ended november 30 2021 was primarily attributable to the following 0 56 million increase in employee compensation expenses related to increased headcount to support the company s commercialization efforts 0 27 million increase in purchases of research and development machinery and equipment at the company s small scale production plant and 0 15 million increase in plant and laboratory operating expenses these increases were partially offset by a 0 64 million decrease in external engineering expenses as a

president biden today endorsed changing senate rules to allow for passage of voting rights reform which good luck with that not only are republicans aligned against the reform effort biden almost certainly faces blowback from his own party i ask every elected official in america biden said in a speech delivered in atlanta do you want to be on the side of dr king or george wallace do you want to be on the side of john lewis or bull connor democrats joe manchin and kyrsten sinema are likely to side with wallace and connor on the two signature voting rights bills the freedom to vote act which would protect mail in and absentee voting and the john lewis voting rights advancement act which would restore anti discrimination components of the voting rights act stripped by a supreme court decision in 2013 biden in the speech backed carving out an exception to the senate s rule allowing filibusters on matters involving voting rights the carve out would and this is a novel idea allowing voting rights bills to pass with a bare majority of votes instead of the 60 required to defeat a filibuster virginia s two democrats in the u s senate mark warner and tim kaine issued statements ahead of biden s speech neither directly addressed his call for a workaround on the filibuster to get the voting rights bills passed as a member of the greatest deliberative body in the world i continue to believe that we must preserve the senate s ability to debate contrasting viewpoints on matters of public policy warner said however voting is the bedrock of our democracy and it is a right that should never be up for contention as president biden doubles down on his efforts to safeguard democracy from the barrage of attacks by state legislatures virginians can be sure that i ll be working in the senate to do whatever it takes to protect americans access to the ballot throughout our history we ve made a lot of mistakes one of the ways we ve tried to protect against mistakes is broadening those who could participate kaine said a functioning democracy gives you the ability to correct mistakes shrinking who can participate putting burdens and obstacles in folks way it s not only harmful to those individuals whose rights are being taken away but it dramatically weakens the ability of a functioning electorate to correct mistakes and change courses and that is what is going on in these jurisdictions all over the country story by chris graham

when the los angeles department of water and power brings a 375 million deal this week the bonds are not likely to be dinged by the one notch downgrade to aa minus from fitch ratings in april nor the news in december that a former general manager had pleaded guilty to felony bribery a retail order period for the power system revenue bonds is planned for wednesday with institutional pricing slated for thursday barclays will run the books we do not believe the downgrade on the power bonds or the outlook change to negative on the water bonds from fitch had any material impact on the pricings based on our review of spreads to the mmd for bond issuances before the downgrade and outlook change compared to the june and november bond sales ellen cheng an ladwp spokeswoman said in an emailed response similar to recent pricings we do not believe it will have a material impact on the upcoming pricing market participants and recent trading backs up this sentiment i don t think ladwp yields will have a penalty for the fitch downgrade said craig brothers senior portfolio manager and co head fixed income partner for bel air investment advisors the bond has such a long history as an aa rated essential service bond it would take more than a one notch downgrade by fitch to change the perception of ladwp the issuer didn t face any yield penalties when bofa securities priced 401 7 million of ladwp s power system revenue bonds on nov 5 the 10 year maturity on the november deal with 5 coupon yielded 1 18 or 8 to triple a benchmarks while 30 year maturity with a 5 coupon yielded 1 75 or 10 to triple as the deal also traded up in the secondary in the days after pricing ladwp yields aren t likely to be penalized by the fitch downgrade said craig brothers of bel air investment advisors the bond has such a long history as an aa rated essential service bond it would take more than a one notch downgrade by fitch to change the perception of ladwp bloomberg news brothers expects the pricing to be favorable and the bonds to receive a similar reception as the aa3 aa minus los angeles world airport deal that priced last week the most recent block trades of ladwp showed 5s of 2041 at 1 53 or 10 and 5s of 2045 trade at 1 68 1 67 or 12 11 to triple as on friday indicative of the larger market moves to wider spreads it s doubtful that bel air will be participating in the deal brothers said if the ladwp spreads are comparable to lax which was less than 15 basis points inside 10 years and less than 30 basis points inside 15 years barclays and td securities are lead managers on the deal that includes a six bank syndicate prag is municipal advisor the power system revenue bonds received ratings of aa minus from fitch ratings aa2 from moody s investors service and aa from kroll bond rating agency fitch had lowered the power system s bond rating to aa minus from aa in april 2020 in march 2020 s p global ratings lowered the power system s bond rating to aa minus from aa as of june 30 2021 the power system s total outstanding long term debt balance including the current portion was roughly 11 4 billion according to unaudited financial documents for june 30 2020 and 2021 the increase of 599 1 million over the prior year s balance was due to 1 1 billion of new debt issuances in fiscal year 2021 252 8 million in issue premiums offset by scheduled maturities of 179 million defeasance of 493 4 million in the power system s revenue bonds and 102 8 million in amortization on premiums and discounts fitch downgraded ladwp s power revenue bond rating to aa minus from aa in early april and assigned a stable outlook citing a higher than expected leverage profile the downgrade affected 8 86 billion of outstanding debt the los angeles department of water and power has also faced negative headlines when its former general manager david h wright 62 of riverside pleaded guilty to one count of bribery on dec 6 the offering documents for the upcoming sale included no information about the charges against wright ladwp worked with disclosure counsel to develop the preliminary offering documents and said it believes the information doesn t include any untrue statement of material fact nor omit to state a material fact other than information permitted to be omitted pursuant to rule 15c2 12 cheng said she added that they have received no investor queries related to the matter nixon peabody is disclosure counsel orrick herrington sutcliffe is bond counsel and stradling yocca carlson rauth is underwriter s counsel on the upcoming deal it s not affecting the rating at this moment said audra dickinson a fitch us public finance director we changed the esg to a three from a four that s recognizing once anything moves above a three it s considered elevated at a level of four it affects the credit profile but not the rating it s on our radar but we did not take rating action because of that the rating agency also says the decision in december by ladwp s board to appoint an inspector general and to seek outside counsel separate from the city attorney s office gave assurance dickinson said the fact the board was taking those steps was considered and viewed positively dickinson said fitch currently views the management structures as generally sound and as to whether fitch could take further action remains to be seen but it will be tracking the changes proposed in the wake of the billing issues and charges lodged against the former general manager she said we hope that investors will keep strongly supporting ladwp issuances as they have in the past cheng said technically we see a supply imbalance with significant redemptions and coupon payments against a limited amount of new offerings so we believe there continues to be value with tax exempt bonds especially in a high tax state like california the recent volatility in the stock market especially within the tech sector might lead retail investors to find ladwp s essential service bonds more attractive cheng said

dr silviu itescu presented results from the three arm trial at the 2022 biotech showcase event being held this week which showed durable reduction in back pain lasting at least three years from a single intra discal injection of rexlemestrocel l hyaluronic acid ha carrier there is a significant need for a safe effective and durable opioid sparing treatment in patients with clbp associated with degenerative disc disease results presented from this trial showed that durable reduction in pain through 36 months was greatest in the pre specified population with clbp of shorter duration than the study median of 68 months n 194 suggesting that greatest benefits may be seen when the therapy is administered earlier in the disease process when there is active inflammation and before irreversible fibrosis of the intervertebral disc has occurred pain reduction through 36 months was also seen in the subset of patients using opioids at baseline n 168 with the rexlemestrocel l ha group having substantially greater reduction at all time points compared with saline controls among patients on opioids at baseline despite instructions to maintain existing therapies throughout the trial at 36 months 28 who received rexlemestrocel l ha were not taking an opioid compared with 8 of saline treated controls nominal p value 0 0075 mesoblast recently received feedback from the us food drug

jin ding china daily after a strong rebound last year the world economy is entering a challenging 2022 the advanced economies have recovered rapidly thanks to big stimulus packages and rapid progress with vaccination but many developing countries continue to struggle the spread of new variants amid large inequalities in vaccination rates elevated food and commodity prices volatile asset markets the prospect of policy tightening in the united states and other advanced economies and continued geopolitical tensions provide a challenging backdrop for developing countries as the world bank s global economic prospects report published today highlights the global context will also weigh on china s outlook in 2022 by dampening export performance a key growth driver last year following a strong 8 percent cyclical rebound in 2021 the world bank expects growth in china to slow to 5 1 percent in 2022 closer to its potential the sustainable growth rate of output at full capacity indeed growth in the second half of 2021 was below this level and so our forecast assumes a modest amount of policy loosening although we expect momentum to pick up our outlook is subject to domestic in addition to global downside risks renewed domestic covid 19 outbreaks including the new omicron variant and other highly transmittable variants could require more broad based and longer lasting restrictions leading to larger disruptions in economic activity a severe and prolonged downturn in the real estate sector could have significant economy wide reverberations in the face of these headwinds china s policymakers should nonetheless keep a steady hand our latest china economic update argues that the old playbook of boosting domestic demand through investment led stimulus will merely exacerbate risks in the real estate sector and reap increasingly lower returns as china s stock of public infrastructure approaches its saturation point instead to achieve sustained growth china needs to stick to the challenging path of rebalancing its economy along three dimensions first the shift from external demand to domestic demand and from investment and industry led growth to greater reliance on consumption and services second a greater role for markets and the private sector in driving innovation and the allocation of capital and talent and third the transition from a high to a low carbon economy none of these rebalancing acts are easy however as the china economic update points out structural reforms could help reduce the trade offs involved in transitioning to a new path of high quality growth first fiscal reforms could aim to create a more progressive tax system while boosting social safety nets and spending on health and education this would help lower precautionary household savings and thereby support the rebalancing toward domestic consumption while also reducing income inequality among households second following tightening anti monopoly provisions aimed at digital platforms and a range of restrictions imposed on online consumer services the authorities could consider shifting their attention to remaining barriers to market competition more broadly to spur innovation and productivity growth a further opening up of the protected services sector for example could improve access to high quality services and support the rebalancing toward high value service jobs a special focus of the world bank report eliminating remaining restrictions on labor mobility by abolishing the hukou china s system of household registration for all urban areas would equally support the growth of vibrant service economies in china s largest cities third the wider use of carbon pricing for example through an expansion of the scope and tightening of the emissions trading system rules as well as power sector reforms to encourage the penetration and nationwide trade and dispatch of renewables would not only generate environmental benefits but also contribute to china s economic transformation to a more sustainable and innovation based growth model in addition a more robust corporate and bank resolution framework would contribute to mitigating moral hazards thereby reducing the trade offs between monetary policy easing and financial risk management addressing distortions in the access to credit reflected in persistent spreads between private and state borrowers could support the shift to more innovation driven private sector led growth productivity growth in china during the past four decades of reform and opening up has been private sector led the scope for future productivity gains through the diffusion of modern technologies and practices among smaller private companies remains large realizing these gains will require a level playing field with state owned enterprises while the latter have played an instrumental role during the pandemic to stabilize employment deliver key services and in some cases close local government budget gaps their ability to drive the next phase of growth is questionable given lower profits and productivity growth rates in the past in 2022 the authorities will face a significantly more challenging policy environment they will need to remain vigilant and ready to recalibrate financial and monetary policies to ensure the difficulties in the real estate sector don t spill over into broader economic distress recent policy loosening suggests the policymakers are well aware of these risks however in aiming to keep growth on a steady path close to potential they will need to be similarly alert to the risk of accumulating ever greater levels of corporate and local government debt the transition to high quality growth will require economic rebalancing toward consumption services and green investments if the past is any guide to the future the reliance on markets and private sector initiative is china s best bet to achieve the required structural

speaker 1 00 01 a check on covid cases and healthcare workers speaker 2 00 03 we know that it s definitely aron that s driving this surge and a lot of gatherings on new year s probably did not speaker 1 00 10 help i m jade henman with maureen kavanaugh this is kpbs midday edition what is the economic outlook for san diego county speaker 3 00 28 and so if you add all that up my estimate is that we ve had more than 4 million people then who have left the the labor uh labor market speaker 1 00 35 and a special on the history of the rainbow sign black cultural center in berkeley county california that s ahead on midday edition last weekend san diego county hit a record with nearly 50 000 new covid cases from friday through sunday while the surge continues hospitals around the county are experiencing staff shortages as the virus spreads among healthcare workers in response the california department of public health issued new guidance for healthcare workers who test positive for the virus lowering the a required isolation time before returning back to work the president of the california nursing association told nbc seven the new guidance could make things worse speaker 4 01 33 putting covid positive you know workers back into the workforce just leads to more cross contamination not only for our patients but for our coworkers as well and then we re gonna have an even worst situation on our hands speaker 1 01 46 joining me now to discuss the recent surge and how hospitals around the county are being affected is kpbs health reporter matt hoffman matt welcome speaker 2 01 54 hey jade how you doing great to be here speaker 1 01 56 so this is a new record for the county what do you think is causing this surge we ve got this highly contagious aln variant but we also just came of speaker 2 02 04 holidays well we know that it s definitely aron that s driving this surge and a lot of gatherings on new year s probably did not help we heard uh state officials local health officials asking people not to gather and if they do to do things like open up windows and open up doors for ventilation um it s really unclear how many people did that but we saw a ton of people flocking out to testing sites not only over the christmas holiday but also over the new year s holiday and now we re seeing more people going back to those testing sites after they had exposures um but we know that aron is driving this and we know that state officials have been testing the wastewater data across the state um and they say that aron has been found in most regions of california um and they say that is consistent with the cdc data that reports that about 95 of all these new cases are ocn so we know that ocn is definitely driving the surge and likely gatherings uh stemming from the holidays are most speaker 1 02 57 of these cases from people who are un vaccinated or are we seeing positive cases among both the vaccinated and un vaccinated population speaker 2 03 05 the most cases definitely are coming from the unvaccinated you know just in san diego county the county sort of reports that you know the case rate for not fully vaccinated residents is about three times higher than those for fully vaccinated residents now um i m sure you know people who are listening um they ve talked to people that have uh you know been fully vaccinated even been boosted and and they ve they ve still caught the virus we are seeing a lot of breakthrough cases but a lot of the breakthrough cases health officials um you know wanna stress uh are usually people who are asymptomatic or people who maybe just seems like they have a cold um and a lot of these people that are ending up in the hospital um majority of them are un vaccinated so officials are saying hey look this is sort of preventable so go out there and get vaccinated our speaker 1 03 45 hospitalizations also still on the rise speaker 2 03 48 hospitalizations are on the rise and they ve been rising you know pretty much since thanksgiving and if you look at the graph there s a sharp line going up um right now we re sitting at about in san diego county just over a thousand in people in the hospital with covid 19 now if you look back to this time a year ago that sounds like a lot uh we had about 1700 1800 in the hospital during this uh last winter surge that we had last year and that was in vaccines we re just starting to roll out and officials are you know sort of crediting vaccines for keeping people out of the hospital now we know with ocn i say if you re un vaccinated it s gonna find you um and it could send you to the hospital another thing health officials are closely monitoring is the number of icu positive patients speaker 2 04 29 um and we know that right now in san diego we have about 166 um and if you remember back you know when there were some of those stay at home orders and everything um they were really stressing you know icu bed availability the people you know who are the worst off because of this virus um we re at 166 now um and during the peak last year we had about 450 people who were hospitalized in the icu with covid so those numbers are a lot down you know hospitalizations are up but icus you know not as high as hospitalizations we speaker 1 04 58 know a lot of hospitals are short staffed right now what s being done to relieve that speaker 2 05 03 issue yeah we re hearing from a lot of local health systems that um you know sort of during this time you know back in the early pandemic people would say you know i m hearing all these cases being reported but i don t know anybody who s sick well i bet a lot of people listening now you know whether it be themselves who may have been exposed they probably know somebody uh close relative or or family member that s been um and that same thing extends to the healthcare systems especially when these people are working directly with these patients um and we know how transmisible ahn can be so a lot of staff are catching ahn and they re having to call out to prevent exposure um and we ve seen you know some institutions hundreds of employees uh going out on unscheduled leave um in the hospital systems they ve sort of been preparing for this but basically what that could mean is cutting back on other elective surgeries um basically planning uh they say to ration care speaker 1 05 49 and as you know the state is now weighing out in order to cancel elective surgeries with the shortage of specialized healthcare workers as covid cases surge has san diego uh been affected by this at all speaker 2 06 01 yeah definitely you know they ve been looking at rationing care for a while and we know that you know during the last winter surge there was a lot of stuff that was put off um and we re seeing that again but i don t think it s happening in large numbers now if the state does decide to pass this order that s being reported that says no elective of uh surgeries then that would obviously cancel uh all elective surgeries in the state i would make a lot of people unhappy uh but the hospitals are saying hey look we just need some breathing room here um also worth noting too um when we talk about you know how are health facilities dealing with the people um that are coming down with the virus uh the state issued some new guidance that you touched on there and the intro that was a little bit controversial uh basically saying you know healthcare providers who test positive and are asymptomatic they can return to work immediately without isolation and without testing um and that s where you re seeing the pushback from the union saying hey wait if somebody s positive um and they re going back into work aren t they just gonna infect more people well we ve heard from hospitals saying you know planning for the worst means having workers go in who are sick you know speaker 1 07 01 how are local businesses and schools being affected by this surge speaker 2 07 04 schools are definitely being affected a lot we re seeing a lot of kids that are having to call out um because they have covid um and it s something that s not just affecting schools it s affecting local businesses um you know i m sure if even if you drive around town if you re looking to order so businesses have had to close you know whether it just be for a few days or even a week uh to sort of catch back up as employees are calling off because they have now we know that there s an indoor mask mandate for businesses you know it s not necessarily being as strictly followed as it was before but i think a lot of business owners are sort of wary and wondering um if restrictions are gonna come back you know we uh when we had the color coded tier system red orange purple uh whatever it was that limited indoor dining capacity uh stopped indoor dining altogether made it outdoor only so uh business owners are definitely on edge right now speaker 1 07 51 a and do you think the surge is going to continue over the next few weeks you know speaker 2 07 54 when we were talking to healthcare officials they were saying you know some of the hospitals that their own visual modeling uh showed the peak of this you know hospitalization increase in the case increase um happening you know around january 20th or so somewhere around there so um if that still rings true then we re not out of the woods yet you know we have another week or two uh as as we go on the incline but we should be coming down here at some point um you know keeping a some of the tests that the county were reporting those record cases uh were for some backlog tests but they say even with the backlog tests that we re still hitting records what can speaker 1 08 28 people do to protect themselves during this time speaker 2 08 31 you know we heard from the county public health officer dr wilma wooten you know that we re in the middle of this unprecedented surge where we re seeing so many cases also something to note to who jade all the cases that we re seeing you know 22 000 cases reported on one day that s only people that go out to testing sites and that actually get that pcr test so you know if you re following the guidance where you have a rapid test you take it at home it s positive you have symptoms you stay at home you write it out you re never gonna go in and get uh an official pcr test you ll never be counted so there s likely thousands of more people that have covid that are just not going in and being counted because they re doing rapid tests um and the guidance has not changed um they re asking people you know please if you re not vaccinated go out there and get vaccinated and we know you know that immunity wanes from these vaccines so if you got vaccinated um they re asking you to go out there and get boosted because your level of protection is just not very high uh if you don t have that booster i ve been speaker 5 09 24 speaking with kpbs health reporter matt hoffman matt thank you very much for speaker 2 09 28 joining us thanks jade speaker 5 09 39 the o macron variant is also having an economic fallout creating another speed bump on the road to us economic recovery from thousands of canceled airline flights to shortened restaurant hours employees sick or quarantined because of o crown have increased staffing shortages the latest national jobs data was gathered before the ocn surge but it too is sending mixed messages about the state of the nation s economy december job growth came in much lower than expected but unemployment is down to almost record levels meanwhile the great resignation seems to be he continuing as rates of resignations continue at peak levels joining us for an update on how san diego is doing is professor a gin economist at the university of san diego professor gin welcome to speaker 3 10 29 the program thank you thanks for having me speaker 5 10 32 now what do these recent reports tell us about the state of the speaker 3 10 37 well i think it shows that uh the labor market right now is pretty tight the economy s doing pretty well but uh what we ve seen then is uh slower growth in terms of employment now and i think that the cause for that is not that employers are not wanting to hire people but it s just simply the the fact that they re just not enough workers now to go around so that is a better situation than if employers were just not wanting to hire people now speaker 5 11 04 how can job numbers be lower than expected yet unemployment is way speaker 3 11 09 down so what s happened is that a lot of people have left the workforce for example retirements are up it was projected that over the time period of the pandemic that about 1 5 million people were gonna retire it turned out that 3 6 million people retired instead so that s more than 2 million extra people retiring so they have left the job market on top of that we ve lost about another million people at covid uh some people have died some workers have died as a result of covid and then we have a large number of people who are in uh what it called the the the covid long pollers they have the disease and side effects and they re basically disabled and so they re gonna be out of the out of the workforce and then finally uh we also have uh a lot of women who have left the workforce due to childcare issues and so if you add all that up my estimate is that we ve had more than 4 million people then who have left the the labor uh labor market therefore that reduces the the size of the labor force which accounts then for the decline and the unemployment rate while at the same time job growth is uh slow speaker 5 12 12 this entire picture economic picture brighter here in san diego than other parts of the country speaker 3 12 19 i think we have a mixed uh situation here in in san diego we have a lot of industries that were strong that were resilient for example research and development was able to keep on going despite the pandemic cuz people could work remotely but then on the other hand we we have a big uh leisure in hospitality industry that was that was hit hard uh by the pandemic so restaurants hotels were hurt by the fact that people were not eating out or traveling uh for for business purposes and so because that is such an important part of the local economy uh san day was suffered then in in that particular sector and that s sectors also having the uh the most difficulty in terms of people quitting their their jobs as well the highest quit rate is in the restaurant and hospitality industries almost 7 of people in that industry nationwide quit their jobs in november but all those people leading the the the labor market that i talked about earlier just created openings all through the labor market and so that gave people the opportunity then to leave their jobs for better better opportunities how speaker 5 13 23 do you expect the ocn surge will affect our economy speaker 3 13 26 that s that s a big unknown at this point i don t think that we re going to have the closing down of the economy like we had in march and april of of uh 2020 so i think uh this may that may slow things people will be more cautious but i don t think that it s gonna have the big impact that the pandemic had at at at its beginning speaker 5 13 46 now governor newsom presented his new budget proposal yesterday and apparently california is still a wash in surplus funds where is this money coming from speaker 3 13 57 well i think uh we we ve got a couple of things going on here uh number one is that uh you know the stock market s doing pretty well and so uh i think a lot of people had uh made some made a lot of capital gains a lot of people in the high tech industries for example were able to keep working throughout the pandemic so they re continuing to earn money and and pay uh pay income taxes and then finally on top of that people have been spending money during the pandemic in 2020 people had to stay home they couldn t go out they couldn t travel and so as a result of that they ended up saving money what economists are calling a covid piggy bank uh it s been estimated that 1 6 trillion was saved uh nationwide during the pandemic and so now that people can do do stuff they re gonna go out and spend some of that money and that s earning uh the the state uh some sales tax revenue speaker 5 14 47 what stood out for you in the governor s proposals that could benefit san diego s economy speaker 3 14 54 i think uh the emphasis on housing and dealing with the homelessness is uh one of the bigger aspects in as far as the uh budget is concerned uh we have a serious housing problem in california in terms of affordability it s just really expensive to live here housing price did not go down uh during the pandemic and uh it costs a lot then to buy a house and and even to rent so a lot of people are are in tough spots then in terms of what they have to spend on housing and so i think uh the proposals then to boost construction of housing then will help and also think uh you know we have a serious homelessness problem and so i the proposals then to deal with homelessness are gonna be significant speaker 5 15 35 you know as you referred to uh there were reports that came out at the end of the year about overall individual income in san diego rising last year despite the pandemic yet there seems to be a popular notion that the economy is not doing well why do you think there s this disconnect speaker 3 15 54 yeah that s that s an interesting question uh you know i i think um unfortunately that there s just these days that there are just a lot of misinformation going on uh spread by by the internet uh and and as a result of that uh people think the situation s actually worse than it is you know i saw the for example how the media portrayed the jobs report on friday and it was just almost universally negative whereas you know my view is that uh the unemployment rate is thinking below 4 was just a positive development and and again that that slow job growth is the result of you know people leaving the the labor force voluntarily and so as a result of that uh that s not a as of not as big of a negative as uh it might otherwise may be speaker 5 16 40 do you think the pandemic has caused permanent changes in san diego s economy speaker 3 16 45 i think it has caused some permanent changes uh for example i i think the popularity of outdoor eating has made that some thing that that is going to continue then in the future uh both the public and the the restaurant people like that and and uh you know we have the weather in san diego then to to carry that on but i think uh this big retirement wave that we saw is gonna have lasting impacts at least uh for for several more years down the line i think the labor market s gonna continue to be tight and and wages will be continued to rise then for for the next few years and then uh that will allow you know more of this job switching uh the great resignation people quitting their jobs then and moving on then to to better opportunities speaker 5 17 29 i ve been speaking with professor allin economist at the university of san diego and and ellen thank you so much speaker 3 17 35 thank you speaker 5 17 47 this is kpbs midday edition i m maureen kavanaugh with jade henman on the latest episode of the california report magazine host sasha coka and k u e d political correspondent marisa lagos explore the rich history of the rainbow sign a groundbreaking center in berkeley for black culture politics and art they begin by describing the unassuming appearance of the former community center which now sits in stark contrast to the sight and sounds it once housed speaker 6 18 19 it s this stucco one story building and it s got an adobe tiled roof and curved windows and mostly what you can hear these days at the corner of martin luther king to you in your way and derby street in berkeley is traffic but if you had stood here 50 years ago you might have heard some very different sounds drifting out the doors of this building speaker 7 18 45 what is africa to me one three centuries removed from the lands my father s love the spicy grove cinnamon tree what is africa to me speaker 8 19 10 he is so impact speaker 6 19 13 this place was a california cultural landmark that hosted dozens of high profile artists and thought leaders people like maya angelou nina simone and influential folk musician odea but it lasted for just a few short years i m sasha coca and the california report magazine and today i m co hosting the show with my colleague marisa lagos who s a political correspondent for k q e d where we produce the california report hey there marisa hey sasha speaker 9 19 42 very excited to be here you know you and i have been teaming up on some episodes of this show looking at race identity and history here in california and today we re gonna visit the rainbow sign speaker 10 19 55 rainbow sign is a unique club in berkeley which is geared to the role of the black and american cultural speaker 11 20 00 society this is a small intimate club you could walk up and ask a question of maya angelou or james baldwin sat mahal there into saki changa people like um cleveland bellows raymond holbert all had exhibitions there speaker 12 20 16 alice walker who went on to win the pulitzer prize for the color purple did a reading at rainbow sign nina simone performed at rainbow sign when i was seven years old oh speaker 8 20 27 to be speaker 6 20 30 black you might recognize eyes one of those voices as vice president kamala harris she wrote about growing up in berkeley and going to the rainbow sign as a kid in her 2019 autobiography the truths we hold here she is reading from the audio book speaker 12 20 48 families with children who are especially welcome at rainbow sign an approach that reflected both the values and the vision of the women at its helm speaker 9 20 57 kamala harris election made us start thinking about the rich history of this cultural center it s a place most californians haven t even heard about speaker 6 21 05 yeah and the rainbow sign has incredible legacy there are so many famous people who performed and visited there and it cultivated so many artists and leaders but it was also a place where people could experience joy it wasn t just about black pain and the suffering of folks of color but it was really about celebration and speaker 9 21 26 more than 40 years that s all still relevant as we continue to reckon with our country s shameful racism and think more about the need for people of color to have safe spaces we also know that the conversations happening now were built on years of previous work we re talking political cultural artistic so we wanted to take our audience back to an other era full of upheaval speaker 6 21 51 to the 1960s and seventies in the bay area and remember this was at the height of the vietnam war the free speech movement black nationalism and berkeley was right at the center of so many of those social movements speaker 11 22 05 so we are at the corner of martin luther king jr and derby street in front of what was rainbow sign a black cultural arts club between 1971 and 1977 speaker 9 22 17 today s a mental health center run by the city of berkeley and last year it was being renovated and we were able to take a tour before it was open to the public with someone whose memories of the place run deep speaker 11 22 29 my name is ode paula and my parents henry and maryanne paula started at rainbow sign in the seventies speaker 6 22 35 ette hadn t been in the building for more than 40 years since she was a speaker 11 22 39 teenager it was painted it was very warm the yellows and the gold so when you walked in it felt very much like you were walking into somebody s living room speaker 9 22 50 this is a big place much of the inside has now been rebuilt into cubicles and office spaces but the main concert hall is still there it has a church like feel to it echoy wood floors tall ceiling beams hand painted with a delicate floral pattern it s beautiful speaker 11 23 07 there was an energy um in heat there was that feeling of movement right there was action things were happening it it wasn t stagnant at all speaker 9 23 17 while some of the performers who came through there were already established the nina simone and josephine bakers others were at the very start of their careers with only a whisper of their greatness to come speaker 6 23 28 like blue singer to hodge mahal here he is performing leaving trump it s a song from his very first album released back in 1968 i went speaker 8 23 39 upstairs to pack my leaving i ain t seen no blues whiskey man speaker 6 23 47 the rainbow sign also occupied a hugely important political space both for the actual political organizing that happened there and for the fact that it staunchly celebrated blackness and black potential but it was only around for six years in the 1970s which means a lot of its history has been lost to time that s speaker 9 24 10 right we had trouble finding performances recorded at the rainbow sign but there has been an effort in recent years to preserve what archives did survive while both maryanne paula and henry poll passed away more than 20 years ago their daughter ette kept and boxes of archives they d actually been buried in storage for years until 2017 when a couple of students in an undergraduate seminar at uc berkeley began researching the rainbow sign and they ended up creating a digital archive with a debt s blessing speaker 11 24 39 rainbow sign needs to not just disappear into the mists of time speaker 6 24 45 odet speaker 9 24 46 is particularly proud of her mother maryanne poll who forged a path as a black female concert promoter before that was even an established job speaker 11 24 55 this is a black woman in the forties and fifties and sixties doing things nobody else had ever speaker 6 24 59 done her dad henry poll had a day job as an engineer but the pollers were also really big folk music and they spent a lot of time going to see live shows enough time that they started helping put up flyers for concerts and running ticket booths and getting to know the musicians as friends now back then these concerts usually featured a bunch of folk artists on the bill but in 1958 the manager for the folk singer odea asked the poll if they d like to put together a solo show that experience helped inspire the couple to launch mary ann paula presents and as concert promoters they helped bring new names to the bay area including bob dylan after turning him down several times because they didn t know who he was speaker 13 25 45 oh and the gates speaker 6 25 51 this is bob dylan performing gates of eden at one of maryanne poll s shows in san francisco odea went on to record dozens of hits after appearing in maryanne poll s concerts martin luther king called her the queen of american folk music here is singing hit or miss recorded in 1917 speaker 8 26 14 just like giving you gotta be you hit or miss speaker 6 26 20 the poll s daughter otet who was named in part after odea recalls her parents booking a veritable who s who of 1960s folk and rock music speaker 11 26 30 judy collins joan baez uh mimi farina the clancy brothers and tommy make she even did the modern jazz quartet peter paul and mary the weavers frank zappa and the mothers of invention speaker 6 26 48 by the way that s zappa s 1970 recording of trave booky speaker 9 26 54 odet says her parents success didn t just lie in their ability to recognize talent she describes a cozy intimate relationship between these artists and her parents and their broader group of friends she says many of them would end up crashing at her family s house after most speaker 11 27 08 of the concerts there was a party and at my parents house they re very very social i m a kid so i d go upstairs and go to bed and people were singing you know and performing downstairs and that s just normal is to fall asleep to odea or pete secret somebody singing downstairs speaker 9 27 26 everything about the rainbow sign was intentional starting with its name here s vice president kamala harris again speaker 12 27 33 its name was inspired by a verse from the black spiritual mary don t you weak speaker 14 27 38 god gave noah the rainbow sign no more but fire next time speaker 12 27 46 the lyric god gave noah the rainbow sign no more water the fire next time was printed on the membership brochure james baldwin of course had memorably used this same verse for his book the fire next time baldwin was a close friend of polars and a regular guest at the club speaker 6 28 05 even before the rainbow sign got started james baldwin had already spent time in the bay area including back in 1964 when he toured the city on camera for a film called take this hammer it was actually produced by k q e d the station where today we produced the california report speaker 9 28 22 it was a time of huge change here the second wave of the great migration had brought about 300 000 people largely black southerners to the bay area between just 1940 and 1970 and by the sixties san francisco was demolishing its thriving jazz district the historically black fillmore neighborhood under the guise of urban renewal and this speaker 15 28 43 is part of how redevelop also what do you mean you say redeveloping meaning you mean removal of negros yes that s that s what i thought you meant speaker 6 28 53 baldwin called out the racism that he saw he said it was overt in the south but in san francisco where everyone is so liberal and so civilized and so literate it s all a under the rug speaker 9 29 06 and baldwin brings this unflinching assessment of american racism to the documentary but it also shows his optimism he speaks with young black men about their challenges and speaker 15 29 16 struggles we re gonna be a negro president in this country we re never be a negro president in this country why do you say that good jobs how we gonna be your president god but i want you to think about this there will be a nero president of this country but it will not be the country that we that we are sitting in now what if you say to yourself there never will be a negro president of this country and what you re doing is agreeing with white people who say you are inferior it s not important really you know whether or not it s negro president i mean in that way what s important is that you should realize that you can become you can become the president there s nothing anybody anybody can do you can do speaker 6 30 05 of course we did end up finally having a black president about 50 years later and now we have the first black and south asian vice president speaker 9 30 13 kamala harris and she says she learned lessons at the rainbow sign that helped her go on to break barriers it speaker 12 30 20 was where i learned that artistic expression ambition and intelligence were cool it was where i came to understand that there is no better way to feed someone s brain than by bringing together food poetry politics music dance and art speaker 6 30 41 ka writes about dancing at home to versions of the nina simone song young gifted and black and about seeing nina simone perform at the rainbow sign when she was just seven years old speaker 5 30 53 you ve been listening to a piece on the history of the rainbow sign in berkeley california it will continue after a short break this is kpbs midday edition i m maureen kavanaugh with jade henman we continue a piece from the california report magazine about the rich history of the rainbow black cultural center in berkeley host sasha coka and reporter marisa lagos begin by explaining singer nina simone s involvement in the storied community center and what it meant for black culture in the 1970s speaker 9 31 38 nina simone hung out at the rainbow sign as did berkeley s first black mayor warren widener and in 1975 maryanne paula invited both the singer and the mayor there for a special ceremony so he could proclaim nina simone day in berkeley speaker 11 31 53 the press conference will be held at 10 00 am rainbow sign on friday the 31st you ll be presented with a proclamation from the city of berkeley presented to you by the mayor of berkeley warren whitener well i speaker 16 32 05 warn whitener mayor the city of berkeley to hereby proclaim friday march 31st 1972 as nina simone day in appreciation of the great dignity bearing and uniqueness of miss simone and a recognition of her exceptional contribution to the rainbow sign the black cultural center of the city of berkeley speaker 6 32 28 nina when mayor widener honored nina simone at the rainbow sign local tv station kpix covered the event i can speaker 16 32 36 only say that i am stunned and i m pleased and i m that s it thank you very much from ages three um know that song by heart young gifted in black speaker 11 32 57 so the legacy of rainbow sign is that there was more going on in the world and in the world of people of color than most people know about period and earlier if you look at history you would think nothing happened unless you were european and that s simply not accurate speaker 9 33 17 the crux of the rainbow sign ode poll says was not black nationalism it was about building a multiracial space rooted in celebrating black culture speaker 17 33 26 rainbow sign does not exclude non black people you know either from membership or from speaker 9 33 32 attendant odets mom maryanne poll died in 1999 but in a 1974 interview she talks this approach of being black centered but inclusive speaker 17 33 43 but we do specify that it s a black area which i explained by saying we set the table and anyone can eat at it but we do set the table speaker 9 33 58 sculpture and graphic artists elizabeth catlett showed at the rainbow sign in 1972 that was covered by kpix as well artists speaker 18 34 05 generally project themselves towards galleries and buyers or collectors but i want to talk about the relationship of the artists to the community especially the black artists to the black community speaker 6 34 17 and the exhibits in performances and shows weren t just for adults the ray rainbow sign welcomed kids speaker 9 34 22 right kamala harris and her family spent many evenings speaker 12 34 26 there my mother maya and i went to the rainbow sign often everyone in the neighborhood knew us as shamala and the girls we were a unit a team and when we d show up at the rainbow sign we were always greeted with big smiles and warm hugs speaker 6 34 41 that was part of maryanne paula s vision she wanted to let artists interact with and inspire young people not just perform and move on to the next concert hall we wanna put these heroes together with the children maryanne poll told the berkeley gazette back in 1975 she went on to say no kid who wants to be a painter can say no to if a kid doesn t like to read put him together with a poet speaker 9 35 06 and kamala harris remembers high school kids meeting and interacting directly with guest speakers and performers in an intimate space kids speaker 12 35 14 like me who spent time at rainbow sign were exposed to dozens of extraordinary men and women who showed us what we could become speaker 9 35 27 the rainbow sign was also a home for political organizing guests ran the gamut from black nationalists to more moderate political leaders including huey newton winnie mandela and shirley chisholm the black congresswoman who launched a historic run for president speaker 7 35 42 those of you who have been neglected left out ignored forgotten or shunned the side for whatever reason give me your help at this hour join me in an effort to reshape our society and regain control of our destiny as we go down the chisholm trail for 1970 speaker 9 36 07 and it was where a group of women founded the powerful black women organized for political action or wpa it s a group that still exists today and has helped foster generations of black female leaders including kamala harris the speaker 6 36 20 woman who s led bapa for four decades as president her name is desi woods jones she says she and the other original members of her group didn t have big expectations when they first called a meeting at the rainbow sign back in 1971 see speaker 19 36 34 how many women we can get that would be interested in in politics being engaged in politics not necessarily running but just being involved and we expected about 40 45 people to show up and um and we opened the doors and you know looked around and i think there must have been pretty close to a couple of hundred uh women that showed up and we were of course just astounded speaker 9 37 03 that enthusiastic response spoke to the energy and excitement among black women who were tired of just doing the grunt work behind the scenes you know we speaker 19 37 11 would do all the fundraising we would walk the precincts we would go in office and do the mailers speaker 9 37 16 they wanted to have a seat at the two table themselves speaker 19 37 20 and yet when it came to the public policy and really uh people making the decisions even among our strong black men supporters women were sort of dismissed and so we kind of didn t you know that didn t set too well for some strong black women she speaker 6 37 37 says the energy in the room at the at first meeting was palpable and while the political organizing group outlived the rainbow sign it was no coincidence des woods jones says that the group got its speaker 19 37 50 start there it was the right place at the right time for just to grow out of it just ended up being kind of the gathering place i mean you would go in the rainbow at any given day or time and not know who you may run into odea may be there performing and uh people just sort of like like going there plus the food was good speaker 9 38 10 the food breaking bread together it was a central part of the rainbow sign and it was memorable enough for the vice president to recall her favorite dishes decades speaker 19 38 20 later some othered chicken meatballs and gravy candied yas cornbread peach speaker 6 38 25 cobbler otet poller says some people came to the rainbow sign just for the food speaker 19 38 30 excellent excellent food my mom was a stunning cook so the food here was very very good a menu speaker 6 38 35 from around 1975 details a lot of the choices that you could pick from from entrees for 3 a piece liver with onions speaker 20 38 45 smothered steak fried chicken speaker 6 38 48 complete with two side dishes buttered speaker 20 38 50 corn lima beans mashed potatoes pickled beets and onions speaker 6 38 56 and a super salad there was also a dessert menu blackberry speaker 20 39 00 cobbler apple cobbler bread pudding sweet potato pie speaker 11 39 04 there was something about pies yes speaker 9 39 08 and like most things at the rainbow sign the restaurant s purpose went well beyond the obvious yes it served as a gathering place to eat but it was also a stepping stone for young people hired to work there and they included men who had been recently paroled from san quentin prison some actually went on to successful careers in hospitality speaker 6 39 32 but in the end this special place was never financially stable within a year of its opening the rainbow sign was already struggling to survive at the center s one year anniversary in 1972 maryanne poll talked with a reporter from crown four about the financial challenges but speaker 21 39 49 the rainbow sign faces a deep crisis which must be resolved immediately as executive director of mary anne polls planes speaker 17 39 57 as deep as it can get we have to control our home that is our physical building and we have until may 1st and to raise 75 000 speaker 9 40 08 the rainbow sign hung on another five years but it did shut its doors for good in 1977 after the pollers were unable to raise enough money to the building which speaker 6 40 17 by the way is actually located on the corner of the two streets marking the literal red line in berkeley at that time people of color could not get loans to buy homes to the north and to the east of the rainbow sign speaker 11 40 30 so it was right on the red line it was segregated my parents owned a house on ella street because they weren t allowed to buy a house above mlk speaker 6 40 44 that s a long time berkeley sculptor and mixed media artist mildred howard and she used to hang out at the rainbow sign when she was a young woman speaker 9 40 51 mildred s mother mabel howard everyone called her mama howard was a legendary community activist in berkeley perhaps best known for her fight over a commuter train line officials wanted to build bart tracks that would ve run through the black part of town and physically separated from the white neighborhoods mama howard sued and won forcing officials to put the train tracks underground where they still are speaker 6 41 14 today when we talked with mildred howard she remembered her moms deep work to lift up black voices and power speaker 11 41 22 i i can remember people coming to our house and saying who should we vote for and my mom sitting down and talking with them about it and most major black politicians in this area would come to her and if she supported them the whole neighborhood supported them speaker 6 41 42 decades after the rainbow sign was forced to close because the building was too expensive mildred howard herself was pushed out of her longtime berkeley home you do speaker 11 41 51 and put the these things this is the old these are the old family photos more photos yeah i was notified by my landlord that my rent would go up 50 and as an artist i can t afford 50 increase in rent speaker 6 42 13 in this film from the k q e d series truly california filmmakers followed mildred howard and her grandson as she was being evicted back in 2018 speaker 11 42 22 i i mean it s just a myth where you think you have a secure place to stay it s a myth i probably should not have drank the koolaid eight i think it was part of the american dream that i thought that i was a part of speaker 9 42 41 in 1970 when the rainbow signed first open black residents made up about a quarter of berkeley s population by 2020 just 8 of city residents were black speaker 6 42 51 those statistics are pretty chilling a lot of people moved to outlying suburbs and others like mildred moved to oakland speaker 9 42 59 that s where we talked to her in her new live workspace mildred s still mourning what she lost being forced to leave speaker 11 43 05 berkeley and now when you go to south berkeley it s all white i could name everyone who lived with a and like two or three blocks but the neighborhood is now on white and i can t afford to buy a house there speaker 6 43 21 mildred howard says the white liberal talk about black lives matter isn t enough when black people can t afford to stay and when i hear her say that it really echoes what james baldwin said about the bay area back in 1964 speaker 15 43 36 what do you mean you say redevelop meaning you mean removal of nick rose yes that s speaker 11 43 41 that s what i thought you meant it s a lie berkeley is thought to be this open liberal place when in fact it is not speaker 9 43 53 but mildred still makes meaningful our art to tell these stories like even as she was dealing with her own displacement she launched a photo project capturing the voices of young black men and women in berkeley speaker 11 44 04 and i brought together nine african american youth talk about issues of today and each one was paid a stipend because i believe in young people because i want them to know that what they have to say is valuable speaker 6 44 23 and she s got those photos hanging on the walls of her live workspace in oakland each of the young people she photographed is silhouette in shadow speaker 9 44 31 next to a speaker 11 44 32 quote out of it came these wonderful quotes by each of these young people i ve always felt powerful because no one told me otherwise i love that quote speaker 9 44 46 it s the same philosophy that maryanne paula spent six years c at the rainbow sign the idea that young black people need the space to craft stories to celebrate black beauty and value even if the world isn t always ready for it speaker 5 45 02 that was sasha coca and marisa lagos for the california report magazine speaker 8 45 11 i

the bedding industry adding hundreds of new stores houston based mattress firm filed for an initial public offering on jan 7 seeking to raise some 100m from investors on the new york stock exchange in its ipo filing the retailer said it planned to open 300 new stores over the next three years in under penetrated markets such as los angeles upstate new york and detroit the store expansion is a reversal of three years of store closures following its 2018 bankruptcy between 2019 and 2021 mattress firm shuttered 972 stores across the country according to its ipo prospectus the store culling following mattress firm s bankruptcy burned many of its landlords with then ceo steve stagner telling them they could accept lower rents or face the threat of closure bisnow previously reported mattress firm replaced stagner as ceo in 2019 with john eck a former media executive mattress firm has continued to open new locations during that time as well it spent 24m between 2019 and 2021 on new store construction according to the ipo filing mattress firm declined to comment for this story mattress firm s retail footprint is massive by any metric and company officials maintain that its real estate presence is critical to driving sales mattress firm has 2 353 stores a portfolio that puts 82 of the u s population within 10 miles of a store it said in the prospectus the firm also operates 70 distribution centers and uses 30 delivery providers and the retailer is now testing same day delivery in some markets our national scale enables us to provide convenience to customers that we believe our competitors cannot match the retailer said in its prospectus offering the retailer said it would continue to shutter underperforming stores throughout its expansion process but didn t say how many real estate has been the source of great controversy at mattress firm over the past few years in november 2017 a year after steinhoff international purchased mattress firm for 3 8b and took the retailer private the retailer sued three former real estate executives and consultants alleging the men perpetrated a multimillion dollar real estate fraud scheme against it by agreeing to leases above market rents while receiving gifts and kickbacks from landlords and developers even though mattress firm is under new management that lawsuit and a counterclaim are still active in harris county texas superior court alex deitch a former colliers atlanta broker who represented mattress firm and is a defendant in the original lawsuit claimed in a countersuit that mattress firm had full knowledge of the arrangements of all its leases and weaponized its real estate department to squeeze its competition out of various markets deitch also claimed mattress firm fostered a culture of accepting gifts from vendors he has asked a judge to force the retailer to disclose what other company executives had received and alleged that stagner himself privately invested in mattress firm real estate deals in a new motion filed last week deitch claimed that of the nearly 1 000 leases cut by mattress firm following its bankruptcy only 14 were cited by the retailer as part of the alleged kickback scheme mattress firm re emerged from bankruptcy at the end of 2018 mattress firm previously stated that its real estate obligations were a big reason for its bankruptcy claiming it had too many stores in redundant locations in some instances it had stores across the street from one another its retail footprint also became the centerpiece of a debunked online conspiracy theory that the retailer was laundering money through its stores given how few people were regularly seen shopping in them mattress firm s south african parent company steinhoff was embroiled in its own accounting scandal in 2017 which led to billions of dollars in restatements and losses in 2020 south africa s financial sector conduct authority fined former steinhoff ceo markus jooste nearly 15m for sending texts to a cadre of associates warning them ahead of time of coming financial difficulties the authority s report found that jooste had told investors mattress firm would contribute billions to its revenues in its first year but it instead saddled steinhoff with steep losses the report found that jooste privately called the acquisition one of the two worst mistakes he ever made and a disaster even after steinhoff executives allegedly discovered that mattress firm was paying inflated rents the south african regulatory report found that steinhoff told investors mattress firm was profitable as it was taking on heavy losses today steinhoff owns 50 1 of mattress firm and its creditors own 49 9 the retailer said in the prospectus it has 3 5b in liabilities including 1 2b of debt the company posted a 165m loss for the fiscal year ending sept 28 mainly due to an impairment charge but the company posted a net income of 125 6m in 2020 it said in the prospectus it said its revenues have grown from 2 9b in 2019 to nearly 4 4b last year a 21 8 compounded annual growth rate mattress firm executives in the ipo say the retailer is riding a wave of new housing growth millennials forming households and new wellness and health awareness where sleep plays a critical role we are the clear market leader in the large and growing u s retail mattress and foundations industry with a market

by kevin liptak and jeremy diamond cnn as president joe biden was spending his holidays with family at the white house and in delaware he was frustrated to see images on television of americans waiting in long lines for covid 19 tests nearly a year after he had taken office the stubborn problem he had vowed to solve persisted exposing a testing system that was failing once again to meet demand and biden s own promises anger over testing shortages has been mounting across the country including inside the white house since early december when the omicron variant began spreading widely across the country and the demand for tests began far outstripping the supply in many areas according to people involved in the conversations biden himself has privately told top staff members in strong terms that he regrets that he and his team did not anticipate the shortfalls earlier something he s also made clear in public despite those regrets experts had been warning for months that testing capacity wasn t where it should be as the holiday season approached including during a virtual meeting with white house officials in october multiple experts argue that biden and his team did not move quickly enough to address the coming shortfalls and by then it was too late to dramatically increase supplies to levels that would have eased the current shortages everybody saw it coming we knew we needed more tests dr ashish jha dean of the brown university school of public health said on cnn last month i think the administration had dropped the ball on this while biden entered office with a plan to expand testing pouring in billions of dollars to boost manufacturing and ramp up testing in schools his top priority was vaccines which kept most people out of the hospital and even slashed the chances of getting infected with and spreading the virus but vaccine hesitancy remains stubbornly high and a new highly transmissible variant that sidesteps much of the vaccines protection against infection has spread across the country driving case counts to their highest levels to date by december it was evident biden was falling short of the promise he had made as a candidate that anyone who wants a test should be able to get one period that has prompted a hurried effort inside the white house to stand up a new test distribution program that officials say will provide free at home rapid tests to any american who orders them online federal testing sites have opened in cities across the country and a new requirement for health insurance companies to reimburse for the cost of tests takes effect this week the white house says a slew of investments it made in the fall including through the defense production act and efforts to speed up the authorization of new rapid tests have helped to dramatically increase the number of at home tests the monthly supply of at home tests has risen from 25 million to 28 million in august to 46 million in october to 300 million today the white house projects that next month the monthly supply will hit 350 million to 400 million according to a white house memo obtained by cnn still many experts say that even those ramped up numbers are not enough we re not going to stop there those numbers will keep going up in the months ahead dr tom inglesby the white house s newly installed testing coordinator said in an interview this week as the country shifts into a new phase of the pandemic focused less on eradicating covid and more on learning to live with it there is a renewed emphasis on the availability of testing to assure people they re safe to travel and engage in other normal activities it s a pivotal moment for the biden white house aides to the president know he and his party will be judged by how well they navigate a return to normal pivoting quickly to improve testing supplies is a test of biden s ability to shift the country into a new stage of a virus he s acknowledged is unlikely to completely disappear what we ve been hampered by is thinking that the role of testing is sort of secondary and optional where really the role of testing is foundational throughout the course of the pandemic and throughout the exit from the pandemic said dr thomas tsai assistant professor of health policy at harvard t h chan school of public health because the testing is the information is the early warning system on whether cases are rising or decreasing it s the information that informs behavior we ve always been chasing our tails within testing strategy tsai added it s never sort of coincided where we ve had the demand and supply of tests before the waves peak so we can actually alter the course of the pandemic it s always documented the course of pandemic as opposed to altering the course an october warning two months before christmas medical experts foresaw a frantic last minute shopping surge with millions of americans flooding stores in search of at home covid testing kits to tell them their holiday gatherings were safe a group of doctors shared that vision with the white house at a meeting on october 22 urging officials to expand the nation s testing capacity in a hurry the participants say they got what they wanted massive efforts to expand production and distribution of tests as one of those physicians described it to cnn yet it turned out the warning and the effort came too late by that point the doctors vision of 732 million tests per month by march 2022 was simply impossible to pull off demand for the tests had tumbled so low during the summer that manufacturers had dramatically reduced production and at that point only a handful of at home tests were available for purchase i think the bold initiative had it come to fruition would have been amazing said dr michael mina a physician who was part of that october briefing with the biden administration but it would have been very very difficult in the last two months inglesby who joined the white house this month as the covid 19 response team testing coordinator said the goals presented in the meeting were ambitious but impossible to reach in october because of the limited number of authorized over the counter tests we all wish it could have been sooner if it were feasible everyone would have liked it to be earlier he said in an interview this week inglesby noted that the testing shortage is not unique to the us if you look at newspapers all over the world every country is having challenges meeting demand administration officials have been working behind the scenes for weeks in a hurried effort to stand up the free test program including working with test manufacturers to solicit proposals and with website programmers to develop the portal where americans will be able to request the tests contracts between private companies and the federal government to procure the 500 million tests began being awarded on friday and more information about the website is expected in the coming days the white house said it expected the first free rapid tests to be delivered to the government early next week white house officials insist the steps biden took over the past months have made it possible to order the 500 million tests at all including purchasing 3 billion in rapid tests during the late summer and early fall to bolster the market and spending another 1 billion to secure key supplies for test makers using the defense production act they say those steps increased capacity when demand was low but they have acknowledged it wasn t enough to avert the omicron induced shortage we do not have the tests that we need to meet all the demand inglesby said of the current state of play echoing a blunt acknowledgment from the president creating a system that can scale 50 to 60 times is challenging we are working to meet that challenge but it s just really important to understand that this virus that we are working against now this strain of virus is moving and has accelerated in a way that was very different even from delta and certainly from the world before delta inglesby said we have all the levers pulled too late to help testing companies are poised to make the most of the moment manufacturers whose tests have been authorized by the us food and drug administration including abbott acon and ihealth had been increasing their capacity already and there have been significant changes in capacity for the start of 2022 it has taken a year and a half for the us to embrace the important role of rapid testing said a spokesperson for abbott who said the company was producing 70 million of its binaxnow products in january and prepared to scale significantly further in the coming months it is important for the us to maintain the testing manufacturing capacity and supply during periods of low demand so we can respond to future variants and surges we re on the right path now but we can t be complacent or think that testing won t play a critical role in our ability to gather safely later on yet even if tests begin reaching americans by the end of january that would be more than a month after the latest wave began hitting communities and the testing shortfalls became apparent some in congress have sharpened their criticism of the administration s testing approach in recent weeks in a letter last week addressed to us health and human services secretary xavier becerra two senior republicans on key health committees demanded answers on the biden administration s lack of strategy for covid 19 testing with over 82 6 billion specifically appropriated for testing and flexibility within the department to allocate additional funds from covid 19 supplemental bills or annual appropriations if necessary it is unclear to us why we are facing such dire circumstances now wrote sens roy blunt of missouri and richard burr of north carolina on monday a group of 50 lawmakers who included some high profile biden allies such as democratic sens elizabeth warren of massachusetts and amy klobuchar of minnesota along with independent sen bernie sanders of vermont wrote a letter to the president urging additional immediate steps to ramp up testing supply so that every american has access to one rapid test a week officials say the scarcity of at home tests this month was driven by a steep uptick in demand particularly in major cities where cases began surging at the same moment americans were entering the holiday stretch increased travel and family get togethers prompted fresh interest in getting tested which depleted stocks of at home tests at drugstores and online the plan biden announced in december to procure and distribute hundreds of millions of at home rapid tests developed quickly over a stretch of days that month as reports emerged of empty shelves and sold out notices according to officials familiar with the matter still when biden made that announcement several details of the plan remained unresolved administration officials were unable to provide any specific details about when the website to request the tests would launch or how quickly tests would be shipped pointing only to a broad timeline of early january they also did not detail a plan to get tests to those with limited internet access a problem biden promised to solve but hasn t a buildup of factors over the past two years led to a shortfall in testing that became apparent only as the omicron variant began spreading across the country in the weeks after thanksgiving according to administration officials and others familiar with the matter since the beginning of the pandemic testing has been an issue in the us pandemic response many public health experts say the first tests developed in the united states by the us centers for disease control and prevention in early 2020 were faulty keeping many local officials in the dark about the sizes of their outbreaks correcting these tests took nearly a month leaving the country in a blind spot about how to contain the growing pandemic there also were questions over who should be tested only those who had symptoms or close contacts of people with confirmed infections as well biden entered office vowing to remedy the testing issues that had plagued the previous administration and he signed an executive order on his first day in office meant to expand the availability of testing including in schools and other priority populations he established a pandemic testing board a campaign promise modeled on president franklin d roosevelt s war production board early in his term and in february he announced a series of investments meant to increase testing capacity by scaling up the production of raw materials and establishing regional centers to distribute test kits and collect samples but biden s central focus in the early days of his term ultimately was on getting as many americans vaccinated as possible a campaign that diverted public attention from the testing initiative he d entered office vowing to execute right from the start the cdc for lack of a better word screwed up testing they got the testing kits wrong they sent out the wrong kits then we finally built up an infrastructure but it came simultaneously with the vaccine and we thought the vaccine would solve the problem and we didn t need to maintain that infrastructure said dr ezekiel emanuel a physician at the university of pennsylvania who served on biden s covid advisory team during the transition the white house rejects the notion that it prioritized vaccination at the expense of testing that is not true at all inglesby said it was never zero sum between the two still without adequate testing public health officials and hospitals aren t in the best position to anticipate how many cases may be coming their way or how much treatment may be needed testing is taking on an additional importance with the introduction of antivirals such as the recently authorized product from pfizer paxlovid which can reduce hospitalization by nearly 90 in high risk adults for that medication to work properly the pills need to be taken within the first five days of symptoms occurring the only way to know if those symptoms are caused by covid is through testing if you don t have a strategy around testing you re just kind of shooting in the dark and really addressing issues as they come up said lori freeman chief executive officer of the national association of county and city health officials and i think we might be feeling the consequences of that right now the cnn wire 2022 cable news network
