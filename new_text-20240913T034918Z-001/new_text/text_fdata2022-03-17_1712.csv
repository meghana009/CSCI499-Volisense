and those running for office about the homelessness crisis and needing a federal response to address it in a state where over 161 000 people are experiencing homelessness is it enough to declare homelessness an emergency would that push the federal emergency management agency to support the state the same way it helps after natural disasters veronica lewis director of the homeless outreach program integrated care system hopics thinks it could be but there s not much political will she used project roomkey temporary motel rooms that the city paid for during the pandemic for unhoused people to illustrate how fast things can move when there is political will and a significant investment in resources bureaucracy can be moved out the way when people want it moved out the way covid has shown us that veronica lewis director of hopics think about the millions of dollars dispatched and all the logistics that were worked out in 30 days think about if you had the same level of energy and political will to create a long term solution lewis said bureaucracy can be moved out the way when people want it moved out the way covid has shown us that at a two hour forum attended by mayoral candidates that included l a city councilmembers kevin de león and joe buscaino l a city attorney mike feuer and u s rep karen bass fema came up again buscaino pointed to a 2019 op ed he wrote asking for a state of emergency because a bridge home that provided permanent supportive housing for people experiencing homelessness in his district took too damn long using government owned property feuer said declaring a state of emergency is one ingredient in a larger array of solutions that should focus more on prevention but would give a mayor the authority to commandeer property and eliminate competitive biddings bass supported declaring a local state of emergency but said it s not enough to cut through the red tape if you want a fema like response you bring in fema bass said at the forum to do that you need a national state of emergency de león agreed that unnecessary bureaucracy from every level of government is the biggest challenge he faces but was less enthusiastic about the federal government s response we know that climate change and global warming is an existential threat to humanity but we haven t seen the action out of washington d c yet de león said we have 10 million immigrants who have given their lives to this country and pay their taxes but we don t have any immigration reform yet i highly doubt we are going to have a declaration of a national emergency dealing with our unhoused neighbors de león said declaring a state of emergency would be symbolic and does not provide permanent housing for people experiencing homelessness what about eminent domain l a city councilmember curren price said that despite the rhetoric requesting fema s response to the homelessness crisis there hasn t been any actions taken yet certainly at the state level they talk about that kind of response but it hasn t happened price said we don t have the resources to mount that kind of assault effort even if we did it would be limited to how much housing is available we aren t building enough of it fema cleared all the bureaucracy and put checks in peoples hands and made sure we had workers to get that done we haven t seen that response on homelessness marqueece harris dawson l a city councilmember so far the city of l a has focused on city owned properties to move things forward but price said he thinks the city should be discussing the use of eminent domain to address the homelessness crisis because planning and land use is fundamental in the operation of government price said they ve also experienced issues with hotels and motels since there isn t a huge stock of hotels to be repurposed through programs like project homekey conversations haven t gotten to privately owned property yet price said if we are talking about a real crisis then all hands should be on deck not just in south l a either it should be in all parts of the city marqueece harris dawson councilmember for the 8th district which includes the neighborhoods of baldwin hills crenshaw and west adams said the city county and state processes need to be aligned the councilmember said despite ongoing rhetoric the governor is the only person who can declare a state of emergency for homelessness and get fema involved he pointed to the 1994 northridge earthquake as an example of true mobilization during a crisis that led to a section of the 10 freeway that collapsed being repaired within a year fema cleared all the bureaucracy and put checks in people s hands and made sure we had workers to get that done harris dawson said we haven t seen that response on homelessness vice president al gore speaking at re opening ceremonies for the santa monica freeway following the 1994 northridge earthquake on april 13 1994 gary leonard collection courtesy of the los angeles public library as harris dawson noted fema s ability to make direct deals with hotel owners would go a long way toward helping the city place people in rooms something that requires a significant amount of labor and coordination while eminent domain isn t really necessary since the rooms would be used on a temporary basis while more housing is built daniel lópez a spokesperson for gov gavin newsom said the governor has made tackling the homelessness crisis a top priority of his administration pointing to the 14 billion invested to create housing and provide treatment options for people with severe behavioral health challenges lópez also praised the biden administration s partnership in extending fema reimbursements through july 1 to extend project roomkey what we re doing in california to tackle the homelessness crisis is unprecedented in both nature and scale cutting through red tape and getting more folks off the street and into health and housing services faster than ever before and at a fraction of the cost lópez said in a statement the state of california hasn t declared an emergency

america s central bank increased its benchmark interest rate on wednesday pushing it up by a quarter percentage point the hike the first since 2018 was widely expected but at a time when russia s war in ukraine has roiled global markets u s inflation is at its highest level since the 1980s and covid 19 cases are increasing in some parts of the world consumers and investors are contending with the prospect of rates going even higher at stake will stocks tank or soar will the pandemic induced demand for housing continue even though borrowing costs are going up and will rate hikes be enough to tame inflation the fed is faced with a real predicament said lauren goodwin economist and portfolio strategist at new york life investments even before the russia ukraine crisis the fed was facing an inflation problem and also an expectation that economic growth would slow the overall economic growth impact is less pronounced in the short term but the longer the conflict drags on the more risk we will see what the fed does to interest rates affects nearly every aspect of americans financial lives from the interest rates on credit cards and auto loans to the returns on their retirement savings and this increase is expected to be the first of many before the meeting traders were pricing in a total of seven rate hikes this year and the fed itself signaled six more hikes after this one here s what experts say consumers should be mindful of as interest rates rise stocks and retirement accounts an oft cited theory is that interest rates and stock prices move in opposite directions the idea is that equity valuations reflect the present value of a company s future earnings dividends or cash flows higher interest rates make that future money worth less today which in turn drags down stock prices but history tells a different story during the previous eight hiking cycles the s p 500 index was higher one year after the first increase every single time according to lpl financial the intuition is that higher rates are bad for stocks particularly growth stocks said katie nixon chief investment officer of wealth management at northern trust but if you look back to the post global financial crisis period stocks did well the fed did increase rates several times over that period stocks rose and growth stocks outperformed value stocks that s not carte blanche to go all in on stocks nixon said she worries that some investors concerned about rising rates may be overexposing themselves to equities and shunning bonds bringing too much risk into their portfolios bond prices typically fall when interest rates rise even in a rising rate environment fixed income does give you diversification against risk asset volatility she said noting that a rate hike is a good time for investors to reexamine their asset allocation savings accounts the fed s hike also means that the rates on so called high yield savings accounts will probably increase as well these online accounts like the marcus product from goldman sachs became popular in the past decade as an easy way for everyday investors to keep their cash savings fairly liquid yet still earn higher returns than those offered by most regular retail banks when the fed cut interest rates at the onset of the pandemic the companies behind these accounts lowered their rates as well to maintain profits in mid 2019 marcus offered a 2 rate but it s now only 0 5 although there will almost certainly be a lag the rates on high yield savings accounts will likely move higher as the fed tightens policy it s this timing game that everybody is trying to play said matt miskin co chief investment strategist at john hancock investment management do you put something in now do you wait until it goes a bit higher still it s going to be a tough environment for savers with inflation at almost 8 that underscores the importance of having a balanced portfolio that includes both high risk high return plays as well as safer bets like bonds miskin said real estate raging housing prices have everyone asking the same question when will the market cool down the answer is impossible to predict but some are hoping the fed s rate hikes will help temper demand and lower prices that s because mortgage rates will likely move higher as well lessening the appeal of buying a home mortgages track the 10 year treasury yield which tends to move in the same direction as the fed s benchmark rate the mortgage market has already priced in some of the impact of higher rates with the average for a 30 year loan hitting 3 85 last week up from 3 05 at the same time last year the short term rate hikes that the fed will embark on to try to tame inflation will certainly put upward pressure on auto loans and mortgage rates said taylor marr deputy chief economist at real estate brokerage redfin another big factor is the end of the fed s bond buying program which helped support fixed income markets during the pandemic a large portion of the purchases were mortgage backed securities contributing to lower mortgage rates marr expects program s end alongside higher rates to decrease demand for homes and slow price growth in the short term though increases in borrowing costs could further pinch homebuyers already struggling with the effects of inflation you ve got a higher mortgage rate and high costs for food and other things that s not going to be easy to manage for everyday people miskin said cryptocurrencies bitcoin ether and many other tokens have become popular with investors looking for potentially high returns even if that means more risk compared to traditional assets like stocks or bonds government stimulus checks also prompted new investors to begin trading during the pandemic and a fair amount of that money ended up in crypto markets rising rates are like a wet blanket on crypto said matt hougan chief investment officer at bitwise asset management if investors can find yield in lower risk corners of the market that suddenly makes crypto less attractive bitcoin prices have slumped around 40 from their high in november and ether has lost nearly 45 however some recent developments in the crypto space may help reduce its risk greater regulatory clarity is taking shape particularly after president joe biden signed an executive order earlier this month that industry participants viewed as benign institutional investors and venture capitalists have also flocked to the space giving it more liquidity the future the number of rate hikes this year will depend on factors like inflation economic growth and geopolitical risks estimates from wall street economists vary widely with some predicting as many as seven total in 2022 others believe that estimate is overblown miskin at john hancock expects the fed to start like a hawk and end like a dove this year essentially the central bank will raise rates in the first half to combat inflation but not as aggressively as some are predicting we do believe there is downside risk to the global economy given the russian war and the spike in commodity prices he said that s going to potentially dent global growth for consumers the biggest focus is likely on inflation which they can feel in everyday purchases the fed hikes will help lower prices but not immediately according to goodwin at new york life investments what they are hoping to achieve by raising interest rates is that by increasing the cost of financing they can slow demand on the margin for some of the goods and services that have seen such large increases in prices she said that process takes time

the federal reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point wednesday and it forecast six more for this year some economists say the fed may not execute all of its hikes because it could hurt the economy and inflation may begin to ebb others believe the fed will proceed as forecast because it is determined to prevent stagflation which means rising inflation but also rising unemployment the federal reserve forecast an aggressive campaign of interest rate hikes to fight inflation but that raises the question of whether the central bank can actually succeed without doing serious harm to the economy the fed raised interest rates by a quarter point wednesday the first hike since 2018 at the same time its forecast showed fed officials expect six more rate hikes this year and three next year stocks rallied and ended the day sharply higher after initially selling off on the central bank s forecast the dow was up 518 points or 1 5 while the nasdaq jumped 3 8 to 13 436 in the bond market yields jumped but were off their highs later in the day the 10 year yield which influences mortgages and other loans was at 2 19 down from 2 24 at its intraday high yields move opposite price get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters in my career today s federal reserve meeting is the most vetted before the fact meeting i ve ever witnessed said james paulsen chief investment strategist at leuthold group the stock market started to respond to this last august pauslen said the stock market had a sell the news type of reaction and it could be set up for a rally he noted that seven rate hikes were priced into the bond market even before the meeting but many economists had expected the fed would only forecast five or six a lot of this is priced in but the bigger issue for the market is whether we are going to see a recession said paulsen while economists are not forecasting recession they do see slower growth and the picture has become more clouded since russia invaded ukraine that war sparked its own inflation wave since russia is a major commodities producer and the conflict and sanctions raise doubts about supplies of oil wheat and other major exports i think the fed is too aggressive here said simona mocuta chief economist at state street global advisors economists have been revising down growth forecasts due to the russian invasion of ukraine how the economy evolves is highly uncertain they may not come to pass but certainly the fed delivered a very strong message i m still skeptical we ll get all these rate hikes said mocuta economists had expected the fed to sound hawkish or aggressive when it delivered the first rate hike many had viewed the fed as behind the curve because it initially viewed inflation as transitory and they felt it held onto that view for too long an inflationary shock inflation has continued to rise more than expected the consumer price index jumped to 7 9 in february and is expected to be even higher in march in the second half of the year inflation should slow down in part because of base effects in comparisons the policy trade off wasn t great before the ukraine war but ukraine makes it worse it s an inflationary shock but driven by factors the fed can t control mocuta said the fed is likely to carry out the first few rate hikes mocuta said but it should revisit the path of hikes and the economy in the third quarter if the situation in the russia ukraine conflict were to improve some pressures on inflation and supply chains would ease some supply chain pressures from the pandemic could also fade as the year wears on the way i d say it is they re signaling what they need to signal but whether they actually act on it is an open question said drew matus chief market strategist at metlife investment management this is not a demand side story i don t understand what the fed will achieve with that by way of inflation there are supply chain issues and energy issues that have nothing to do with the fed the fed also expects that core inflation will be 4 1 this year falling to 2 6 next year after the rate hikes the forecast also had gross domestic product growing at 4 this year and falling to 2 2 in 2023 fed officials saw the unemployment rate falling to 3 5 and staying there a lot of their forecasts don t make sense you have inflation coming down you have growth coming down but you have the unemployment rate staying steady matus said when you look at the unemployment rate staying steady there are some gaps in the logic matus said one of the gaps is that the fed would not be able to achieve that economic forecast if it really were to raise rates at the projected pace they re serious but others do expect the fed to proceed and seven rate hikes for this year has been in some wall street forecasts they re serious they re really far behind the curve on inflation those who don t think they will be able to execute seven hikes they re in for a rude shock said mark cabana head of u s short rate strategy at bank of america grant thornton s chief economist diane swonk said markets should take the fed at its word we cannot risk stagflation they admitted they now expect inflation to be hotter for longer and it wasn t just a ukraine issue she said seeing the market reaction clearly they don t believe it this is a monumental shift in the fed outlook in terms of rate hikes they do that for a reason and it wasn t just one person at the fed an outlier it was a systemic move across the fed even the most dovish fed officials swonk said the fed s forecast on unemployment may not add up but the central bank seriously wants to bring down inflation if fed officials move as forecast there are risks when i model seven rate hikes which is what my forecast is i see the economy stalling out to 1 average growth in the second half she said it s a semihard landing

business fed begins inflation fight with key rate hike more to come federal reserve chairman jerome powell testifies before the senate banking committee hearing thursday march 3 2022 on capitol hill in washington tom williams pool via ap the associated press washington ap the federal reserve launched a high risk effort wednesday to tame the worst inflation since the early 1980s raising its benchmark short term interest rate and signaling up to six additional rate hikes this year the fed s quarter point hike in its key rate which it had pinned near zero since the pandemic recession struck two years ago marks the start of its effort to curb the high inflation that followed the recovery from the recession the rate hikes will eventually mean higher loan rates for many consumers and businesses the central bank in a policy statement along with quarterly projections and remarks by chair jerome powell at a news conference pointed to a somewhat more aggressive approach to rate hikes than many analysts had expected advertisement the projections showed that seven of the central bank s 16 policymakers favor at least one half point rate hike this year suggesting that such a large increase is a live possibility said michael feroli an economist at jpmorgan chase at his news conference powell stressed his confidence that the economy is strong enough to withstand higher interest rates but he also made clear that the fed is focused on doing whatever it takes to reduce inflation over time to its 2 annual target otherwise powell warned the economy might not sustain its recovery from the pandemic recession we re acutely aware of the need to restore price stability the fed chair said in fact it s a precondition for achieving the kind of labor market that we want you can t have maximum employment for any sustained period without price stability the fed also released a set of quarterly economic projections wednesday that underscored the potential for extended interest rate increases in the months ahead seven hikes would raise its short term rate to between 1 75 and 2 at the end of 2022 fed officials also forecast four more rate increases in 2023 which would boost its benchmark rate to 2 8 that would be the highest level since march 2008 borrowing costs for mortgage loans credit cards and auto loans will likely rise as a result advertisement clearly inflation has moved front and center into the fed s thinking said tim duy chief u s economist at sgh macro advisers the central bank s policymakers expect inflation to remain elevated ending 2022 at 4 3 according to quarterly projections they released wednesday the officials also now forecast much slower economic growth this year of 2 8 down from a 4 estimate in december but many economists worry that with inflation already so high it reached 7 9 in february the worst in four decades and with russia s invasion of ukraine driving up gas prices the fed may have to raise rates even higher than it now expects and potentially cause a recession by its own admission the central bank underestimated the breadth and persistence of high inflation after the pandemic struck and many economists say the fed has made its task riskier by waiting too long to begin raising rates the fed s projections show that by the end of next year the policymakers expect their short term rate to be above neutral the level at which they think the rate neither fuels nor slows economic growth roberto perli an economist at piper sandler questioned powell s assurances that the economy could withstand such higher rates in the past whenever the fed has approached let alone exceeded neutral the economy weakened sharply perli wrote in a note to clients the risk of recession in 2023 and beyond is increasing advertisement yet powell downplayed the likelihood of an economic setback the probability of a recession in the next year is not particularly elevated he said at his news conference powell said he believed that inflation would slow later this year as supply chain bottlenecks clear and more americans return to the job market easing upward pressure on wages he also suggested that over time the fed s higher rates will reduce consumer spending on interest rate sensitive items like autos and cars americans may also buy less as credit card rates increase those trends would eventually reduce businesses demand for workers and slow pay raises which are running at a robust 6 annual rate and ease inflation pressures powell noted that there are a near record number of job openings leaving 1 7 available jobs on average for every unemployed person as a result he expressed confidence that the fed can lower demand for workers and wage growth without increasing unemployment all signs are that this is a strong economy he said one that will be able to flourish in the face of less accommodative monetary policy the fed s forecast for numerous additional rate hikes in the coming months initially disrupted a strong rally on wall street weakening stock gains and sending bond yields up but stock prices more than recovered their gains soon after the press conference began most economists say that sharply higher rates are long overdue to combat the escalation of inflation across the economy with the unemployment rate below 4 inflation nearing 8 and the war in ukraine likely to put even more upward pressure on prices this is what the fed needs to do to bring inflation under control said mike fratantoni chief economist at the mortgage bankers association advertisement powell is steering the fed into a sharp u turn officials had kept rates ultra low to support growth and hiring during the recession and its aftermath as recently as december fed officials had expected to raise rates just three times this year one member of the fed s rate setting committee james bullard head of the federal reserve bank of st louis dissented from wednesday s decision bullard favored a half point rate hike a position he has advocated in interviews and speeches the fed also said it would begin to reduce its nearly 9 trillion balance sheet which has more than doubled in size during the pandemic at a coming meeting that step will also have the effect of tightening credit for many consumers and businesses since its last meeting in january the challenges and uncertainties for the fed have escalated russia s invasion has magnified the cost of oil gas wheat and other commodities china has closed ports and factories again to try to contain a new outbreak of covid which will worsen supply chain disruptions and likely further fuel price pressures in the meantime the sharp rise in average gas prices since the invasion up more than 60 cents to 4 31 a gallon nationally will send inflation higher while also probably slowing growth two conflicting trends that are notoriously difficult for the fed to manage simultaneously ap economics writer paul wiseman contributed to this report
since the 2020 elections gridlock in the united states senate has transformed from a pressing political problem to a fact of political life from president joe biden s flagship build back better social policy plan to efforts to pass a new voting rights bill to attempts at basic police reform the story remains consistent a bill addressing popular discontent that aligns with democratic priorities gains steam among the majority of the party s senators but attempts to secure passage of the bill are blocked by either unified republican opposition or holdouts among the democrats the consistency of this story seems to suggest that the senate suffers from institutional paralysis and is incapable of passing legislation however this description is not entirely accurate despite public perception the senate has continued to pass significant legislation with bipartisan majorities throughout both the trump and biden presidencies the key according to the secret congress theory advanced by simon bazelon and matt yglesias is that successfully passing a bill requires that it draw little attention during the legislative process despite the strength of the theory s arguments however there are several difficulties in applying its prescriptions to practical policymaking the secret congress theory is by nature counterintuitive a basic understanding of the operations of representative democracy would suggest that the best way to ensure the passage of a bill is to ensure that people know and care about it so that their representatives will be motivated to fight for it despite this fact there are several examples that provide convincing evidence for the theory a recent example is the no surprises act which was passed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers and banned surprise medical billing an issue which had drawn significant media attention despite the bill s wide impact on the lawsuits that hospitals and doctors groups filed in response to the bill the legislative process received little coverage and attention another prominent example mentioned by bazelon and yglesias is the drinking water and wastewater infrastructure act which allocated funds for the improvement of water infrastructure other examples include bills banning arbitration in sexual assault cases and postal service reform while some of these bills carried large price tags they attracted little to no media coverage and passed with bipartisan majorities with each receiving enough votes to overcome the filibuster possibly due to their tackling of popular issues according to the secret congress theory this is not a coincidence the key assumption behind the theory is that the most powerful force in national politics is negative partisanship a phenomenon where voters mobilize against a party rather than in favor of one while rare in the past negative partisanship has risen rapidly in recent years opinion polls suggest that americans opinions of the political party they do not belong to have declined sharply since 1980 the secret congress theory holds that under such conditions of extreme negative partisanship drawing attention to a bill has the effect of associating it with a specific political party and therefore turning members of the opposing party against it to avoid giving the other party a win under these conditions believers in the secret congress theory would suggest as bazelon and yglesias do that the best way to pass bills is to avoid drawing attention to them the secret congress theory is extremely compelling it offers a way to harmonize prominent examples of gridlock with the senate s continued action on other legislation it also provides a reasonably simple strategy prescription for groups or individuals who want to affect policy by steering them towards behind the scenes intervention in issues which draw little attention however the theory suffers from several difficulties that significantly weaken its suggestions the most prominent difficulty involves the direction of causality between public attention and bill passage while the theory asserts that a lack of attention allows lawmakers to act in bipartisan ways and pass legislation an equally plausible interpretation is that those bills which lawmakers would naturally be inclined to pass on a bipartisan basis are also predisposed to receive little public attention it seems somewhat unrealistic to think that increased public attention on the no surprises act or the drinking water and wastewater infrastructure act would have resulted in these bills becoming bogged down in partisan infighting as their content is popular and uncontroversial however its core claim relies on an unproven causal relationship which could convincingly work the opposite way and this fact leaves its strategy suggestions with questionable value and inherently limited scope determining whether an issue benefited from low media coverage or if it is generally uncontroversial is difficult and this difficulty complicates secret congress theory s prescriptions after all bazelon and yglesias are making an explicitly causal claim that aggressive partisan affiliated public advocacy can help you pass bills if it leads to landslide electoral victories but in a nonelectoral context you are more likely to make headway by staying chill if the relationship between attention and policy success flows the opposite way then this advice is based on faulty causal inference and may not have any effect if put into practice one example that supports this reversed causality is the ban congressional stock trading act which has garnered bipartisan support alongside significant media coverage and public attention stock trading bans for congressional representatives would appear to be popular and uncontroversial enough to receive bipartisan support despite high salience raising doubts about whether low levels of public attention allowed other bipartisan bills to pass or if they were popular enough to pass anyway similarly the infrastructure investment and jobs act commonly known as the bipartisan infrastructure deal received significant media attention during the legislative process and still passed in the senate with a bipartisan majority this interpretation of the secret congress theory also casts doubt on the optimistic interpretation that the secret congress proves the senate remains a functional institution in contrast to bazelon and yglesias belief that this theory shows there are lots of high impact neglected legislative areas in which progress is feasible reversing the proposed direction of causality implies that the senate as it operates currently is inherently limited to the space of issues that are both popular and uncontroversial it further suggests that attempts to expand to issues outside of this narrow area will fail no matter how little attention the individual trying to effect change draws to it the strategy of the individual or policymaker means nothing and any effort to tackle an important issue such as climate change or poverty will fail this is a profoundly pessimistic view of senate institutions and one that suggests the need for significant reform the secret congress theory is enticing because it offers a possibility that gridlock is a somewhat illusory phenomenon necessarily illuminated by the fact that bills the public knows about are much more likely to fail than those that remain obscure it also offers those who accept its findings a way to effect policy change without needing to win electoral victories or wait for structural reforms of senate institutions that may never come however its core claim relies on an unproven causal relationship which could convincingly work the opposite way and this fact leaves its implications with questionable value and inherently limited scope in the end no matter how much it would like to secret congress theory cannot save us from the failure of modern senate institutions and the urgent need for structural reform
the hospitality sector is flying in foreign workers which is a bad sign for the economy now but a great one going forward all around us we re seeing good omens that the economy is getting back to normal and the need for foreign workers and the fact that they might be attainable is a great positive indicator for the economy travellers who come here to not just holiday but work have been crucial for many businesses in the financial year 2020 which was when the pandemic struck in february we still received a total of 439 000 international backpackers which was significantly less than the previous financial year for virus reasons but as we closed up the economy to beat the coronavirus those workers were not needed but the fact that businesses are crying out for them now is a real plus for our outlook despite problems now but that was then this is now with unemployment at 4 2 which is a low level not seen since before the gfc in 2008 and employment is at a record high so it s not surprising that the afr s dominic powell has reported that the parent company behind a number of prominent restaurants such as rockpool spice temple munich brauhaus and the bavarian has employed 125 recruits from the middle east europe and the united states at a cost of 10 000 to 20 000 per employee in an effort to bolster languishing worker numbers locally the caterer for the mcg says the business is a few hundred short of the usual 3 000 workers they have to run their business across many venues and the afr story quoted restaurant owners telling us demand to dine out is strong this uptick in demand for hospitality workers comes as the economic activity tracker chart says to expect both a lot of job opportunities and inflation in coming months that blue line is on the rise and it shows australia is economically rebounding better than the usa the red line and europe which will soon show the negative effects of the ukraine war hopefully that will be a short term problem with news overnight that eu stock markets reacted very positively to peace talks progress between russia and ukraine the german stock market was up a big 3 76 on the hopeful news and the french cac index was 3 68 higher if the war can be ceased then the focus will go onto how many interest rate rises are likely for the us economy overnight the fed made its first quarter per cent interest rate rise and looking at the predictions of the fed presidents who vote six more rises this year could be on the cards this will happen if the us economy remains strong and inflation remains elevated interestingly the dow did not sell off on the fed s rate rise news and the tech heavy nasdaq actually was up a notable 2 98 which is a positive sign considering the tech sell offs lately on that subject paul zahra the ceo of the australian retailers association says a tsunami of inflation is coming on goods his members sell as the supply chain problems caused by the pandemic and now oil price increases coming out of the ukraine war make it impossible for retailers to resist price increases fortunately peace talks have helped the price of oil fall 23 in a week to us95 a barrel after hitting nearly us124 last week what lies ahead for the economy is uncertain because of the war the fed now raising interest rates and china going back into lockdown because of a new virus threat but stock markets are a forecaster on the economy and the future profitability of companies and right now they re becoming progressively positive german dax this chart of the german stock market s dax shows the kick up with peace talks helping push the oil price down 23 in a week provided a settlement can eventually be reached between russia and ukraine the expected economic rebound should help stock markets and the international movement of goods services and people seeing the economy get back to normal and the stock market starting to consistently rise as rachel hunter once said in a pantene commercial about how the product that would improve your hair it won t happen overnight but it will happen that s the kind of economic and investing model i like

communication infrastructure services and software solutions to the telecommunications and other sectors the company operates in among other countries the republic of iraq iraq ericsson has a well documented history of using bribes to secure business in countries throughout the middle east and asia for example in december 2019 ericsson was the subject of a u s securities and exchange commission sec action alleging among other things that the company used third party consultants and illicit payments from 2011 through early 2017 to access business in djibouti saudi arabia and china the company also entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the u s department of justice doj the same month for its illicit business dealings following the foregoing regulatory enforcement actions which resulted in ericsson being fined over 520 million and nearly 540 million by the doj and sec respectively ericsson repeatedly assured investors that the company had a zero tolerance stance for bribery and was making significant investments in related programs for example in a december 2019 press release the company asserted that it was nhancing internal anti corruption and compliance related awareness campaigns including the company s zero tolerance for corruption likewise in its 2019 annual report the company asserted that it has zero tolerance for corruption and work hard every day to

faced with what could turn into the biggest supply crisis in decades global energy markets are at a crossroads russia s invasion of ukraine has brought energy security back to the forefront of political agendas as commodity prices surge to new heights while it is still too early to know how events will unfold the crisis may result in lasting changes to energy markets the implications of a potential loss of russian oil exports to global markets cannot be understated russia is the world s largest oil exporter shipping 8 mb d of crude and refined oil products to customers across the globe unprecedented sanctions imposed on russia to date exclude energy trade for the most part but major oil companies trading houses shipping firms and banks have backed away from doing business with the country for now we see the potential for a shut in of 3 mb d of russian oil supply starting from april but losses could increase should restrictions or public condemnation escalate russian oil continues to flow for the time being due to term deals and trades made before moscow sent its troops into ukraine but new business has all but dried up urals crude is being offered at record discounts with limited uptake so far some asian oil importers have shown interest in the much cheaper barrels but are for the most part sticking to traditional suppliers in the middle east latin america and africa for the bulk of their purchases refiners particularly in europe are scrambling to source alternative supplies and risk having to reduce activity just as very tight oil product markets hit consumers there are scant signs of increased supplies coming from the middle east or of a significant reallocation of trade flows the opec alliance agreed on 2 march to stick with a modest scheduled output rise of 400 kb d for april insisting no supply shortage exists saudi arabia and the uae the only producers with substantial spare capacity are so far showing no willingness to tap into their reserves prospects of any additional supplies from iran could be months off talks over a nuclear deal that paves the way for sanction relief have apparently stalled just before the finish line should an agreement be reached exports could ramp up by around 1 mb d over a six month period outside of the opec alliance growth will come from the us canada brazil and guyana but any near term upside potential is limited in the absence of a faster ramp up in production oil stocks will have to balance the market in the coming months but even before the conflict russia s attacks on ukraine the industry s oil inventories were depleting rapidly at the end of january oecd inventories were 335 mb below their five year average and at eight year lows iea emergency stocks will provide a welcome buffer and member countries stand ready to release more oil from strategic reserves if and when needed in addition to the 62 7 mb of crude and products already pledged surging oil and commodity prices if sustained will have a marked impact on inflation and economic growth while the situation remains in flux we have lowered our expectations for gdp and oil demand in this report we now see oil demand growing by 2 1 mb d on average in 2022 a downgrade of around 1 mb d from our previous forecast there are actions governments and consumers can take to cut short term demand for oil more rapidly to ease the strains and the iea will publish recommendations for how to do so later this week the current crisis comes with major challenges for energy markets but it also offers opportunities indeed today s alignment of energy security and economic factors could well accelerate the transition away from oil source iea

the u s federal reserve launched a high risk effort wednesday to tame the worst inflation since the early 1980s raising its benchmark short term interest rate and signaling up to six additional rate increases this year the fed s quarter point hike in its key rate which had been pinned near zero since the pandemic recession struck two years ago marks the start of its effort to curb the high inflation that followed the recovery from the recession the rate hikes will eventually mean higher loan rates for many consumers and businesses the central bank in a policy statement along with quarterly projections and remarks by chair jerome powell at a news conference pointed to a somewhat more aggressive approach to rate hikes than many analysts had expected the projections showed that seven of the central bank s 16 policymakers favor at least one half point rate hike this year suggesting that such a large increase is possible said michael feroli an economist at jpmorgan chase at his news conference powell stressed his confidence that the economy is strong enough to withstand higher interest rates but he also made clear that the fed is focused on doing whatever it takes to reduce inflation over time to its 2 annual target otherwise powell warned the economy might not sustain its recovery from the pandemic recession we re acutely aware of the need to restore price stability the fed chair said in fact it s a precondition for achieving the kind of labor market that we want you can t have maximum employment for any sustained period without price stability quarterly projections the fed also released a set of quarterly economic projections wednesday that underscored the potential for extended interest rate increases in the months ahead seven hikes would raise its short term rate to between 1 75 and 2 at the end of 2022 fed officials also forecast four more rate increases in 2023 which would boost its benchmark rate to 2 8 that would be the highest level since march 2008 borrowing costs for mortgage loans credit cards and auto loans will likely rise as a result clearly inflation has moved front and center into the fed s thinking said tim duy chief u s economist at sgh macro advisors the central bank s policymakers expect inflation to remain elevated ending 2022 at 4 3 according to quarterly projections they released wednesday the officials also forecast a much slower economic growth of 2 8 this year down from a 4 estimate in december but many economists worry that with inflation already so high it reached 7 9 in february the worst in four decades and with russia s invasion of ukraine driving up gas prices the fed may have to raise rates even higher than it now expects and potentially cause a recession by its own admission the central bank underestimated the breadth and persistence of high inflation after the pandemic struck and many economists say the fed has made its task riskier by waiting too long to begin raising rates the fed s projections show that by the end of next year the policymakers expect their short term rate to be above neutral the level at which they think the rate neither fuels nor slows economic growth roberto perli an economist at piper sandler questioned powell s assurances that the economy could withstand such higher rates in the past whenever the fed has approached let alone exceeded neutral the economy weakened sharply perli wrote in a note to clients the risk of recession in 2023 and beyond is increasing powell s predictions yet powell downplayed the likelihood of an economic setback the probability of a recession in the next year is not particularly elevated he said at his news conference powell said he believed that inflation would slow later this year as supply chain bottlenecks clear and more americans return to the job market easing upward pressure on wages he also suggested that over time the fed s higher rates will reduce consumer spending on interest rate sensitive items such as autos and cars americans may also buy less as credit card rates increase those trends would eventually reduce businesses demand for workers and slow pay raises which are running at a robust 6 annual rate and ease inflation pressures powell noted that there are a near record number of job openings leaving 1 7 available jobs on average for every unemployed person as a result he expressed confidence that the fed can lower demand for workers and wage growth without increasing unemployment all signs are that this is a strong economy he said one that will be able to flourish in the face of less accommodative monetary policy the fed s forecast for numerous additional rate hikes in the coming months initially disrupted a strong rally on wall street weakening stock gains and sending bond yields up but stock prices more than recovered their gains soon after the press conference began most economists say that sharply higher rates are long overdue to combat the escalation of inflation across the economy with the unemployment rate below 4 inflation nearing 8 and the war in ukraine likely to put even more upward pressure on prices this is what the fed needs to do to bring inflation under control said mike fratantoni chief economist at the mortgage bankers association powell is steering the fed into a sharp u turn officials had kept rates ultra low to support growth and hiring during the recession and its aftermath as recently as december fed officials had expected to raise rates just three times this year one member of the fed s rate setting committee james bullard head of the federal reserve bank of st louis dissented from wednesday s decision bullard favored a half point rate hike a position he has advocated in interviews and speeches the fed also said it would begin to reduce its nearly 9 trillion balance sheet which has more than doubled in size during the pandemic at a coming meeting that step will also have the effect of tightening credit for many consumers and businesses since its last meeting in january the challenges and uncertainties for the fed have escalated russia s invasion has magnified the cost of oil gas wheat and other commodities china has closed ports and factories again to contain a new outbreak of covid 19 which will worsen supply chain disruptions and likely further fuel price pressures in the

futures were showing up 41 points yesterday morning on a balance of a strong rally on wall street and another night of steep commodity price falls the rally on wall street was as much about a retreating oil price as anything else hence while lower oil may not be good for the energy sector it s good for everyone else having duly opened up around 40 points the asx200 then spent the first hour wondering what to do next investors stopped wondering when beijing came to the rescue one reason oil has come off its highs is related to lockdowns in china which also had the hang seng index plunging 5 7 on tuesday on economic slowdown assumptions yesterday beijing pledged to keep its stock markets stable and take measures to boost economic growth in the first quarter the government will roll out policies favourable to capital markets while being cautious in introducing contractionary measures and continues to support companies listing of shares overseas and has maintained good communications with us regulators on chinese companies listings in the us china s monetary policy should actively respond to support the economy and new credit should help maintain appropriate growth in other words the chinese capital markets will do exactly what the chinese communist party wants and they did the hang seng jumped 9 1 note that on tuesday night morgan stanley had lowered its chinese march quarter gdp growth forecast to zero on this news the australian resource sectors managed not to take another tumble yesterday with energy closing up 0 2 and materials 0 4 but relief from oil prices is positive for the consumer sectors discretionary and staples both up 2 0 which flows through to the banks 1 1 indeed every sector closed in the green yesterday with technology leading the percentages 3 3 on the nasdaq bounce overnight we could delve deeper but there s little point when we note wall street shot up again last night evoking talk of a bottom being in not for the first time and our futures are up 106 points this morning buy the fact the bounce on wall street kicked on ahead of the fed last night with the dow up over 400 points through to lunchtime a little bit of squaring followed before the 2pm fed statement release and then on that release the dow dropped into the negative within half an hour the median fomc forecast as denoted by the infamous dot plots was for seven consecutive rate hikes in 2022 and another four in 2023 the first one was last night up 25 points a rate hike at every meeting this year had been forecast by some economists although consensus was around 4 5 hikes in 2022 particularly given the impact of ukraine but when jay powell made his accompanying speech at the press conference he confirmed every meeting this year is now live this doesn t mean seven hikes are priced in data will still inform but it does mean the fed will go seven in seven if it is deemed to be necessary all powell really had to do was say we were behind the curve for leading up to the fed meeting the us two year bond yield had reached 1 75 the fed funds rate is overnight but the two year is seen as a reliable indicator and from zero 1 75 is seven times 0 25 wall street had already priced in the fed s now even more hawkish stance on that basis one might have expected that when the dust settled the us stock market would close the day unchanged but aside from powell underscoring his hawkishness with an insistence that the us economy is very strong in response to growing recession fears the fact is the fed has laid out its policy position for the whole rest of the year the greatest enemy of financial markets is uncertainty we now know every meeting from here is live while the data flow will still be critical at each coming meeting the fed will now begin catching up to the market not leading it down the wrong path add in a call by many that wall street had been oversold on geopolitical fears as well as tuesday night s bounce and the light was green last night for investors to at least assume a bottom is now in the only caveat is putin the us economy is nevertheless very dependent on the us consumer in january us retail sales rose 4 9 month on month in february as revealed last night they rose only 0 3 in march the oil price spike will come into play there was also no talk last night of when the fed will start reducing its balance sheet maybe to be discussed at the next meeting which may be when any relief rally comes to a screaming halt the aforementioned us two year yield rose 9 points last night to 1 95 while the ten year rose 3 points to 2 19 if the twos exceed the tens it s a signal of a possible recession afoot note that the us seven year yield rose 5 points to 2 23 last night but for now a 3 8 rally for the nasdaq in particular is a sign wall street is back on track albeit the nasdaq is still 17 below its high last night s move was aided by a bounce for chinese stocks listed in the us all of which posted jumps of 30 40 on the news out of beijing last night wall street turned positive for the month commodities spot metals minerals energy futures gold oz 1923 30 9 10 0 48 silver oz 25 03

metals were not about the fed or a subsequent 0 7 fall for the us dollar as the lme closes ahead of the press conference the gains including that of iron ore were all about chinese stimulus gold

hey there time traveller this article was published 15 03 2022 761 days ago so information in it may no longer be current operations at a winnipeg based plastic packaging giant were disrupted for about two weeks after its computer network was held ransom in a sophisticated cyberattack that s becoming increasingly common in canada hackers infiltrated winpak ltd which has manufacturing plants in

were disrupted the sources said jason halstead winnipeg free press files a spokesman for winpak said the company learned last month its network had been targeted through sophisticated and unauthorized means one source was unable to contact employees at the winnipeg plant for a significant period of time following the attack a spokesman for winpak based at 100 saulteaux cres in the murray industrial park in st james said the company learned on feb 21 its network had been targeted through sophisticated and unauthorized means operations didn t return to normal until early last week he said winpak would not say how much money was demanded or if a ransom was paid such attacks can be very profitable for cyber criminals netting them tens of thousands or even millions of dollars winpak immediately took action to protect our infrastructure and we are back resuming normal business operations the company said a prepared statement we are working with a team of third party cybersecurity experts to investigate the incident and are taking all the necessary steps to respond to the incident this matter is of the utmost concern to winpak and is being treated as our highest priority we thank everyone

most ransomware attacks begin with a hacker sending malicious software or malware in a phishing email disguised as being from a trustworthy sender said experts when opened the malware infiltrates a network and encrypts files essentially locking out an entire company usually a message pops up demanding the victim pay a ransom in cryptocurrency to regain access jessica lee winnipeg free press winpak limited headquarters on saulteaux crescent earlier this month winpak reported a record 1 billion in revenue for the 2021 fiscal year a 17 5 per cent increase from 852 million in 2020 everything

up everything it can and make nothing usable said matthew manaigre a cybersecurity expert and president and ceo of winnipeg based avenir it it s quite crippling most ransomware attacks are kept quiet but they happen all the time said manaigre and toronto based cybersecurity and tech analyst ritesh kotak it s a lot more common than people realize said kotak there has been a significant increase in a survey of more than 1 000 canadian businesses last september 55 per cent of respondents said their organization had been a recent victim of ransomware of those almost 60 per cent paid a ransom and 14 per cent paid more than once it s a lot more common than people realize there has been a significant increase ritesh kotak tech analyst canadian companies pay an average ransom of 458 247 according to the poll conducted by angus reid on behalf of cybersecurity company palo alto networks of those polled 17 per cent paid between 500 000 and 5 million my position has always been not to pay said kotak if a ransom is paid the hackers could refuse to give a decryption key or demand more cash or the money could end up funding terrorism or organized crime he said of the businesses polled by angus reid 58 per cent needed more than a month to recover from an attack in december the communications security establishment cse the national cyberspy agency said canada is among the top countries affected by ransomware more than half of canadian victims in the first half of 2021 were critical infrastructure providers including the energy health and manufacturing sectors the cse said it said the frequency of global ransomware attacks soared 151 per cent from 2020 to 2021 and the average cost of recovery had more than doubled to 2 3 million last year manaigre and kotak said the trends show

diane dahn with son mark beyer drahn 29 was killed in her santee apartment in 1988 in what later became a cold case on wednesday sheriff s investigators announced that they used dna and genetic genealogy to identify a suspect warren robertson who died in a house fire in indiana in 1999 robertson was 39 it was a monday afternoon in 1988 when a co worker found 29 year old diane lynn dahn bludgeoned and stabbed to death in her apartment in santee wandering nearby was dahn s 2 year old son the case went unsolved for 34 years now dahn s son mark beyer 36 says he finally has closure advertisement on wednesday sheriff s officials announced they had a suspect they used dna and a process known as genetic genealogy to identify the accused killer warren robertson robertson died in a house fire in indiana in 1999 he was 39 mike beyer diane dohn s son speaks via a video during a press conference wednesday when sheriff s investigators announced they solved dahn s murder through genetic genealogy sandy huffaker for the san diego union tribune the answers that my family received it s closure and closure is everything even after so much time had passed beyer said in a video officials showed during a news conference according to investigators robertson and dahn lived in the same apartment complex on graves avenue near prospect avenue in 1988 robertson was a tow truck driver dahn worked as an electronics technician with san diego transit corp both were racing enthusiasts who attended stock car races investigators were unable to determine if they knew each other before the slaying also unknown is the motive although dahn was nude when her body was found investigators said there was no evidence of sexual assault they said robertson had a criminal history that included low level property crimes but no violent crimes investigators said robertson moved to lakeside soon after the homicide then to indiana the following year for years investigators tried to use dna to solve the case to no avail in late 2000 they extracted dna from samples that had been scraped from dahn s fingernails when they uploaded the dna to a national criminal database there was no match in the summer of 2010 investigators turned to new technology to process a hair follicle that had been found in dahn s hand once again they uploaded the dna to the national database and again they found no match it was in may 2020 that investigators turned to genetic genealogy they used genealogy sites to find relatives whose dna matched the dna of the unidentified suspect according to investigators the sheriff s department uses websites that give users the option to allow law enforcement to view their dna profiles to find matches in dahn s case there were many matches the next step was to build family trees to zero in on the suspect throughout the process investigators contacted relatives to ask for help to build out the branches of the family trees investigators would construct nine family trees with nearly 1 300 relatives tied to robertson either through blood or marriage the process was extremely laborious said jeffrey vandersip senior crime intelligence analyst the genealogy led investigators to robertson s children a paternity test confirmed that the dna investigators had matched robertson s dna this case would have never been solved without genetic genealogy vandersip said i have no doubt in my mind victoria dohn minter diane dohn s sister speaks during a press conference wednesday sandy huffaker for the san diego union tribune dahn s sister victoria dahn minter thanked investigators for their work on the case over the years i didn t think anything was ever going to come of this dahn minter said through tears i thought i myself was going to go to my grave not knowing who killed dahn she said her older sister taught her music and foreign languages and recalled ditching school together to go skiing we just did lots of things together dahn minter said we always wanted to raise our children together when this happened it was just devastating the day she got the news that the case was solved probably was other than the birth of my children the best day of my life she said beyer dahn s son said a family friend adopted him after his biological mother s death he grew up with two older brothers and regularly saw his grandparents and aunt even so he sometimes felt alone he said you kind of feel alone because of what you went through you lost your mother he said he too thanked the investigators who worked on the case i was so blown away when i heard the story of how it actually transpired how you go from what little information you have to building a case like that was truly impressive byer said the homicide marked the fifth time sheriff s investigators used genetic genealogy to solve a cold case the victims in the other cases were orbin holloway teresa solecki michelle louise wyatt and laurie diane potter investigators said they expect to solve more cases with the help of genetic genealogy

upon taking office the biden administration committed to putting human rights at the center of u s foreign policy and defined combatting corruption as a core u s national security interest yet as part of its impending deal with iran the administration will lift sanctions on supreme leader ali khamenei and his 100 billion corporate empire cum slush fund known as eiko which stands for execution of imam khomeini s order thanks to the extraordinary power it wields as khamenei s economic arm eiko is essentially an extortion racket that has seized a dominant position in iran s economy through corruption arbitrary confiscation of private property denial of due process and preferential access to investment and bidding contracts under khamenei s direct control eiko is also tax exempt and completely opaque it enables him to fund every pet project he wishes and shake down ordinary iranians to replenish its coffers lifting sanctions on eiko does not advance joe biden s purported goal of a nuclear détente with tehran the move would simply be a payoff to the supreme leader to secure his approval of a new nuclear deal the obama administration sanctioned eiko in june 2013 along with thirty seven subsidiaries in iran and overseas which the treasury department s top counterterrorism official described as a shadowy network of off the books front companies whose job is to hide billions of dollars of corporate profits at the expense of the iranian people nonetheless as part of the 2015 nuclear deal formally known as the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa the united states delisted eiko then as now the move had nothing to do with nuclear issues it was a reward for the supreme leader eiko is an immense conglomerate that a 2013 reuters investigation valued at almost 100 billion more than half of this wealth by reuters estimates consists of real estate often acquired illegally through arbitrary confiscation and judicial arm twisting at the expense of dissidents religious minorities like the baha is and iranians residing abroad given that reuters assessment drew from land real estate and stock exchange values as old as 2008 eiko may be worth much more once sanctions are lifted and more importantly will generate significantly more revenue than it already does as my colleagues behnam ben taleblu and saeed ghasseminejad noted in 2017 eiko has become a vehicle for khamenei to receive huge sums of money without any oversight solidifying his grip on the country s byzantine power structure atop which he sits this corruption at the height of the covid 19 pandemic was responsible for delays in the acquisition and distribution of life saving personal protection equipment ppe for iran s civilian population eiko was also reportedly hoarding ppe to profit from its citizens misery eiko s companies occupy virtually every sector of iran s economy ranging from real estate and energy to wealth management funds insurance and pharmaceuticals making it a formidable competitor for foreign bids and contracts foreign companies returning to iran s market will soon discover that their business ventures all have the supreme leader as a silent partner their investments will have to compromise with the corruption he supervises and the revenue they generate may end up facilitating the covert advancement of nuclear weapons as the treasury department made clear in its 2013 sanctions announcement eiko was engaged in assisting the iranian government s circumvention of u s and international sanctions the announcement followed the revelation in april 2013 that eiko controlled factories in europe that gave iran access to sensitive dual use nuclear technology sanctions relief for eiko and for all its previously sanctioned subsidiaries and officials will also increase the supreme leader s access to discretionary funds used to support terrorism and spread iranian propaganda as my colleagues eric lorber and matthew zweig noted in 2019 the executive order under which eiko is currently sanctioned e o 13876 has nothing to do with nuclear issues the order targets actions of the government of iran and iranian backed proxies particularly those taken to destabilize the middle east promote international terrorism and advance iran s ballistic missile program and iran s irresponsible and provocative actions in and over international waters including the targeting of united states military assets and civilian vessels removing eiko from the sanctions list on the pretext of nuclear détente follows no clear logic at least in theory the impending deal will impose meaningful restraints on iran s nuclear program thus removing the need to sanction its components but the deal will have no provision to restrain corruption or judicial abuse on the contrary eiko will be able to act with impunity abroad much like it already does at home the new iran deal will make eiko a lead culprit in the clerical regime s corruption plunder of state resources human rights abuses terrorism and regional adventurism much richer than ever before this is biden s gift to the ayatollahs it is the price of negotiations built around the hope that tehran will be grateful for biden s commitment to diplomacy rather than eager to exploit it to the hilt emanuele ottolenghi is a senior fellow at the foundation for defense of democracies a non partisan research institute in washington dc focusing on national security and foreign policy follow him on twitter eottolenghi image reuters

president joe biden vice president kamala harris members of congress and administration officials convened on tuesday to commemorate equal pay day a day highlighting the need to ensure that women are paid as much as their male counterparts despite improvements to the earnings of women equal pay day continues to be not so equal when you get into the weeds of it all wendy chun hoon director of the women s bureau at the united states department of labor told thegrio that the non traditional jobs are where women find parity financially but noted that it s difficult for them to remain in those jobs due to sexism racism and other factors this is an unfortunate thing said chun hoon really we are 74 days into the new year and women s wages are only catching up to what men were paid at the end of last year so essentially that amounts to 83 cents on the dollar and that math doesn t add up she added for women of color specifically for black women latinas these gaps are 64 cents on the dollar and 57 cents on the dollar so math is definitely not adding up photo adobe stock the labor department has created the good jobs initiative in hopes of creating sustainable jobs over the next decade including in transportation construction jobs and even broadband these are the jobs believed to offer family sustaining wages and benefits and in some instances are supported by unions as the biden administration works on equity and inclusion chun hoon said the labor department wants to make sure that women and women of color are in those jobs however even when women of color get these jobs success is not guaranteed chun hoon acknowledged a major negative finding from a labor department study of women and their pay is occupational segregation there is a heavy price to pay for occupational segregation it costs black women 39 3 billion in 2019 she told thegrio noting that those figures were from just before the start of the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 for hispanic women 46 7 billion so that is the cost of occupational segregation said hoon there is a deeper reason for this racial disparity according to chun hoon she explained basically it means that women are overrepresented in certain jobs and they re underrepresented in certain jobs the jobs that women are overrepresented in are some of the lower valued least valued undervalued is what we say in the report jobs in our economy these same jobs which we know women of color are working in were the jobs that took the hardest hits during covid so we re talking restaurant jobs retail jobs even education jobs when everything shuttered folks lost their jobs so that is also part of the reason why things are so disproportionately bad for women but specifically women of color credit adobe stock this issue of occupational segregation perpetuates the united states poverty numbers particularly for minority women for black women statistics show they are leading as the head of household and the breadwinner according to the center for american progress the highest rates of poverty are experienced by american indian or alaska native aian women black women and latinas about 1 in 4 aian women live in poverty the highest rate of poverty among women or men of any racial or ethnic group during her remarks at tuesday s summit vice president harris said that in addition to the work the white house is doing to close the gender pay gap american companies should conduct pay audits on how they are paying women employees and urged them to be transparent about the results the labor department is already directing federal contractors to do just that pay transparency creates accountability she said and accountability well that drives progress thegrio is now on your tv via apple tv amazon fire roku and android tv also please download thegrio mobile apps today

washington the u s federal reserve launched a high risk effort wednesday to tame the worst inflation since the early 1980s raising its benchmark short term interest rate and signaling up to six additional rate increases this year the fed s quarter point hike in its key rate which had been pinned near zero since the pandemic recession struck two years ago marks the start of its effort to curb the high inflation that followed the recovery from the recession the rate hikes will eventually mean higher loan rates for many consumers and businesses the central bank in a policy statement along with quarterly projections and remarks by chair jerome powell at a news conference pointed to a somewhat more aggressive approach to rate hikes than many analysts had expected u s federal reserve board chairman jerome powell testifies during his re nomination hearing before a senate committee on capitol hill in washington jan 11 2022 the projections showed that seven of the central bank s 16 policymakers favor at least one half point rate hike this year suggesting that such a large increase is possible said michael feroli an economist at jpmorgan chase at his news conference powell stressed his confidence that the economy is strong enough to withstand higher interest rates but he also made clear that the fed is focused on doing whatever it takes to reduce inflation over time to its 2 annual target otherwise powell warned the economy might not sustain its recovery from the pandemic recession we re acutely aware of the need to restore price stability the fed chair said in fact it s a precondition for achieving the kind of labor market that we want you can t have maximum employment for any sustained period without price stability quarterly projections the fed also released a set of quarterly economic projections wednesday that underscored the potential for extended interest rate increases in the months ahead seven hikes would raise its short term rate to between 1 75 and 2 at the end of 2022 fed officials also forecast four more rate increases in 2023 which would boost its benchmark rate to 2 8 that would be the highest level since march 2008 borrowing costs for mortgage loans credit cards and auto loans will likely rise as a result clearly inflation has moved front and center into the fed s thinking said tim duy chief u s economist at sgh macro advisors the central bank s policymakers expect inflation to remain elevated ending 2022 at 4 3 according to quarterly projections they released wednesday the officials also forecast a much slower economic growth of 2 8 this year down from a 4 estimate in december but many economists worry that with inflation already so high it reached 7 9 in february the worst in four decades and with russia s invasion of ukraine driving up gas prices the fed may have to raise rates even higher than it now expects and potentially cause a recession by its own admission the central bank underestimated the breadth and persistence of high inflation after the pandemic struck and many economists say the fed has made its task riskier by waiting too long to begin raising rates the fed s projections show that by the end of next year the policymakers expect their short term rate to be above neutral the level at which they think the rate neither fuels nor slows economic growth roberto perli an economist at piper sandler questioned powell s assurances that the economy could withstand such higher rates in the past whenever the fed has approached let alone exceeded neutral the economy weakened sharply perli wrote in a note to clients the risk of recession in 2023 and beyond is increasing powell s predictions yet powell downplayed the likelihood of an economic setback the probability of a recession in the next year is not particularly elevated he said at his news conference powell said he believed that inflation would slow later this year as supply chain bottlenecks clear and more americans return to the job market easing upward pressure on wages he also suggested that over time the fed s higher rates will reduce consumer spending on interest rate sensitive items such as autos and cars americans may also buy less as credit card rates increase those trends would eventually reduce businesses demand for workers and slow pay raises which are running at a robust 6 annual rate and ease inflation pressures powell noted that there are a near record number of job openings leaving 1 7 available jobs on average for every unemployed person as a result he expressed confidence that the fed can lower demand for workers and wage growth without increasing unemployment all signs are that this is a strong economy he said one that will be able to flourish in the face of less accommodative monetary policy the fed s forecast for numerous additional rate hikes in the coming months initially disrupted a strong rally on wall street weakening stock gains and sending bond yields up but stock prices more than recovered their gains soon after the press conference began most economists say that sharply higher rates are long overdue to combat the escalation of inflation across the economy with the unemployment rate below 4 inflation nearing 8 and the war in ukraine likely to put even more upward pressure on prices this is what the fed needs to do to bring inflation under control said mike

its aftermath as recently as december fed officials had expected to raise rates just three times this year one member of the fed s rate setting committee james bullard head of the federal reserve bank of st louis dissented from wednesday s decision bullard favored a half point rate hike a position he has advocated in interviews and speeches the fed also said it would begin to reduce its nearly 9 trillion balance sheet which has more than doubled in size during the pandemic at a coming meeting that step will also have the effect of tightening credit for many consumers and businesses since its last meeting in january the challenges and uncertainties for the fed have escalated russia s invasion has magnified the cost of oil gas wheat and other commodities china has closed ports and factories again to contain a new outbreak of covid 19 which will worsen supply chain disruptions and likely further fuel price pressures in the meantime the sharp rise in average gas prices since the invasion up more than 60 cents to 4 31 a gallon nationally will send inflation higher while also probably slowing growth two conflicting trends that are notoriously difficult for the fed to manage
