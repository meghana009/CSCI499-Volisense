it is imperative that congress addressed the debt limit if not our current estimate is the treasury will likely exhaust its extraordinary measures by october 18 at that point we expect treasury would be left with very limited resources that would be depleted quickly a miracle would default for the first time in history the full faith and credit of the united states would be impaired and our country would likely face a financial crisis and economic recession as a result it s necessary to avert a catastrophic event for our economy senators the debt ceiling has been raised were suspended 78

yellen said this would happen at some point in october this so called x date should be viewed as a best guess by treasury not a set in stone deadline based on exact science in other words america

jamie dimon has warned a default would cause a cascading catastrophe of unbelievable proportions and damage america for 100 years it would be risky for congress to get too close to the x date let alone beyond it is there any leeway maybeof course treasury secretaries have a long history of giving themselves wiggle room when announcing an x date just in case congress blows through that date that s what happened in 2011 washington didn t default then but the delay did cost america its perfect credit rating from s p and rattle financial markets it s the same idea as telling someone who is chronically late that dinner is two hours earlier than scheduled just to make sure they re on time there is some debate over just how much wiggle room yellen is giving congress this time yellen was asked at a hearing on thursday what happens on oct 19 and her response indicates there could be a bit of leeway but not much we re simply in an impossible situation in which it will be impossible for treasury on that day or a few days thereafter we ll have very limited resources yellen said it will be run down quickly we won t be able to pay all of the government s bills however the nonpartisan congressional budget office issued a report tuesday that suggests there may be additional time beyond oct 18 for lawmakers to avoid a catastrophic default the cbo projects that if the debt limit remains unchanged treasury s ability to borrow using extraordinary measures will be exhausted and it will most likely run out of cash near the end of october or the beginning of november that s unchanged from cbo s prior estimate in july cbo warns that after that happens the federal government would be unable to pay its obligations fully and it would delay making payments for some activities default on its debt obligations or both zandi says the x date is around oct 20however others think there is much less time mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics told cnn on wednesday that yellen is likely being somewhat conservative but not overly so i wouldn t be surprised if it is a day or two later than the 18th zandi said i m estimating the 20th that implies a bit of wiggle room but not much certainly not as much as in 2011 zandi said thursday he s not changing his estimate despite the more optimistic take by the cbo very hard to predictthe problem is that nailing down a precise x date is unusually difficult today because there are even more moving pieces than during prior debt ceiling clashes beyond the usual outlays for items like social security medicare and defense contracts the treasury is making big payments for disaster relief and covid programs at the same time tax revenue has been more volatile due to the impact of the pandemic usually these things aren t very hard to predict but right now they are said thomas simons senior money market economist at jefferies the variant in daily cash flows is so high relative to historical precedent yellen noted the government s daily gross cash flow averaged nearly 50 billion per day over the past year and has even exceeded 300 billion scarily close to running out of cash like yellen some on wall street are moving up the timing of when the government could default as recently as sept 10 jefferies projected that treasury could avoid default until nov 10 15 based on projections for cash balances and updated data on extraordinary measures since then things have changed simons wrote in a note to clients on tuesday in particular simons noted that treasury s cash position has dwindled faster than we expected it would throughout september that s never a good sign heading into a debt ceiling impasse simons said treasury s cash balances are starting to get very low on oct 18 we are more or less in agreement with yellen simons wrote in a report titled yellen flags oct 18 and we think she means it this time asked on thursday about the cbo report simons conceded there is a great deal of uncertainty and said the cbo forecast gives him a bit more hope but not much i still think that during the middle of october treasury is going to get scarily close to running out of cash simons told

ridley scott s 1985 epic fantasy adventure returns to high definition in a boxed release packed with extras in legend limited edition arrow video not rated 2 39 1 aspect ratio 114 minutes 49 95 the esteemed director had quickly left his mark in sci fi cinema with alien and blade runner but his attempt to further capture an audience s imagination with a lavish adult fairytale did not fare quite as well panned by critics and twinned with an anemic box office the film starred a young tom cruise as jack a powerful protector of the forest tasked with saving his beloved princess lili a pre ferris bueller mia sara in her first film and stopping the lord of darkness tim curry and his goblins from killing unicorns and using their horns to unleash an eternal night upon the world jack teams up with a team of elves fairies pixies and sprites to infiltrate the bowels of the wicked great tree of life for a final confrontation with the devilish lord the lofty somewhat tolkien shakespeare and walt disneyesque influenced story plucks themes from the lord of the rings the once and future king peter pan and a midsummer night s dream as it weaves a plodding tale of magic and romance the movie certainly had the boyish mr cruise looking out of place especially when sparkling in glitter and dressed in some strange gold armor as he was practically swallowed up by the extravagant set design and overshadowed by the dark crystal looking evil minions however mr curry delivers a nearly career topping performance despite only minutes of actual acting while covered in prosthetics to resemble a terrifying red horned and hooved devil moments as pretty as a hildebrandt brothers painting include a pair of unicorns playing in a stream covered with multicolored flowers on either side lili running through the forest during a snowstorm and jack s swampy encounter with the monstrous hag meg mucklebones star trek s robert picardo viewers get two cuts of the film each on a separate blu ray disc first the theatrical version clocks in at only 89 minutes but arrives in a new 2k restoration from a 4k scan of the original camera negative the work pays off as the visual clarity and color depth pop from the screen it also offers a score by the 1980s pop synth band tangerine dream next the preferred director s cut offers a 114 minute version of the movie and was culled from the 2011 ultimate edition blu ray release that reconstructed the film from a less than perfect answer cut it still looks sharp and colorful but not as strong as the new theatrical scan but adds an orchestral score by jerry goldsmith ultimately some will find legend a guilty pleasure others a cult classic but no matter all will appreciate the outrageous production design the dreamy excalibur cinematography and creepy creature effects best extras the limited edition release completely pampers hardcore fans with an abundance of both digital and hard copy goodies first viewers can listen to not only the director deconstruct his film but listen to a new optional commentary track from the author of ridley scott the making of his movies paul m sammon obviously mr scott s takes precedence and his no nonsense optional track comes from the 2011 blu ray over the director s cut and offers a thorough and candid dive into the minutiae of creating legend mr sammon also does not disappoint appreciating a film that he believes mixes judeo christian mythology and darker european fairytales he talks near nonstop and delivers more of a critical tone of the creative decisions mixed with a guided behind the scenes tour of the film s production its versions and origins now strap in for some great featurettes start with a new 30 minute retrospective that takes viewers down memory lane with crew and cast including production supervisor hugh harlow camera grip david cadwalladr costume designer charles knode co star annabelle lanyon the fairy oona camera operator peter macdonald set decorator ann mollo and artist john ralph as they reflect on how much they enjoyed working with mr ridley and cover most aspects of the movie next and my favorite is a 26 minute two part look at the creature effects it starts with illustrator martin a cline discussing the key fantasy character origins shown through initial sketches and illustrations in a segment packed with artwork part two has the lead make up artist of legend nick dudman discussing the practical application of the rob bottin s creature designs realized by the facial and appendage prosthetics and costuming he focuses mainly on mr curry as the lord of darkness initially an eight hour process to apply the make up but also touches on the dancing statue the difficulty in putting horns on the horses and mr picardo s ordeal as mucklebones next film historian travis crawford offers a 20 minute visual essay finely focused on mr ridley s penchant for offering director s cuts of his movies and showcasing specific examples in legend s various incarnations also notable is a 28 minute exploration of the musical scores from experts jeff bond daniel schweiger and synth pop duo electric youth austin garrick and bronwyn griffin and a vintage almost hourlong 2003 documentary highlighting the director s life and career supplemented by clips of his classics and interviews with harrison ford brad pitt russell crowe and mr scott additionally viewers can watch a 51 minute fairly exhaustive archival retrospective about the film from 2002 that includes words from the director writer william hjortsberg editor terry rawlings cinematographer alex thomson mr curry miss sara but nothing from mr cruise the packaging arrives as a cardboard case with a wraparound cover featuring new artwork by neil davies the contents of the box offers a 60 page full color illustrated book with legend essays by nicholas clement kat ellinger and simon ward a vintage piece on the movie s story from the screenwriter william hjortsberg production notes and a 2002 interview with charles de lauzirika about the restoration of the director s cut the bounty concludes with a large 16 inch by 20 inch fold out double sided poster with artwork by mr davies and original theatrical artwork by john alvin 10 glossy stock 5 inch by 7 inch full color portraits of the cast in costumes photographed by annie leibovitz and six double sided postcard sized lobby card reproductions also the reversible sleeve for the clamshell case holding the pair of blu ray discs features the artwork by mr davies and mr alvin joseph szadkowski can be

this article is more than 2 years old corbis via getty images the 20th anniversary of the 9 11 terrorist attacks is an important reason to recall several major crisis management lessons from that day and the days and weeks that followed and what business leaders should keep in mind when responding to disasters or other emergencies at their companies echoes and impact the impact that day on the business community was immediate the new york stock exchange was closed for four trading days in new york city approximately 430 000 jobs were lost and there was 2 8 billion in lost wages over the three months following the attacks unlike most crisis situations the echoes and impact of 9 11 continue to this day it was not until last month that all u s troops were withdrawn from afghanistan the country that was thought to have harbored the terrorists who plotted the 9 11 attacks best practices there are several crisis management lessons from 9 11 and its aftermath tell people what you know shortly after learning that two commercial aircraft had hit the twin towers of the world trade center president george w bush who was visiting a school in florida at the time made this announcement today we have had a national tragedy two airplanes have crashed into the world trade center in an apparent terrorist attack on our country i have spoken to the vice president to the governor of new york and to the director of the fbi and i ve ordered the full resources of the federal government to help the victims and their families and to find those folks who committed this act manage the crisis from a safe place rather that immediately return to washington after the attacks and at the insistence of his advisers and military officials bush flew on air force one to offutt air force base near omaha nebraska the base is the headquarters of the strategic air command where he convened a meeting of the national security council via teleconference according to the washington post better safe than sorry out of an abundance of caution then faa administrator benedict l sliney ordered the estimated 4 200 aircraft then in the air over the u s to land effectively shutting down american airspace when i issued that order to land regardless of destination we were just trying to do something to try and resolve what was occurring and at least separate the good guys from the bad guys sliney said according to wikipedia many closings and cancellations followed the september 11 attacks including major landmarks buildings restrictions on access to lower manhattan as well as postponement or cancellation of major sporting and other events landmarks were closed primarily because of fears that they may be attacked at some places streets leading up to the institutions were also closed when they reopened there was heightened security many states declared a state of emergency don t blame the wrong people the washington post reported that a week after the terrorist attacks president bush briefly setting aside his war planning efforts visited the mosque at the islamic center of washington yesterday to admonish the nation not to avenge last week s terrorist attacks on innocent american arabs and muslims in a gesture that surprised and gratified islamic leaders bush stepped up an already intense effort by his administration to prevent hate crimes and discrimination against nearly 10 million american arabs and muslims in retaliation for the world trade center and pentagon attacks by middle eastern terrorists ensure the crisis is not repeated according to the u s department of homeland security eleven days after the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks pennsylvania governor tom ridge was appointed as the first director of the office of homeland security in the white house the office oversaw and coordinated a comprehensive national strategy to safeguard the country against terrorism and respond to any future attacks with the passage of the homeland security act by congress in november 2002 the department of homeland security formally came into being as a stand alone cabinet level department to further coordinate and unify national homeland security efforts opening its doors on march 1 2003 prepare and train the harvard gazette reported that the federal government began investing heavily in research and training around crisis planning and management in order to do a better job preparing for and responding to more routine emergencies like major snowstorms and novel crises like a terrorist attack in 2004 fema introduced the national incident management system a framework to assist governments nongovernmental organizations and the private sector to deal with emergencies never forget what caused the crisis in december 2002 congress created the annual 9 11 patriot day and in 2009 requested that the observance of september 11 be recognized as a national day of service and remembrance there are more than 700 memorials to the victims that have been created in communities across the country and of course there are the annual and emotional ceremonies and tributes to honor those who lost their lives every generation faces

asked at a hearing on thursday what happens on oct 19 and her response indicates there could be a bit of leeway but not much we re simply in an impossible situation in which it will be impossible for treasury on that day or a few days thereafter we ll have very limited resources yellen said it will be run down quickly we won t be able to pay all of the government s bills however the nonpartisan congressional budget office issued a report tuesday that suggests there may be additional time beyond oct 18 for lawmakers to avoid a catastrophic default the cbo projects that if the debt limit remains unchanged treasury s ability to borrow using extraordinary measures will be exhausted and it will most likely run out of cash near the end of october or the beginning of november that s unchanged from cbo s prior estimate in july cbo warns that after that happens the federal government would be unable to pay its obligations fully and it would delay making payments for some activities default on its debt obligations or both zandi says the x date is around oct 20however others think there is much less time mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics told cnn on wednesday that yellen is likely being somewhat conservative but not overly so i wouldn t be surprised if it is a day or two later than the 18th zandi said i m estimating the 20th that implies a bit of wiggle room but not much certainly not as much as in 2011 zandi said thursday he s not changing his estimate despite the more optimistic take by the cbo very hard to predictthe problem is that nailing down a precise x date is unusually difficult today because there are even more moving pieces than during prior debt ceiling clashes beyond the usual outlays for items like social security medicare and defense contracts the treasury is making big payments for disaster relief and covid programs at the same time tax revenue has been more volatile due to the impact of the pandemic usually these things aren t very hard to predict but right now they are said thomas simons senior money market economist at jefferies the variant in daily cash flows is so high relative to historical precedent yellen noted the government s daily gross cash flow averaged nearly 50 billion per day over the past year and has even exceeded 300 billion scarily close to running out of cash like yellen some on wall street are moving up the timing of when the government could default as recently as sept 10 jefferies projected that treasury could avoid default until nov 10 15 based on projections for cash balances and updated data on extraordinary measures since then things have changed simons wrote in a note to clients on tuesday in particular simons noted that treasury s cash position has dwindled faster than we expected it would throughout september that s never a good sign heading into a debt ceiling impasse simons said treasury s cash balances are starting to get very low on oct 18 we are more or less in agreement with yellen simons wrote in a report titled yellen flags oct 18 and we think she means it this time asked on thursday about the cbo report simons conceded there is a great deal of uncertainty and said the cbo forecast gives him a bit more hope but not much i still think that during the middle of october treasury is going to get scarily close to running out of cash simons told cnn i am still extremely concerned about what is going to happen in the middle of next month
the queen of england deals extensively in 17 trillion depleted uranium trade nation of change feb 28 2014 many people are wondering what really caused fukushima while we can look into the geologic studies that were taken prior to the daiichi event outlining the active 200 meter fault line that honshu island rests right on top off we are obliged as citizens to look even deeper more so with the admission of an anonymous u s government nuclear official that radiation leaking from the plant just 100 meters away is astronomical uranium can be mined for some medical purposes and to make electricity but its main purpose was and is to fuel nuclear warfare against the world just six mines provide 85 percent of the world s uranium and guess who owns the mineral rights to that land it may be surprising to realize it is none other than the queen of england read morethe queen of england deals extensively in 17 trillion depleted uranium trade
according to research an average american makes around 35 000 decisions each day these decisions range from the mundane what color shirt to wear to the important whether or not to be vaccinated america is called the republic of choice said shilpa madan assistant professor of marketing in the pamplin college of business just go into the supermarket there are a mind boggling variety of just cookies in the last three decades the number of products in the average supermarket increased from an average of nearly 9 000 to almost 47 000 according to the food marketing institute a trade group while having a variety of choices is widely seen as a positive consequence of economic development what impact does this explosion of choice have on the psyche of the individual and further society as a whole in her recently published research in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences the salience of choice fuels independence implications for self perception cognition and behavior madan illustrates how this salience of choice alone can have a range of powerful psychological effects including empowerment of the individual just thinking about making choices makes people more independent and more concerned about their self interests she explained it makes people more individualistic madan notes that these choices don t need to be life altering decisions to have an impact the actual choices could be trivial maybe you woke up this morning and chose to eat cereal for breakfast instead of egg she said you chose to like a few posts on instagram but ignore several others this mere sense of choice that you are in the driver s seat makes people feel that they are independent and important it is said that we make choices that shape our environment but most of us don t realize how our choices shape us madan said she continued this focus on the self isn t necessarily bad in fact it can have a range of positive consequences for the individual when people think of themselves as independent they are less likely to tolerate harassment or discrimination more willing to raise their voice and more willing to negotiate better conditions for themselves however the increase in individualism can potentially have negative consequences for the collective well being choice is good for the individual but could be bad for society madan explained as people become more independent and more individualistic more self interested it becomes more difficult to take collective action as madan explained we are potentially seeing those negative consequences now during the covid 19 pandemic as people are increasingly choosing to assert their independence and act in their own best interests for example by not wearing masks or not getting vaccinated the challenges the world is facing right now the covid 19 pandemic climate change discrimination bias and inequity need collective action need people to work together for the greater good while the united states of america was founded on the ideals of individualism what about more collectivist societies does the salience of choice have the same impact on people in nations where individualism is not as prolific according to her research the impact is the same no matter the culture it replicates across cultures madan said from america which is already very individualistic to singapore and india which are both collectivistic countries one look down a supermarket aisle or at a netflix home screen shows that our choices are only growing so what can be done to ensure that our focus on individualism does not come at the cost of the greater good according to madan this requires further research as research scientists we are trying to find interventions for specific contexts where we can attenuate this negative effect of choice on collective well being she said what are the kind of interventions we can create to make people wear a mask or get vaccinated or make them care for the environment in the interim madan reiterated that choices are meant to be made deliberately and consciously she referenced the virginia tech motto to ensure we are making the right decisions both for ourselves and for our community virginia tech s motto ut prosim that i may serve speaks to this make choices that are not just self serving but good for those around you

it is imperative that congress addressed the debt limit if not our current estimate is the treasury will likely exhaust its extraordinary measures by october 18 at that point we expect treasury would be left with very limited resources that would be depleted quickly a miracle would default for the first time in history the full faith and credit of the united states would be impaired and our country would likely face a financial crisis and economic recession as a result it s necessary to avert a catastrophic event for our economy senators the debt ceiling has been raised were suspended 78 times since 1960 almost always on a bipartisan basis my hope is that we can work together to do so again and to build a stronger american economy for future generations advertisement why oct 19 could be a catastrophic day for the us economy share copy link copy the united states could be just weeks away from defaulting on its debt for the first time ever the 28 4 trillion debt limit was reinstated aug 1 since then treasury secretary janet yellen has been keeping the nation s finances afloat by using emergency accounting maneuvers known as extraordinary measures these steps allow the government to borrow additional funds without breaching the debt ceiling video above us debt measures likely exhausted oct 18 secretary yellen saysbut yellen warned lawmakers this week that if congress fails to raise or suspend the debt ceiling the federal government will exhaust those extraordinary measures by oct 18 at that point we expect treasury would be left with very limited resources that would be depleted quickly yellen wrote in a letter to congress it is uncertain whether we would continue to meet all the nation s commitments after that date that s an accelerated timing from previously when yellen said this would happen at some point in october this so called x date should be viewed as a best guess by treasury not a set in stone deadline based on exact science in other words america could hit the debt ceiling days before or days after oct 18 there are many many moving pieces here yellen herself warned the x date can unpredictably shift forward or backward and given the stakes jamie dimon has warned a default would cause a cascading catastrophe of unbelievable proportions and damage america for 100 years it would be risky for congress to get too close to the x date let alone beyond it is there any leeway maybeof course treasury secretaries have a long history of giving themselves wiggle room when announcing an x date just in case congress blows through that date

today more than 1 100 charter schools are run by for profit corporations whether those corporations are large national chains or small local companies running one or two schools they invest in slick marketing campaigns to get children and tax dollars through the door the public is often shocked to find out that for profit run charters use federal dollars to skim funds at taxpayers expense according to the most stringent interpretation of federal law for profit charters cannot be federally subsidized title 20 of the elementary and secondary education act requires k 12 schools to be nonprofit organizations to receive federal funding however clever for profit operators create workarounds using nonprofit facades to evade the law last year the network for public education dug deep into the for profit operations of charter schools the schemes we discovered ranged from elaborate to unsophisticated depending on the operator s creativity worst of all we saw how for profits shortchange kids to line their pockets we uncovered scandalous examples of self dealing like reginald barr who with his wife and daughter own the management personnel and real estate companies contracting with their arizona based amerischools they also sit on the nonprofit board that governs the charters ensuring that whatever rent or fees they want are approved and passed right into their accounts in north carolina donnie mcqueen is the executive manager of the for profit that runs torchlight academy where he s the executive director and his wife is principal he s also president of the real estate company that owns the building leased to the school nearly every penny that comes in is turned over by the nonprofit to the for profit he owns marcus may s for profit newpoint education partners managed 15 charter schools may persuaded parents and community members who were mostly naive to school governance to create charter schools dependent on newpoint his vendor businesses overcharged the schools for furniture computers and other items he took kickbacks and broker fees for leases and inflated enrollment figures for more revenue may is now an inmate in florida appealing his 20 year sentence for racketeering and organized fraud these grifters often use sweeps contracts to extract every penny from their taxpayer funded charter schools examples of sweeps include the contracts between the ohio distance electronic learning academy and accel online ohio llc northeast raleigh charter academy and torchlight academy schools and ohio virtual academy and k12 virtual schools sweep contracts are used by one of the largest for profit chains national heritage academies nha which uses its control to make money through real estate either as a broker or landlord for example nha leased a building from the diocese of new york for 264 000 and then sublet it to its brooklyn dreams charter school for 2 76 million nha s owner j c huizenga is selling off 69 charter buildings to a new nonprofit run by his personal attorney the deal is financed by nearly 1 billion in municipal bonds even after he cashes in on the school sale his for profit will control them sweeping in profits from day to day operations and the maintenance of the buildings of greatest concern however are the cost cutting service diminishing strategies used by for profits to maximize their bottom line such as circumventing state rules for qualified educators by designating their uncertified and inexperienced teachers as permanent substitutes limiting the number of special needs students permitted to attend violating laws about open enrollment overcrowding classroom settings especially online one online charter operator had a student teacher ratio of 275 to 1 11 instituting policies and practices intended to discriminate against or exclude students who are expensive to teach of course charter schools should be free to use for profit companies to provide books transportation and the like but when for profits are managing the school inside deals secrecy and real estate empires quickly take precedence over the well being of children fortunately congress is on the verge of closing a major loophole exploited by these for profit charter operators it is hoped the senate will pass section 314 of the 2022 house labor hhs education appropriations bill and help ensure our tax dollars stay in the classroom with students where they belong clearly some parents are happy with the services that these schools provide i am not arguing that they should be shut down but if our federal dollars are being used to support them then the spirit of the law not just the letter should be followed it is time that congress close the loophole and put kids before profits once and for all

situation as it exists today dr paul craig roberts is one of those individuals dr roberts served under president reagan as the assistant secretary of treasury for economic policy as the associate editor of the wall street journal a columnist for businessweek and scripps howard news service and holds many university appointments dave gahary had a chance to sit down with dr roberts to discuss his accomplishments in the reagan administration the purposeful destruction of the united states economy the evisceration of the u s constiution and the coming collapse in this important interview 28 02 how america was lost from 9 11 to the police warfare state the neoconservative threat to world order washington s perilous war for hegemony the failure of laissez faire capitalism world never in more danger from nuclear armageddon former top treasury official paul craig roberts speaks candidly to afp by dave gahary there aren t too many scholars who have been on the inside of the highest halls of power and have the keen intellect to be able to dissect and explain the political and economic situation as it exists today dr paul craig roberts is one of those individuals dr roberts served under president reagan as the assistant secretary of treasury for economic policy as the associate editor of the wall street journal a columnist for businessweek and scripps howard news service and holds many university appointments american free press had a chance to sit down with dr roberts on february 2 for a 45 minute interview afp asked what his duties were under president reagan i was the front man in the president s government to get his economic plan out of the treasury out of council of economic advisors and out of the office of management and budget and also out of the chief of staff of the white house so that the congress could vote on it he explained it cannot be stressed enough the significant impact dr roberts had and continues to have on economic policy in the united states and the world he had to play politics and go up against those not willing to support reagan s economic plan like james a baker iii white house chief of staff david stockman director of omb paul volcker s federal reserve wall street as well as the central intelligence agency cia i succeeded and got to the program out of the administration and into the congress where it passed he said this was how as dr roberts explained supply side economics became the policy instead of the post world war ii keynesian demand management supply side economic theory argues that economic growth can be most effectively created by investing in capital and by lowering barriers on the production of goods and services keynesian economic theory argues that economic output is strongly influenced by the total spending in the economy wall street believed the plan would unleash inflation and destroy their stock and bond portfolios explained dr roberts the cia and the military security complex didn t want to end the cold war it was a profitable business he said in fact explained dr roberts the cia told reagan that if he started an arms race the soviets would win president reagan however didn t believe what the spy agency was telling him he formed a secret committee to which he appointed me to investigate the basis for the cia s claim he said the committee had subpoena power over the cia s relevant documents which made their decision easy the committee concluded that it was basically the cia protecting its turf dr roberts explained the committee s findings are what precipitated reagan s historic meeting with mikhail gorbachev and brought this cold war with its threat of nuclear armageddon to an end dr roberts explained reagan s accomplishments set the stage for bill clinton s success dr roberts said emigrate while you still can learn more dr roberts continued until clinton came along we had very good relations with the russians it was clinton who started breaking all the agreements the russians had been promised that nato would not move one inch to the east he explained now it s on their borders clinton wasn t the only president to unravel what the gipper assembled almost 30 years ago george w bush pulled out of the abm treaty his administration rewrote our nuclear doctrine and took nuclear weapons from a retaliatory role to a preemptive first strike dr roberts explained although he helped craft a new economic paradigm for this nation he admits that model cannot help us now and also explained how we got to where we are today as he does in his classic book the failure of laissez faire capitalism and economic dilution of the west our economic problems today are fundamentally different he began supply side economics hasn t a solution to american problems today our problems today are twofold he said one is we have offshored millions of middle class jobs this began with the manufacturing and of course it destroyed the unions but it also destroyed consumer purchasing power the kind of high productivity high value added jobs in manufacturing that created a middle class for people without a college education and which led to rising consumer incomes and rising living standards he explained has been given away to china and it s hurt the tax base of cities and states he continued and then the corporations found out they could also offshore professional skill jobs that the university educated kids would move into like software engineering information technology research design any kind of engineering that you don t have to be actually on the job present this sort of got rid of the backbone of the american consumer economy and the income that drove the consumer economy just ceased to be there alan greenspan and the federal reserve filled in for the missing growth and real income by expanding credit and got everybody indebted up to their eyeballs and that s how they kept the economy going in the early part of this century dr roberts explained the other reason why the u s economy is in tatters the other problem is that the economy has been financialized with these huge financial institutions focused on essentially extracting the entire economic surplus into interest payments to themselves he explained they don t really finance productive activities like factories and new businesses he explained they re basically extracting everything they can into interest payments to serve debt that they issue and they re so powerful now and they re too big to fail and also they re too big to jail afp asked what can be done to reverse these disasters probably we can t do much of anything and it s gonna lead to a collapse he said dr roberts then touched on the assault on our god given rights what s happened to us with the constitution is extremely serious he explained because the united states is the constitution that s what we are without the constitution we are not the united states we re some other country and yet the constitution has been decimated all of the protections in the bill of rights have been set aside he lamented we now have indefinite detention without presenting any evidence or going before a court this is what medieval robber barons did is pick people up and threw them in the dungeon we have the president also claiming the power to assassinate american citizens without due process of law that is they murder on the basis of presumption or assumption no evidence the executive branch has violated all of the u s statutory laws and international laws against torture and no one has been held accountable they have also violated all the laws against spying without warrants and no one s been held accountable what this means is that there s no rule of law the whole purpose of the rule of law is that it makes law a shield that protects the people from arbitrary government action if you don t have rule of law then you have law not as a shield for the people but law as a weapon in the hands of the state now people will say he explained well they don t bother me but the point is if they want to they can previously they couldn t no matter how bad they wanted to but now if they want to they can and when will they want to as things get more and more difficult for them more and more people will fall under these kinds of punishments this is what my book how america was lost from 9 11 to the police warfare state is about he said it s showing the progression from a free nation into a tyranny dr roberts explained the premise of his other book the neoconservative threat to world order washington s perilous war for hegemony this threat is a threat of nuclear war he said when the soviet union collapsed the neoconservatives said hey look history has chosen america they didn t choose the proletariat they chose what they called democratic capitalism it s neither democratic or capitalist but that s what they call it and it s chosen us to rule the world and to impose our system on everybody else and this puts us above all law law is what we say it also puts us above the sovereignty of other countries and this is where the imperial american of the 21st century came from this is the justification for invading countries on false pretenses slaughtering huge numbers of people producing huge numbers of refugees and displaced people we ve done this now to at least seven countries it is this notion that we cannot accept any constraint on our will which has thrown us into conflict with china and russia china and russia are not iraq and libya he said these are powerful countries they have powerful militaries powerful nuclear forces trying to force your hegemony by destabilizing these kinds of countries this is so reckless as to be unbelievable but that is the foreign policy of the united states it leads directly to nuclear confrontation and of course nobody wins dr roberts addressed the recent news that trillions of dollars in new nuclear weapons will be purchased by u s taxpayers we don t have any money to pay medicare or social security and they ve got this arms race going again it s the most serious situation in my lifetime he said the cold war was never as dangerous as what has been created now dave gahary a former submariner in the u s navy is the host of afp s underground interview series be sure to check out all of afp s free audio

if there s anything the globalist free traders loved more than importing cheap foreign labor to undercut american workers wages it was offshoring those jobs entirely by relocating american manufacturing to communist china according to the gfts there was absolutely no downside to this true american manufacturing workers would lose their livelihoods by the millions but all the cheap chinese made crap they could buy at walmart once they learned to code and got new high tech jobs unless east indian coders imported by the millions on h visas undercut those jobs too would raise their overall consumer satisfaction also the gfts told us try not to laugh increasing trade with the chinese would make them more liberal and democratic the former thing is working out about as well as the latter thing which is why you may have noticed a lot of empty shelves or more likely item out of stock labels on amazon this is reported at multiple sources but we ll use the daily mail dozens of cargo ships anchored off the coasts of los angeles and new york face shocking wait times of up to four weeks and railyards and trucking routes are hopelessly clogged due to the lack of manpower to unload goods with an expert warning that the government needs to intervene or face spiraling inflation and unemployment the backlog of billions of dollars of toys clothing electronics vehicles and furniture comes as the demand for consumer goods hit its highest point in history as consumers stay home instead of spending money on travel and entertainment supply chains have lagged far behind consumer demand due to a lack of manpower at american ports and the restrictions that came with the covid 19 outbreak early last year these constraints which include social distancing and mandatory quarantines have severely limited the number and ability of port workers to do their jobs i can t help thinking a lot of this could have been avoided if you know we still manufactured stuff in america also if we hadn t treated an upper respiratory infection with a 99 8 survival rate like it was the second coming of the black plague i vaguely remember a guy who warned us that depending on communist china for our manufacturing was a bad idea i think he got impeached or something published in

tommy williams those of you who read the newspaper with frequency may note in the last month i have reflected upon unusual experiences that happened over my long career in the meantime the world turns and a blend of blessings and insanity continues i thought i might drop back and check in with some experts and get their take on the state of economy and its potential impact on your pocketbook the last few weeks have seen a handful of bumps in the road but none of the traditional 10 correction type that tends to rattle many to action it s been more like a smattering of sales placed on america s great companies so those who are paying attention can put idle cash to work though there is no shortage of bad news to keep the news cycle alive and well the market continues to hold on to a perch near all time highs on the surface that seems counterintuitive what with the debt ceiling debate the administration s difficulty getting their huge agenda trillions of dollars passed despite their majority position in the government the afghanistan debacle the problems on the southern border hurricanes fires homicides and oh the pandemic we are now approaching 700 000 deaths in the u s i think i ve bored you with just a sampling of what would seem to be obstacles to a sound investment environment lest i let my oil and gas friends down please be reminded that oil has topped 75 barrel and natural gas has reached a point above 5 million cubic feet that s a positive break for the producers of those products and the industry that provides services to them so what are the experts saying that attempts to explain this apparent defiance of economic gravity i touched base with saira malik the chief investment officer of nuveen equities she points out a handful of things that really matter 1 there is considerable concern about the federal reserve suggesting multiple interest rate hikes by the end of 2023 that would be a negative for market growth however there are expectations that moderating economic growth in that time frame will slow down the pace of rate increases of course the fed s purpose in raising rates is to slow down an overheating economy and if it is slowing in a couple of years that might not be necessary 2 near term risks in washington remain as politicians grandstand and play to their constituents however no one wants to have a default of our pristine u s treasury debt on their watch so as they ve done 78 times since 1960 they ll resolve the debt ceiling concern probably in the waning seconds there is more concern about higher taxes to pay for larger government than a u s credit down grade 3 as the delta variant subsides nuveen expects a near term resurgence in economic growth stephen auth executive vice president and chief investment officer at federated hermes see things somewhat similarly he suggests that the odds of a market correction over the near term look strong however in the same breath he adds that the long term outlook is positive here are a few reasons he is sticking to his optimistic year end and 2022 market forecast 1 the economic reacceleration we ve been expecting though delayed by the delta variant is coming soon it s not a matter of if it is a matter of when the fundamentals of the economy are strong and the prospects of a recession seem distant this is partially because there is much to be gained in a group of so called reopening stocks that have yet to see their day in the sun but it is coming 2 corporate earnings remain healthy and growing even with the proposed biden tax hikes standard and poor earnings next year and into 2023 are likely to reflect a solid 8 10 growth above 2021 s already improved outcome there are countless other sources i could recite to explain why a seemingly crazy world has yet

race tracks of the west side by angus macfarlane in the lake merced parking lot at the south end of sunset boulevard is a statue of a man on a horse the man represents juan bautista de anza the spaniard who founded san francisco in 1776 the horse is just a horse of course but the location of the horse s statue is historically significant for two reasons on november 2 1769 five years before anza s colonists arrived in san francisco a small scouting party led by sergeant jose ortega left the portola expedition and traveled on the hard wet sands of ocean beach crossing into what would become san francisco this marked the arrival of the horse in san francisco one hundred years later less than a furlong from today s statue of a horse and rider the first of the west side s horse racing venues opened for business this is the history of those race tracks previous the ocean course track golden gate driving park 1868 1885 the next west side race track was a half mile oval adjacent to the point lobos toll road today s geary boulevard from the toll gate at cemetery presidio avenue to the cliff house four miles away point lobos road penetrated a virtually unpopulated landscape when it was widened from 20 to 40 feet and regraded to make it level most of the distance it was an open invitation to race in response to this need for speed an unnamed and long forgotten visionary scraped out a primitive track on the north side of the road near today s 25th avenue where informal and impromptu races between owners of teams could be held in march 1868 james eoff leased the land where the primitive track had been and laid out a half mile track along with substantial buildings fences and horse sheds this track was located roughly between clement and california streets and 26th and 22nd avenues the purpose of what was at first called the golden gate driving park was to provide a type of racing that the other tracks didn t or couldn t offer private racing where gentleman could challenge each other to settle whose team was the better set of horseflesh rather than endangering the welfare of their horses and risking property damage from racing along the point lobos road public thoroughfare proud competitive gentlemen desiring to do their own racing were invited to eoff s facility the track formally opened on october 10 1868 the highlight of the day was the introduction of norfolk the star attraction and victor of the opening of the ocean course four years earlier eoff s golden gate driving park prospered because he knew what his patrons wanted and he obliged by providing excitement and variety in his racing programs eoff kept a steady stream of competitors and spectators coming to his track week after week month after month james eoff s facility was in operation while week after week and month after month the ocean view and bay view course another racing course located in the bayview district stood idle and silent in april 1870 the bay district agricultural association was formed and it leased the golden gate driving park for three years a series of improvements were initiated the track which remained a half mile oval was leveled and widened ten feet the turns were banked and the track was entirely enclosed with a fence a roadway was built to the track s infield allowing those who desired to sit in their carriages during to races to do so out buildings including stables were constructed and existing structures were vastly improved including enlarging the grandstand for ladies it was proclaimed the best half mile track in the world agricultural park was inaugurated on july 23 1870 with an exhibition of stock and five trotting races three thousand people attended this event the most notable difference between the golden gate driving park and agricultural park was the size of the purses which naturally attracted higher quality racers which in turn attracted a higher quality clientele particularly ladies over the next three years everything seemed to fall into place for the little track by the side of the road and its owner james eoff however when the three year lease expired in april 1873 the directors of the bay district association declined to renew it at the same time there were rumors of a new mile race track to be built by the association a short distance from eoff s facility by august 1873 the rumors were confirmed in response to this setback eoff announced on august 2 1873 that he intended to enlarge his half mile track to a mile he had purchased enough land at either end of his facility to extend the straight aways while keeping the turns the same distance he expected that work on the track would commence immediately but his plans for a mile track never came to fruition and by august 8 1873 the track was once again the golden gate driving park the halcyon days of the little half mile track were clearly over not only could it not compete with the well capitalized and opulent bay district track two miles closer to the city but traffic on the point lobos toll road was slashed when a toll free road to the ocean and cliff house opened in golden gate park in july 1874 the final race announcement at the half mile track was on sunday march 29 1885 after almost two decades of service the venerable old track just ceased to be there were no news announcements no grand finale no subdivision notices it just simply ceased to be mentioned in any context the city directory continued to list the track as agricultural park located on the north side of point lobos avenue between 23rd and 27th avenues through the 1891 edition next bay district race track contribute your own stories about western neighborhoods places

high impact degrees and credentials no matter who they are or where they live northam convened the fafsa work group in march when he set a long term goal of every eligible student in virginia completing a fafsa application each year virginia is currently ranked 26th nationally for fafsa completion with a 52 7 percent completion rate according to a 2018 study approximately 15 000 virginia high school seniors that would have been eligible for pell grants did not complete the fafsa amounting to more than 58 million in federal aid that students left on the table this aid could have made the difference in thousands of students continuing their education filling high impact jobs and collecting greater earnings over their lifetime research indicates that those with a college degree have greater lifetime earnings are healthier enjoy greater job security and are more engaged in their communities said secretary of education atif qarni higher education cultivates talent to support our

defender make land rover segment suv inspired by the military jeep the first land rover was born in 1947 as an agricultural vehicle it soon moved beyond use by farmers and the series and defender models became the ultimate utility vehicle while the jeep became a lifestyle and recreation vehicle the land rover started going global as the go to vehicle for explorers and the uk s military its applications grew and have been used in just about every area a robust off road vehicle can be including aid work firefighting mountain rescue medical response and just for good old fun as a recreational vehicle while land rover went upmarket it never lost its off roading and practical edge and the discovery freelander and range rover models have been used in almost as many applications as the original line of utilitarian vehicles along the way there have been some amazing land rovers created these are just some of them close 1 camel trophy 110 defender the camel trophy event spanned twenty years between 1980 and 2000 and was known affectionately as the olympics of off roading the arduous annual competitive events took place in different places including mongolia madagascar siberia borneo and zaire originally using three license built jeep cj5s exploring the trans amazonian highway but between 1981 and 2000 every model was a land rover that got a heavily upgraded camel trophy version in sandglow yellow and land rover supplied the support vehicles the harshest and most legendary event was the 876 mile amazonian trek in 1989 won by british explorers joe and bob ives in a land rover 110 the pair negotiated the route from alta floresta to manaus in the rainy season where the previously dusty roads turn to soft clay there were stretches where we put two anchored cars pulling another one and nothing happened we had to dig for half an hour to try to get the car out of that hole and thirty meters later fall into another one explained team member ricardo simonsen close 2 110 svx spectre defender land rovers have long been a component of the james bond universe but the most spectacular so far are the ten built by bowler in the uk for the 2015 movie spectre it s thought that seven survived making the movie including one that s road legal as it was only used for drive by scenes they re crew cab defender 110s modified with massive 37 inch tires heavy duty roll cages toughened suspensions bilstein rally dampers a hydraulic handbrake and recaro seats some including the one below were built specifically for the snow chase scene in the movie and one was tuned for a high speed road chase close 3 land rover series iia pink panther the british sas special air service has a fine reputation as an elite force and one piece of sas history produced a legendary version of the land rover series ii the pink panther from 1971 to 1976 the sas fought in a guerrilla war in south oman and the perfect color for camouflage in the middle east was gauged to be pink particularly at dusk and dawn these were kitted out by marshalls of cambridge with four fuel tanks a heavy duty chassis heavy duty suspension front and rear differential plates sand tires and a front mounted spare tire the roof doors and windscreen were removed and spotlights were added to survive in a warzone the land rovers were also fitted with grenade holders and carried rifles smoke canisters a general purpose machine gun and an anti tank weapon the small sas group defeated the communist rebels in oman but only twenty of the 72 pinkies survived the action they re now the most sought after land rovers in the world close 4 bowler bulldog land rover went to bowler for the camel trophy vehicles but expedition vehicles aren t the british company s specialty the bowler bulldog is the third in a line of land rover based rally raid vehicles built on a custom chassis and using modified range rover sport subframes and specially made bilstein shocks each bowler bulldog is handbuilt ready for competition complete with an integrated fia approved roll cage but is also road legal it s wider than a stock defender has more suspension travel and comes with a tuned version of either the petrol or diesel v6 engine from the range rover sport these may look old but they re the best competition lr off roaders out there close 5 cuthbertson tracked land rover if you need a vehicle to go absolutely anywhere it needs tracks this one was built in 1958 by conversion specialist james a cuthbertson ltd which built conversions specifically for farmers forced to work in an uneven hostile landscape however the british army bought some for land mine clearing as they re lighter than tanks the army didn t buy many though and it s believed that cuthbertson built less than 20 in total it has a top speed of 20 mph a custom power steering unit and is designed to be converted quickly back into a wheeled vehicle close 6 flying huntsman 6x6 pickup the flying huntsman 6x6 pickup was designed by afzal kahn and his design and engineering team for his chelsea truck company the british firm specializes in bespoke takes on land rovers jeep wranglers mercedes g wagens and mercedes x class models but the flying huntsman 6x6 pickup is a standout model the bodywork is hand formed with aluminum and the donor land rover defender 110 is extended by a further 34 6 inches for the extra axle a rear roll bar is added and it also gets a bespoke interior completing the transformation is a 6 2 liter gm supplied ls3 v8 engine making around 430 horsepower close 7 land rover hot rod this one is downright hated by the purists even though it s not actually a hacked up 1948 series i land rover it was originally built by a brit called steve dyer who had a bunch of land rovers but wanted to build a hot rod american cars in the uk are expensive so he did the logical thing and took a 1948 lr and started building however the chassis isn t from a land rover but rather from a 1980 rover p4 series car as are the disc brakes under the hood is a 3 9 liter rover v8 and in front is a grille from a 1948 series i land rover as is the rear tub the rest of the bodywork is a mix of land rover parts it sits on 15 inch steel wheels and has been lowered by a few inches it s been sold on a few times but once in a while it gets spotted and photographed on british roads so we know it s still out there making people smile wince close 8 trans americas expedition range rovers in the early 1970s suvs were not yet a huge market however more and more americans were being drawn to rugged off roaders like chevy blazers and the ford bronco for recreational use knowing america is a vast market british leyland poked land rover s pr team into doing something spectacular the result was two 1971 range rovers upgraded to traverse the 18 000 grueling miles of pan american highway and taking the british trans americas expedition from alaska s frozen frontier to the sub tropical tip of argentina the trek was punishing enough but the two range rovers needed to cross the darién gap as part of the journey the rivers swamps mountains and jungles of the gap are graveyards of travelers and equipment that have tried to pass the pan american highway s missing link land rover only added a few upgrades that couldn t be optioned from the factory and the 250 mile stretch was completed in three months half the allotted time with help from 64 british army personnel drawn from the royal engineers and expeditionary officers

in january workers will face a new payroll tax to fund the state s new program called the wa cares fund workers will pay a premium of 0 58 of their wages 58 cents per 100 a worker earning 50 000 a year would pay 290 in annual payroll deductions those who are self employed can opt in to the program starting in 2025 eligible workers will be able access program funds to pay for long term care services such as in home care nursing home stays equipment home modifications rides to the doctor and to pay family caregivers the maximum benefit a person can access over their lifetime is 36 500 when the legislature established the program in 2019 the state was the first in the nation to create a public long term care insurance program seven in 10 people will need long term care as they age and most can t afford private long term care insurance according to a fact sheet from the state department of social health services the department notes that the program will help reduce the state s medicaid spending the program includes an option for people to opt out of paying the payroll tax if they purchase a qualifying long term care insurance plan on the private market those who choose to opt out will be permanently ineligible for state benefits the deadline to purchase a private plan is nov 1 on friday the state opened the application period for people to apply for an exemption and will accept applications through dec 31 2022 the website to apply for an exemption crashed on friday but was working again on saturday some have raised concerns that the state s deadline does not give people enough time to secure a private plan and that plans are no longer available because of an increase in demand there are also questions about who is eligible to receive benefits one issue is that workers who pay the payroll premium will lose access to benefits if they move to or retire in another state with the new payroll tax looming and many questions remaining about the program a group of 23 state senators 20 republicans and three democrats asked gov jay inslee last week to pause implementation of the program your intervention to suspend the tax and insurance purchase deadline would provide temporary relief to employees who face a major new tax and give time for the legislature to work on a solution the senators sept 22 letter states state sen keith wagoner r sedro woolley who signed the letter said he has heard from many constituents about the program he said many have been unable to find a private plan that meets the state s guidelines in time for the nov 1 deadline when the bill went into effect i don t think very many people knew about it he said it started getting attention and we got lots of feedback i don t know how many hundreds of emails have come in on long term care in a sept 9 letter to inslee the association of washington business awb raised similar concerns arguing that the state s private plan purchase deadline resulted in a collapse in the private insurance market and resulted in companies no longer selling coverage dozens of businesses chambers of commerce and labor unions signed onto the awb letter the letter also brings up eligibility issues such as if near term retirees or those who work in washington but live in border states are eligible for benefits wagoner who did not support the 2019 legislation said he believes the private insurance market is better suited to meet residents long term care needs his concern now is that people will pay into the state s system without ever seeing a benefit he said inslee should use his emergency powers to suspend the program to allow more time to address these concerns it s nothing more than a pause to give people relief during the pandemic and find more ways to opt out of this he said there are so many details that we haven t figured out democrats agree that policy tweaks are needed but have no interest in pausing the program state rep alex ramel d bellingham said the state s program is needed to provide long term care insurance as the population ages he said without the program people would have to spend everything they have in order to qualify for medicaid and that the private long term care market is insufficient ramel said pausing the program would not only delay the collection of payroll premiums but delay when residents can access benefits ramel who was not a state representative when the legislation passed in 2019 said he understands the concerns about paying into the system and not receiving any benefits when the system first starts up it needs to collect revenue for a couple of years before they are able to provide benefits to people he said that s unfortunately just how finances work to make the system financially solvent ramel said he would like to see a national system of long term care insurance so those who work here and move away wouldn t lose benefits the state s long term services and supports trust commission is working on ways to improve the new program state sen karen keiser d des moines a commission member said the group plans to make proposals to the legislature during the session that begins in january the goals are to address issues such as allowing workers who live in border states but work in washington and those who work in washington and move away to access benefits we are working on solutions to those oversights keiser said they are really technical fixes some have raised the question of whether the 36 500 maximum benefit is enough to cover a person s long term care needs keiser said the benefit is designed to cover at home care aging in place rather than to pay for more costly nursing home care she called private long term insurance a failed market that has had large rate increases in recent years rate increases have been known to fluctuate between 20 to 79 in a year according to the state office of the insurance commissioner there are other differences between the state s program and what you can get on the private market keiser said an advantage of the state s program is that you can use benefits to pay a family caregiver in addition those with private plans have to continue paying premiums in order to receive care under the state s program those who retire and no longer contribute to the wa cares fund can access benefits anytime as long as they meet eligibility requirements to qualify workers must work and contribute to the fund for at least 10 years with a break of no more than five years in that time period or have worked at least 500 hours a year during three of the past six years at the time they apply for the benefit as for concerns about the opt out process keiser said when the 2019 legislation passed the idea was to allow those who already had private insurance to opt out so they wouldn t be double billed during the 2021 legislative session a republican sponsored amendment passed to extend the deadline to purchase a private plan from the bill s effective date to nov 1 the opt in opt out amendment created this incredible feeding frenzy and real concerted effort by the insurance industry to sell plans keiser said state sen curtis king r yakima also a member of the long term care commission said he proposed further extending the deadline to buy a private insurance plan he agreed with other republicans that the program should be paused so legislators can make adjustments without a pause workers will pay the payroll tax starting in january even if changes are implemented later right now they would not get that money returned to them and i don t think that s right king said mike faulk spokesperson for inslee s office said the governor supported and signed the legislation in 2019 he said the governor s office is aware of concerns about the program and monitoring the progress of the long term care trust group the governor has said he does not intend to delay the implementation date as set out by the legislature and we don t believe he has that authority faulk said there may be larger questions about the long term funding of the program at the planned 0 58 payroll tax rate the program is set to run out of money to pay scheduled benefits by 2075 according to a december 2020 study commissioned by the state the report also describes the impact of different scenarios such as allowing people who leave the state to access benefits that scenario would require more revenue and a higher tax rate keiser said there are ways to better fund the program and allow more to participate one idea is for the state to invest long term care tax funds in private stocks to do so the state must pass a constitutional amendment a ballot measure that would have allowed the state to invest long term care funds in stocks was rejected by voters in 2020 more information about the program can be found at wacaresfund wa gov reporter jacqueline allison 360 416 2145 twitter jacqueline_svh ___ c 2021 the skagit valley herald

the same as early in the pandemic when hundreds of residents were thrown out of work in march 2020 but even as people have returned to work many have outstanding bills depleted savings and continuing financial worries some are still catching up on bills sears graves said so getting help with food eases costs to help with the other bills and with the cost of food going up if they can get the food free that enables them to get their prescriptions and pay their other bills that come up we saw the sign and decided to stop by carol eduardo diaz of new london said as she awaited a united way food

ortiz came to the school to pick up lily and saw the sandwich board sign announcing the food pantry she asked for extra boxes for her neighbors because she said many people probably did not know about the new food pantry she thanked united way for realizing that people like her are still in need of food help united way has helped me with other things in my life ortiz said it really helps i just got a new job and now i don t qualify for food assistance but i still have needs in just over an hour volunteers had loaded 148 boxes into cars at jennings school last wednesday the numbers at the weekly distributions are not as high as they were in the peak of covid ct foodshare president and ceo jason jakubowski said but they re also not down to pre covid numbers ct foodshare a recent merger of connecticut food bank and foodshare did not run emergency weekly food sites before the covid 19 pandemic the entities instead had supplied food to dozens of food pantries and meal sites throughout the state jakubowski said the agency hopes to get back to that the ct foodshare weekly emergency drives such as the norwich site which runs from 9 a m to noon on mondays at the former foxwoods employee parking lot at 28 stonington road route 2 had been slated to end in early summer again in august and in september but with 1 000 boxes being loaded into cars each week ct foodshare will continue through october the emergency weekly distributions got their latest funding boost from the state last week on wednesday gov ned lamont announced that nearly 10 million of the state s federal american rescue plan grant dollars will be allocated to support connecticut dairy and agriculture industries hurt by the pandemic ct foodshare will receive 800 000 per month for september and october to purchase fresh produce and dairy products to continue the weekly food sites through october jakubowski said 80 of the food distributed will be purchased from connecticut farmers including fresh produce eggs and dairy products he said the agency has not been able to purchase much meat lately and donations of meat have been low the people are extremely grateful said norwich mayor peter nystrom who volunteers at the norwich food site each week the last two mondays we were wiped out by 11 30 the need is there it s not going away and with heating bills coming on we really need this service but jakubowski warned that october likely would be the last month for the drive thru service in norwich and other cities outside this region these are scheduled to end at the end of october he said i don t believe there will be additional funding we strongly encourage people to get connected with their local food pantries after that foodshare will start working on its annual holiday season food drives and collection of thousands of turkeys to help families with holiday meals jakubowski said ct foodshare s weekly food pantry in new london however will not end anytime soon started in january as an emergency weekly distribution the walk up food pantry held from 2 30 to 4 p m fridays at st mary s star of the sea church at 10 huntington st is now permanent jakubowski said that site is funded directly through donations to ct foodshare we re glad we re able to keep that going he said of the new london site it s not the same volume as drive thru sites we initially thought the new london site would be emergency drive thru but it works as a permanent walk up site at the united way food pantries volunteers hand pack boxes with canned and boxed dry goods donated and purchased by the united way food center along with frozen meat produce and dairy products the boxes vary each week depending on supplies at the food center united way ceo sears graves said sears graves said the pandemic has

it is imperative that congress addressed the debt limit if not our current estimate is the treasury will likely exhaust its extraordinary measures by october 18 at that point we expect treasury would be left with very limited resources that would be depleted quickly a miracle would default for the first time in history the full faith and credit of the united states would be impaired and our country would likely face a financial crisis and economic recession as a result it s necessary to avert a catastrophic event for our economy senators the debt ceiling has been raised were suspended 78 times since 1960 almost always on a bipartisan basis my hope is that we can work together to do so again and to build a stronger american economy for future generations advertisement why oct 19 could be a catastrophic day for the us economy share copy link copy the united states could be just weeks away from defaulting on its debt for the first time ever the 28 4 trillion debt limit was reinstated aug 1 since then treasury secretary janet yellen has been keeping the nation s finances afloat by using emergency accounting maneuvers known as extraordinary measures these steps allow the government to borrow additional funds without breaching the debt ceiling video above us debt measures likely exhausted oct 18 secretary yellen saysbut yellen warned lawmakers this week that if congress fails to raise or suspend the debt ceiling the federal government will exhaust those extraordinary measures by oct 18 at that point we expect treasury would be left with very limited resources that would be depleted quickly yellen wrote in a letter to congress it is uncertain whether we would continue to meet all the nation s commitments after that date that s an accelerated timing from previously when yellen said this would happen at some point in october this so called x date should be viewed as a best guess by treasury not a set in stone deadline based on exact science in other words america could hit the debt ceiling days before or days after oct 18 there are many many moving pieces here yellen herself warned the x date can unpredictably shift forward or backward and given the stakes jamie dimon has warned a default would cause a cascading catastrophe of unbelievable proportions and damage america for 100 years it would be risky for congress to get too close to the x date let alone beyond it is there any leeway maybeof course treasury secretaries have a long history of giving themselves wiggle room when announcing an x date just in case congress blows through that date that s what happened in 2011 washington didn t default then but the delay did cost america its perfect credit rating from s p and rattle financial markets it s the same idea as telling someone who is chronically late that dinner is two hours earlier than scheduled just to make sure they re on time there is some debate over just how much wiggle room yellen is giving congress this time yellen was asked at a hearing on thursday what happens on oct 19 and her response indicates there could be a bit of leeway but not much we re simply in an impossible situation in which it will be impossible for treasury on that day or a few days thereafter we ll have very limited resources yellen said it will be run down quickly we won t be able to pay all of the government s bills however the nonpartisan congressional budget office issued a report tuesday that suggests there may be additional time beyond oct 18 for lawmakers to avoid a catastrophic default the cbo projects that if the debt limit remains unchanged treasury s ability to borrow using extraordinary measures will be exhausted and it will most likely run out of cash near the end of october or the beginning of november that s unchanged from cbo s prior estimate in july cbo warns that after that happens the federal government would be unable to pay its obligations fully and it would delay making payments for some activities default on its debt obligations or both zandi says the x date is around oct 20however others think there is much less time mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics told cnn on wednesday that yellen is likely being somewhat conservative but not overly so i wouldn t be surprised if it is a day or two later than the 18th zandi said i m estimating the 20th that implies a bit of wiggle room but not much certainly not as much as in 2011 zandi said thursday he s not changing his estimate despite the more optimistic take by the cbo very hard to predictthe problem is that nailing down a precise x date is unusually difficult today because there are even more moving pieces than during prior debt ceiling clashes beyond the usual outlays for items like social security medicare and defense contracts the treasury is making big payments for disaster relief and covid programs at the same time tax revenue has been more volatile due to the impact of the pandemic usually these things aren t very hard to predict but right now they are said thomas simons senior money market economist at jefferies the variant in daily cash flows is so high relative to historical precedent yellen noted the government s daily gross cash flow averaged nearly 50 billion per day over the past year and has even exceeded 300 billion scarily close to running out of cash like yellen some on wall street are moving up the timing of when the government could default as recently as sept 10 jefferies projected that treasury could avoid default until nov 10 15 based on projections for cash balances and updated data on extraordinary measures since then things have changed simons wrote in a note to clients on tuesday in particular simons noted that treasury s cash position has dwindled faster than we expected it would throughout september that s never a good sign heading into a debt ceiling impasse simons said treasury s cash balances are starting to get very low on oct 18 we are more or less in agreement with yellen simons wrote in a report titled yellen flags oct 18 and we think she means it this time asked on thursday about the cbo report simons conceded there is a great deal of uncertainty and said the cbo forecast gives him a bit more hope but not much i still think that during the middle of october treasury is going to get scarily close to running out of cash simons told cnn i am still extremely concerned about what is going to happen in the middle of next month

comica festival 2009 london is bubbling over with comics between 5 to 26 november 2009 london is bubbling over with international comics during the comica festival s annual three week season of exhibitions events talks performances workshops films a conference and publishers fair at the institute of contemporary arts in the mall and other venues below comica director paul gravett discusses with freelance journalist matt badham his ambitions for this year s comica festival matt badham please tell us about a little about the history of your event and how it s evolved over the years paul gravett comica started in 2003 and grew out of a couple of events i d done with the ica that s the institute of contemporary arts before including interviews with grant morrison and tetsuya chiba and a panel with dave gibbons dave mckean and matt smith the ica is a cool venue on the mall just off trafalgar square and up the road from buckingham palace it has galleries two cinemas a theatre education space cafe bar and bookshop a key person there getting comica to happen was john dunning their film pr man at the time and a keen comics enthusiast and now a published graphic novelist himself with the brilliant salem brownstone from walker books which launched on 24th october at a comica spooktacular evening at the ica together john and i cajoled and persuaded philip dodd director of the ica finally to let us run a pilot 10 day festival during their summer refurbishment of the galleries they gave us the concourse gallery to fill a long corridor type space that leads from the foyer to the bar and the use of rooms and the cinema for talks luckily i knew a curator at a spanish festival who was inviting charles burns joe sacco and chris ware over and she very kindly let me bring the three of them from madrid to london saving on their pricey transatlantic flights so we had three top class guests to kick the show off one central idea of comica is to mix comics with all the other media and not keep it sealed off in some specialist cocoon so we got novelist alex garland who had drawn his hit book the beach initially as a comic he showed it to me years ago on the train to caption in oxford to talk with chris ware they were both pretty shy frankly but it was a great encounter jonathan ross surprised many people by being respectful and knowledgeable interviewing charles burns comica 04 l to r chris ware seth the pilot was an astonishing success instead of the ica being a deserted building site for 10 days it was packed with the public the talks sold out and the bookshop shifted loads and loads of graphic novels we got some great press coverage and even had joe sacco on channel 4 news philip dodd rang me right after and said let s do it again next year and comica was underway over the years comica has had some amazing guests craig thompson alan moore no less than 3 times joann sfar lewis trondheim the bitterkomix boys from south africa alison bechdel ben katchor guy delisle scott mccloud david b and many more we ve also branched out to work with other venues like the french institute national maritime museum v a bookart bookshop and this year no less than the british museum but the ica has remained the hub the base and the simple idea is to try to get each ica department film performance exhibition and of course talks to programme something comics related during the festival comica 09 l to r nic roeg alan moore melinda gebbie how is your event funded by ticket sales the exhibitors a grant some other means or a combination of these the ica continue to support comica amazingly through their arts funding and providing the venues technology and staff of course most ica events are ticketed so that s the main revenue stream from the start philip dodd recognised that something was happening in comics something they had to engage with and embrace to be there first ahead of their big artsy rivals like the tate we ve also had huge help from publishers other european festivals and various cultural institutes bringing artists over we ve never gone for the big comic mart mixed with trade fair approach but we started a small press fair in 2007 comica comiket and that s growing well with london underground comics teaming up last year and this year on sunday november 8th we expand to the ica theatre and have several groups supporting it from jimi gherkin s alternative press crew to matthew sheret from words pictures and the nobrow guys none of this comica festival would happen without everyone involved at the ica itself from house management tickets reception installation bookshop and technical to director ekow eshun jennifer thatcher in talks tejinder jouhal in films emma jayne taylor vicky carmichael in education jennifer byrne in press and everyone else who pulls together to make it go smoothly and i must sing the praises of the team of volunteers who help make comica possible including sarah lightman vasileios sakkos tom smith ben le foe and others in fact if anyone reading this would like to volunteer for comica this november do please get in touch via the website i understand that you run satellite events under the comica banner throughout the year can you tell us a little about these and why you decided to augment the main comica with other panels and exhibitions because too much is happening comics are too vibrant to limit them to one festival a year even one that s grown from ten days to three weeks with the year round flexibility of comica events we can welcome major guests whenever they can make it to london from art spiegelman and marjane satrapi to alan moore and joe sacco only a few weeks ago to a packed house and daniel clowes lined up for next spring comica 08 l to r emmanuel guibert ted benoit drawing by guibert photo sarah mcintyre what are comica s overall aims to treat comics as a totally valid contemporary artform to show where the medium is heading right now locally and internationally and how comics can interconnect with every other artform in many ways the aims the mission of comica are in sync with what peter stanbury and i envisaged when we used to co publish escape magazine back in the 1980s to escape to break out from narrow definitions and formulas to liberate comics to be anything they want and everything they can be that s why we ve put spiegelman together with philip pullman posy simmonds with ian mcewan moore gebbie with stewart lee or this year logicomix author apostolos doxiadis with marcus de sautoy and ben templesmith with philip ridley and comica hosts the best from whatever field of comics from japanese comics with junko mizuno to american superheroes like alex maleev last year and cameron stewart this year quality is there in every sector of this medium comica 08 l to r posy simmonds art spiegelman photo joel meadows who is comica aimed at what sort of punters do you hope to attract are you family friendly to reach out to as broad a public as possible to the fans and enthusiasts of course but also to all sorts of other people who are culturally alert and curious and may just be discovering the wonders of manga or graphic novels among them are plenty of people who want to make comics themselves easily half of them these days being women comica this year is adding a kids workshop little pencil with sarah mcintryre its identity is mostly focussed on the adult audience for comics though plans are afoot to expand the family side next year how effective have you been in getting those kind of people to attend definitely effective one of my greatest pleasures is to chat with people queuing for an event or signing and find out how they ve got interested in comica they come from all sort of backgrounds and interests and for a lot of them it s opening up a whole world of comics culture that they are really getting into can you give a projected or actual attendance figure for comica we estimate over 5 000 people now attend comica over the festival period and the numbers are still increasing as we link up with other major venues the added plus is that the ica no longer has to charge admission to the venue so a lot more people are visiting the free exhibitions and events what lessons have you learned during your time running comica in terms of its marketing and advertising key to comica s success has been the ica s high profile and strong links with the cutting edge media people notice and pay attention to what the ica does so it s been amazing working with them and getting coverage far and wide comica doesn t advertise because our newsworthy events and guests can get us valuable editorial coverage we know word of mouth works wonders do you use emerging technologies to spread the word about comica do you have a website or blog or use email mailing lists yep vital first through my own website www paulgravett com and since this year through www comicafestival com its own site both doing extremely well with thousands of visitors and we re using facebook now i ve got some great help with these from tim webber and ben le foe and the ica s own site always highlights our events what about print do you use print advertising have a newsletter anything like that instead of a convention booklet only for paying attendees we print a comica programme available as a pdf here that gets widely distributed across london so people can pick it up and get an overview of the whole season on top of this the ica always highlight comica in their monthly agenda which gets to lots of outlets and yes people can sign up to the email newsletter via the comica site to get first alerts on upcoming events to be sure to book those tickets early detail from the comica 09 brochure by sarah mcintyre what s the mix in terms of exhibitors at comica do you even have exhibitors as i said that s one aspect of traditional conventions that we ve not gone for instead the ica s own bookshop stocks all the relevant books by the guest creators and since 2007 we invite small presses self publishers and independents to sell their wares at the comica comiket what are your thoughts on the small press comics scene in this country how do you use comica to support it do you try and support it again as above the comiket is an important part of the festival we also spotlight small press creators on panels and in exhibitions such as the potential comic or pocom wall that ran in 2003 and again last year in 2007 comica hooked up with the observer and jonathan cape to launch the graphic short story prize to give newcomers the chance to win 1 000 get published in a national sunday paper and be talent spotted by a mainstream graphic novel publisher last year s winner julian hanshaw has his debut graphic novel the art of pho out from cape next spring it s a real opportunity for small pressers to get noticed this year we re getting four full pages in the glossy observer magazine for the winner s strip that s great exposure and will come out the sunday before the comica festival begins so great pre publicity and plenty of emerging uk talents have been nominated for the arts foundation s first 10 000 fellowship for a graphic novelist we re announcing the finalists at comica the first of many we hope how much are the tickets for comica how did you arrive at that price please tell us about any concessions the ica sets the prices for all its comica events and there are always discounts for concessions and even bigger discounts if you become an ica member we also offer reduced rates for an afternoon of three comica conversations in a row i m well aware that comica can be pricey for many people so i m pleased this year that thanks to sponsors ctrl alt shift and the arts foundation we ve got some totally free panels you just need to book and the exhibitions and comiket comics fair are always free admission how much are exhibitor tables for comica if you have any again how did you arrive at that figure we try to keep comiket prices deliberately low just to cover costs as low as a tenner to give people a chance to attend and reach out to the public do you run workshops events panels at comica please tell us about those and how they are organised yep the ica now has a reading room and student forum where we re holding an afternoon workshop with bryan talbot pat mills and other major creators dropping in to give advice and guidance there s another workshop at the new book club in shoreditch to design cartoon posters organising panels or comica conversations is one of the most complex parts of programming the festival co ordinating guests schedules to bring amazing people together like last year s underground comix reunion of spiegelman shelton and spain their first three way conversation in many many years vital to making these work are my years of working in comics getting to know creators publishers and festival organisers worldwide getting sacco over for example was possible only because he was in europe between two weekend festivals in st petersburg and italy comica 08 l to r gilbert shelton matt groening spain photo sarah mcintyre as you ve been kind enough to answer these questions please fell free to big comica up a bit tell us what you do well what comica s main attractions are and why our readers should attend the next one i really think there should be something for everyone who loves comics at this year s comica we ve teamed up again with the brilliant unmissable thought bubble festival in leeds to bring ben templesmith over as thought bubble run their big saturday during the comica season again this year i deliberately don t programme major events to clash on that day for one thing i want to get to thought bubble myself i can see the advantages of holding a one day event like this or the weekend approach of bristol or birmingham but you never have time to see everything and everyone you want to especially as there s often parallel programming going on comica is different because it can stretch across two even three weeks it does kind of favour people already living in or near london who can get here easily but out of towners can choose the weekends which are often the busiest parts of the festival ctrl alt shift unmasks corruption cover by laura oldfield ford i m especially excited by comica 09 because we ve hooked up with a fantastic sponsor the youth charity ctrl alt shift and i ve helped them co edit the first anthology comic published for comica ctrl alt shift unmasks corruption it really is a first class international anthology of reportage exposé comics with bryan talbot dave mckean woodrow phoenix peter kuper pat mills dylan horrocks dan goldman and more through ctrl alt shift we re hosting ny musician lightspeed champion who s created one story and scripted a second in the book for a live gig to launch the comic and it s great to have a month long exhibition to promote it through the ultra cool shop at lazarides gallery in greek street soho this show is going to stun people situating comics alongside agit prop graphics and the whole plethora of activist and political comics and cartoons from may 68 and black panthers to today and sean duffield s forthcoming paper tiger war anthology and alan moore s new venture dodgem logic the other startling thing is the number of related exhibitions linking up with comica this time from the british museum s manga show spotlighting the genius hoshino yukinobu and swiss cottage library s black powers display to solo shows by robert crumb at scream gallery mayfair philip marsden at riverside richmond and john miers at the flea pit in the east end our catch line this year is totally accurate london is bubbling over with comics on top of this are the exceptional theatrical live performance events this year david lloyd himself kicking off the festival appropriately on november 5th with live drawing and music with a v for vendetta theme it s a free party at the ica bar so remember remember the 5th of november then there s the darkly funny adults only uncle hans peter party by comic artist and animator richard squires where everyone in the audience has to wear an identical creepy mask and the equally edgy play busted jesus comix based on the conviction of florida teen mike diana forbidden to draw his crazed boiled angel comix in the end what makes comica worth doing is having remarkable guests like gerry finley day who had never appeared at a comics event before and this year reuniting brian bolland and dave gibbons with retail pioneers phil clarke of nostalgia comics and derek bram stokes founder of dark they were and golden eyed a thrill for me as dtwage was the first

44 year old kevin j donaldson author of 10 secrets of the new rich and founder of real wealth solutions has had to overcome an incredible amount during his life to reach the success he enjoys today conquering his humble beginnings and gaining mastery over his education finances health spirituality and most importantly his relationships allowed him to achieve business success the secrets of which he wishes to share with any willing to listen humble beginnings kevin s story began in 1977 in brooklyn new york growing up in crown heights kevin and his 11 other siblings relied on public assistance from a young age as a result of his mother s disability this led to the development of his entrepreneurial spirit from a young age he would pack bags at the local grocery store to earn some money but would not be taught anything regarding the value of it until much later during adulthood following the passing of his brother when he was ten kevin s mom moved him to rochester where he was able to thrive because of the much better environment in the next ten years it took kevin to accept his brother s death he became a more loving understanding and empathetic person he credits his ability to help others today to his understanding of death which would only be built upon as he continued in life after enrolling on a competitive nursing program at a rival high school kevin graduated as a licensed practical nurse and began working as one during and after college he describes becoming a nurse as one of the best moves he ever made due to the life lessons he learnt on the job it built on his pre existing compassion and empathy skills and taught him the importance of connection in relationships a skill that is paramount for business on top of this kevin quickly had to learn how to supplement his income whilst on a nurse s salary due to the fact that it wasn t extravagantly paid he had the opportunity to stoke his entrepreneurial mind and pursue other ventures which eventually led to his career in pharmaceutical sales importance of relationships in his current pursuits business relies on the successful maintenance of relationships kevin realized this early on in his career which explains why his business has been so lucrative given the financial struggle kevin experienced in the first half of his life and the basis for this being the lack of economic education provided during or after school he was passionate to establish a resource for financial and business knowledge that people willing to learn could refer to in 2010 kevin founded real wealth solutions for this purpose having already outlined the blueprint for financial independence in his book several years earlier rws was meant to be a holistic resource to help people to achieve financial freedom and pass on generational wealth by increasing their knowledge of the pillars of success finances health spirituality and relationships according to kevin the basis of financial freedom for those looking to establish it is life insurance as it helps to facilitate growth when a family s main breadwinner dies a family suffers in many ways but the existence of a life insurance policy creates an immediate tax free death benefit adding to the family s net worth this leads people to be healthier and to have better relationships which is empowering and has positive benefits for those seeking to found a business kevin stresses that the ability to develop meaningful relationships in itself is a skill that is invaluable to businesses whose very purpose is to be able to connect with customers and be able to provide value to them kevin is a remarkable man not only due to the adversity he has had to overcome to run the successful business he does today but his need to find the best medium through which to share his knowledge with others to share what he has learnt about financial freedom business and the importance of the ability to develop relationships kevin hopes to use real wealth solutions as a platform to eliminate poverty and reduce governmental dependence and if the success of his former and current clients is anything to go by he s well on his way to achieving this goal story by giuliana speranza
content warning show warnings this page contains blood death dying murder the deaths began slowly or rather the dying itself was quick bodies dropping onto polished marble red soaking starched linen the thudding noises summoning household staff the limbs were contorted into agonized poses and the mouths gave off a smell the staff would tell police and reporters one that they faltered to adequately describe it was like rubbing alcohol heated on the stove or white gardenias left to rot in an untended room it was that smell a smell with no name or too many names that some would cite when trying to explain why they d huddled in fear in the doorways or down the hall during their employers last seconds but there were also the housemaids who wept as they talked of cradling the heads of the dying pulling a frette pillowcase over their own mouths as they frantically dialed for help the investigations began as they would have extra detectives assigned to untangle the threads of endowments stocks bonds illegitimate children with unsupported inheritance claims former partners with lawsuits dangling activists and stalkers rounding out the edges of crowded whiteboards at headquarters alibis were offered and confirmed one detective using a no 2 pencil to mark off each name as he cleared it from the list and flicked open a new page nannies and gardeners and house cleaners were questioned sometimes over and over white gloves dusted every bottle of roundup in the garage and every leather cleaner in the stables of course finding a thicket of fingerprints that proved nothing at all none of those chemicals were found at the autopsies anyway and by the time the bodies had been rolled onto steel tables at the coroner s offices nobody could detect the odor duly noted in the reports always identified by the employees who found the bodies but varying widely as the cases began to dot the map floor polish lighter fluid rancid sweat the smell would sometimes return weeks later as housekeepers emptied desk drawers or shook out heavy curtains sending them rushing to the safety of their employers brick lined patios to gasp in the summer air that the bodies were dead was plainly obvious but there was nothing in the prying open of brains or hearts or stomachs nothing in the meticulous sampling of blood and hair and tissue nothing in the second or third reports commissioned by grieving families that could explain how they had got that way what emerged slowly were enough deaths to discern a pattern from newport beach to east hampton to breckenridge reporters camped in front of stone lions announcing yet another death this one old and infirm that one young and known for tennis every morning on the back lawn another for scaling k 2 the year before live tweeting the journey while a team of sherpas carried her bags after all people die all the time and it took some time before the accumulation of a critical mass of causes marked in coroners reports as idiopathic or in detective reports as unknown it didn t help that so much else was inexplicable in one family the patriarch was found floating in his swimming pool but his wife and children were untouched in another the seven senior members of the family board of directors were all found dead at precisely 10 p m on a friday scattered across four time zones and as many continents a plane pulled into kuala lumpur to find the youngest daughter unresponsive only minutes after she d been served her second sloe gin fizz this time what emitted from her mouth even as the muscles began to stiffen was an odor of burnt leather and even more oddly crushed lemongrass the youngest daughter s heirs began to fight over her portion of the empire a line of shoes and handbags undergoing a rough patch when rumors of malaysian child labor kept dogging her instagram feed it never occurred to them that they might be next it wasn t until five months after the first death the ceo of a corn and soybean processing giant collapsing in his dressing gown the smell of sulfur dioxide escaping through the dining room window and alerting his gardeners outside that anyone realized that s what it had been it took two reporters one from forbes and another from corporate watch rated far left left leaning by two nonpartisan media rating sites to independently reach a sober conclusion while the deceased had a remarkable amount in common hailing from schools with names like dartmouth and dalton and tending to belong to the same few clubs there was one single thread running through every unexplained death like a string dangling from a pulled tooth the forbes editor told his reporter in no uncertain terms to kill the story but after ending the call he gripped his phone scrolling through the contacts a list that had grown three shorter over the previous seven months he began a text that would serve as a warning but what would it say the day after that conversation the corporate watch web site laid out its observations in simple unimpeachable graphic form while many of the country s wealthiest people were still very much alive every one of the eleven bodies had appeared on a list of the fortune 500 and in fact a chronology of the deaths though it skipped some entries leapfrogged its way up the list in perfectly ascending order its blogger had chosen that for his title a warning to those who remained the fortune 489 homicide departments called emergency meetings reassembled their teams along with fbi agents dark suited and flown in on red eyes nannies and cooks and assistants were resummoned for questioning detectives picking apart their alibis with renewed vigor an internal email was leaked each of its authors insisted that they d been the victim of hacking between head actuaries at the country s top three life insurance companies proposing that policies be null and void for anyone on the fortune list one suggested out of an abundance of caution expanding it for the country s top one percent of wealth holders that furor was eclipsed the following day when two deaths were reported within hours of each other in still ascending order on what several copy editors dubbed the fortune 487 the corporate watch blogger recruited three friends as bodyguards after thebloggerdidit began trending the bulk of the comments arguing that his piece had been a public hit list for an assassin nobody could name the nation s top security and risk management company hired 84 new employees in a single day half of them merely to field the calls and emails that began flooding in two minutes after the piece went live the company s online help chat bots were swiftly removed after reading endless copies of inquest testimony and detective reports and the articles that clogged twitter with dizzying speed the ceo of the largest company had to call back a prospective client who d left three increasingly desperate messages on his personal phone so you re telling me you refuse to protect me she snapped before his opening sentence was out his chair creaked as he sat up with a jerk ma am what i m saying is i can t protect you i can charge you to feel protected and you may decide that that s worth it to you but there s not one thing in common between all of these crime scenes not even a common cause of death except no cause at all he scrawled on a notepad beside him except a mysterious smell that could not be replicated and that was never described the same way twice one terrified man gave away every bit of his fortune and sold every piece of real estate he had down to the last stick of furniture when the voice mails and then certified letters and finally angry tweets begged him to keep it in the family he closed his account and scrawled return to sender in furious green at the bottom of each envelope the movers found him collapsed in the foyer of his first home already plucked and stripped of all his possessions the sunlight bouncing off empty floors and his body giving off the odor of burning graphite the magnate s lawyers spent months disbursing and reimbursing the funds he d shed and the stocks he d unloaded he d begun his fortune in agribusiness but he was particularly fond of his factories making school supplies there had been an especially ugly case early in his career two workers had been killed by one of the machines which had overheated and scalded their faces with steam he d been seen weeping at their funerals and on his death his family learned that he d been quietly sending an annuity to the children and grandchildren of both the dead workers his older daughter cut it off his three children staked out what would emerge as the response patterns of the wealthy even as the deaths began rolling in faster and forming new lists entirely expanding to england mexico hong kong dubai his youngest followed in her father s recent footsteps selling off nearly everything she kept a single silver pendant and one matching watch sloughing off the stocks and trust payments as fast as they rolled in holed up in a three bedroom condo she told herself was safe enough her brother s instagram feed filled up with snaps of him at lake como on bali precisely the same wide grin in every shot both of them were still alive six months later along with the older daughter who d taken the reins of the company and hired a firm to fight off a union that had been sniffing around one of the pencil factories it was these inconsistencies and the glaring gaps and inexplicable branching of the lists that kept earning phrases like capricious twist of fate in news articles and that spawned multiple watch sites including one that actually took real bets on who would be next until it went dark one day without warning an anonymous collective of hackers and internet sleuths published the real names of the bettors which took up the better part of the news cycle until the collapse of the world s third wealthiest man he d collapsed inside his foyer surrounded by seventeen armed guards and two assistants and the taster he d hired for every single dish one award winning columnist for der spiegel noted that the deaths had reached twenty nine every one of them unsolved and sent out a tweet if god s not a marxist he certainly seems to have done the reading the third wealthiest man had included in his empire several internationally recognized newspapers a columnist for one of them usually on the fashion and lifestyle beat proposed that instead of joining the coverage of the utter chaos at insurance companies and stock advising firms the estate and tax attorneys booking ninety hour weeks the advisors for security and risk management firms quitting in impotent fear the proliferation of really rich dead people trading cards the conferences of experts poring again and again over autopsy reports the exhumations of bodies that had long since begun to stink the utterly indescribable tone of voice from the ceo of the world s largest venture capital firm on their earnings call a week after the death of three of its five principals that she seek out the very first household employees who d found the very first body what one macabre headline had dubbed billionaire zero none of them had ever actually met him the gardeners explained perched on rickety metal chairs at a starbucks where customers kept craning their necks at the faces that looked faintly familiar but that they couldn t quite place the columnist had only been able to round up two of the four gardeners who d been working outside that dining room window shaping hydrangea bushes in the april sun and one did most of the talking andrés had been in the united states for thirty years his family had left el salvador when a neighbor recognized his father andrés sr s distinctive tattoos marking him as a commander in a squad that had killed untold civilians at the massacre of el mozote he hadn t known his father s history until he was much older andrés jr explained twisting a slim silver cross around and around in his hands a present from his father at first communion i mean it s just it s so hard to reconcile that with the man who taught me to ride a bike and bragged to all the neighbors when i graduated high school with honors imagine learning that you d lived for so long with someone who brought on that much suffering the house you lived in the food you ate that they came from someone who was carrying all that around inside the cross dangled from his fingers and gleamed in the waning light that so much death had been walking beside you all along

corporate executive compensation in particular the pay ratio compared with rank and file employees has resurfaced as a u s senate democratic revenue initiative a group of progressive democratic senators led by bernie sanders of vermont and elizabeth warren of massachusetts introduced the tax excessive ceo pay act in march a similar proposal has been submitted in the u s house last month sen ron wyden d ore the u s senate finance committee chairman expressed his support for the proposed bill as a revenue stream the goal of the bill is to take on corporate greed by raising taxes on companies that pay their top executives at least 50 times more than the pay of a median worker median is defined as the middle value in a list of numbers if the proposed bill which faces long odds in the senate clears congress at least 19 corporations with a major employment presence in the triad would have had to pay the tax just for their chief executive s total compensation in fiscal 2020 the senators cited as examples that if the proposed legislation had been in effect in fiscal 2020 walmart would have paid up to 854 9 million more in taxes home depot 550 8 million more jpmorganchase co 172 8 million more nike 147 7 million more mcdonald s 69 5 million more and american airlines 22 6 million more sanders said in a statement that the american people understand that today we are moving toward an oligarchic form of society where the very rich are doing phenomenally well and working families are struggling in a way that we have not seen since the great depression at a time of massive income and wealth inequality the american people are demanding that large profitable corporations pay their fair share of taxes and treat their employees with the dignity and respect they deserve that is what this legislation will begin to do the left leaning institute for policy studies determined that of the 50 publicly traded u s corporations with the widest pay ratio gaps in 2018 the typical employee would have to work at least 1 000 years to earn what their ceo made in just one topping the local list is lowes cos inc chief executive marvin ellison whose ceo pay ratio was 940 to 1 based on ellison s total compensation of 23 07 million and the median worker compensation of 24 554 ellison was paid 1 45 million in salary making 59 06 for every 1 made by the median worker next was hanesbrands inc chief executive stephen bratspies who took over in august 2020 bratspies was paid 4 83 million in total compensation which includes 458 333 in salary meanwhile the median annual employee compensation was 6 900 for hanesbrands nearly 61 000 employees of which about 88 work in central america the caribbean basin and asia the median employee was determined to be a production operator at a supply chain facility in honduras bratspies ceo pay ratio was 699 to 1 while the salary ratio was 66 42 to 1 it was by far the lowest annual compensation for a median employee for the 29 listed corporations with a significant triad presence how it would work the corporate tax rate would increase by 0 5 for companies reporting a ceo pay ratio of 50 to 1 it would cap at a 5 tax rate for those companies reporting a ratio of 500 to 1 or higher the remaining breakdowns are more than 100 but not more than 200 to 1 1 percentage point tax rate more than 200 but not more than 300 to 1 a 2 percentage point tax rate more than 300 but not more than 400 to 1 a 3 percentage point tax rate and more than 400 but not more than 500 to 1 a 4 percentage point tax rate for the 19 corporations with the significant triad employment presence lowes and hanesbrands would pay the maximum tax rate paying the proposed 4 tax would be tanger factory outlet centers inc while paying the 3 tax would be laboratory corp of america holdings corporations paying the proposed 2 tax would be caterpillar inc wells fargo co and fedex corp paying the proposed 1 tax would be raytheon technologies inc herbalife nutrition ltd primo water corp qorvo inc american airlines group inc truist financial corp f n b corp and old dominion freight line inc paying the proposed 0 5 tax would be sturm ruger co inc amazon first horizon national corp and pinnacle financial partners inc according to the proposed bill the legislation would extend the current pay ratio disclosure rules for public companies to private companies with gross receipts of 100 million per year for those companies where the ceo is paid little or nothing typically due to their underlying ownership of the company the ratio will be calculated based on the compensation of the company s highest paid employee rather than that of the company s ceo that proposal would take into consideration the executive compensation of corporations such as amazon which paid former chief executive and billionaire jeff bezos 1 68 million in total compensation and 81 840 in salary bezos is considered the world s richest person with an estimated net worth of 191 billion meanwhile the median amazon worker made 29 007 in compensation for a ceo pay ratio of 58 to 1 and salary ratio of 2 82 to 1 dodd frank next step bill sponsors considered the bill as an extension of the 2010 dodd frank federal legislation that requires publicly traded corporations to disclose the ratio between their ceo and median worker pay they said that the results of this important regulation show that disclosure is not enough according on a statement on the act the proposed legislation has gained a second wind recently by being pushed similarly to how increased excise taxes have been promoted on tobacco and nicotine products anti tobacco advocates and public health officials urge increasing federal and state tobacco excise taxes as not as a pricing deterrent to consumers but also as a revenue stream in the meantime by increasing the tax rate on companies with excessive ceo pay the bill could raise as much as 150 billion over 10 years and help reduce the rampant growth of income inequality according to bill sponsors the thinking with the proposed bill appears to be that if corporations are going to insist on annual exorbitant ceo pay even with public disclosures of the ceo pay ratio they should pay taxes on what would be considered as excessive amounts according to washington monthly the proposed legislation would create an incentive for corporations to raise employee pay to avoid paying the higher tax rate this would not only be popular with voters and reverse the decades old trend toward income inequality it would also answer the chief objection some economists lodge one that holds sway with many moderate lawmakers against traditional corporate tax increases that they lead companies to pay workers less pay ratio background since 1994 the annual salary bonus and incentives stock awards and other compensation of top five executives from publicly traded companies have been disclosed by requirement of federal regulators an element of the dodd frank federal regulatory act that went into effect in 2017 requires corporations to put a number and a ratio to the compensation gap between chief executives and their median employee salary the act requires corporations to adjust how they determine who their median employee is every three years which means that change will show up in the 2021 ceo pay ratio calculations the ratio is easy to understand and has served to increase interest in the issue said michael walden an economics professor at n c state university however recent data from the pandemic suggest ceo management is highly valued by companies especially when companies are under stress many companies substantially increased ceo compensation during the pandemic does not work the annual ceo pay ratio disclosures may cause some buzz for a few days but overall the strategy does not work said zagros madjd sadjadi an economics professor at winston salem state university investors do not seem to care about the ratio what they care about are results and with the stock market reaching new heights the ratio of ceo to worker pay is reaching record levels for those corporations who closely tie stock awards to executive compensation ceo compensation even though it looms large in terms of the average worker still tends to be very small in terms of a firm s realized profits madjd sadjadi said compensation advisory partners a national executive compensation consulting firm said in a jan 19 blog post that since inception comparing ceo pay ratios across companies has been of limited usefulness for example beyond variability across industries when looking at two competitors the workforce of one may be largely u s based while the workforce of the other may be mostly located in lower cost countries the firm said those differences were exasperated in 2020 by inconsistent disruptions in business and workforces in 2020 due to the historic covid 19 pandemic those disruptions may significantly impact the numerator and or denominator of the ceo pay ratio calculation has only reinforced the inherent issues with comparing ceo pay ratios across companies tony plath a retired finance professor at unc charlotte said that while he doesn t believe the proposed legislation could clear the u s senate it doesn t mean the goal lacks merit wouldn t it make a lot more sense to penalize directly the people responsible for the excessive compensation that ceos earn plath asked structure the incidence of increased federal taxation to fall on the shoulders of the ceos and corporate board members who vote to support these ridiculous and bourgeois ceo plans is this constitutional probably not but put enough smart and overpaid tax lawyers to work on the problem and i m pretty sure they could come up with a workable solution for federal tax policy that would accomplish the same result and still pass muster with the u s constitution plath said it is a laudable goal to pursue raising the median wages for employees particularly in low paying industries such as textiles and food processing rather than taxing the ceo pay ratio excesses the current output price of the product should after all be somewhat higher to reflect all of the real physical labor that goes in to producing a chicken breast plath said why on earth would you seek to penalize via increased federal corporate taxes the wage earners customers and shareholders of public corporations these are the people who ultimately suffer the expense of higher taxes imposed on publicly held corporations and practically all of these people had absolutely nothing to do with the decision to excessively compensate a corporate ceo

as a young boy kenny nichols was no stranger to hard work his dad passed away in 1934 when nichols was four years old leaving the youngster his mother and older siblings to eke out a living from the land during the great depression it meant long days and back breaking work with few rewards beginning of caterpillar love affair one particular day some 84 years ago seven year old nichols was on an errand walking a county dirt road in rural missouri when a man driving a caterpillar ten crawler came down the way the county had the machine they were bringing it up the road from cedar grove to work on some hills near the palmer banks i was just a kid walking along the road the driver stopped to give me a ride nichols said and he let me drive it about a half a mile that brief encounter began nichols s lifelong love for cat dozers duty calls little boys grow up and nichols did too he and his brothers continued working to help support the family in 1951 nichols married the love of his life willadean stephens soon after duty called and the u s army sent him to korea leaving his young bride at home on her parent s missouri farm nichols served his country abroad for 13 months but not everything about being away from home was without joy during his service in korea nichols ran a caterpillar dozer i got to run one in the army it wasn t in my mos code but we had the equipment over there to dig trenches the operators were tired and didn t want to run them so i said i ll do it nichols said i got to run them a lot over there homecoming upon the young soldier s homecoming in 1953 he picked up where he d left off working as a dozer operator over the next few years nichols built a strong reputation as a skillful operator known for his integrity and passion for high quality work but he preferred to work for companies that owned cat machines eventually nichols purchased his own machine the first dozer i bought was a cat d6c in 1971 it belonged to a man i was working for at the time he bought a brand new d6c and offered to sell me his old one he said so nichols began using his own dozer and working for himself through the years he has worked on every type of job imaginable from clearing land for buildings and roads to moving dirt for stock ponds and lakes you name it and he has probably done it using a cat dozer over the years he s owned only cat machines and currently owns a d6c a d6d and a cat backhoe when asked why he chooses cat machines nichols replied i wouldn t have anything else if you re going to use heavy equipment just get cat they re dependable and i think they re prettier myself i ve dug so many new house basements around salem missouri more than were dug with backhoes and lakes big lakes it would take me a lot of time to tell you about all the jobs i ve worked on he said just like they took care of us throughout the years the nichols family fared well supported by nichols s extraordinary operator skills and passion for operating a dozer but it s the nichols family s love for each other and their cat dozers that makes the story special kent nichols kenny and willadean s son explained you see my mother developed severe rheumatoid arthritis when she was just 27 if you had spoken to her on the phone you wouldn t have known there was anything wrong with her she was always upbeat and positive an eternal optimist but her fingers were very contorted from the arthritis she wore a c collar and was in a wheelchair because she d had both legs amputated due to the disease caterpillar is an important part of our family s story because all through the years my dad took care of mom he would get her up in the mornings and get her set for the day if she had to go to the doctor he would take her this went on for years and years his business allowed him the flexibility to take care of her but those dozers made it possible had it not been for those cat machines being so dependable and the whole caterpillar and fabick team behind them dad couldn t have cared for mom and the machines enabled him to make enough money to pay her medical bills so growing up those dozers were like members of the family we cherished them and took care of them just like they took care of us willadean passed away nearly 24 years ago but her love for life and remarkable legacy lives on today at age 91 nichols continues working every day at the job he has loved for a lifetime the family estimates that he s spent more than 110 000 hours operating dozers possibly claiming the record for logging the most hours operating a bulldozer and those cat machines they just keep on running you can t find machines that are any better you can afford to pay more for a cat machine because it s cheaper in the long run they last longer and they handle better they prove themselves said nichols does he think about retiring anytime soon why quit something you like doing nichols said this story was reprinted with the permission of caterpillar inc today s top stories

chris m barkley unburdening myself of unfinished business by chris m barkley item one as we emerge from the cold and cloudless days of january and february you would think that the prospect of sunny days baseball international football soccer the open swimming pools and children playing outside would bring some joy to my soul every year for the past forty years or so the coming of the so called daylight savings time fills me with sadness anxiety moodiness and lastly anger yes i only appear to be a mild mannered reporter for a daily metropolitan daily sf news zine because myself and most of my fellow north americans have lost an hour s sleep and why because the farmers blah blah blah and the kids getting on the bus in the dark blah blah and commerce and businesses flourish blah blah blah when i was a young lad in the mid 1960 s the prospect of time travel in this fashion was novel and exciting forward into the future and then returning back into the past a few months later was a perfectly appealing idea to my young mind but as i got older my priorities and attitude towards dst gradually changed just the thought of the approaching date brought on bouts of gnawing and persisting dread changing the clocks forth and back became and still are a hassle and the loss of an hour s sleep every spring is just plain wrong i m not going to bore everyone with its history musings opinions or statistics about whether we should choose to sat in standard or daylight time or why the dst should be hunted down with pitchforks and torches staked through the heart and left burning in the noonday sun instead i will leave you with a well known native american aphorism only a white man would have you believe you could cut a foot off the top of the blanket sew it onto the bottom of the blanket and you d be left with a longer blanket contact your congressional representative and senators they are the only ones who can kill this stupid and unhealthy abomination once and for all enough said item two on the morning of february 5 2024 my audio interview with dave mccarty was published here on file770 com as many of you may know i distribute the daily pixel scroll and other standalone news items on eight sff facebook groups and on the bluesky app i have mostly avoided posting on x twitter since september 2023 if there is something more important or pressing at hand like an exclusive interview with dave mccarty for example i post a file 770 link to a more widespread group of forty groups well actually thirty nine as of today let me explain that particular morning i started posting the interview to my usual group but when i came up to the washington science fiction association i had to pause because i was served with a notice that stated that my posting privileges had been suspended your profile been sic suspended in this group the admin has temporarily turned off your ability to post comment and earn contribution points in the group until february 23 2024 10 19 am i was flabbergasted for several reasons the first of which was that i had not received any notice of the suspension from any of the administrators there was no previous indication of any trouble before that day since i was locked out of the page there was no way to send a message to an admin so i decided to shout out on my own page to the washington science fiction association facebook page while posting my latest file 770 column this morning i found out that the admins of the washington science fiction association suspended my posting privileges on their page for three weeks apparently they found my most recent dispersing news on a regular basis either offensive and or disturbing i have done my best to pass along vital and accurate information there for some time and i am highly upset that i was suspended without notification or an adequate explanation do i need to point out the parallels to what happened recently regarding the chengdu long list nominees as a journalist i resent being effectively censored in this fashion sf fans have every right to be informed whether the news is for good or for ill especially during these tumultuous times in sf fandom while i recognize that they have every right to run their page as they see fit i find this action egregious unnecessary and a disservice to the other members of the group as a result of these actions i will be leaving the group later today chris b during the course of that day several friends offered advice and support which for the most part i appreciated several suggested i reach out to the administrators to find out what the problem was i wasn t very receptive to doing that because i was very upset and the aggrieved party so why would i do that two friends intervened on my behalf and made inquiries on my behalf one reported in a direct message sent your message to the three admins i m guessing what set this off was the piece with the mccarty interview i did not hear back from anyone else about this that day and so at a little after 10pm the washington science fiction association page had one less member my other friend sent me the following message in the early morning hours of the next day chris you were paused by the moderator because they were traveling and could not monitor posts i sent back the following message well that s a troubling explanation was this applied to everyone or just me because without a notification to me or on the page it felt like i was being targeted also the period of time described in the suspension notice wasn t for a period of days but weeks so yeah i m having a hard time believing this as of today i have not been contacted by any of the admins involved nor have i been given an adequate explanation for their actions or offered an apology my reason for airing my grievance here and now is two fold this incident has been simmering with me for over five weeks and i felt the need to let loose before i lose my sanity self esteem or both secondly this is not my first rodeo with unresponsive page admins and frankly i m becoming more and more disenchanted with social media and facebook in particular and at its best facebook is a wonderful tool to keep in touch with friends and share ideas and opinions but i am beginning to realize that for me the pervasive and oftentimes intrusive effects of social media may outweigh its benefits lately i have been contemplating leaving facebook for good incidents like this just nudge me a little further towards doing that item three and then there was the matter of d g valdron s essay on medium com on february 18 mr valdron who describes himself on the website as a canadian speculative fiction and pop culture writer published an article that was ominously titled moral compromise and the lesson of the hugos mr valdron in an imperious and somewhat solemn tone vaguely and mind you without attribution outlined the problems regarding the chengdu worldcon in 2023 the world science fiction convention was held in chengdu china this was a little bit controversial given the chinese government s genocidal actions regarding ughyers and tibetans their authoritarian police state shtick etc but everyone went along with it why rock the boat the problem came with the hugo awards now the thing with the hugos is that everyone submits nominations the hugo awards committee vets the nominations and a final list gets put out for the fans and convention members to vote on by secret ballot now that s how i understand it i might have gotten some detail wrong but i believe that s the gist it doesn t matter here s what matters the hugos were corrupted the hugo awards committee turns out to have been screening out the works of american english and chinese creators on behalf of the chinese government basically anyone whose novel or background was critical of the chinese government or even politically sensitive like mentioning tibet was dropped from the list but you know what strikes me it s how trivial this is forgive me i m sure it s important to the people involved careers and friendships ended a community rocked but let s get a grip most people in north america have never even heard of the hugos most people in north america are not science fiction writers or readers hell most people in north america are not readers the hugos aren t the nobels or the pulitzers in the larger scheme they re a minor award restricted to a literary social subculture which might result in a few extra sales and an ego boost no one s life was at risk no one s freedom was imperiled no huge sums of money no public safety this was a small trivial thing in my cynical side i suspect that most times people would make the wrong moral choice but hopefully in the face of more pressure or intimidation or incentive than this maybe i just want people to suffer more anyway we ve been down this path before you and i sorry to belabour it how we treat each other is a hobby horse of mine i ve had my tests and i ll have more i ve dealt with them what about you i m so glad you asked sir now to be fair mr valdron is entitled to his opinion and granted what happened with the chengdu worldcon and the 2023 hugo awards is definitely not as important as the ongoing wars in ukraine and the gaza strip the current battle between democracy and fascism in the united states or our ever increasing concerns over climate change and various environmental crises all over the world what really ticked me off about d g valdron s article is his rather cavalier attitude towards what happened the hugo awards and general air of disapproval of the fandom that supports it fantasy science fiction and horror is despite the bleating of insufferable academics and mainstream literary critics a vital part of the tree of literature and whose roots run a millenium or two deep modern sff literature and fandom started over a hundred years ago when teenagers in the us and united kingdom began to correspond meet talk and write about their mutual fascination and out of those meetings came conventions cosplay and generations of aspiring publishers writers editors artists game creators filmmakers and commentators like myself i have had the privilege of growing up in a period of this history to witness sff grow from being considered a freakish sideshow to becoming a dominant force in world culture and the hugo awards for better or worse have provided all of us with an invaluable anecdotal year by year snapshot of what people thought about fantastic literature and the visual arts readers writers editors artists and publishers look to it as a bellwether of the field s vitality so no this is not a small trivial thing mr waldron and i find it very disappointing to see a member of our own community like yourself thinking so little of the situation as to look down your nose at the sff fandom and its history under the pretense of high handed criticism there is a term for this mr waldron it is called bad form item four having a little notoriety in your life can be fun i have been a fan guest of honor at three conventions windycon in 2019 astronomicon in 2021 and confusion in 2023 a panelist art auctioneer at local regional conventions and at worldcons i ve been nominated for a hugo award twice and may have even won one but speaking personally i don t go out of my way to seek it out i know myself well enough to know that if my ego were well fed on a regular basis it would be to the detriment of myself and my family and friends so as you can well imagine my quandary as the chengdu worldcon story grew exponentially my name as well as my co author jason sanford popped in all sorts of media outlets like the guardian uk nbc news the associated press and the new york times among others i was even interviewed by andrew linbong for national public radio which as a listener of fifty plus years was the thrill of a lifetime as far as i m concerned but there s a downside as well while i and jason received universal praise for our reporting we were also reminded that there are a lot of cranks out there who were more than willing to let the air out of tires so to speak there were several that stood out sff author larry correia was irked because of jason and i had previously reported on and commented negatively against his involvements in the sad angry rabid puppy wars a decade ago frankly having someone like correia upset with me is a badge of honor as far as i m concerned see my post on bluesky my partner juli alerted me that some wag on reddit had heard my interview with dave mccarty and had come to the startling conclusion that i was actually in cahoots with him to cover up his complicity in the scandal to which i replied that he had obviously seen far too many episodes of the traitors reality competition show to be reasoned with i was very heartened when i read that both samantha mills author of the acclaimed short story rabbit test and adrian tchaikovsky who wrote the children of time series had both decided not to acknowledge their hugo awards in the wake of the chengdu scandal adversely i received a bit of backlash from some people once i let it be known that i was going to keep my hugo award more as a keepsake and family heirloom than a personal achievement i might have felt the same way as ms mills and mr tchaikovsky if i was sitting at home watching the hugo awards ceremony at home and found out later that my presence on the ballot was dubious at best and that many chinese writers and fans were most likely disenfranchised from the process but i went to china had the time of my life made the speech of my life and felt a close affinity for this award i thought i had rightly won if anything i wanted to be reminded of the trip the people i met and befriended and the devastating revelations that followed well for a very vocal fringe minority of people keeping this hugo award was tantamount to rooting for lex luthor killing baby seals helping the houston astros win the 2017 world series or actually being a communist i laughed off nearly all of this outrage as either sour grapes jealousy pettiness or virtue signaling in the course of all of this sturm and drang i posted the following on bluesky this generated a unnecessarily snarky response from afab boyfriend it s responses like these that seemingly come out of the social ether that occasionally bother me referring back to my general unease about social media i don t know this person and they clearly don t know me and yet it seems my comment struck a nerve that needed a pointed response and i get it i admit that in the past i too have sought out people i don t know to comment on how reprehensible i thought their opinions or positions were but tried to do so from a reasonable point of view and not to make it personal enough to hurt someone s feelings this comment was meant to be both condemning and personal but i decided to take the high road i followed that up with case closed afab boyfriend item five last week this happened my response was two things happened after i posted this two days later on sunday march 10th i fumbled my understanding of gmt time and eastern daylight time damn you again dst and as a result both juli and i logged onto the glasgow worldcon site three hours too late to nominate anything for this year s hugo awards for the first time in more than a decade even more ironically i began to hear from friends and acquaintances who openly stated that despite my recusal of future nominations in my speech at the chengdu hugo award ceremony and my public statement on march 8th people were still nominating me in the best fan writer category their reasons ranged from they viewed my win in chengdu as invalid and they wanted me to have another chance or that my works from 2023 were quite worthy of consideration i have to admit that the idea of being nominated again in light of what happened last year excites me but the other side of that coin brings feelings of despair do i actually deserve another nomination would i be depriving someone else of a nomination and what if i get that email in the next week or so am i allowed to change my mind my partner juli says that she will abide by and support any decision i make which is one of the many reasons why i love her so much the few friends i have asked about this dilemma all said i should take the nomination right now i have no idea what i should do watch this space readers
the russian military hackers who stole tens of thousands of sensitive democratic party documents in 2016 struggled to disseminate their bounty online at least until anti secrecy group wikileaks joined the effort according to a report released tuesday night the report prepared by analyzing data facebook provided to the senate intelligence committee found that the russian military hackers sought to publicize the documents as early as june 14 that year through a post on facebook that said check restricted documents leaked from hillary clinton s presidential campaign staff and provided a link to an online trove but despite the potentially explosive contents the post on the dcleaks page generated just 11 likes 17 shares and zero comments direct messages to american journalists made through a fictitious twitter persona called guccifer 2 0 generated a spate of news coverage soon after but that was modest compared to the deluge that came five weeks later on july 22 when wikileaks published the documents and tweeted a link to its 3 2 million followers advertisement the revelations from the stolen documents many of which were embarrassing emails showing party officials appearing to favor clinton over her rival for the presidential nomination sen bernie sanders soon spread widely enough to prompt the democratic chairwoman to resign on the eve of the party s national convention the hacking campaign s outreach efforts executed by the russian military intelligence agency known as the gru underscore how marrying stolen documents with sophisticated social media outreach can generate outsize results it also underscored the unwitting role american journalists played in a russian intelligence operation to interfere in a u s election tuesday s report called potemkin pages personas assessing gru online operations 2014 2019 is the latest that disinformation researchers have produced using data provided to the senate intelligence committee and gives the most complete account yet of the social media operations of the gru it was released by the stanford internet observatory with research manager renee diresta as the lead author diresta also has worked as part of the technical advisory group for the senate committee advertisement the report found that the gru in targeting the united states and other countries set up phony think tanks and news organizations created fake online personas and pushed racially divisive online messages through facebook pages it created including baltimore is everywhere and michael brown memorial then special counsel robert s mueller iii indicted 12 gru officers last year for their alleged role in seeking to disrupt the u s election one thing this report shows is that what happens on social media doesn t stay isolated to social media said sen mark r warner va the top democrat on the intelligence committee platforms like facebook can also serve as the launching pad for narratives that spread throughout the information ecosystem these big platforms need to do a better job of making sure they don t become tools for russian manipulation of american voters and responsible actors need to take serious stock of how they interact with rely on and amplify the information found on those platforms the committee s chairman sen richard burr r n c said this report helps us better understand how the gru conducts its information warfare operations it s clear that the foreign influence threat is persistent and evolving and we cannot flag in our collective effort to combat it advertisement many researchers who have studied russia s efforts to influence the 2016 presidential race have pointed to the publication of the democratic party documents as especially effective at disrupting the election which republican donald trump narrowly won such tactics called hack and leak by researchers are widely used highly effective and difficult to combat when used in democratic nations that respect press freedoms mueller s final report released publicly in april detailed the relationship between the gru operating through the fictitious persona guccifer 2 0 and wikileaks the anti secrecy group did not respond to requests for comment tuesday wikileaks founder and longtime public face julian assange who is in british custody and has been charged by u s officials for alleged violations of the espionage act long has denied that the group s source for the democratic party documents was russian military intelligence the indictments against assange are not related to the democratic party documents rather they concern a 2010 leak of u s government documents advertisement the gru operations mirrored to some degree the influence campaigns waged by the internet research agency ira the st petersburg based operation that was created by an ally of russian president vladimir putin but run more as a social media start up with civilian employees than a formal government operation while the gru excelled at hacking it was not nearly as good as the ira at building an online following and spreading messages share this article share we were stunned by what a failure it was said diresta maybe that s why the ira exists maybe there s a recognition that this is a different form of propaganda facebook said it has removed a number of accounts related to russian interference in the united states syria and ukraine we welcome independent analysis like the one by the stanford internet observatory that chronicles these campaigns that we investigated and removed in the past said nathaniel gleicher facebook s head of cybersecurity policy advertisement in addition to the document dump by wikileaks ahead of the democratic national convention wikileaks in october that year also published thousands of emails stolen from clinton campaign chairman john podesta sparking several news stories and the spread of lurid and demonstrably false conspiracy theories based loosely on remarks in the emails the ira used its twitter accounts to help push information from those documents and the ones wikileaks published in july according to previous research by clemson university professors darren linvill and patrick warren they found a dramatic surge of tweets 18 000 over a single 24 hour period from ira accounts on oct 6 2016 the day before wikileaks published the podesta emails the timing suggests some degree of coordination between the gru and the ira perhaps intended to spur online conversation to prepare for the document dump linvill an associate professor of communication said there may have been an explicit division of responsibility with the gru focused on hacking valuable targets while the ira mounted a guerrilla marketing campaign advertisement that takes sustained effort at persona building he said that s really effective but it s the kind of thing you are going to want grunts to do it s not really what the gru is built for camille francois a disinformation researcher who has studied the material that facebook provided to the senate intelligence committee said tuesday night that the data suggests that the gru and the ira may have worked together this set shows clearly that the gru and the ira focused on shared targets and objects such as the promotion of leaked material and the targeting of black activists communities this raises the urgency in understanding how exactly different russian entities engaged in information operations coordinated with one another said francois chief innovation officer for graphika a network analysis firm based in new york that studies online disinformation the gru was comparatively successful at what the stanford report calls narrative laundering meaning the spreading of disinformation through phony think tanks or news sites or by using fictitious personas to post content mimicking actual news reports one well chronicled fake journalistic persona sometimes going by alice donovan wrote for a number of sites including the inside syria media center which was a gru creation as well advertisement like the ira the gru also worked across tech platforms the inside syria news center for example operated on facebook twitter and youtube and had a channel on the encrypted communication service telegram another phony persona sophia mangal who was listed as an editor for the inside syria media center had accounts on medium quora and twitter

you could tell from thirty miles out that this was not a day like all others northern virginia traffic is notoriously awful i once derailed joe sobran s bitter complaints about it in his see no evil in immigration days by pointing out that sprawl is a direct result of immigration driven population growth but in the rainy early morning i 66 was eerily empty quite obviously even civilian commuters were staying home on inauguration day our native guide who had been planning a complicated route involving parking at a far metro stop grew increasingly optimistic we finished up driving all the way to roslyn the edge of the heart of the district where we found parking easily and took a cab to capitol hill there the reason for the eerie emptiness became immediately apparent there had been a military coup the streets swarmed with uniformed men and women looking ridiculous as usual but still carrying guns it was extremely difficult to get around humvees concrete blocks and high wire fences had sprung up everywhere there was an unmistakable feeling of curfew intensified by fact that as you got closer everyone seemed to be hurrying intently in the same direction as if trying to get home before the blackout they were trump supporters cheerful but orderly and quiet headed for the mall as it happened vdare com senior management had this odd but usefully traffic clearing experience in another great american city a few months earlier an empty cleveland when donald j trump accepted the gop nomination but in cleveland there were no riots it s a mark of the left s intensifying assault that in d c despite this intense lockdown there were still riots and some 230 arrests it s exactly 36 years since i last attended an inauguration ronald reagan s first and i had vowed never to do it again my first wife was so outraged that our recently joint but still pitiful finances had been so humiliatingly ripped off by what turned out to be the impossible mob scene at the inaugural ball for which i had purchased tickets that for a while i feared for our new marriage anyone know if the official balls were better this year but although living at that time in a washington that was the ground zero in the cold war that was then very far from won i recall nothing like this omnipresent and oppressive security this puts the msm meme about empty stands opposite the white house at the parade into perspective friends who attended the swearing in and had tickets to the parade told us that after a long wait in an unmoving line for another security check they simply gave up and went off in search of lunch odd that no journalist mentioned this obvious point but jared taylor reports that arrangements for the press worked much more smoothly so maybe they didn t notice what it comes down to is this in order to inaugurate a president who was the clear choice of the founding stock of the historic american nation 63 of white males and 53 of white women voted for trump the capital of the republic they created must be turned into an armed camp under these threatening circumstances it surprises me that anyone came to the inauguration at all but they did in their hundreds of thousands from the heartland nice patriot families with children like the ones who attended trump s great rallies even after leftists mobbed and shut down trump s chicago rally in march disavowed by precisely no one among the main stream media the democratic party where distinguishable or even trump s fellow gop contenders they were overwhelmingly white although not exclusively lydia who had a better inauguration ceremony ticket than i did found herself in a cheering section of sikhs but they were nice here s the fashionable liberal site vox amazed to meet ordinary americans these nice guy trump supporters were the real story at the inauguration by jeff stein and zachary crockett january 21 2017 but niceness of course is not enough greg jones adorned in a confederate flag cowboy hat and american flag boots says he was swayed by trump s promise to restore manufacturing jobs after watching trump get inaugurated he hangs around at union station hoping to strike up friendly debates with protesters they see my hat and tell me to go to hell he says just come talk to me give me a damn chance you ll see i m a nice guy capable of engaging in a conversation jones from daytona beach florida came to dc for the first time in his life to support trump i used to work on trains as a factory worker he says leaning up against a railing i m a simple guy i have a family to feed as hundreds of protesters marched by the seating area of the train jones said he d been trying to talk with someone the whole time nobody had stopped for more than 30 seconds emphases added to all quotes of course nobody stopped to talk because the left does not want to talk it wants to triumph trump s inauguration was the first physical confrontation in america s coming civil war it did not amount to a manassas which we drove past on our way into washington now overwhelmed by northern virginia immigrant sprawl it did not even amount to a harper s ferry no one was actually killed but that s just a matter of time look at this video of the assault on richard spencer with whom we ve had our differences but for god s sake and note the apparent approval of the new york times and the left twittosphere attack on alt right leader has internet asking is it o k to punch a nazi by liam stack nyt january 21 2017 typically the dc police apparently told the press that they had received no complaint and therefore were not investigating the incident spencer has now filed a report if the incoming trump administration is behind the federal prosecutor s apparent intention to charge rioters with felony rioting i e go for exemplary sentencing that all by itself justifies the 2016 election and look at these randomly selected incidents lauren southern being pushed around here the protesters who threw red paint on pollster frank luntz and called him a fascist motherf cker in the lobby of the marquis and even on an apparently trivial interpersonal level i agree with luntz hese protests are out of control the language is out of control there are 8 9 10 year olds watching this they read these horrible words from these signs and to have to face this personally you can see that i get choked up i never thought this would be america i never thought this would happen in this country i think they want to prove that they can be as loud and as obnoxious and in your face as possible i think they want to try to intimidate the trump administration but the thing that bothers me the most is there is no unity we re not going to cure these divisions they are just going to go on not just for months but probably for years i really think we are not seeing the end but the beginning of this violent action in this country luntz i was called a fascist glitter thrown in my face i never thought this would happen in this country realclearpolitics january 22 2017 immigration has produced a situation where we have two nations warring in the bosom of a single state there s america on the one hand and anti america on the other hillary clinton s 2016 electoral coalition was barely half white subtracting jews and homosexuals maybe 3 4 each trump appears to have lost jews by about 70 and homosexuals by 70 despite having jewish grandchildren and despite pandering to gay marriage less than half the democratic party vote at the presidential level is what might be called generic americans the leaders of what i have called the nation of anti america have always been absolutely conscious that there is still time for the historic nation of america to unite to throw off what from a demographic point of view is undeniably a minority occupation government and to stop its electing a new people through immigration policy and they are absolutely determined to prevent the historic nation of america from uniting by any means necessary but to their horror it seems to be happening anyway hence their anti trump tantrum we re facing what was called in the case of the civil war an irrepressible conflict but this is america people have guns it will come to blood peter brimelow is the editor of vdare com his best selling book alien nation common sense about america s immigration

the transactions were executed prior to his involvement in deliberations on federal reserve actions to respond to the emergence of the coronavirus and not during a blackout period the selected funds were chosen with the prior approval of the board s ethics official the transactions are likely to further heighten scrutiny of the ethics rules and governance of the us central bank after two regional fed chiefs announced their departures following revelations about their trading activity last year one of the presidents eric rosengren of boston said his resignation was due to a serious health condition mr clarida a former executive at pacific investment management company was visiting faculty and students at yale university in connecticut on the day of the trading and not in his office in washington his calendar for the month shows a single phone call with a board member on february 27 at 4 45pm after the market close as well as numerous meetings with fed staff on previous days clear guidelines the fed spells out clear guidelines for trading activity by policymakers its voluntary guide to conduct for senior officials says they should carefully avoid engaging in any financial transaction the timing of which could create the appearance of acting on inside information concerning federal reserve deliberations and actions it also says that they should avoid dealings that might convey even an appearance of conflict between their personal interests the interests of the system and the public interest february 2020 was a time of extreme moves in financial markets as investors reacted to the threat of the global spread of covid 19 stocks fell steeply and bond markets were in a powerful rally advertisement that was not the appropriate time for top fed officials to be making multimillion dollar changes to their portfolios said andrew levin a dartmouth college professor and former special adviser to the fed s board the fed should welcome an external review of all financial transactions made by federal reserve board members last year the disclosure comes as resistance to the potential renomination of mr powell has intensified with senator elizabeth warren becoming the first senator to publicly oppose him and many progressive groups pushing for some alternative leader at the fed mr powell receives generally high marks from economists and wall street for his actions in steering the economy through the pandemic recession but he has come under fire from some progressive groups around issues that are traditionally not major points of contention when the fed s leadership is considered such as financial regulation or have never come up before such as climate change one alternative is lael brainard a fed governor who has repeatedly cast dissenting votes on mr powell s rule changes who could be appointed either to the fed s top regulatory post which becomes vacant on october 13 or to succeed mr powell ms brainard is also the leading alternative to mr powell among progressive democrats because of her support for tighter banking rules and for greater action on climate change she would also continue mr powell s low interest rate policies and as a member of the fed s board of governors for seven years her appointment would be seen as unlikely to disrupt financial markets with ap bloomberg

in his speech celebrating the chinese communist party s 100th anniversary last week chairman xi jinping proclaimed that china has never bullied or oppressed the people of any other country yet that is exactly what beijing is doing to taiwan and its intensifying aggression toward the democratic island is increasingly raising concerns that it will try to take it by force the question is not whether the united states should defend taiwan during war but how to prevent war in the first place now is the time to strengthen u s taiwan security cooperation for years world leaders have been hesitant to respond to china s military aggression in the region but beijing s escalating rhetoric and military developments are pushing washington and its allies to work together in ways never done before such as the joint u s japanese military planning for a conflict with china over taiwan just monday japanese deputy prime minister taro aso declared that in the case of an attack on taiwan japan and the u s must defend taiwan together unifying taiwan by force as a chinese policy has existed since chairman mao zedong coined the term though the onset of the korean war spared taiwan such a fate at that time china s unfulfilled aspirations continue to haunt the communist party in recent years xi has tied the annexation of taiwan which split from the chinese mainland amid civil war in 1949 to his china dream for the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation in the eyes of communist party elites unifying taiwan is the final piece in making china great again the communist party now controls the most powerful military in asia the people s liberation army and beijing s increasing sense of urgency to annex taiwan is evident in major changes to its military posture beijing understands that the united states is the most significant obstacle to its conquest of taiwan and has transformed its force to specifically offset u s operational advantages in the pacific theater to this end the chinese military has developed anti ship ballistic missiles attack submarines and an array of air and naval platforms for conducting saturation attacks to overwhelm enemies all supported by space based systems that make it more integrated and lethal taken together china s emergence as a near peer military competitor to the united states represents the single greatest strategic challenge facing washington the pace and intensity of china s military modernization seem to have caught american leaders by surprise this is perhaps less due to beijing s mastery at concealing its efforts and more to washington s complacent neglect of the communist party s ambitious pursuit of national rejuvenation as a means to challenge the american led post cold war world order in this environment it is impossible to accurately predict when china might attempt a full scale invasion of taiwan given the complexities involved even xi may not have a definitive timeline however the existence of a significant military imbalance between china and taiwan with the far more powerful side intent on bringing the other under political domination increases the possibility and temptation for war what is certain is that the communist party is already taking action against taiwan for years it has carried out deliberate and incremental military provocations below the threshold of armed conflict with the objective of compressing the space in which taiwan s military can operate while intimidating its people these operations have created significant challenges for taiwanese leaders who must carefully calibrate their responses according to the level of ambiguity and varying severity such subconflict operations known as gray zone aggression include frequent airspace incursions by people s liberation army fighter aircraft shows of force by chinese warships around taiwan cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns designed to demoralize taiwan s society and undermine popular support for the government in taipei soon it s conceivable we ll see escalation short of all out war the exchange of fire between chinese and taiwanese forces small scale missile attacks and chinese seizure of taiwan s outer islands are all possible if xi s bid for a third term at the chinese communist party s 20th party congress in 2022 should fumble due to internal opposition taking military action against taiwan could validate his credentials as both a champion of china s great rise and a strong leader who can stand up to america s so called hegemonic forces all out war however is unlikely to occur in the near future as the people s liberation army still needs to address significant operational issues to mount an amphibious invasion of taiwan but the communist party has proclaimed that the military will be a fully modernized force by 2027 which could be when china perceives a window of opportunity for a full scale invasion of taiwan factors that could tempt beijing to such military adventurism include diminished u s deterrence and continued failure by taiwan to implement critical military reforms deterring this potential conflict requires the united states and taiwan to create uncertainty in the minds of chinese government elites while credibly demonstrating the ability to impose unacceptable costs if beijing should choose conflict this means taiwan must rapidly strengthen near term combat capabilities and defense readiness based on asymmetric warfare this could be accomplished by fully implementing and institutionalizing the force modernization priorities prescribed by taiwan s overall defense concept which the u s government has strongly endorsed as it would effectively allocate taiwan s limited resources on systems that directly improve its defense strategy the odc aims to maximize taiwan s combat power to survive a chinese attack disrupt chinese operational flow and deny its military mission effectiveness taiwan s defense acquisition should be focused on systems that are cost effective affordable in large numbers mobile survivable and lethal the united states for its part should prioritize taiwan s defense readiness and work with taipei to expeditiously reform and implement its defense strategy while streamlining its acquisition system through establishing a u s taiwan joint working group that focuses on implementing the odc moreover the u s should position stocks of munitions spare parts and other key defense equipment that could directly improve taiwan s war readiness this would also demonstrate u s commitment and political will congress could model this initiative on the war reserve stocks for allies program that it maintains with israel the united states should also prioritize capability building among allies and u s forces who can work together to target critical people s liberation army vulnerabilities in a taiwan contingency together they must develop the means to disrupt deny degrade destroy or deceive the chinese military s assets thus preventing it from achieving military success against taiwan doing so would greatly enhance credible deterrence and that could prevent war the threat of chinese military aggression is no longer hypothetical gray zone operations have already begun should the communist party s aggression continue to escalate an all out attack on taiwan could become likely with economic and military consequences that would shake the world the question is not whether the united states should defend taiwan during war but how to prevent war in the first place now is the time to strengthen u s taiwan security cooperation to ensure peace in the taiwan strait
the journalist who quit her job at bloomberg and left her husband because she had fallen in love with pharma bro martin shkreli only for him to dump her from prison has admitted that if he manipulated me i m glad it worked christie smythe who broke the story of shkreli s arrest for securities fraud back in 2015 penned an op ed for the new york post where she confessed she has a thing for complicated guys but branded the idea she was manipulated by the convicted fraudster ridiculous in the end if it was all a manipulation getting me to take charge of my life and write the narrative for myself i m glad it worked she said smythe 39 who described herself as happily divorced and no longer working in legacy media also confirmed she and shkreli 38 are no longer romantically involved however she insisted they are still friends and that a lifelong friendship seems probable when he is released from prison the journalist who quit her job at bloomberg and left her husband because she had fallen in love with pharma bro martin shkreli has admitted that if he manipulated me i m glad it worked pictured shkreli and christie smythe shkreli became known as the most hated man in america after he bought up the rights to lifesaving aids drug daraprim in 2014 and raised the price from 13 50 per pill to a staggering 750 per pill in 2018 he was sentenced to seven years in prison on an unrelated matter for lying to investors about the performance of two hedge funds he ran withdrawing more money from those funds than he was entitled to get and defrauding investors in a drug company retrophin by hiding his ownership of some of its stock smythe hit headlines in december when she announced in a bombshell interview with elle that she had fallen in love with shkreli while reporting on his white collar crimes as a journalist she quit her job left her husband and froze her eggs to be able to have a family with shkreli on his release but her public disclosure of their love affair appeared to anger her jailhouse lover who refused to speak to her and released a cutting statement saying he wishes her well the couple later reconciled though smythe said they are now just friends and critics have long assumed the journalist was another victim of the master manipulator s ways smythe pushed back at the suggestion she had been manipulated by shkreli in her op ed mocking the idea he has magical coercive powers by far the most ridiculous notion people seemed to settle on was that i was somehow manipulated by martin into leaving my job and my husband for him as though a guy who couldn t avoid being a walking pr trainwreck had magical coercive powers she wrote first things first he does not shkreli branded the idea she was manipulated by the convicted fraudster by far the most ridiculous notion mocking that he does not magical coercive powers smythe also confirmed she and shkreli 38 pictured arriving at court in 2017 are no longer romantically involved smythe admitted that the convict can be manipulative but insisted unlike his previous girlfriends she is not really interested in free jimmy choos and handbags there is certainly truth to stories that martin can be manipulative she wrote he s highly intelligent having taught himself biology and chemistry among other technical subjects and can be highly entertaining and affable in conversation when he s with someone he likes like most other human beings he knows how to turn on his charm to get something he wants smythe continued while researching my book i spoke to a number of his former girlfriends and learned how he plied them with things like jewels and expensive shoes trips and other goodies to win their favor i m not really interested in free jimmy choos and handbags though nor am i interested in transparently manipulative behavior rather than showering her with gifts smythe claimed shkreli won my favor by showing her respect for my intellect and my abilities if there was anything at all that martin did to win my favor it was offering a gift of a very different sort one that is infinitely more valuable to me he showed respect for my intellect and my abilities she wrote from the beginning of our interactions i felt as though we genuinely connected he asked for my opinion on significant matters and seemed to take to heart many things i said smythe is pictured with her ex husband she hit headlines in december when she announced she had fallen in love with shkreli quit her job at bloomberg left her husband and frozen her eggs smythe said it was shkreli who first encouraged her to write a book she listened and took leave from bloomberg to write a book on shkreli smythe claimed she was concerned in the beginning that his flattering behavior was some sort of ploy but after spending hours together during prison visits she realized our investment in each other was real and they started to seep into each other their relationship soon started making her think more confidently about myself and and more self assured about creating my own destiny she realized she wasn t satisfied with her marriage or her job and quit both she said rather than being the sign of someone under a manipulative spell smythe insisted her decision to then go public with their romance was something she did for herself because she was tired of hiding she also knew she wrote that shkreli would be unhappy with the move when i went public in elle i knew martin wouldn t be pleased the idea of splattering a personal relationship across the pages of a magazine horrified him she wrote shkreli became known as the most hated man in america after he bought up the rights to lifesaving aids drug daraprim in 2014 and raised the price from 13 50 to 750 per pill shkreli being arrested in 2015 on charges of securities fraud he is scheduled for release in october 2022 after serving his seven year prison sentence but even his feelings in that moment took a back seat for me when it came to deciding what i wanted smythe said she is now happy and living in a nicer apartment in harlem and working for a startup called thinknum i m now happily divorced happily no longer working in legacy media and happily still friends with although no longer the girlfriend of martin shkreli she wrote she said she hopes their relationship will continue when he leaves prison but admitted she doesn t think it could become romantic again i don t know what will happen when martin gets out of prison it is my hope that he takes to heart some of the things we talked about and makes an earnest effort to apply himself to something good she wrote i do not imagine we would be together in a romantic sense but a lifelong friendship seems probable shkreli is scheduled for release in october 2022 after serving his seven year prison sentence at the time of his 2015 arrest for lying to investors shkreli was already notorious for hiking the price of daraprim by 500 percent daraprim is used to treat toxoplasmosis a parasitic infection that can be fatal to people with the aids virus or other immune system disorders including malaria and cancer he was also known for attacking critics on social media under the guise of pharma bro and of putting a 5 000 bounty on a strand of hillary clinton s hair

all of us would complain how our government in its crooked ways made sure that malta s households will pay through their nose for years to come for natural gas priced at what seemed like three times market rates for a generation as it looks with a natural gas crisis in europe and globally intensifying we all in malta may end up paying less this winter that anyone else if nothing shady comes our way that is for azerbaijan to stick to its well pampered commitment we would need to know the small print of a contract which in many ways was structured by good old corruption in the case of electrogas with kaleidoscopic diversity so fingers crossed that we won t end up like great britain already set for a cold frugal christmas the picture in the uk grimmer than anywhere else in europe for the moment is nevertheless exemplary for a dire situation caused by multiple factors gas prices have globally risen sharply this year 300 per cent in case of the uk and storage tanks all over europe remain depleted since last winter s prolonged cold period in many ways it shows the dangers of a purely market based approach with little regard to energy security in the uk natural gas is not only used to heat households but like malta to generate a large portion of its electricity to protect households thus double dependent on gas and exposed to oligopolistic abuse the uk has tried since 2016 to stimulate price competition by allowing start ups to compete with the large incumbents like bg eon or edf these behemoths were accused of milking consumers by charging higher prices when the spot markets went up while giving back very little when wholesale prices dropped the new entrants were quickly gaining market share by offering cheaper gas when times were good to make sure that they were not accumulating customers by a loss leader strategy to raise prices later market regulator ofgem dictated firm price caps with wholesale prices now far exceeding capped consumer contracts these small disrupter companies die like mayflies yet another government intervention is under way to save the consumer from the dysfunction the government has created itself the once vilified majors are asked cap in hand to please provide for all those millions of misled unprofitable customers offering taxpayers money and tariff leniency greece france and italy their consumers suffering unregulated hence inhumane price hikes want to pick up the energy bill for poorer households spain and portugal plan to force price caps on their energy providers and to impose windfall taxes expensive gas is setting off a terrible chain reaction in the uk already cf industries one of the world s biggest fertiliser producers with large manufacturing facilities in the uk is throttling production of artificial manure to better cope with its now too costly feedstock natural gas its by product co2 needed as a coolant for nuclear plants and the production of dry ice is in the uk almost exclusively supplied by cf in normal times satisfying 60 per cent of the uk market the sudden dearth of co2 is now negatively impacting everything from fizzy drinks to frozen food from slaughterhouses and chicken farms animals are doused with co2 to bakery products uk consumers are not only facing a winter of heating poverty but meat shortages too a deficit exacerbated by labour shortages the christmas turkey has just gained another lease of life into the new year when excess animals will have to be culled the us is scolding europe today for having done too little to care for its gas supplies andreas weitzer in the wake of covid related supply disruptions see my piece on loo roll economics from last month a perfect storm is gathering strength worried by ever increasing transport bottlenecks and rapidly emptying gas buffer storage in europe asian countries like japan and china are aggressively bidding up lng spot prices spare capacities are predominantly directed to asia these days bypassing europe at the same time norway europe s biggest producer of natural gas is carrying out maintenance works of its infrastructure and the uk having largely depleted its own north sea resources has nowhere to turn to to add insult to injury wind power is slacking with wind intensities lower than at any time since the 1960s in addition the main electricity cable connecting france with the uk burnt through and needs repair the situation in germany is equally worrying with spot prices for gas even higher than in the uk and storage dangerously low the german green party adamantly opposing nuclear power and coal has long treated gas as the biggest evildoer denying it any role as a bridge towards carbon neutrality the greens were opposing any increase of russian gas transport capacity to europe even more fiercely than the us which for years had opposed and embargoed the nordstream 2 pipeline devised to double the capacity of nordstream 1 between russia and germany while the german greens were opposing gas in principle the us initially very keen to export their own overflow of fracking derived lng emphasised geopolitical risk canting about europe s dangerously increased dependency on russian gas this was of course poppycock as in an interdependent global energy market everyone sits in the same boat as exemplified by today s crisis true to form the us is scolding europe today for having done too little to care for its gas supplies and is accusing russia of holding back urgently needed additional supplies the us alas has temporarily lost all interest to supply lng to europe after lean years and many bankruptcies later american shale gas producers are starved of capital and credit and are unwilling and incapable to increase production meaningfully russian officials gleefully point out that while they were accurately fulfilling all existing contracts with european energy buyers it was not their fault that planned increases of pipeline capacity was embargoed for so long the truth is more likely to be the vastly improved transport capacity towards china which is paying more and happy to have outmanoeuvred europe with the help of the us america after all has done everything possible to forge an ever closer cooperation between putin and china overcoming traditional antipathy gasprom is all the happier for this gasprom s sudden boost in profitability and geopolitical prominence has seen its share price rising beyond all expectations riding a momentum created by narrative obsessed retail investors and professionals who bet on them personally i am quite vexed by this having bought gasprom shares at the nadir of the great financial crisis for as little as six dollars per piece for more than a decade i suffered a slow motion loss gasprom has been selling for years into a weak market and was prone to theft and costly plunders yet shortly before the market crash in march 2020 my shares suddenly doubled i felt vindicated with covid came the stock market crash and the next meltdown of energy prices gasprom shares tanked again i lost my nerve and sold all my adrs in may at par glad to have avoided a loss today alas i would sit on a 50 per cent profit the purpose of this column is to broaden readers general financial knowledge and it should not be interpreted as presenting investment advice or advice on the buying and

district for elong the problem is urgent two fridges were destroyed by power outages this year it s among the many logistical issues facing health officials as they expand covid 19 vaccination into rural areas with the arrival of substantial doses in the previously vaccine starved nation gulu home to 325 000 people has given out about 9 000 doses with only 2 795 people fully vaccinated the district had 30 astrazeneca doses and 300 chinese made sinovac ones as of sept 23 an artificial shortage in a country with a growing vaccine stock of millions of doses in recent days uganda has received more than 2 2 million doses including pfizer and moderna from the united states as well as 985 000 astrazeneca shots from france belgium and ireland a total of 11 978 840 doses donations and purchases via the african union are expected in uganda by december president yoweri museveni said last week but uganda s central storage facility near the capital kampala can only hold 5 million doses of the pfizer vaccines requiring ultra low temperatures and some rural areas like gulu aren t equipped to handle either the pfizer or moderna shots as supply grows officials are trying to whip up

while some african countries such as rwanda and zimbabwe are doing well in rolling out vaccines others like uganda are struggling and the agency will be looking to community and religious leaders for help health systems in africa are among the poorest in the world plagued by chronic shortages of essential supplies corruption and an unmotivated workforce in nigeria africa s most populous nation those challenges are exacerbated by insecurity with vaccine distribution in rural areas especially in the country s volatile north crippled by the threat of violence only 3 of nigeria s 200 million people have received their first dose in uganda an east african nation of 44 million authorities have ramped up vaccination in the kampala area but efforts have largely stalled in rural districts such as gulu hampered by hesitancy as well as refrigeration and other distribution problems museveni said last week that officials face dismissal in rural areas which now account for most of the country s 268 covid 19 hospitalizations if vaccines expire under their watch we are literally dancing around said dr misaki wayengera head of a committee advising uganda s pandemic response speaking of the slow vaccine rollout the government rations doses to districts based on demand expectations and supplies aren t replenished until officials account for doses they previously received as a result shortages stemming from delays in reporting back vaccination data can occur the demand is there said dr kenneth canna but right now what is bogging us down is availability of the vaccine both in the urban setting and in the rural setting associated press journalists reached a remote area of gulu where a health center without running water had the district s last supply of 30 astrazeneca doses because a vial contains seven doses that must be accounted for vaccines aren t distributed until seven people are in line so people come and go without a getting a jab you can t open the vial when the people are few if people are few you will be wasting the vaccine said okello labedo a clinical officer in charge of the awach health center speaking through a frayed mask the turnout among the elderly is very poor i think it is because of the distance amos okello a farmer who had waited several hours under a mango tree expressed disappointment he would be going home without a shot after traveling many kilometers on a rented bike they said if you come alone you cannot get the vaccine okello said i can t go and force someone from his home to come here and get the vaccine while it s important for me to get the vaccine tomorrow i might not be able to come back he added patrick okot a commodities trader in gulu who received his first astrazeneca shot in may said he considered traveling to another district for the second one but is discouraged by the cost you might go there and you find that they also don t have vaccines he said uganda s goal is to vaccinate 4 8 million of its most vulnerable people including those age 50 and above but so far 348 000 are fully vaccinated according to official figures and only 37 of the country s 150 000 health care workers are fully vaccinated highlighting

pursuing a regulatory crackdown while markets remain on edge as china evergrande group struggles to survive fuel and food costs are soaring worldwide combining with congested ports and strained supply chains to elevate price pressures labor shortages continue to plague some employers although the expansion seems intact such a backdrop is fanning fears of a mix of weaker growth and faster inflation to come threatening to complicate nascent efforts by central banks to dial back stimulus without rattling markets expectations of a swift exit from the pandemic were always misplaced said frederic neumann co head of asian economic research at hsbc holdings plc in hong kong full recovery will be measured in years not quarters here s a breakdown of the major risks china crunched china s energy travails have forced manufacturers to curb production and prompted economists to cut their growth forecasts bloomberg economics expects the power shortages to have the biggest hit to expansion since a

guangdong jiangsu shandong zhejiang and henan in a sign of what s to come factory activity contracted in september for the first time since the pandemic began that s compounding a drag from the crisis

harvest season from corn to soy to peanuts and cotton over the past year beijing imported a record amount of agricultural products due to a domestic shortage driving prices and global food costs to multiyear highs a united nations index is up 33 over the past 12 months at the same time some gas coal carbon and electricity benchmarks are hitting records the price of oil passed 80 a barrel for the

as a locomotive for the global recovery while president joe biden swerved a disruptive shutdown of the federal government for now through a stopgap funding bill fractured talks continue on his 4 trillion economic agenda with deep divisions among his democrats on the way forward compromise on the shutdown came after treasury secretary janet yellen warned that her department will effectively run out of cash around oct 18 unless congress suspends or increases the federal debt limit failure to do so would trigger both a recession and financial crisis yellen said globally fiscal policy support is set to slow into 2022 after governments ran up the biggest debts since the 1970s biden and yellen must also decide whether to hand a second term to federal reserve chairman jerome powell a decision which could also roil markets for powell and his international counterparts the combination of slowing growth and stubborn inflation is a challenge friday alone saw news of the fastest euro area inflation in 13 years and a u s gauge rose the most on an annual basis since 1991 for now powell and european central bank president christine lagarde are voicing cautious optimism that inflation will ease but economists are asking at what point transitory becomes more persistent and that makes plans to reduce bond purchases or raise interest rates a risky proposition many latin american central banks and some in eastern europe have already hiked borrowing costs norway just became the first developed nation to do so and the fed is signaling it will pare its bond buying program as soon

groups like jemaah islamiyah were already carrying out attacks in southeast asia when 9 11 happened an attack of an altogether larger scale medan indonesia ali imron one of the perpetrators of the deadly bombings on the indonesian island of bali in 2002 says the first he saw of the attacks on the world trade center wtc and the pentagon on september 11 2001 was on the front page of his local newspaper our family didn t have a television at the time imron told al jazeera the 52 year old was sentenced to life in prison for his role in planning the bali bombings that killed more than 200 people many of them foreign tourists but i immediately guessed this was jihad from our friends twenty years ago imron was a member of jemaah islamiyah ji a hardline group founded in 1993 in indonesia which still counts more than 1 600 active members according to the indonesian authorities ji has historically been linked to al qaeda which claimed responsibility for september 11 and was headed by osama bin laden the attacks on 9 11 when al qaeda members hijacked four commercial planes and crashed them into the world trade center and the pentagon echoed throughout the world more than 2 500 people from 90 countries were killed and analysts say the event had a direct impact on the development of violent hardline networks in southeast asia some of which were already working with al qaeda 9 11 happened at a time when abdullah sungkar the founder of jemaah islamiyah the largest militant network in the region had died two years before and abu bakar bashir was letting hambali collaborate with al qaeda on attacks against western targets but this split jemaah islamiyah because it went against sungkar s approach of patiently building the strength to take down the soeharto regime quinton temby an assistant professor in public policy at monash university indonesia told al jazeera jemaah islamiyah was never an affiliate much less a franchise of al qaeda but it was a key al qaeda ally in the rise of global jihad jemaah islamiyah provided logistical support for some of the 9 11 hijackers in malaysia he said nawaf al hazmi and khalid al mihdhar who were on the plane that crashed into the pentagon passed through malaysia en route to the united states it is thought that they met senior indonesian ji figures including encep nurjaman alias hambali who is now facing a military commission at guantanamo bay on a slew of terrorism related charges after 18 years in us custody a senate select committee on intelligence report released in 2014 also known as the torture report alleged that hambali transferred funds to french national zacarias moussaoui to enrol in flight school in the us to train as a potential hijacker before 9 11 moussaoui would later be sentenced to life in prison after he was arrested in august 2001 and pleaded guilty to conspiring to kill citizens of the us on september 11 the small number of southeast asian militants working closely with al qaeda were emboldened by 9 11 but few knew about the plot in advance and most were shocked by how successful it was temby said in the years that followed members of ji and al qaeda continued to support each other temby added with al qaeda providing funds for attacks in southeast asia such as the bali bombings turning point while imron was one of the members of jemaah islamiyah who claims he did not know about plans for 9 11 he told al jazeera that the group found inspiration in the attacks even going as far as planning the bali bombings as a kind of tribute i still remember it he said imam samudra wanted to carry out the bali bombing on september 11 to commemorate the anniversary of the world trade center attack but there wasn t enough time the bombing finally took place on october 12 with the attackers targeting the busy bars of kuta imron added that the original plan had been to attack naval ships in singapore s port but they switched their attention to bali after seeing the scale of 9 11 senior members like hambali also agreed with controversial pronouncements from bin laden that sought to justify the killings of common people in addition to military targets imron says he and other members of his group showed clips of the wtc attacks as well as video messages from the perpetrators which had been released online and widely broadcast to the two bombers who went on to detonate suicide vests in the sari club and paddy s pub we played the videos to them for several days before the bali bombings imron told al jazeera the suicide bombers weren t scared but the videos of the 9 11 attacks gave them a boost imam samudra a senior member of ji and two of imron s brothers mukhlas and amrozi were executed in indonesia in 2009 for their roles in masterminding the attacks in bali imron got a life sentence after he expressed remorse and apologised during his trial noor huda ismail a former member of the muslim hardline group darul islam told al jazeera before the 20th anniversary of the september 11 attacks that it was the bali attacks that were a turning point in his life after he discovered his former roommate was involved bomb maker mubarok who had shared a room with ismail at islamic boarding school had made some of the explosive devices used in the attacks and was sentenced to life imprisonment along with imron in 2003 ismail who says he asked himself how his old roommate could have chosen the path that he did founded the institute for international peace building and runs deradicalisation programmes and workshops in indonesia and monitors hardline group threats across the region the attacks of september 11 have strongly shaped the evolution of the global security threat landscape in southeast asia he said ismail says in the last 20 years groups such as al qaeda and isil isis have established their networks against the background of local conflicts and operated clandestinely within various southeast asian countries recruiting local actors to carry out their aims and objectives through the utilisation of terror demonstrated on 9 11 according to judith jacob a senior analyst at protection group international it is necessary to look backwards as well as forwards to understand the true extent of the event s impact even before 9 11 ji had been carrying out attacks on september 14 2000 the group bombed the jakarta stock exchange killing 15 people later in the year it conducted a series of coordinated bombings at churches on christmas eve killing 18 people there was also violence in the philippines such as the rizal day attacks on december 30 2000 in which 22 people died coordinated bombings in manila regular skirmishes with security forces in the south market bombings and kidnappings in april 2000 abu sayyaf previously thought of more as thuggish bandits snatched 21 people from the malaysian diving island of sipadan half of them foreign tourists holding them for ransom on jolo in the philippines and sparking a months long hostage crisis jolo remains one of the most dangerous places in the region and abu sayyaf has now affiliated itself with isil september 11 was definitely inspiring to southeast asian militants thanks to the scale of the devastation and the audacity of the attack said jacob but they did not need to be emboldened
