new york ap wall street capped a turbulent week of trading friday with a broad rally for stocks as relief flowed through the market even as deadly attacks raged in ukraine oil fell and investors turned away from gold and other traditional havens they favor when fear is high the s p 500 climbed 2 2 and notched its first weekly gain in three weeks the benchmark index was following up on a wild thursday when it careened from a 2 6 loss to a gain of 1 5 stocks have swung sharply with uncertainty about how much russia s invasion will push up inflation particularly oil and natural gas prices and drag on the global economy such big swings are likely to continue with so much uncertainty not only about ukraine but also about interest rates the federal reserve is caught in a delicate dance where it has to raise interest rates enough to rein in high inflation but not so much as to cause a recession on friday at least the mood was calmer a measure of fear on wall street which shows how worried traders are about upcoming swings in stock prices fell 9 gold dropped 2 after rallying for weeks on worries about russia and ukraine treasury yields held relatively steady signaling investors weren t scrambling for safety as they had immediately after russia s invasion the market acts emotionally when these things happen because it is so difficult to model said mark hackett chief of investment research at nationwide a u s government report showed that that inflation last month was roughly in line with economists expectations though it was still high it also showed the main engine of the u s economy spending by consumers strengthened by more than economists expected brand connections lost in a lot of focus on russia the federal reserve and inflation is the fact that the economy is in a fairly strong position hackett said the economic reports could be enough to convince the federal reserve to hold off on raising short term rates next month by double its usual increase at least for now said brian jacobsen senior investment strategist at allspring global investments that s something some fed officials had suggested and it s something investors usually fear because higher rates put downward pressure on all kinds of investments whatever size it is the rate increase would be the first since 2018 all the renewed calm in global financial markets though was against the backdrop of russia pressing its invasion of ukraine to the outskirts of the capital friday after unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases and sending in troops and tanks from three sides in what amounts to the largest ground conflict in europe since world war ii still investors may have been encouraged by looking at how past geopolitical crises including wars have affected the stock market generally stocks are initially put under pressure before conflict breaks out but then they tend to recover between three and six months later said zachary hill head of portfolio management at horizon investments hill said the turning point for the market this week came as investors judged the u s sanctions on russia to be less severe than expected the sanctions were not as bad as feared he said the s p 500 rose 95 95 points to 4 384 65 the dow jones industrial average rose 834 92 points or 2 5 to 34 058 75 the nasdaq composite gained 221 04 points or 1 6 to 13 694 62 after swinging between modest gains and losses a day earlier it briefly fell more than 20 below its record high before roaring back suddenly smaller company stocks also notched gains the russell 2000 index rose 44 92 points or 2 3 to 2 040 923 prices for everything from stocks to bitcoin have been swinging sharply with the uncertainty about russia and ukraine but the market s brightest spotlight has perhaps been on oil and natural gas russia is one of the world s largest producers of both oil and gas and european consumers are particularly reliant on it oil prices fell on both sides of the atlantic a day after they briefly topped 100 per barrel amid worries that the conflict and upcoming sanctions could disrupt supplies benchmark u s crude slipped 1 3 to 91 59 per barrel brent crude the international standard fell 1 2 to 97 93 when announcing sanctions on russia that he described as tough on thursday president joe biden said that he will do everything in my power to limit the pain the american people are feeling at the gas pump that led to some relief that sanctions were not as severe as they could have been and the drop in oil prices helped to lift stocks we re not going to do anything which causes an unintended disruption to the flow of energy as the global economic recovery is still underway deputy national economic council director daleep singh said thursday stocks also rose across much of europe and asia friday recovering some of their sharp losses from immediately after russia s invasion london s ftse 100 gained 3 9 while france s cac 40 rose 3 6 and germany s dax rose 3 7 market players might be betting that the crisis could slow moves by central banks to cool inflation by raising interest rates and unwinding other support for pandemic burdened economies said ipek ozkardeskaya of swissquote bank sa but in reality it s about volatility high volatility that results from a high voltage environment ozkardeskaya wrote in a commentary it s impossible to tell what direction the market will take in the next five minutes ap business writer yuri kageyama contributed veiga reported from los angeles

pushed underinvested to get more invested but come next week it may be a different story if meetings with ukraine end with your choice is to step aside and let me put in new leaders nato may not like

difficult to control asthma in urban children which may be characterized by specific early life factors and patterns of nasal epithelial cell gene expression according to a speaker here james e gern md faaaai professor of pediatrics and medicine at university of wisconsin school of medicine and public health spoke at the american academy of allergy asthma immunology annual meeting to review the data that has been gathered thus far on where difficult to control asthma may originate in children living in urban environments source adobe stock characteristics phenotypes difficult to control asthma in urban children can be characterized by greater symptoms and exacerbations airway obstruction and highly expressed type 2 markers although there are also some low type 2 phenotypes in early life gern said he reviewed data from the asthma phenotypes in inner city children apic study which involved 619 children with asthma aged 6 to 17 years researchers defined difficult to control asthma as that that required at least 500 ¬µg fluticasone which comprised 41 of the cohort researchers from that study identified 44 variables in 12 domains that predicted difficult to control asthma with the most influential factors being demographics family allergy and asthma history allergen sensitization allergic inflammation rhinitis pulmonary physiology environmental exposure bmi stress and vitamin d also bronchodilator response and asthma control test were important distinguishing baseline characteristics between patients with difficult to control vs easy to control asthma with rhinitis medication and symptom scores also playing a role data from the apic study also revealed five clusters of different asthma phenotypes which differ based on indicators of asthma and rhinitis severity pulmonary physiology allergy sensitization and total serum ige and allergic inflammation gern highlighted two groupings that stood out in terms of asthma severity clusters b and e driven by increased nighttime symptoms and albuterol use with greater medication use to achieve control pulmonary physiology also appeared somewhat low in cluster b gern said but quite low in cluster e also rhinitis severity number of allergen sensitizations total serum ige blood eosinophil count all appeared to indicate greater allergen sensitization and allergic inflammation in cluster e early life factors to discuss how these phenotypes relate to early life environmental exposures gern reviewed data from the ureca study which involved 560 children black 72 hispanic 20 other 8 from allergic families living in urban neighborhoods with at least 20 of the residents living in poverty the researchers created six clusters of asthma differentiated by patterns of wheezing atopy and lung function the largest group 22 was defined by low wheeze and atopy and normal lung function other groups included those with transient wheeze low atopy and normal lung function 17 moderate wheeze low atopy and normal lung function 17 low wheeze high atopy and normal lung function 20 moderate wheeze high atopy and normal lung function 12 and high wheeze high atopy and obstructed lung function 12 the latter group had the most comorbidities including 82 with asthma 66 with chronic nasal symptoms at age 10 and 44 with any eczema as well as higher rates of inhaled and oral corticosteroids usage when researchers looked at environmental exposures they found two correlations gern said the first being that the moderate wheeze low atopy group had significantly higher maternal depression scores and maternal perceived stress score in the child s early life secondly the high wheeze high atopy and low lung function group showed lower exposure to common allergens including house dust cat dog mouse and cockroach allergens and higher exposure to ergosterol in house dust a mold marker it is interesting to think what the mechanisms might be to increase the probability of developing the moderate wheeze low atopy phenotype perhaps through endocrine or neurological mechanisms gern said but with this high wheeze high atopy low lung function group the decreased exposure to allergens and increased exposure to mold in the house suggest these might be important factors in developing immune responses as these children are growing epithelial cell gene expression researchers also used these groups from ureca to evaluate nasal epithelial cell gene expression using rna extraction and sequencing and they identified 26 modules of differentially expressed genes their network analysis of gene modules showed that several modules were overexpressed in the high wheeze high atopy low lung function group with an overall different pattern than what researchers observed for the moderate wheeze low atopy group the former group was defined by modules that included typical type 2 inflammatory pathways gern said such as epithelium response to il 13 muc5ac hypersecretion and leukotriene and lipid metabolism muc5ac hypersecretion was a really unique increase in the group with high wheeze high atopy and low lung function gern said conversely the moderate wheeze low atopy group had underexpression of antioxidant activity and epithelial integrity and leukocyte migration but an increase in injury response based on epithelial gene module expression we get some evidence that these phenotypes may actually be endotypes with increased expression of injury reduced expression of integrity and antioxidant activity in the moderate wheeze low atopy phenotype whereas the high wheeze atopy phenotype was associated with an increase in type 2 modules and muc5ac expression which could play a direct role in airway closure references

john kennedy capital bureau usa today network florida tallahassee gov ron desantis got what he wanted from the house redistricting committee friday which advanced congressional boundaries that eliminate a jacksonville to tallahassee district held by black democratic u s rep al lawson fellow republicans on the panel bowed to the governor s veiled threat that he d veto any map that kept the wide ranging 45 black north florida district in place instead the committee confined lawson s congressional district 5 to jacksonville s duval county and in doing so reduced the redrawn district s black voting population by 10 voters in democratic heavy tallahassee and leon county would be shifted fully into a redrawn republican leaning district held by u s rep neal dunn r panama city but chair tom leek r ormond beach acknowledged the risk that reducing cd 5 s black population could be rejected as a violation of state and federal law ultimately a court is going to have to decide that in a statement later friday lawson said he was disappointed that house leadership caved to the demands of ron desantis to push a partisan unconstitutional congressional map desantis demand hinting veto desantis pressures lawmakers to reduce black held congressional districts minority districts threatened democrats stand with al lawson in feud with desantis over wickedness in redistricting senate broke with desantis florida senate breaks with gov ron desantis on congressional redistricting map court won t give advice justices refuse to give desantis redistricting guidance he wants on district now held by black congressman two maps not one in an unusual move the panel wound up approving two maps a primary plan that confines lawson s seat in duval and a secondary proposal that would keep the general boundaries of the jacksonville to tallahassee district in place since 2015 the two map package s goal leek said is to have a back up plan in place if a state or federal court was to rule against the primary map on grounds that eliminating the jacksonville to tallahassee diminishes the ability of black voters in the region to elect a candidate of their choice diminishment is a legal conclusion leek said but he said that in his view reducing cd 5 s black voting population from 45 to 35 would not hamper minority voters ability to elect a preferred candidate a court though might not agree he suggested it is a serious legal question that we don t know the answer to the question leek said defending the two map approach we put forth a primary map and if that primary map is found to be unconstitutional then the secondary map kicks in but lawson was emphatic that never in our state s history has the florida legislature submitted two maps for review one that is clearly unconstitutional and a second in case we get caught map the proposed congressional district 5 divides minority communities of interest across north florida leaving all black voters west of jacksonville unrepresented he added in his statement following the civil war newly freed african americans remained in what is now the i 10 corridor where many of their descendants continue to reside and the desantis map den ies these communities of interest a voice in congress lawmakers wary of court clash florida lawmakers look to avoid running afoul of courts when redrawing districts meaningless probably still under questioning from rep fentrice driskell d tampa leek conceded that providing the back up plan would not guarantee that a court would endorse it even after throwing out the primary plan rep joe geller d aventura called the two map approach flawed and mocked the idea here s a new law and if it turns out that s unconstitutional then we re going to have another law he said what if we did that with every law he urged ruling republicans to make a choice as to what you think is constitutional but rep tyler sirois r merritt island who chaired the congressional redistricting subcommittee that just a week ago approved what now has been reduced to the secondary map praised the one two tactic this amendment is making the best decision we can with the information in front of us and the timetable going forward sirois said what s ahead the package will now go to the full house for approval the senate has already approved a congressional map that retains the jacksonville to tallahassee cd 5 shape along with largely maintaining the state s current political balance in congress the senate map creates 16 districts likely to elect republicans and 12 where democrats would be favored based on past voting performance florida s congressional delegation currently is divided 16 11 with republicans holding the edge the state is adding a congressional district this year because of population growth revealed in the 2020 census which prompts the once a decade redraw of house senate and congressional seats both house congressional plans approved friday expand republican dominance to 18 seats the gop could be expected to win with republicans pushing hard to regain control of congress during this year s midterm elections a potential pickup of more seats from florida could prove decisive lawmakers are struggling to finalize a congressional plan before the scheduled march 11 close of the 2022 legislative session the state house and senate plans have been approved by lawmakers and sent to the state supreme court for review the desantis strategy desantis who already has a major national profile among republicans has emerged as a controlling figure in redistricting a role never before embraced by a florida governor through his general counsel desantis submitted two congressional maps which dramatically revamp the districts held by lawson and another black democrat u s rep val demings of orlando now a candidate for u s senate demings district was made more similar to the one she currently represents in the proposals approved friday by the house panel which also are similar to the approach taken by the senate in his approach to reducing minority districts desantis appears to be relying heavily on a 2017 u s supreme court ruling in a north carolina case that found it unconstitutional to racially gerrymander a seat except in narrow instances that lawson s district may not meet lawson s seat was created by the florida supreme court in 2015 two years before the u s supreme court decision came down florida s congressional districts were crafted by state justices after three years of legal fights over the last round of maps drawing in 2012 desantis unsuccessfully sought an advisory opinion from the florida supreme court earlier this month on whether the state constitution s fair districts standards separately prohibited the redrawing of boundaries that could diminish the number of seats held by minorities in a 5 0 ruling the supreme court turned back desantis request for guidance questions linger among gop over redistricting but questions about the durability of minority districts is growing among republicans texas where gov greg abbott like desantis is viewed as a republican white house contender in 2024 has already approved redistricting maps that reduce minority representation drawing a lawsuit from the u s justice department under president biden on the redistricting committee friday rep randy fine r palm bay insisted that republicans were not doing the governor s bidding the two maps approved by the panel don t match the one from desantis but he added he does have a right to veto whatever we pass frankly if you don t talk to the governor s office whenever you re running any bill you re not doing a good job of being a bill sponsor john kennedy is a reporter

the invasion of ukraine comes at a delicate time for the world economy which was just beginning to recover from the ravages of covid russia s war could now have far reaching economic consequences as financial markets tumble and the price of oil soars a worrying comparison can even be made to the 1973 yom kippur war in the middle east which led to an oil crisis this shook the world economy to its foundations and signalled the end of an economic boom which had done so much to reduce unemployment and raise living standards today the world economy is much larger than it was back then but it has been growing much more slowly in recent decades and the pandemic struck a mighty blow over the last two years with governments forced to spend vast sums on bailing out their own economies now despite some signs of recovery the risks of higher inflation and lower growth remain with large debts limiting the ability of many governments to intervene key to the weakening economic outlook are rising energy costs and continuing disruption to supply chains both of which will be made worse by the ukraine crisis russia is the eu s largest supplier of gas and oil and higher energy costs mean more expensive transport affecting the movement of all kinds of goods but perhaps the biggest risk to the world economy is that a prolonged crisis could tip the world into stagflation a combination of high inflation and low economic growth this was a key problem after the 1973 oil crisis but one which many economists hoped has been consigned to history with relatively low and stable prices for the last two decades cost of living could worsen high and rising inflation will exacerbate the cost of living crisis which is already affecting many consumers it also presents a dilemma for central banks which have been pouring money into the economy for the last two years of the pandemic most are now planning to gradually withdraw this support at the same time as gradually raising interest rates to curb inflation but this will further weaken the economy especially if inflation continues to accelerate and central banks react with dramatic interest rates rises during the 1970s crisis the us federal reserve had raised interest rates to 10 by 1978 causing a deep recession the following year in the uk bank of england interest rates reached 17 precipitating a sharp economic decline hopes that inflationary pressures will ease by the middle of 2022 now look optimistic russia and ukraine are among the world s biggest exporters of wheat and many especially in europe depend on russian oil and gas so energy and food prices could continue to rise further and it s not just the rate of inflation which matters but also people s expectations that it will rise further this can spark a wage price spiral where people demand higher wages to compensate for the higher cost of living forcing companies to increase prices further across the board to pay for the wage rises central banks are then forced to raise interest rates even higher inflation also means that government spending could fall in real terms reducing the level of public services and squeezing public sector pay and if firms become concerned that they cannot raise prices enough to compensate for higher wages they may be tempted to cut back on their workforce leading to higher unemployment falling stocks while the central banks have been pumping huge amounts of money into financial markets in order to help stabilise a weak economy one effect of this has been that the stock markets remained remarkably buoyant over the last decade rising by nearly 10 each year on average stocks had already started to fall this year after central banks announced that they will unwind this support and markets have fallen further since ukraine was attacked if stagflation returns central banks will have to reduce their support even faster while a slowing economy would hit corporate profits and further depress stock prices although energy stocks would rise this in turn could reduce investment and business confidence leading to fewer new jobs for many people who hold stocks or other assets rising prices often lead to a wealth effect where people are more confident about spending and borrowing money especially on big ticket items weaker markets would therefore affect economic growth as well as the viability of pension plans which many people depend on read more ukraine i m surprised the oil price hasn t hit us 130 a barrel yet energy trading expert q a so while there is much uncertainty about the political and human consequences of russia s attack on ukraine the world should also be prepared for serious economic ramifications europe is likely to be first in the path of any economic storm partly because of its greater dependence on russian energy supplies but also because of its geographical proximity to a war on its doorstep in the us any economic difficulties could further weaken the biden administration and bolster isolationist america first views meanwhile a global alliance between russia and china could further strengthen both economies overriding any effect of sanctions and strengthening their military as well as economic clout author steve schifferes honorary research fellow city political economy research centre professor of financial journalism 2009 2017 city university of london

it s unlikely that they are especially since the two countries announced their new no limits partnership just a few weeks ago that was their way of declaring that they re tired of the pax americana and intend to carve out spheres of influence surely the chinese understood what that would mean for ukraine sooner or later advertisement yet there s tantalizing reporting over the past few days speculating that beijing was as surprised as anyone to see putin bring down the hammer which stands to reason as even plenty of russian analysts were caught off guard by the invasion the times has a report today about the white house s futile effort over many months to convince china that putin was planning to attack ukraine and that it would be in everyone s interest if he didn t including beijing s knowing that china is russia s most important partner the u s hoped xi would be willing to lean on putin to stand down and pursue diplomacy china either wasn t interested or didn t believe the u s intelligence despite the best efforts of american diplomats to explain how sanctions imposed on russia would indirectly bite china as well each time the chinese officials including the foreign minister and the ambassador to the united states rebuffed the americans saying they did not think an invasion was in the works after one diplomatic exchange in december u s officials got intelligence showing beijing had shared the information with moscow telling the russians that the united states was trying to sow discord and that china would not try to impede russian plans and actions the officials said in addition to laying out the intelligence the white house officials told the ambassador that the united states would impose tough sanctions on russian companies officials and businesspeople in the event of an invasion going far beyond those announced by the obama administration after russia seized ukraine s crimean peninsula in 2014 the u s officials said the sanctions would also hurt china over time because of its commercial ties advertisement the ambassador was skeptical and suspicious according to the times skeptical and suspicious that russia would really invade or skeptical and suspicious that the west really would slam russia with harsh sanctions after declining to do so following putin s 2014 incursion into ukraine or both yesterday wapo also flagged some circumstantial evidence that china had been taken by surprise by putin s attack on ukraine despite the outward show of mutual support between the two countries there have been indications that china was caught flat footed by russian president vladimir putin s announcement of military action minutes after the declaration china s representative to the united nations zhang jun told a security council meeting we believe that the door to a peaceful solution to the ukraine situation is not fully shut nor should it be yun sun director of the china program at the stimson center noted tuesday that the chinese policy community appeared to be in shock at the sudden escalation of fighting after having subscribed to the theory that putin was only posturing and that u s intelligence was

foreign minister wang yi pic twitter com rrhjvcfjvb steve herman w7voa february 25 2022 i m resisting the urge to read too much into that china has consistently said that it respects ukraine s sovereignty while also acknowledging russia s legitimate security concerns presumably its no exceptions policy on sovereignty is a way to protect its own claim to taiwan because china insists that taiwan is part of its own country not a separate nation when the day comes for china to put down the rebellion there it expects the international order to respect its sovereignty in doing so but even so there s no way around the conflict in russian and chinese rhetoric about ukraine putin s rationale in attacking ukraine was that it has no sovereignty that it s not a real country but rather some

the seven most dangerous words in journalism are the world will never be the same in over four decades of reporting i have rarely dared use that phrase but i m going there now in the wake of vladimir putin s invasion of ukraine our world is not going to be the same again because this war has no historical parallel it is a raw 18th century style land grab by a superpower but in a 21st century globalized world this is the first war that will be covered on tiktok by super empowered individuals armed only with smartphones so acts of brutality will be documented and broadcast worldwide without any editors or filters on the first day of the war we saw invading russian tank units unexpectedly being exposed by google maps because google wanted to alert drivers that the russian armor was causing traffic jams you have never seen this play before yes the russian attempt to seize ukraine is a throwback to earlier centuries before the democracy revolutions in america and france when a european monarch or russian czar could simply decide that he wanted more territory that the time was ripe to grab it and so he did and everyone in the region knew he would devour as much as he could and there was no global community to stop him in acting this way today though putin is not only aiming to unilaterally rewrite the rules of the international system that have been in place since world war ii that no nation can just devour the nation next door he is also out to alter that balance of power that he feels was imposed on russia after the cold war
it was an attack few ukrainians anticipated would happen certainly not on this scale for weeks their president volodymyr zelensky and his advisers downplayed the possibilities of a russian assault even chastising the united states and european countries for constantly warning that an attack would happen there were no evacuation plans or other elements of a comprehensive strategy to keep ukrainians safe and secure in the event russian tanks rolled in advertisement on wednesday night restaurants and bars had been crowded with well dressed people hours before the attack many residents attended the opera or strolled with their families past kyiv s centuries old cathedrals airplanes arriving in ukraine were full we never expected this at all said ludmila referring to the russian assault she and her colleagues withheld their family names out of concern for their security by thursday the fears of a nation could be seen in the long queues at atms gas stations and grocery stores to stock up on food and necessities the fears could be seen in the massive traffic jams of cars filled with families desperately trying to leave the city and they could be seen at the bus station where passengers carrying what little they could stuff in small suitcases waited in snaking lines
the ruble crashed to a record low after putin invaded ukraine and the west announced new sanctions alexander nemenov afp via getty images the ruble crashed to a record low after putin invaded ukraine and the west announced new sanctions alexander nemenov afp via getty images author david cortright menafn the conversation the biden administration is delivering on its vow to impose severe sanctions against russia for its military aggression against ukraine the new sanctions announced on feb 24 2022 will cut off russia s major banks and companies from western financing and impose direct financial costs on many of russian president vladimir putin s chief political allies the sanctions package will also restrict russia s access to semiconductor products and the technologies it needs to sustain its industrial sector and military capabilities and the next day the u s and its european allies prepared sanctions against putin personally an important symbolic step although not likely to have significant impact because the new sanctions are multilateral in design and being implemented in close coordination with allies in europe japan australia and other countries around the world our research suggests they will have a significant impact on russia what makes sanctions stick we ve studied the effectiveness of past sanctions both in terms of their economic impact and whether they attain their political objectives we ve found that there are two conditions necessary for sanctions to be effective at least when it comes to their economic impact they must be multilateral meaning they involve a broad coalition of governments and they must be implemented by countries that have extensive commercial relations with the targeted regime that s why the participation of the u k germany france and other european states which have a much higher volume of trade with russia than does the united states in enforcing the sanctions is crucial and that explains why the russian stock market went into a nose dive and the ruble down fell to a record low against the dollar after russia launched its invasion and the new sanctions emerged as a result russia s billionaires lost an estimated 71 billion on feb 24 2022 both russian president vladimir putin left and federal security service director alexander bortnikov are now under financial sanction by the u s and europe alexei nikolsky sputnik kremlin pool photo via ap powerful new sanctions the new sanctions being implemented by the white house and the governments of other countries fall into two general categories financial restrictions and export controls in the first group the united states and its allies in europe and other countries are imposing asset freezes and financial sanctions on russia s largest banks and several of the country s richest and most powerful oligarchs these measures cover nearly 80 of all russian financial assets what the u s treasury department called the core infrastructure of the russian financial system the financial sanctions will block russia s largest financial companies including sberbank and vtb bank from accessing credit and currency markets and impede the ability of state owned and private entities to raise capital and by imposing steep costs on these financial firms as well as on putin s main allies such as aleksandr bortnikov head of russia s federal security service and his son denis bortnikov who chairs vtb s board the sanctions should undermine the investment and development that drives the russian economy the export controls the second category prohibit companies and countries from exporting technological equipment to russia with components that use u s built or designed microchips since the u s continues to dominate in making the kinds of high end semiconductors necessary for advanced technologies this provides important leverage the export controls target russia s defense aerospace and maritime sectors and will cut off russia s access to vital technological inputs which will likely lead to the atrophy of key sectors of its industrial base while russia imports most of its semiconductors from china these are low end chips used to run washing machines not to operate a guided missile russia relies on u s semiconductor components for many of its most important technological applications similar export controls on semiconductor products are being imposed by many others including europe japan and taiwan altogether these sanctions if sustained for many months should have a significant effect in curtailing russia s strategic capabilities by hurting the powerful energy sector and military industrial companies which are bulwarks of putin s regime why swift isn t on the list yet missing from the latest sanctions is something ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy has called for explicitly in recent days denying russia access to the swift system of global financial communications and credit facilitation swift which stands for the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication connects thousands of financial institutions around the world ejecting russia would completely cut off russia from western financial markets and prevent hard currency transactions this would impose immediate economic costs on russia when iran was cut off from swift in 2012 it lost half of its oil export revenues and 30 of its foreign trade on the flip side cutting off russia would create costs for the many banks and corporations in europe and other countries that currently do business with russia which is why so far the west has been unwilling to impose this sanction importantly that decision doesn t belong to the u s alone but to the central banks of the 10 member countries which also include canada germany and italy bearing the costs of imposing sanctions discussions are continuing and pressure may build to take this or other more severe measure in response to the russian assault especially if its military engages in serious violations of humanitarian law regarding treatment of innocent civilians and the leaders of ukraine other measures on the table include more direct product based sanctions of oil natural gas and aluminum but they also would have more immediate negative consequences for europe ultimately the effectiveness of sanctions depends on the strength of the measures and the willingness of the states imposing these measures to bear the costs of their implementation in this case the impact of the strong sanctions now levied will hurt russia in an ongoing way for the next few years even as u s and its allies banks and commercial companies and their customers are going to bear some of the cost for standing up against aggression that the economy will feel pain is clear to us whether putin and his closest allies pay a political price high enough that it leads to changed behavior is less certain

ways off we re in chicago so not cooking at altitude i soak beans in tap water and use a combo of filtered water reverse osmosis filter and broth for cooking anyone have ideas for me i ve tried looking for another brand of cannellinis to see if that helps but i haven t been able to find any jennifer chicago il my partner and i just call this the soup it is so good it is transcendent we make it as described except we use canned cannellini beans and add chicken stock to make up for the liquid highly recommended tim halbur portland or i liked how the saltiness of the soup and the softness of the pasta was delicious anonymous sydney very good even for us toothless types the dreaded crusty bread should be avoided though gummy austin tx i really enjoyed this it is incredibly seasoned with the addition of the parmesan rind and ham hock plus all that work of cooking down the soffrito is totally worth it i used navy beans but think i ll go with the suggested cannellini beans next time as they are bit more hefty yum yum kim san diego great recipe a little different than my grandma s pasta e fagioli but still delicious i used pancetta instead of a ham hock because it was what i could find grandma used pig s feet but ugh and added a couple of tbsp tomato paste to the veggies after they were sauteed and caramelized it then followed the recipe like others cooked the pasta separately and added to the bowls easier to freeze w o pasta grandma would have loved it charles danville ca made this without the pasta because i forgot to pick some up it still ended up awesome also i didn t shred up the ham hock i just left it in the pot defiantly will make again steve ohio excellent recipe a few modifications i used half leek half onion i couldn t get a ham hock so we kept it vegetarian the flavor was still fabulous parmesan rind makes a big difference no food processor so went with small dice which worked fine added some butter to the soffrito saved a bit of time by pressure cooking the beans in salted water for ten minutes in my instant pot added the beans and their cooking water to the rest of the ingredients and let the beans cook the rest of the way to pick up all the flavors skipped the extra oil on top but grated parmesan was a must as always i served the pasta separately so that the leftover soup didn t end up with soggy pasta sara b boston ma i made this after reading the recipe thoroughly in carla s book as well as watching the video the depth of flavor i developed using carla s tips was incredible this recipe will be added to my all time favorites list and will be on rotation all winter recipe notes 1 i added celery and a small fennel bulb to the sofrito 2 i added about 2 cups of chicken stock to step 3 also adding about the same amount of stock 2 more times during the cooking in total i simmered this for 3 hours and it was perfect 3 i added a few sprigs of rosemary and thyme whitney seattle wa so good and worth the time attention dei fabulous recipe i followed it closely and it was a hit for the whole family got a big thumbs up from the 4yo very much looking forward to leftovers tomorrow john seattle wa this is an excellent recipe that being said i did make a mistake and ended up with a very salty version which i amended with some water but still is on the salty side i did the power soak described in the recipe p bc i forgot to soak my beans the night before doing the power soak as written adds a lot of salt to the recipe you don t notice it until after you have salted your sofrito as well and added your ham hock i should have taken it into consideration live and learn i ll just drink lots of water and wine and enjoy will definitely make again scargosun philadelphia pa this is truly one of my favorite recipes of all time the flavors are incredible and it s a lot of fun to make there s something so satisfying about a pot of something delicious simmering for hours on a cold day i power soak beans a few hours before i start on the soup and it always works out well i suggest making a batch of ba s best pesto and drop a hefty tablespoon on your soup when it comes time to serve nom leigh washington dc this reminds me of the dish that my nona poli made for me when i lived with her for a year when i was a child absolutely delicious nona did not use kale rather she grew chard and it was all i knew if the chard looked decent at the market today i would have used it the market did not have a smoked pork hock so i subbed bacon nona used to use pancetta i cut back on oil as a result also nona used to rotate change the soaking water a couple times she said it causes less digestive gassing when i make this again i will par cook the beans i had to boil the soup for well over two hours to cook the beans thanks carla for helping me bring back some great memories doug trail bc canada
one of philly s most acclaimed bars is tempting whiskey drinkers with an exclusive opportunity to try a rare limited release rye hop sing laundromat bought up the pennsylvania liquor control board s entire stash of old overholt s 92 6 proof rye whiskey earlier this month a haul that totaled 835 limited release bottles said l√™ owner of the speakeasy style north korean cocktail bar in chinatown the distillery had conducted a one time release of 600 cases of this 11 year old spirit in 2020 to celebrate the label s 210th anniversary to honor the whiskey brand s roots the cases were distributed exclusively in pennsylvania and ohio old overholt was founded in 1810 in west overton pennsylvania which is about 40 miles southeast of pittsburgh the company later relocated to ohio before moving to its current distillery in kentucky in 1987 all the whiskey distributed to ohio sold out the whiskey was featured in fine wine good spirits stores across pennsylvania and was popular during the 2020 holiday season but plcb spokesperson shawn kelly said that the product did not sell through as quickly as anticipated so the plcb had these bottles sitting in distribution centers and fine wine good spirits stores across the state a plcb representative contacted l√™ the bar owner said inquiring if he would be interested in purchasing some of the cases the state had been sitting on for nearly two years the plcb takes bulk purchase requests from licensees and consumers kelly said a deal was worked out for hop sing laundromat to buy the state s entire supply so long as the plcb could ship it to one fine wine good spirits store where l√™ could pick it up the plcb agreed and shipped 75 cases of the rye whiskey to the fine wine good spirits store in flourtown montgomery county the cases had to be collected from distribution centers and fine wine good spirits stores across the state before being shipped the allotment was originally 841 bottles but six bottles were broken during the trip leaving a total of 835 l√™ said adding that he rented a u haul to retrieve the cases the bottles of old overholt were priced at 75 a piece meaning that the entire stock was valued at about 62 000 according to l√™ l√™ said that he purchased the entire stock so his customers could enjoy the rare rye whiskey at a reasonable price he also wanted to prevent out of state vendors from buying up the bottles and jacking up the prices in future years i just hated the fact that someone from out of state would come in and take it outside of the state l√™ said people like me who live in this city we ll never get a chance to taste it this is supposed to be for us hop sing landromat known for its rules as well as its cocktails of course has rules about how customers can drink their old overholt the bar will only serve the rye whiskey neat using the whiskey in a cocktail would be a complete waste and it won t be diluted by melting ice either l√™ said a 2 ounce pour will cost 15 hop sing laundromat is at 1029 race st located behind a steel entry gate inside a signless commercial space it opened in 2012 the bar denies entry to anyone wearing shorts sandals and flip flops inside photos and cell phone use is not allowed breaking the rules or committing other misdeeds like being a bad tipper or being too loud can land a person on the lifetime ban list which is thousands of names long hop sing laundromat reopened in september after being shut down for 18 months during the pandemic the cash only speakeasy closed again in december to protect guests and staff as the omicron variant led to another surge in coronavirus infections around the holidays the bar reopened again at the beginning of february for service on fridays and saturdays with reducing seating and a limit on parties to a maximum of four people all guests must be fully vaccinated and present their physical vaccination cards upon entering the bar those who don t will be shown the door and directed to another nearby bar l√™ said hop sing laundromat was named one of america s best bars by esquire in 2019 and one of the greatest bars in the world by conde nast traveler in 2015

gold fell sharply after surging above 1 970 and ended the week in negative territory the near term technical outlook remains bullish as long as 1 870 support holds a prolonged russia ukraine war could help the yellow metal gain traction gold fluctuated wildly throughout the week as it remained the most sensitive asset to shifts in risk perception following an impressive rally to its highest level since september 2020 at 1 974 on thursday the yellow metal declined below 1 900 in the early american session on friday and ended up snapping a three week winning streak what happened last week the improving market mood at the beginning of the week on renewed hopes of a diplomatic solution to the russia ukraine crisis made it difficult for gold to build on the previous week s gains the white house announced late sunday that us president biden agreed to meet his russian counterpart vladimir putin later in the week allowing markets to breathe a sigh of relief markets stayed relatively quiet on tuesday and gold edged lower in the second half of the day as us treasury bond yields gained traction with american investors returning from the long weekend additionally the data from the us revealed that the economic activity in the private sector continued to expand at a robust pace in february with markit composite pmi improving sharply to 56 6 from 51 in january gold managed to hold above 1 900 on wednesday and sellers remained on the sidelines as reports of russia piling up troops near the ukrainian border caused risk flows to cool off during the asian trading hours on thursday russia announced that it had launched a special military operation against ukraine and russian president vladimir putin said that the aim was to demilitarize ukraine ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy announced martial law and ukrainian news outlets reported that russia was shelling targets across the country the knee jerk market reaction triggered an intense flight to safety and provided a boost to gold lifting xau usd to the 1 950 area when european markets opened gold extended its rally and touched its strongest level in 17 months at 1 974 with european stocks suffering heavy losses the west s response to russian aggression against ukraine however eased fears over the negative implications of a prolonged russia ukraine war on the global economy the uk the eu and the us announced a series of sanctions on thursday but refrained from cutting russia off from the swift system while reiterating that it was an option that could be exercised furthermore the russian energy sector was largely untouched the slight positive tilt witnessed in risk sentiment and profit taking forced xau usd to erase its daily gains late thursday meanwhile the us bureau of economic analysis announced on thursday that it had revised the annualized real gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter higher to 7 in its second estimate from 6 9 this reading came in line with the market expectation and it was largely ignored by investors on friday reports of russian forces moving toward the ukrainian capital of kyiv with the intention of overthrowing the government forced markets to adopt a cautious stance the yellow metal spent the first half of the day in a relatively tight range above 1 900 in the early american session reports of russia willing to send a delegation to minsk for talks with ukraine revived optimism for a diplomatic end to war xau usd came under bearish pressure on this development and continued to push lower next week there will be several high tier data releases featured in the economic calendar next week but investors are likely to stay focused on geopolitical headlines this week s market action showed that gold is the go to safe haven asset but it s also the one that s being sold first when the mood improves in case russia reaffirms its intention to look for a diplomatic solution and refrains from advancing its troops early next week gold is likely to face additional selling pressure on the flip side a prolonged military conflict with russia s intention to take over kyiv and additional sanctions from the west could support the precious metal on tuesday the ism will release the manufacturing pmi for february on wednesday the adp s private sector employment report and the federal reserve s beige book will be looked upon for fresh impetus in the second half of the week the us economic docket will offer ism services pmi on thursday and nonfarm payrolls on friday more importantly fomc chairman jerome powell will testify before the us senate banking committee and it will be interesting to see how powell responds to questions on the potential impact of the russia ukraine war on the policy outlook powell is likely to reiterate that their priority is controlling inflation if the chairman hints at the possibility of a 50 basis points rate hike in march gold could start pushing lower on the flip side markets are currently pricing a very small chance of a double dose hike in march and a dollar selloff should be limited in case powell goes against it fomc policymakers said numerous times that they are not concerned about the labour market but market participants will pay close attention to wage inflation nonetheless average hourly earnings on a yearly basis are expected to edge lower to 5 2 in february from 5 7 in january a stronger than expected reading could help the greenback find demand and weigh on xau usd but the market reaction is likely to remain short lived as long as geopolitics remain the primary market driver gold technical outlook despite the sharp correction witnessed toward the end of the week gold s near term outlook doesn t yet point to a bearish shift the ascending trend line coming from early february stays intact the relative strength index rsi indicator on the daily chart sits above 50 and the price holds way above the 20 day 50 day 100 day and 200 day smas the initial support is located at 1 870 static level ascending trend line in case xau usd makes a daily close below that level it could extend its slide toward 1 850 static level 20 day sma on the upside 1 900 psychological level aligns as first resistance if buyers managed to flip that level into support 1 910 static level could be seen as the next hurdle before 1 920 static level gold sentiment poll the fxstreet forecast poll points to a slightly bearish bias in the near term with the one week average target sitting at 1 886 the one month outlook paints a mixed picture

russian invasion of ukraine dominates markets on thursday and friday markets reverse invasion shock wti falls below wednesday s close yen gives back all of thursday s safety gain usd jpy rises the fxstreet forecast poll predicts slight weakening in usd jpy a sleepy usd jpy that closed wednesday at 115 00 exactly where it had opened on monday awoke to gunfire on thursday the ensuing shock and falling us treasury rates drove the yen as high as 114 40 in a matter of hours yet by the market close that day the usd jpy was 60 points above its open us equities had closed in the black despite massive early losses and treasury yields had retraced their initial declines on friday morning those directions continued stocks in the us europe and asia rallied except interestingly in hong kong treasury rates in the us rose in all terms while european and asian sovereign yields were mixed with losses in the short end of the curve west texas intermediate wti the north american crude pricing standard was trading at 91 17 below its pre invasion wednesday close of 91 92 the rapid recovery of global markets from thursday s shock leads to a perhaps unpalatable conclusion russia will complete its takeover of ukraine without much difficulty european and american sanctions have not targeted the russian oil industry such an effort would be extremely costly to russia which earns 40 of its revenue from energy but it would send global oil prices and western consumer prices sky high the unwillingness of western governments to contemplate such a difficult move while pretending to reserve these harsh sanctions for a future crisis is the most telltale sign that the ukranianians are on their own russian president validimir putin wants to avoid an occupation of ukraine and would undoubtedly prefer a compliant but national government in kyiv he has already made public calls for cooperation from the ukrainian military and offered negotiations in minsk the ukrainian government in turn has proffered moscow neutrality without specifying any terms ukrainian developments are the determinant factors for global markets the very preliminary movement towards negotiation has reinforced thursday s market recovery japanese economic data was mixed tokyo cpi in february was a bit stronger than forecast though the core index was weaker us information was generally better than anticipated fourth quarter gdp was revised to 7 2 from 6 9 markit s manufacturing and services purchasing managers indexes for february were slightly higher than expected durable goods orders for january were like retail sales much more robust than expected usd jpy outlook the usd jpy immediate future will be crafted by the denouement of the russian ukraine conflict the origin and morality of the dispute is less important to markets than that it is quickly and relatively bloodlessly settled whether the result is a newly accommodative kyiv government under its current president volodymyr zelenskyy or another leader is irrelevant the key is ukrainian acquiescence and the end of the military conflict japanese industrial production and retail trade sales for january will give no impetus for a change of view on the economy in the us purchasing managers indexes and nonfarm payrolls nfp for february will provide a window on the recovery but only nfp has the potential to move markets comments from the federal reserve presidents of clevland atlanta and richmond that inflation was the bank s biggest problem and that rate normalization would procede while noting the potential for ukraine to disrupt economic picture helped to support the usd jpy on friday given these circumstances the usd jpy outlook is modestly higher the widening differential between us and japanese interest rates is the chief source of dollar strength if the ukrainian war becomes a protracted stalemate the impact on global economics rises in direct proportion to its length and viciousness the worse the

the ruble crashed to a record low after putin invaded ukraine and the west announced new sanctions alexander nemenov afp via getty images the ruble crashed to a record low after putin invaded ukraine and the west announced new sanctions alexander nemenov afp via getty images author david cortright menafn the conversation the biden administration is delivering on its vow to impose severe sanctions against russia for its military aggression against ukraine the new sanctions announced on feb 24 2022 will cut off russia s major banks and companies from western financing and impose direct financial costs on many of russian president vladimir putin s chief political allies the sanctions package will also restrict russia s access to semiconductor products and the technologies it needs to sustain its industrial sector and military capabilities and the next day the u s and its european allies prepared sanctions against putin personally an important symbolic step although not likely to have significant impact because the new sanctions are multilateral in design and being implemented in close coordination with allies in europe japan australia and other countries around the world our research suggests they will have a significant impact on russia what makes sanctions stick we ve studied the effectiveness of past sanctions both in terms of their economic impact and whether they attain their political objectives we ve found that there are two conditions necessary for sanctions to be effective at least when it comes to their economic impact they must be multilateral meaning they involve a broad coalition of governments and they must be implemented by countries that have extensive commercial relations with the targeted regime that s why the participation of the u k germany france and other european states which have a much higher volume of trade with russia than does the united states in enforcing the sanctions is crucial and that explains why the russian stock market went into a nose dive and the ruble down fell to a record low against the dollar after russia launched its invasion and the new sanctions emerged as a result russia s billionaires lost an estimated 71 billion on feb 24 2022 both russian president vladimir putin left and federal security service director alexander bortnikov are now under financial sanction by the u s and europe alexei nikolsky sputnik kremlin pool photo via ap powerful new sanctions the new sanctions being implemented by the white house and the governments of other countries fall into two general categories financial restrictions and export controls in the first group the united states and its allies in europe and other countries are imposing asset freezes and financial sanctions on russia s largest banks and several of the country s richest and most powerful oligarchs these measures cover nearly 80 of all russian financial assets what the u s treasury department called the core infrastructure of the russian financial system the financial sanctions will block russia s largest financial companies including sberbank and vtb bank from accessing credit and currency markets and impede the ability of state owned and private entities to raise capital and by imposing steep costs on these financial firms as well as on putin s main allies such as aleksandr bortnikov head of russia s federal security service and his son denis bortnikov who chairs vtb s board the sanctions should undermine the investment and development that drives the russian economy the export controls the second category prohibit companies and countries from exporting technological equipment to russia with components that use u s built or designed microchips since the u s continues to dominate in making the kinds of high end semiconductors necessary for advanced technologies this provides important leverage the export controls target russia s defense aerospace and maritime sectors and will cut off russia s access to vital technological inputs which will likely lead to the atrophy of key sectors of its industrial base while russia imports most of its semiconductors from china these are low end chips used to run washing machines not to operate a guided missile russia relies on u s semiconductor components for many of its most important technological applications similar export controls on semiconductor products are being imposed by many others including europe japan and taiwan altogether these sanctions if sustained for many months should have a significant effect in curtailing russia s strategic capabilities by hurting the powerful energy sector and military industrial companies which are bulwarks of putin s regime why swift isn t on the list yet missing from the latest sanctions is something ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy has called for explicitly in recent days denying russia access to the swift system of global financial communications and credit facilitation swift which stands for the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication connects thousands of financial institutions around the world ejecting russia would completely cut off russia from western financial markets and prevent hard currency transactions this would impose immediate economic costs on russia when iran was cut off from swift in 2012 it lost half of its oil export revenues and 30 of its foreign trade on the flip side cutting off russia would create costs for the many banks and corporations in europe and other countries that currently do business with russia which is why so far the west has been unwilling to impose this sanction importantly that decision doesn t belong to the u s alone but to the central banks of the 10 member countries which also include canada germany and italy bearing the costs of imposing sanctions discussions are continuing and pressure may build to take this or other more severe measure in response to the russian assault especially if its military engages in serious violations of humanitarian law regarding treatment of innocent civilians and the leaders of ukraine other measures on the table include more direct product based sanctions of oil natural gas and aluminum but they also would have more immediate negative consequences for europe ultimately the effectiveness of sanctions depends on the strength of the measures and the willingness of the states imposing these measures to bear the costs of their implementation in this case the impact of the strong sanctions now levied will hurt russia in an ongoing way for the next few years even as u s and its allies banks and commercial companies and their customers are going to bear some of the cost for standing up against aggression that the economy will feel pain is clear to us whether putin and his closest allies pay a political price high enough that it leads to changed behavior is less certain

within the thematic space the e commerce industry can serve as a multi sector play on strong consumer spending combined with rapid technology growth as many investors know e commerce has been strengthening for several years supported by mobile and internet penetration e commerce has grown steadily in the mid teen percentage range since 2010 but the covid 19 pandemic pulled forward e commerce growth to the high 30 range throughout the end of 2020 now with year over year growth averaging about 6 6 in 3q21 the growth rate has diminished and seems somewhat less exciting at first glance however e commerce sales continue to show positive growth at a more sustainable level than previous years despite tough comps in 2020 and 2021 e commerce sales also remain a high portion of overall retail sales at levels above 13 since 3q20 compared to 11 pre pandemic today s note discusses the s network global e commerce index ecomx and how it captures e commerce growth and future trends in consumer retail why e commerce now several overarching trends have contributed to the strength in e commerce first of all e commerce has been excelling alongside the growth of mobile and internet usage while it seems like the typical american household already has several mobile phones tablets and laptops global cellular coverage is still extremely limited and possible reaches only 15 of the world 1 as cellular coverage expands with the help of 5g and commercial satellites access to online purchases and e commerce may increase second consumer habits have been changing supply chain issues have created fears of shortages particularly with food beverages and other grocery essentials as long as funds are available there is less opportunity risk to buy extra food product rather than running out early e g toilet paper in the height of the covid 19 pandemic these habits in addition to movement into the suburbs and spending more time at home have led to an increase in bulk buying bulk product has increased over 2 since 2019 according to some sources which may be cheaper and easier to order online 2 third remote work has been increasing with as many as 11 of total u s workers teleworking in december 2021 for more corporate positions measured by those with a bachelor s degree or higher those percentages were in the 20 25 range 3 with less consumers making an afternoon commute it s not as simple to stop by stores on their way home from work instead consumers may find it easier to order online especially given faster shipping times i e next day same day while companies like amazon amzn have led the push for faster shipping times other logistics companies could become more competitive with the growth of automated and electrified last mile delivery services for example companies like united parcel service ups and fedex fdx are investing capital to modernize their delivery fleet for faster and more efficient delivery ecomx supports e commerce trends with a multi sector approach to consumer retail strength the ecomx index is constructed to represent the breadth of the e commerce space and includes 60 equal weighted constituents allocated evenly across each of its four main business segments online marketplaces online retailers content navigation and e commerce infrastructure online marketplaces are among the most well known and primary beneficiaries in the e commerce space these include constituents like amazon amzn and ebay ebay these online marketplaces connect buyers with multiple sellers typically via website and mobile app in addition most traditional brick and mortar retailers have shifted business models to incorporate online retailing for example large retailers like walmart wmt have increased net e commerce sales by over 30 in the first nine months of 2021 compared to the same time period in 2020 4 these online marketplaces retailers are typically enabled by content navigation providers e g advertisements social media consumer tracking finally companies that supply infrastructure for e commerce growth include anything from warehouses that hold inventory to transportation companies which can deliver goods as far as across the globe or as close as from store to household with the majority of online marketplaces and online retailers considered consumer discretionary stocks this sector s weighting in the ecomx index is currently about 40 but the index is further differentiated from other consumer retail indexes which typically hold 100 weighting toward consumer discretionary staples by a large weighting to tech and industrial focused sectors the heavier allocation to tech oriented sectors gives the index a higher risk reward potential compared to pure play consumer retail indexes bottom line investors who believe that traditional retail models are evolving may have interest in the growing e commerce space because of its tilt toward higher growth tech driven stocks indexes like ecomx may be able to provide higher reward in exchange for higher risk when compared to traditional retail peers the s network global e commerce index ecomx is the underlying index for the first trust s

the investment strategy that we utilize at o neil global advisors focuses on identifying leading companies in disruptive industry groups which have the potential to outperform the general market we identify investment themes that are fundamentally creating a sea change within their respective sectors and industry groups we have found that companies exemplifying these disruptive themes usually have increasing earnings and sales growth and tend to outperform the market over a 12 18 month holding period a few historical examples of disruptive investment themes include the railroad sector in 1914 the rise of commercial aviation in 1962 and the global rise of the internet in 1990 today one of the ways to invest in a major disruptive theme is through the shared economy image 1 sector railroads bethlehem steel 1914 increased 1 400 in 99 weeks william o neil co image 2 sector aviation national airlines 1962 increased 1 004 in 179 weeks william o neil co image 3 internet networking cisco systems 1990 increased 1 602 in 169 weeks william o neil co the shared economy is a new economic model that leverages peer to peer p2p or shared access to goods and services facilitated by online community based platforms these shared economy platforms are possible due to advances in technology that allow users to generate revenue from unused assets in numerous sectors such as hospitality transportation and leisure revenue generated from companies within the shared economy theme could reach 335 billion by 2025 according to pwc the shared economy model will have profound societal and economic benefits and potentially improve the lives of countless individuals image 4 sharing economy versus traditional operating business model william o neil co in addition to the advances in technology that have enabled the shared economy consumer preferences have shifted in the millennial and gen z demographics this shift stems from a new generation that demands a high degree of personal interaction along with numerous customizable options consumers now want community based experiences rather than transaction based experiences resulting in a systemic change in the way companies operate according to pwc the european commission has found that 75 of the one billion cars that are on road today are each operated by one individual additionally private vehicles go unused for 95 of their lifetime further 43 of americans view auto ownership as an inconvenience and a hassle these combined factors create an opportunity for consumers to generate revenue from unused automotive assets as a result the sector that has most benefited from these changes is the transportation and mobility area the transportation sector enables both car sharing and ride sharing services that allow individuals to generate revenue from unused assets ride sharing typically offers short rides to consumers while car sharing services offer individuals longer rides at flexible and affordable prices the two largest publicly traded companies benefiting from the ride sharing trend are uber nasdq uber and lyft nasdaq lyft uber generates annual revenues of more than 17 5 billion from over 101 million active users in over 900 metro areas worldwide similarly lyft the second largest ride sharing company generates revenues of 3 2 billion annually in 644 cities in the usa and 12 in canada image 5 transportation uber 2022 william o neil co image 6 transportation lyft 2022 william o neil co other sectors that have benefited from the shared economy are hospitality retail and consumer goods the hospitality industry benefits from both monetized home sharing and home exchange programs home sharing allows users to rent out an individual unused asset which creates economic benefits for both parties the leading company in this segment is airbnb nasdaq abnb with 6 billion in annual revenues airbnb has had exponential growth in the most recent quarters with guest nights rising to 300 million in 2021 an increase of 55 versus 2020 demonstrating the validity of the home sharing concept the company has also achieved global scale with over 6 million active listings in 220 countries and over 100 000 cities currently to date over one billion guests have stayed at an airbnb demographically airbnb is very much on trend since 60 of its users are millennials image 7 hospitality airbnb 2022 william o neil co traditional hotel companies using an old economic business model have taken notice of the growth in home sharing programs which is why expedia nasdaq expe acquired home sharing companies homeaway and vrbo in recent years of note expedia also owns the brands hotels com orbitz travelocity trivago and carrentals com and generated over 8 billion in revenue in 2021 image 8 hospitality expedia 2022 william o neil co there are numerous small sectors that are also benefiting from the shared economy model for example platforms within the retail and fashion industries are enabling individuals to buy sell and rent clothes resulting in a fundamental shift away from on premise retailing and brick and mortar stores one example is the recent ipo of rent the runway nasdaq rent which was launched in november 2009 and allows users to rent or buy apparel and accessories from over 700 designers image 9 retail rent 2022 william o neil co looking forward strategic partnerships and the development of new products in the sharing economy should help accelerate future growth the sharing economy is not only a disruptive and innovative investing theme but also an opportunity for investors to generate wealth despite the challenging current market conditions happy hunting randy watts and jason thomson co author statement jason thomson portfolio manager

the canadian stock market is finally getting its moment to outshine its bigger brother the s p 500 after many years of lacklustre performance indeed higher energy prices and strength in the financials sector have helped keep the s p tsx index buoyed while the major indexes south of the border sank undoubtedly this is not the kind of outperformance that investors desired and unfortunately with all of the horrific news surrounding the invasion of ukraine there s a chance that the tsx s year of outperformance could be in the grey or even slightly in the red it s really hard to tell what the next course is for markets but for those who want to take a step back to focus on value or profitable growth at somewhat reasonable prices the case for buying canadian has never been better in fact american investors reading this piece may be enticed to swap some greenbacks for loonies as they look to capitalize on what i see as higher relative value in the north arguably such names have not gotten nearly as much hype from retail investors as investors consider value above all else especially sales growth i expect names like alimentation couche tard tsx atd and bank of montreal tsx bmo nyse bmo could be the new class of winners alimentation couche tard couche tard is the epitome of a growth at a reasonable price type of stock the company is not exciting in the slightest at least on the surface it s a convenience store giant that s grown primarily via m a activity of late though the pace of acquisitions and dispositions has slowed with a shift of focus on adapting to the new age of convenience retail and a bit more effort placed on improving organic growth same store sales many investors may stand to misunderstand the company one thing is clear management has a knack for creating value from its acquisitions the pace of acquisitions has gone down likely due to stretched valuations though couche had not made the headlines of late nearly as much as it used to when it was wheeling and dealing on a somewhat regular basis it s worth noting that the balance sheet has improved such that it could take advantage of a bargain if it saw fit with markets plunging i think couche tard could have a shot to really get a great bang for its buck it the meantime investors seem confused as to what will happen to the firm s sales once evs become mainstream given progress in ev mature markets i think concerns are overblown and atd stock may be a relative bargain in a market environment that cares more about value and less about sexy stories or promises of growth bank of montreal bank of montreal is another boring stock you won t hear mentioned around the water cooler it s a big bank that i think has one of the more underrated managers out there the bank of the west deal i think could bolster the firm s growth prospects as it looks to cash in on what could be a multi year run for the banks indeed higher rates and a still robust economy could paint a goldilocks type of picture though bmo stock has outpaced some of its rivals the stock is still relatively cheap at just 12 4 times trailing earnings with a 3 7 dividend yield and a recent 25 dividend hike i think bmo could find itself being one of the sexy stocks for an era of rising rates and resilient economic growth bmo has risen out of the covid crash in a big way i think it s still just getting started

ukraine here s how nato can respond biden on thursday said nato is convening a summit friday to bring together the leaders of 30 allied nations and close partners to affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take the president said u s forces are not and will not be engaged in a conflict with russia in ukraine but they will defend our nato allies and reassure those allies in the east for several weeks biden has ordered thousands of forces to germany and other parts of europe what is the history between russia and ukraine world war i resulted in the creation of two ukrainian republics one on either side of the former russian austrian border they unified in 1919 as an independent state the ukrainian people s republic soon afterward ukraine s pro independence forces fell to the soviet union and the ukrainian soviet socialist republic became the founding member of the ussr in 1922 however in 1991 a referendum on ukrainian independence was backed by a majority in every region of ukraine producing a more than 90 landslide a week later the soviet union ceased to exist ukraine russia crisis how do you pronounce donetsk and is it kyiv or kiev what are sanctions what you

russia fomented a separatist rebellion in ukraine s east and later seized control of part of the donbas region although a cease fire agreement was formed in2015 the front lines have not moved since

the biden administration in extraordinary and rapid cooperation with allies over a period of three days has doubled down on its vow to impose severe sanctions against russia for its military aggression against ukraine on feb 26 2022 the u s and europe agreed to cut off some russian banks from the swift messaging system which is used to make trillions of dollars worth of transactions every day an option so devastating it has been called the nuclear option of sanctioning they also vowed to prevent russia from accessing some of its foreign reserves making it harder to offset the effects of the sanctions two days earlier the white house announced a multifaceted sanctions package that cuts off russia s major banks and companies from western financing and imposed direct financial costs on many of russian president vladimir putin s top allies it also restricted russia s access to semiconductor products and the technologies it needs to sustain its industrial sector and military capabilities western governments also sought to punish putin personally in separate sanctions targeting his personal assets held abroad as experts on the effectiveness of sanctions we believe the combination of these measures comprise an unprecedented global attack on a national economy in this case russia s the negative impact of which will increase by the hour powerful new sanctions in their feb 24 sanctions package the u s its european allies and other supportive countries froze the assets of russia s largest banks and several of the country s richest and most powerful oligarchs and imposed other financial sanctions on them these measures cover nearly 80 of all russian financial assets which the u s treasury department called the core infrastructure of the russian financial system blocking sberbank vtb bank and other russian banks from accessing credit and currency markets and impeding the ability of state owned and private entities to raise capital by imposing steep costs on these financial firms as well as on putin s main allies such as aleksandr bortnikov head of russia s federal security service and his son denis bortnikov who chairs vtb s board the sanctions should undermine the investment and development that drives the russian economy the sanctions also include export controls that prohibit companies and countries from exporting technological equipment to russia with components that use u s built or u s designed microchips since the u s continues to dominate in making the kinds of high end semiconductors necessary for advanced technologies this provides important leverage the export controls target russia s defense aerospace and maritime sectors and will cut off russia s access to vital technology which will likely lead to the atrophy of key sectors of its industrial base while russia imports most of its semiconductors from china these are the type of low end chips used to run washing machines for example not to operate a guided missile russia relies on u s semiconductor components for many of its most important technological applications similar export controls on semiconductor products are being imposed by many others including europe japan and taiwan massive bank runs and after intense pressure from ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy and others the u s and european union agreed on feb 26 to cut off some russian banks from swift which stands for the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication and connects thousands of financial institutions around the world this is especially notable because some countries in particular germany and italy had previously been opposed to this step when iran was first cut off from swift in 2012 it lost half of its oil export revenues and 30 of its foreign trade the u s and allies also announced on feb 26 that they would block the russian central bank s access to some of its over us 600 billion in foreign currency reserves elina ribakova deputy chief economist for the institute of international finance said this measure would have a dramatic effect on russia s economy and banking system and lead to massive bank runs a selloff of rubles and possibly a full on collapse of russia s financial system altogether these sanctions if sustained should have a devastating effect on russia s economy as well as curtail its strategic capabilities by hurting the powerful energy sector and military industrial companies which are bulwarks of putin s regime what makes sanctions stick and sting we ve studied the effectiveness of past sanctions both in terms of their economic impact and whether they attain their political objectives we ve found two conditions are necessary for sanctions to be effective at least when it comes to their economic impact they must be multilateral meaning they involve a broad coalition of governments and they must be implemented by countries that have extensive commercial relations with the targeted regime furthermore the countries with deep ties to the target must accept the risks and costs that result from their actions that s why the participation of a growing number of like minded nations including the u k germany france and other european states that have a much higher volume of trade with russia than does the united states is so crucial in making these sanctions succeed this unity and collective economic clout explain why the russian stock market went into a nose dive and the ruble fell to a record low against the dollar after russia launched its invasion and the new sanctions emerged as a result russia s billionaires lost an estimated 71 billion on feb 24 and standard poor s and fitch ratings slashed the country s credit rating to junk status because the sanctions are multilateral in design and being implemented in close coordination with allies in europe japan australia and other countries around the world our research suggests they will have a significant impact on russia previous estimates have suggested aggressive sanctions like the ones being unleashed now could shrink russia s annual gross domestic product by 3 to 5 or more bearing the costs of imposing sanctions discussions are continuing and pressure may build to take other more severe measures in response to the russian assault especially if its military is deemed to be guilty of committing war crimes other measures on the table include more direct product based sanctions of oil natural gas and aluminum but they also would have more immediate negative consequences for europe another test of endurance for the economic battle with russia in this case the impact of the very strong sanctions levied is hurting russia now and will increase substantially in the coming months as long as the countries imposing the sanctions as well as the companies and citizens who will also bear some of the costs are willing to accept them they will likely succeed in punishing putin for his aggression against ukraine this article has been updated to include new swift and central bank sanctions

are one of many variables that we consider ultimately whether society meets its goals to decarbonise is not within shell s control while we intend to travel this journey in step with society only governments can create the framework for success the sky 1 5 scenario starts with data from shell s sky scenario but there are important updates first the outlook uses the most recent modelling for the impact and recovery from covid 19 consistent with a sky 1 5 scenario narrative second it blends this projection into existing sky 2018 energy system data by around 2030 third the extensive scaleup of nature based solutions is brought into the core scenario which benefits from extensive new modelling of that scale up in 2018 nature based solutions required to achieve 1 5 c above pre industrial

natural gas supply modelling with an outlook consistent with the sky 1 5 narrative and demand is presented for the first time fifth the sky 1 5 scenario draws on the latest historical data and estimates to 2020 from various sources particularly the extensive international energy agency energy statistics as with sky this scenario assumes that society achieves the 1 5 c stretch goal of the paris agreement it is rooted in stretching but realistic development dynamics today but explores a goal oriented way to achieve that ambition we worked back in designing how this could occur considering the realities of the situation today and taking into account realistic timescales for change of course there is a range of possible paths in detail that society could take to achieve this goal although achieving the goal of the paris agreement and the future depicted in sky 1 5 while maintaining a growing global economy will be extremely challenging today it is still a technically possible path shell s operating plan outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten year period and are updated every year they reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years accordingly shell s operating plans outlooks budgets and pricing assumptions do not reflect our net zero emissions target in the future as society moves towards net zero emissions we expect shell s operating plans outlooks budgets and pricing assumptions to reflect this movement also in this press release we may refer to shell s net carbon footprint which includes shell s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products our suppliers carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell shell only controls its own emissions the use of the term shell s net carbon footprint is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of

2 35 p m est mr price good afternoon question good afternoon mr price hello my apologies for the delay we actually intended to start early today we are now starting late i report to higher authorities as we all do i d like to start by saying this the american people are standing with the people of ukraine as they suffer an unjustified unprovoked and premeditated attack by russia s military forces it s a brutal attack it s a brutal attack that is endangering the lives and livelihoods of millions of civilians we will not falter in our resolute support for ukraine s sovereignty and territorial integrity this is a dangerous moment for europe and really for freedom loving people everywhere putin s assault on ukraine is an attack on the principles that undergird global peace stability and security the world over but putin didn t account for everything and he didn t account for the bravery and resolve of the people of ukraine we commend the ukrainian people for showing strength and determination in response to an unprovoked attack by the kremlin we have seen ukrainian soldiers demonstrate incredible bravery in the first day of self defense shooting down russian aircraft firing at tanks and holding many of the positions while under violent assault the kremlin continues to use disinformation including false reports alleging again falsely the widespread surrender of ukrainian troops moscow is resorting to outright lies in an effort to weaken the resolve of ukraine s military and of its people we also are witting of reports that the russian federation plans to threaten to kill the family members of ukrainian soldiers if they do not surrender these tactics are classic intimidation they are synonymous with the kremlin they are unacceptable this isn t the first time of course putin has decided that his country can attack another country with impunity moscow s further invasion of ukraine is part of a pattern of the kremlin s destructive behavior the russian federation of course invaded georgia in 2008 it continues to occupy territories within georgia s borders and for decades it has stationed troops in moldova without host government consent tomorrow the united states will join ukraine in solemnly marking the eighth anniversary of russia s 2014 invasion and brutal occupation of crimea a flagrant disregard for international law as well as ukraine s sovereignty and territorial integrity the united states reaffirms as we always have crimea is ukraine the ukrainian people have known 30 years of independence and while building their democracy they have shown relentless and inspiring pursuit of liberty of peace of security of human dignity and they continue to show that they will not go back in time as we approach the seventh anniversary of the brutal murder of boris nemtsov we are reminded that many russians disagree with putin s brutal and imperialist tactics and policies the citizens of russia who are peacefully protesting including in putin s own hometown and in dozens of other cities across the russian federation are rejecting his violence against the people of ukraine we deeply respect them we respect their bravery we respect their heroism they are out in the streets demanding that russia s government their government stop this unprovoked and unjustified war we ve seen leading russian journalists denouncing putin s war of choice we have heard of russia s mothers concerned about the reckless deployment of their sons to a needless war these courageous people of conscience in russia persist they persist despite the kremlin s reinvigorated crackdown this too is classic from putin s playbook whenever challenged by people his own people speaking truth and opposing views his tactic is to silence them the people of russia as we have said time and again are not our enemy we hold president putin and his cronies responsible for this war not them we join you in saying no to war –Ω–µ—Ç –≤–æ–π–Ω–µ cyrillic president biden has said from the start of this crisis if putin chooses to invade the cost to russia will be immediate and profound to its financial system to its economy to its technological base and to its strategic position and ambitions as well as its reputation in the world and the world has now witnessed that putin has made a choice he rejected diplomacy he has chosen war and president biden has announced our response to be clear this is not the outcome we wanted this is not the outcome we sought to prevent it s both a tragedy for the people of ukraine and a choice putin made that he that he has decided for the people of russia this is a choice that has been decided for them not by them putin s war of choice has required that we follow through on imposing the massive consequences and severe costs and that we ensure his flagrant violation of international law will be a strategic failure we stand united with our nato allies and partners in europe and around the world in confronting the russian government and holding president putin and those around him to account question thanks ned i just wanted i think you might have misspoken this is the outcome you sought to prevent right mr price this is the outcome that we sought to prevent question okay can i ask you this may be already kind of obe but there was this proposal the chinese chinese proposal the russians seem to have picked up on at least for an hour or so about talks between russia and ukraine happening in minsk i know the secretary spoke to foreign minister kuleba today what s the u s what s your thinking about the efficacy of such a of such talks mr price well matt you ve heard us say before that over the course of several weeks leading up to the events that we ve seen recently in ukraine the assault on ukraine its sovereignty its territorial integrity and really its people that moscow engaged in a pretense of diplomacy that was before the invasion started now we see moscow suggesting that diplomacy take place at the barrel of a gun or as moscow s rockets mortars artillery target the ukrainian people this is not real diplomacy those are not the conditions for real diplomacy we and our allies have called for a real diplomatic solution from day one president zelenskyy for his part has repeatedly reached out to president putin but his outstretched hand at every turn was met now by silence and now bombs if president putin is serious about diplomacy he knows what he can do he should immediately stop the bombing campaign against civilians order the withdrawal of his forces from ukraine and indicate very clearly unambiguously to the world that moscow is prepared to de escalate we have not seen that yet question so you don t think it s a good idea mr price we have not seen any indication that putin is prepared to de escalate we have not seen any indication that he is willing to create the conditions in which diplomacy can succeed question and just to put a superfine point on it it is not the question of the it is not a question of the venue if the same talks without some kind of significant change from the russians you don t think talks anywhere would mr price this is a question that is much more fundamental than the venue this is the question of whether diplomacy can succeed under these conditions we do not think it can question okay then just secondly and finally from me finland and sweden were invited to participate in this nato meeting in brussels earlier today and the russians have i don t know issued a warning saying that if they were to join nato and i know that there isn t any current plan for them to do so but if they were that there would be repercussions military and political repercussions for them now i m not going to ask you whether the u s would encourage or support finland or sweden to join nato but there are conditions that have to be satisfied or aspirants have to satisfy certain conditions to become members do finland and sweden currently as they are now meet those conditions for membership mr price that is a question matt for nato but there is a more fundamental question that your question actually gets at and that is really what is at stake in this conflict we have made the point before that ukraine is a valued partner of the united states its people are partners of the american people but this in some ways in many ways is bigger than a territorial conflict between russia and ukraine it is bigger because these are about the foundational principles that for 70 years now since the end over the course of two world wars and since the end of the cold war principles that have undergirded and really fueled unprecedented levels of stability of prosperity of security the world over in europe indo pacific and everywhere in between that is what putin is threatening in addition to the territorial integrity of ukraine the people of ukraine the government of ukraine what putin is threatening are these is this rules based international order and one of the central precepts of that rules based international order is the foundational truth that every country should be free to determine its own policies its own domestic policy its own foreign policies its partnerships its alliances its associations its aspirations that is what putin has sought to trample on in ukraine it is what if we are to listen to at least this bluster we may be led to believe he wants to trample on beyond ukraine question okay i get that that s not my question is about finland and sweden it s not about what putin s policies are ukraine has made it very clear that it wants to or the current government in ukraine has made it very clear that it wants to join nato and nato has said no you re not ready yet what my question is is if and i know you re not going to want to answer a hypothetical but if you re going to say no that i mean do finland and sweden meet the criteria for nato membership mr price so first question should they should they apply tomorrow would they have to would would they have to do are they democratic enough mr price so question do they do they uphold human rights do they mr price so let me make three points it is up to finland and sweden to determine for themselves if they wish to join nato or any other alliance it is our firm position that and a firm position of the nato alliance that nato s door remains open to all eligible aspirants and three ultimately if a country does apply does aspire for nato membership that s a decision for nato not for any other country question right but i just want to know would the united states support you don t support ukraine s membership in nato right now but do you mr price matt you yourself have just said that neither finland nor sweden have indicated that they aspire to join nato so question i know well that s why that s why i i tried to couch the question whether they would currently meet the criteria to become members mr price i m going to let finland and sweden speak for themselves question all right mr price yes vivian question thanks ned the eu has agreed to impose sanctions on vladimir putin and foreign minister sergey lavrov today the president said obviously it was under consideration yesterday there are reports that the u s will announce sanctions on putin today can you tell us if that is the case mr price as you heard from the president yesterday all options are on the table all options means all all means all we are looking closely at additional options that may apply appropriate pressure to the russian federation to president putin to those around him but any additional measures would join a litany of steps that together with our eu allies with australia with canada with great britain with new zealand a number of other countries we announced yesterday that constitute the strongest most consequential set of sanctions and other economic measures ever imposed and the fact that they are responsive to this brazen brutal unprovoked aggression on the part of russia against ukraine speaks to their strength and why that strength was and is necessary so any additional measures would complement the fact that we announced yesterday that now all ten of russia s largest bank which hold 80 percent of the assets in russia s banking sector are now subject to these measures the export controls that we have the department of commerce to be specific imposed yesterday now block the import of some 50 percent of the strategic imports that moscow would need for its strategic positioning it s strategic ambitions the fact that the russian government is now cut off in terms of its sovereign debt from western financing the fact that elites around president putin are now sanctioned and subject to those attendant restrictions any additional measures and again we have said that if president putin continues to escalate we will do the same but any additional measures would join that long litany of steps that already constitute the strongest the most decisive response that the united states and together with our allies and partners have ever mounted humeyra question so i have a couple of follow ups on both of those issues but before please indulge me foreign policy magazine first reported this about locally employed staff working in ukraine and how they re seeking u s help so what is the plan for them how many people are we talking about and what is your assessment do you not think you have an obligation to these people mr price humeyra the secretary and others from here have been in regular touch with the embassy kyiv community and that of course includes our locally employed staff you ve traveled with us you know the value that the secretary that the team around him attach to our locally employed staff they are at the heart of our embassy operations around the world quite simply our embassies our posts around the world could not function without our locally employed staff on february 24th a couple of days ago the locally employed staff committee sent us an email following russia s unprovoked attack against kyiv we are exploring all legal options available to us that would enable us to support them at what clearly is a very difficult time for our locally employed staff we ve already taken some important steps we ve implemented paid administrative leave for all staff unable to work or telework regardless of their location whether our local staff are working whether they re teleworking whether they are unable to work let me be clear they are being paid whether they are in ukraine or outside of ukraine they are being paid we have established a dedicated communications channel for all of our locally employed staff to contact us with their questions with their concerns so that we can be responsive directly to them and we ve provided the option of salary advances to support those locally employed staff who need an extra amount of assistance at what is clearly a very difficult time so these relationships are deeply meaningful to us they re deeply important to us again our operations could not continue without our locally employed staff question how many people are we talking about mr price i m not in a position to offer that question four hundred a hundred mr price all of them are being paid all of them have these options available to them question okay question can i just follow up on that mr price sure question unless you want to go into something else humeyra question yeah i was going to move on question can i just do one quick question on that mr price sure question yeah go ahead question okay one thing that they asked for specifically in this letter was assistance relocating out of the country the biden administration has been talking about this potential assault for weeks now so why isn t there already a way to help these locally employed staff get out of the country if they want to and do you plan on doing that mr price well we are exploring all options that are legally available to us and that are logistically available to us at this time as you know we have for over the course of weeks now been issuing public communications directed in the first instance at the american citizen community in kyiv those who otherwise would have traveled to ukraine urging individuals not to travel to ukraine and more recently urging americans located in ukraine to depart ukraine we have of course provided guidance to our locally engaged staff locally employed staff who has come to us who had come to us seeking guidance seeking direction so i can t speak to specific cases i can t speak to specific decisions or choices that may have been made but we are here to support them in every conceivable way that we can question that raises actually the sorry question and is there any reason to believe they d be specifically subject to russian aggression mr price i m sorry question is there any reason to believe that these locally employed staff would be specifically subject to russian aggressions mr price i have i have not seen any indication that they would be targeted for their role but we have seen every indication that this is intended to be on the part of the russian federation not only an assault on ukraine s territorial integrity not only an assault on its government but also an assault on the ukrainian people so we are deeply concerned about the intentions the motivations of the russian federation it s why we are seeking to bring this unprovoked needless war to an end as quickly as we can humeyra question just on this do you know were there any local staff who accompanied the people who went to lviv and were working in lviv and who have since now been relocated basically to poland and who would have gone and are now temporarily at least being living in poland mr price it was a core embassy team matt that question of just americans or were there local staff too mr price it was a core embassy team i m not in a position to offer if there were any locally employed staff with them humeyra question just to close the loop on sanctions and then i ll move on to un very briefly so the assessments out there about how long it would take russian forces to overrun kyiv is mentioned like in days and yet the president and others in this government said yesterday sanctions would be more impactful in time is it fair to say then in the immediate term the u s is basically unable to stop putin mr price i don t think you heard anyone say that what you have heard us say is that well let me back up over the course of months now we have been ringing the alarm bell as we had information available to us as early as late last year that vladimir putin had these intentions we started to see his forces mobilize around that time you remember in november of 2021 when we first started to speak about this publicly we beyond our public messaging we engaged in robust private diplomacy behind closed doors to ensure that our allies and partners around the world knew what we knew so that we could operate in tandem with one another when it comes to the sanctions that you mentioned these were coordinated with allies and partners around the world part of what gives them the bite the heft that they have is that these were not just measures that were introduced by the united states but also by the european union question it doesn t matter how many people how many countries introduced that it s just it s a matter of time and we re talking about days and president openly said that they don t have the days but mr price but you will look if you see what has transpired in the russian marketplace over the course not only of recent days but of recent weeks the threat of these massive consequences have pushed the ruble to its lowest level in years pushed the russian stock market pushed down investor sentiment and have made clear that these measures have tremendous bite and we saw that yesterday when these measures were introduced so what is true is that these measures are designed to garner strength to garner momentum over time but with their immediate introduction yesterday on top of the measures that we imposed on monday in response to president putin s recognition of these so called republics in eastern ukraine you have seen that there has been an immediate effect there has been an immediate bite question my final one is on un the vote is delayed for an hour do you know why mr price i do not you would need to ask the un question are you confident you ve got uae and india to say to vote yes mr price we are confident that the russian federation will be and will be shown to be isolated on the world stage we are confident that our partners that our allies around the world will stand in very clear very stark opposition to this aggression to this assault on ukraine s territorial integrity to its independence to its sovereignty we have every expectation that message will emanate loud and clear from this un session question all your partners including india and uae mr price we have every expectation that message will be loud and clear to the russian federation unambiguous to president putin yes question can i follow up on something that you said when you were speaking with matt you said if you were listen to the blunder of president putin you might believe he was willing to go beyond ukraine do you have reason to believe that that is the case mr price president putin knows because we have stated very clearly that our commitment to nato nato s article 5 an attack on one is an attack on all is as vibrant is as sacrosanct as it was at nato s founding some seven decades ago you heard the president say again yesterday that we will fight for every inch of nato territory that is a message that we have made very clear in public it is a message that we have conveyed very clearly in private i have no doubt that that message has reached president putin question off mike question and one separate question oh if you want to do a follow up question inaudible thank you but is there anything specific to indicate the nato secretary general said today that there are indications that the kremlin s objectives spanned beyond ukraine is there anything to suggest from the u s s perspective that they do mr price well what we have seen from president putin not only in recent days but in recent years is his desire to go back to an era that has long since passed an era in which spheres of influence are acceptable an era in which large countries can bully small countries an era in which might equals right that is an era that should have ended certainly with the fall of the berlin wall certainly with the end of the cold war but of course president putin has other desires other aspirations it is our task to reinforce the rules that have again governed the international community over the course of some 70 years but certainly in more recent years since the end of the cold war abigail question can you give us any update on your efforts to help americans who are still in who are still in ukraine i know you are always hesitant to give exact numbers but do you have any further indication of how many americans have crossed over the border into poland for instance mr price so as you ve heard us say we don t have precise figures in any country around the world of the number of americans who are present in a foreign country at any given time and you know those reasons well we don t track americans we don t require them to register we don t require them to unregister when they leave a country in the case of ukraine however we did have an estimate and we do have an estimate dated from october of last year of americans resident in ukraine at the time october of 2021 there were 6 600 americans resident in ukraine by our estimation and that estimation was based on data from our ukrainian partners it was based on data that was available to us as well including data from local organizations that same month october of 2021 is the very same month that we started warning americans not to travel to ukraine it was those warnings were later superseded by clear and consistent encouragement to americans to leave the country and most recently warnings that americans should leave the country so since october of 2021 we have seen a sweeping shift in the advice and guidance we have provided to americans who either sought to travel to ukraine or americans who might have been resident in ukraine so while we don t have a firm number of americans who are there we have good reason to believe and i think all of you have good reason to conclude that the number of americans in ukraine now is far lower than 6 600 what we have been doing over the course of weeks now is communicating with americans who are located in ukraine asking them to be in touch with us providing us their contact information so that we in turn can provide them specific tailored guidance about what they should do to depart the country we have done so in the context of commercial air travel when that was available and now more recently we ve provided specific consistent guidance on how americans can travel overland to leave the country including offering them specific advice as to which border crossings to go to so that they can travel from ukraine into poland with ease we ve conducted diplomacy with our polish allies to make sure that americans need not provide any sort of advance notice when they seek to travel from ukraine into poland we ve set up a welcome center on the polish side of the border with representatives of the state department there to offer them any advice any forms any guidance they may need to complete their onward travel so we ve been in regular consistent touch with americans who are in ukraine and americans who have made that travel into poland yes sir question ned if i may i d like to follow on sanctions so you mentioned those additional measures means additional sanctions but what might be the trigger what might trigger them so what else are you waiting from moscow moscow is bombing kyiv and other ukrainian cities i have the moral right to tell about this and not speculating because my family spent this night in the shelter so what might what else might happened and to just push administration to apply the additional sanctions and secondly if i may there are a lot of talks in ukraine about the possibility of some kind of talks with the russians president zelenskyy told about this in his statement that maybe america and united kingdom may backing ukraine in those conversations so what s your message to ukraine do you think that it s necessary right now or it s the wrong way thank you mr price thank you so we do believe that diplomacy is the only responsible way to address this that was our belief prior to the start of the russian invasion it is our belief now that the russian invasion and assault on ukraine has begun at the same time we want to see diplomacy conducted in a context in an environment in which it can succeed our concern had been prior to the russian invasion that again moscow was using the so called pretense of diplomacy pretending to take part in serious diplomatic discussions having these staged highly choreographed meetings of the national security council where president putin would instruct his lieutenants to engage in diplomacy only as he continued to amass his forces now we see offers of diplomacy at the barrel of a gun we see these offers as tanks continue to roll across the border as your fellow countrymen your fellow countrywomen remain subject to unimaginable levels of violence and brutality by the russian federation we want to make clear to president putin that diplomacy by the barrel of a gun coercive diplomacy is not something that we are going to take part in it is not something that will bring an end to this conflict in a real genuine and sustainable way we do want to see diplomacy succeed that is why we are doing everything we can through our public messaging but in some ways much more importantly through the measures we have introduced over the past couple days coercive measures that are designed to contour president putin s next moves to put pressure on his economy on his financial system on those around him and on president putin himself so that we see de escalation we see diminution of violence we see withdrawal of forces we have not seen any of those things just yet but these measures were just instituted and it is our sincere desire to see this going forward so that we can work diplomatically to bring an end to this senseless unprovoked violence in terms of sanctions as we ve said we have instituted the most biting the most crippling the most devastating set of sanctions together with our allies and partners that the world has ever seen and we have additional measures that if we do not see de escalation if we do not see a diminution in violence that we are prepared to enact again together with our allies and partners yes question following up on this there was a memo sent around today to state department employees calling for the cancellation of all government to government contacts with russia unless it was a major national security interest topic and those were listed i m just wondering what the goal of that approach is what you guys think that does mr price the goal of could you question the goal of cutting off most of the contacts unless it s of a high national security interest topic mr price so again russia s actions its needless unprovoked unnecessary brutal campaign against ukraine has fundamentally changed the relationship that moscow has not only with the united states but with countries around the world the flavor the look the feel of our relationship with moscow is very different today than it was last week or even a few days ago at the same time we have national security priorities national security imperatives and there may be some areas in which the fulfillment of our national security priorities and imperatives require us to engage to coexist at some level with the russian federation these are areas that are of overriding importance to us and there are a few that come to mind but the point is that moscow is now a pariah on the world stage president putin is a pariah on the world stage his economy will suffer his financial system will suffer moscow s strategic ambitions will suffer moscow s strategic positioning and strength will suffer but again we are always going to pursue what s in our national security interest however we need to do that yes paul question ned you ve spoken about the u s rejecting this idea of talks in minsk but the talks were offered with ukraine and i don t think ukraine has stated its position if i m right are you telling ukraine you wouldn t stop you wouldn t support them if they entered talks mr price we are a partner of the ukrainian government we re a partner of the ukrainian people we will partner with them in real constructive diplomacy just as in our engagement with the russian federation whether that was on a bilateral basis whether it was through the nato russia council whether it was through the osce we incorporated the viewpoints we incorporated the perspectives we incorporated the interests of our ukrainian partners into that so we are here to support our ukrainian partners not only diplomatically that s important we are supporting them with our security assistance unprecedented levels of security assistance that will only continue to increase now that putin has made this disastrous decision our support for ukraine s economy just last week the secretary signed a fourth 1 billion loan guarantee we have continued through other means to provide stability to the ukrainian economy financial system and through our humanitarian support we provided 52 million in humanitarian funding for the people of ukraine last year we will continue to provide significant levels of humanitarian support to the ukrainian people this year yes question following on that so has the u s advised the ukrainians against entering into any diplomatic talks with moscow and do you believe that that offer today was made in bad faith mr price on your second question it is our belief that moscow has sought to engage in the pretense of diplomacy they clearly it appears attempted to do that prior to the invasion to buy time to continue their preparations for what it now seems clear vladimir putin had intended all along i don t think it takes a grand geopolitical analyst to know that an offer of diplomacy as you rain down bombs mortar shells as your tanks advance towards a capital of 2 9 million people as your forces encircle a capital as your political leaders make demands of demilitarization make demands of a fundamentally neutral foreign policy essentially removing agency that kyiv should otherwise have that is not the context in which diplomacy can succeed i think it is fair to say that we see eye to eye with our ukrainian partners on that front president biden as you know spoke to president zelenskyy earlier today secretary blinken as you know spoke to foreign minister kuleba earlier today we will continue to provide guidance to share information with our ukrainian partners they in turn are continuing to provide updates to us and we are ensuring that everything we do will be fully coordinated and that we ll be operating in pure lockstep question president zelenskyy said last night to western interlocutors that it might be the last time that he s seen alive is the u s in any discussions with the ukrainian government about securing their safety are they moving them outside of the country or otherwise have the ukrainians made such a request or the u s made such an offer mr price we are in constant discussion with our ukrainian partners again the president today the secretary today the secretary a couple of days ago spoke to foreign minister kuleba a couple days before that he spoke to foreign minister kuleba and that s only at the senior most levels at working levels we have been in regular contact with our ukrainian partners about the challenges they re facing about the ways we will continue to support them their security needs their humanitarian needs their economic needs their political needs but i wouldn t want to characterize it beyond that question ned mr price yes question the president president zelenskyy also made an appeal for a no fly zone is any consideration being given to that mr price we are in regular dialogue as i just said with our ukrainian partners we are looking at a range of ways we can continue to support them but i wouldn t want to go beyond that lalit question on a halt in the bilateral talks with russia can you give us a couple of examples of issues that are of such significant national security interest that you they will continue mr price well i ll offer one at least of course it remains in our interest to see to it that iran is never able to acquire a nuclear weapon the fact that russia has now invaded ukraine should not give iran the green light to develop a nuclear weapon to weaponize to move towards the point at which it can quickly acquire a nuclear weapon it remains as in our interest today to deny iran that ability than it was on saturday question okay mr price lalit question thank you i wanted to ask you about question wait wait hold on okay that s one but the list that i saw goes includes the arctic council it includes climate change talks is there anything significant that like does it include the strategic dialogue mr price we have no plans to take part in another strategic dialogue at the moment question at the moment mr price at the moment question and again all of this stuff is suspension it s not permanent so should russia change its mr price the point question its course these would resume mr price the much like sanctions these are a means to an end what we are trying to do is to change on an urgent basis moscow s behavior to bring this violence to an end to bring this conflict to an end to bring the suffering that russia is inflicting on the ukrainian people to an end lalit question i want to ask you about india u s relationship in the context of the russian ukrainian crisis you know india has a strong relationship with russia and so has with the united states as well has the ukrainian crisis strained india u s relationship mr price we have a broad strategic partnership with india as you know we had an opportunity to see our indian counterpart foreign minister jaishankar in australia just the other day when we were in the indo pacific for a meeting of the quad what we have done including in the context of the bilateral discussion we had with foreign minister jaishankar in sydney sorry in melbourne was to share our fervent belief that countries around the world especially those countries that have a level of influence of clout of leverage with the russian federation needed to use that to good effect needed to use that to protect the rules based international order again that have worked to the benefit of the united states that have worked to the benefit of our european allies that have worked to the benefit of india and quite frankly have worked to the benefit of the russian federation over the course of some 70 years we share important interests with india we share important values with india and we know india has a relationship with russia that is distinct from the relationship that we have with russia of course that is okay what we have asked of every country around the world is that they use that leverage to good effect to uphold those norms those rules that have been at the center again of unprecedented levels over the past 70 years of security stability and prosperity question do you believe that india has influence or leverage over russia mr price india has a relationship with russia that we certainly don t have india and russia have a relationship including in the defense and security sector that we don t have and again we have asked every country that has a relationship and certainly those countries that have leverage to use that leverage in a constructive way question i have one more question on pakistan s prime minister imran khan was recently in moscow when russian attacked ukraine this is the first time in 20 years a pakistani prime minister had visited russia do you see realignment of forces there mr price well i will leave it to our pakistani partners to speak to their position on this what i can say is that we communicated to pakistan our position on what was then the threat of a russian invasion and what is now the ongoing russian invasion against ukraine just as india does pakistan knows precisely where we stand on this these are again rules norms guidelines that benefit india pakistan the united states and russia as well yes sir question thank you i have a follow up on minsk talks and a broader point about the conflict is the united states has the united states been explicitly asking the ukrainians not to take part in the proposed talks mr price we have been in regular contact with our ukrainian partners we want to see diplomacy we want to see diplomacy succeed and we want that precisely because only through diplomacy can we bring an end to this needless unprovoked brutal conflict and only through diplomacy can we save lives on a sustainable basis so first and most important we want to see diplomacy we want to see diplomacy succeed a corollary to that we want to know that russia is actually interested in genuine diplomacy it now appears quite clear that russia was not and has not been interested in genuine diplomacy they were interested in the pretense of diplomacy and as i said before in the context of the ongoing invasion diplomacy at the barrel of a gun that is not genuine diplomacy that is coercive diplomacy that is coercion with the guise of diplomatic niceties that is not something that can bring an end to this conflict in a way that we know it must end question and my broader point if i may why do you think this military operation is taking place is this because the russians are so inherently evil that they woke up one day and decided to attack a neighboring country or is it because of some broader and deeper roots that needs to be addressed like for instance the international security architecture doesn t work in its current form mr price you ll have to ask that question of president putin only he can give you a good answer to or he only he can give you an answer i m not sure it ll be a good one to explain his decisions but let me make one point this is not and was not a decision of the russian people this was a decision that was made for them this was not a decision that was made by them and even in recent hours in recent days we have seen thousands of brave russians take to the streets peacefully to demonstrate against what they see as precisely what we see an unprovoked an unjustified a needless war that will inflict costs not only on ukraine but also on russia the fact is that russians are unlikely to see their countrymen come back in body bags because putin controls just about every instrument of communication every mass media every element of the mass media but russians will be coming home in body bags this has already had a devastating consequential effect on the russian economy this has already had consequential implications for russia s strategic ambitions both at the present and going forward so this is not a decision judging by what we re seeing from the russian people themselves that they wanted to see this is not a decision that many of them support the american people the united states government we are standing on the side of those russians who are peacefully taking to the streets to voice their concern their criticism their in some cases deep condemnation of what is going on and to exert the rights that are as universal to them as they are to anyone anywhere else they are doing this in the face of continued crackdowns against the exercise of these same very same universal rights this is just as we have said of so many other tactics straight from putin s playbook the fact that dissent of this nature peaceful protests peaceful demonstrations are quashed and crushed in short order that is symptomatic of a deep seated insecurity on the part of president putin of those around him so i want to be very clear that even though this was a decision a reckless brutal costly decision by president putin and his lieutenants we are under no illusions that this has the support of the russian people and in fact we re seeing the russian people indicate very clearly many of them that this is something they reject question can i have one more on that mr price sure question would the united states like to see a resumption of talks on euro atlantic security and maybe even talks with china about the international security architecture overall to maybe try and update it or overhaul it as necessary mr price so i ll make two points prior to the onset of this needless war we had made a genuine good faith offer together with our allies and partners to discuss with the russian federation certain areas where we thought we could make progress on a reciprocal basis these would have been discussions about just as you said broader european security architecture the placement of offensive missiles in europe arms control protocols arms control agreements when it steps when it comes to stability transparency as well that was very much on the table the russian federation again engaged in this pretense of diplomacy with us there was an exchange as everyone knows by now of written proposals written responses there were high level meetings all of which culminated in what we ve now seen the russian invasion of ukraine perhaps an invasion that was planned all along that is not our near term priority our near term priority for diplomacy going forward is to bring as quickly as possible an end to this needless violence this brutality that the russian federation is directing against the ukrainian state against the ukrainian government and against the ukrainian people that is our near term focus question can i go back question can i follow up question to these bilateral talks just for a second because i think i asked the wrong question i should have instead of asking you what is exempted because i ve seen the list of exemptions and it s frankly huge can you give us an example of the kinds of talks that now are no longer going to take place mr price you re asking me to question well i mean are we talking about cultural exchanges or what mr price matt i question i mean because if you look at the list of stuff that s exempted you start with the jcpoa you go to climate you go to covid you go to anything having to do with consular affairs mr price what you will see question you go to anything that the seventh floor thinks is significant enough which could be anything so i m just wondering what it is that is that mr price you will see you will see question you have the arctic council in there you have every single like mr price you will see you will see a focus on our core national security interests question yeah but every international organization contact with the russians at every international organization is carved out it s exempted from this mr price matt i m not sure this question everything from the icao to the arctic council to the osce to mr price we are going to pursue question oh i know so what is what has been banned or halted because of this directive mr price we are going to pursue what is in our national security interest some of the things you just listed are fundamental to our national security interests just because russia has taken this action doesn t mean that we should stop caring about our own security the well being the welfare the safety the security of the american people you ve seen for yourself at least what purports to be a list of areas where we need to engage we might need to engage to pursue those core national security interests i will leave it to your well informed imagination what might not meet that criteria question i m not no i m just wondering can you point to something specific that is now no longer able to be talked about with the russians bilaterally because of this because it just seems like almost everything that one can imagine except for i don t know licensing for artwork to come to be loaned to a museum mr price the russian question is included is exempted mr price the unprovoked russian invasion of ukraine has contoured has changed our bilateral relationship so question i m not i understand that i m question i have something specific that i want to ask about arms talks mr price please please vivian about what talks question are arms talks arms talks mr price so question are they off the table completely now mr price at this point we do not have any plans for the next iteration of the strategic stability dialogue arms control is an area whether it s in the context of the jcpoa if you want to consider that an arms control agreement or the fact that the united states and the russian federation have the two largest nuclear arsenals on the planet it would remain in our national security interest to see to it that nuclear material nuclear warheads that nuclear stockpiles remain under control in the positive control of the russian federation that stockpiles that remain that nuclear arsenals remain small as small as possible certainly arms control is something that will continue to be in our national security interest but we don t have another iteration of the strategic stability dialogue planned question i have a specific thing on that so today the in london they canceled the performance of the bolshoi ballet yesterday the kennedy center canceled the performance of a russian ballet are cultural exchange exchanges or commercially commercial cultural visits now off the table in the u s mr price i don t want to be categorical about it again this is not a decision that was taken by the russian people this was a decision question but i mean this is still i understand that i m sorry to interrupt but i understand that the russian people didn t do this but still is the u s will the u s be blocking this i mean you ve had a member of congress a democrat who suggested that russian students should be expelled from u s schools and expelled from the u s so are we going that far that we re not going to allow russian cultural visits or it indicates mr price we are exacting we are exacting costly consequences for president putin for those around him for the kremlin for the russian government our goal is not to punish the russian people our goal is to stand with the russian people many of whom are taking to the streets in protest of this war that has the potential to devastate their country their economy their society as well so again i m not prepared to tell you today precisely what will be canceled whether the bolshoi will be coming to washington within the next several days or several weeks what i can tell you is that we are going to continue to exact costing costly consequences for the kremlin but we will continue to stand up for the universal rights of the russian people question should you go ahead and follow suit not you personally but treasury or whoever is going to be announcing the the eu sanctions that were introduced today against president putin and foreign minister lavrov i just want to be clear would that complicate any communication between the president and the president or the secretary and the foreign minister or any meetings that mr price so you ve just posed a hypothetical wrapped in a hypothetical so it s a little bit difficult for me to question well question it s about to happen mr price for me to answer that question well should we mr price and i appreciate the breaking news updates from reuters laughter question should we ask again in 10 minutes laughter mr price hopefully i ll be out of here in 10 minutes laughter what i would say is that we will always keep the door open to diplomacy question okay so mr price we would not do anything that would shut the door to genuine diplomacy question okay so these and so such talks would be ones that are like exempted mr price you re not going to extract anything else from me on this front at this time at least dmitry question inaudible mr price sure question you announced i mean the state department has announced recently the expulsion of the russian dcm from your point of view it s a response to what the russians have been doing the russians are saying pretty much the same thing this vicious cycle has been going on for some time now and this is not the policy stuff this is purely technical issues why can t you resolve those problems of at least letting your diplomatic missions to work properly the russians are saying guys let s reset all those mutual claims that we have you re saying no or that s my understanding and i d like to hear your take on that mr price i think you might be misinformed we have been very clear that especially during times of tensions especially during times of crisis especially during times of conflict it is important for governments to be able to communicate to correspond with one another what we ve seen from the russian federation over the course of months now has been a constriction on the part of our embassy operations in moscow most recently we saw them on an unprovoked basis expel our dcm the watchwords the buzzword for us is parity that s precisely what we are seeking the russian embassy here in washington is more resourced better resourced than is our diplomatic mission in moscow we re looking for parity we re looking for fairness so this step we announced yesterday the fact that we had expelled or indicated to the russian federation that we would be expelling their second ranking official here in washington it was not a response to russia s invasion of ukraine it was a response to what russia has done to our bilateral mission in moscow all right thank you all very much question thank you the briefing was concluded at 3 34 p m

take lowering your tax bill generally comes down to two things tax credits and tax deductions tax credits directly reduce the amount of money you owe to lower your overall tax liability if you get a 1 000 tax credit then your tax bill is reduced by 1 000 there are a variety of tax credits including credits for parents education and saving for retirement tax deductions work to reduce the amount of income that is subject to taxation contributing to a 401 k with your employer is one example advertisement article continues below this ad if you re debating filing your taxes on your own or hiring a professional ask yourself a few questions first do you feel comfortable filing your taxes on your own next have you experienced any major life changes like becoming self employed or becoming a parent that would make your tax situation more complicated than in previous years and do you know how to vet a tax professional do your research into both options before jumping into a decision about which way to go know how to navigate capital gains if you sold an asset like stocks in the previous tax year how long you held the asset before selling determines your capital gains rate if you sold the asset less than a year after purchasing it you are subject to short term capital gains which is generally the same as your income tax rate but if you held onto the asset for more than a year before selling you are subject to long term capital gains which is 0 15 or 20 depending on your income and filing status our tips know your comfort level if your tax situation is simple you can probably get away with filing on your own but if you are unsure about how to manage your taxes you might want to hire a professional if your tax situation is simple you can probably get away with filing on your

advertisement article continues below this ad sean this episode is all about taxes we are taking on a few of your money questions about filing taxes this year including whether you should diy your taxes how to know what you owe and navigating capital gains and we are joined by tax nerd sabrina parys to answer your questions but first in our this week in your money segment we are talking about what will and will not minimize your tax bill liz there can be a lot of confusion about this topic so sean and i wanted to dig into the subject to help you navigate your own tax situation lowering your tax bill generally comes down to two things tax deductions and tax credits each works in different ways so we wanted to lay out how you can make the most of your credits and if possible your deductions we also wanted to do a little bit of myth busting too sean and let s start by talking about tax credits tax credits are essentially a dollar for dollar way to reduce your tax bill so if you get a credit for 500 your tax bill would then be lowered by 500 liz and some of the most common tax credits fall into just a few categories for example credits for parents like the child tax credit that a lot of people started receiving monthly last year another one is the adoption tax credit there are also credits for investing in education or retirement if you meet certain income qualifications there are credits for green purchases as well like if you buy an electric car or you put solar panels on your roof advertisement article continues below this ad sean and tax deductions on the other hand lower your taxable income and thus your tax liability deductions can be more common but also more misunderstood than tax credits common deductions are contributions to things like 401 k s or health savings accounts these are often called pre tax contributions because the amount that you put into these accounts are not taxed liz but there are a number of deductions you can only take if you itemize so when you file your taxes you can either take the standard deduction or you can itemize but you can t do both and generally you have to have more itemized deductions to itemize does that make sense sean so yes it does but it gets a little bit technical because you want to see if all of the itemized deductions would exceed the amount that is the standard deduction which for the 2021 tax year is 12 550 for single filers or 25 100 for those who are married and filing jointly so when i was going through to do my taxes this year i looked at all of my potential deductions essentially it was my property taxes for my house and i saw that my deductions did not exceed 12 550 so i took the standard deduction liz whereas with my husband and i we live in los angeles and our mortgage is probably a bit larger than yours so when we put together the property taxes and the mortgage charitable deductions and other things that we deduct we do have enough to itemize our deductions because it was larger than the standard deduction advertisement article continues below this ad sean but a lot of folks can get tangled up sorting through which things are actually deductible and which things are not liz one of the complicating factors is that the law changed a few years ago many more people could itemize their deductions before that law changed than can do it now so maybe their mortgage was helping them at some point but now it no longer is sean there s also a lot of misinformation out there i ve seen influencers on tiktok that have said that you can deduct every expense if you run it through a business the irs will see through that in a heartbeat you probably shouldn t do that liz yes exactly and also you ll hear a number of nonprofit organizations say that you can write off your deductions like give us your car you ll get a tax deduction that s true only if you itemize advertisement article continues below this ad sean it s true in a sense but it s not really the whole picture my 20 a month donation to public radio is not pushing me to the threshold that would make itemizing worth it so the donation does not actually end up being tax deductible for me liz but you re still going to do it right sean oh of course i have to but that said there is an exception for the 2021 tax year folks who made charitable contributions in 2021 may be able to deduct 300 for single filers and 600 if you re married and filing jointly on their tax return without having to itemize liz well that s good news good advertisement article continues below this ad sean i think that is enough about itemizing for now and let s take a brief interlude between our tax conversations to do a check in on our no spend month challenge for new listeners here is the deal the month of february we are doing a no spend month challenge where liz and i are attempting to not spend money on things that we do not need and we are inviting you our beloved listeners to join us so on that note of our listeners we got a couple notes from folks and i want to share them with you guys so one was from a listener named will and he mentioned that he had saved over 700 compared to his spending last month in part thanks to the nerdwallet app which is pretty cool liz wow oh that s great news i m glad he s having a better experience than i am sean nnenna in the bay area left us a message to say that they actually find no spend months to be too restrictive but that they have their own way to curb impulse spending they mentioned that if they want something like an expensive bag they will make a line item on their budget for the next month for that purchase and then they ll set a reminder for that next month to buy the item so that by the time the reminder comes around they will have at once budgeted for it and also waited enough time to see if they truly want that item which can help curb discretionary spending on things that you don t need advertisement article continues below this ad liz oh i love that i have a running list and you re doing this as well of the things that we did not spend money on to remind us why we re doing this but having that little pause built in can really help sean and i m a huge fan of the reminders app on my phone as well i ll use it for about everything so i might take a page out of nnenna s book and try this out for size so liz how has the last week or so been for you with the no spend month challenge liz pretty terrible i needed to take a trip unexpectedly there was an unexpected airfare there was unexpected hotel and meals and then i went shopping with my daughter we re going to scratch off this week as just ok let s do a reset and hope for the rest of the month we ll do better sean as much as this challenge is about actually saving dollars it s about having the conversation with yourself and reevaluating your spending and second guessing your urge to just buy something and i think you ve been doing that every step of the way right advertisement article continues below this ad liz definitely that s definitely true and just feeling guilty about all the spending sean yeah which is hard because you don t want to make this something that is a negative experience for you you don t want to feel bad about failing at something you want to give yourself grace as we talked about in the beginning but as long as you re continuing to have that conversation with yourself reevaluating what you do and don t spend money on i think it s still a success liz i m not throwing in the towel and that s the big difference it s kind of like people who diet and then they blow their diet and then they give up entirely i m not going to give up i m going to keep going and see what else i can do for the rest of this month that will be within the bounds of the no spending month but i m interested to hear how you did with your trip to florida sean well i m back from my vacation and i can proudly say that i stayed strong in the face of very expensive souvenirs advertisement article continues below this ad liz very good sean i went to this beautiful photo gallery in the big cypress national forest with my mom and there were these gorgeous prints of the surrounding landscape and orchids and all these things that i love and i was very tempted to buy prints but they ran in the several hundred dollar range and i just was not prepared to buy that even if i wasn t doing a no spend challenge it would ve been pretty pricey so i felt strong and didn t buy those things however i did spend more on food than i was expecting i think that s just part of having an experience and traveling and getting together with my mom again like i want to have of these great memories and so i allowed myself to spend a little more and i think that s ok i also bought a couple books that s my weakness anytime someone recommends a book to me i tend to just buy it right then and there so i can add it to my list and not forget about it did that a couple times however i will say i have some good wins in here and one is that i have not browsed ebay once since starting this challenge that s one of my biggest weaknesses the app has gone off my phone i haven t even opened the website on my browser because of that alone i estimate that i ve saved around 120 because i was spending about 30 a week on ebay which is kind of embarrassing to admit and also i held strong and i still have not purchased that lego set that i had mentioned before liz despite your heinous attempt at tempting me to buy it by sending me a link to the kit that was on sale i still have not purchased it liz good for you advertisement article continues below this ad sean i m doing really good liz that was evil of me i apologize sean you acknowledged it in the moment that it was evil and i think that maybe allowed me to stay stronger that much easier i m doing ok i mean so far this month i think i ve saved around 300 and as we mentioned before the important thing really is shaking up your shopping habits and i ve totally done that liz that s awesome i love hearing that advertisement article continues below this ad sean i think we ll have one last check in before this is over so listeners if you have anything else to share about how this is going for you please feel free to reach out to us shoot us a text on the nerd hotline 901 730 6373 or email us at podcast nerdwallet com liz let s get into this episode s money question segment with tax nerd sabrina parys welcome onto the podcast sabrina sabrina parys hi liz thanks for having me sean it s great to have you on so let s get into our first of three listener questions it comes from a listener s voicemail and here it is advertisement article continues below this ad listener 1 hi my name is liz and i have a tax related question typically i do my taxes on turbotax but i m wondering at what point i might start to consider the use of a tax professional i m fairly comfortable doing my own taxes in this way since i m single and have your typical income streams and circumstances however this year i was part of a class action litigation that resulted in a settlement and received payments for it i learned from limited research i ve done that generally a settlement payment for personal physical injuries is nontaxable but i know my individual circumstances may change things i m a bit intimidated by this unique situation and i ve started wondering at what point should you consider moving on from doing it yourself to a tax professional thanks so much sean sabrina when do you think someone should switch from their favorite diy tax filing software to hiring a professional sabrina that s a really good question i don t think that there s a rule of thumb necessarily but generally speaking the more complex your tax situation is the more likely you might benefit from some professional guidance liz let s talk about the risks of doing it on your own advertisement article continues below this ad sabrina the irs ultimately puts the responsibility of accurate reporting on you the taxpayer and that s whether or not you use software or a paid professional at the end of the day it really comes down to your comfort level with taxes and how much help you want liz one thing i think about is the audit risk i want to have somebody else represent me in front of the irs if my tax return gets picked for an audit that s just common sense you don t want to go in there and say something stupid and make things worse so even if you do a diy solution if you get a notice from the irs you definitely want a tax pro to help sean and what circumstances might lead someone to making the jump from doing a diy to hiring a cpa sabrina again i don t think there s a simple answer but i can think of a few situations that might lead someone to want to work with a cpa let s talk about major life changes they can often usher in new tax implications let s say that you welcomed your first child last year that means that you might have a dependent to claim for the first time or you might suddenly be eligible for some new tax credits if you re not aware of that you might accidentally leave some money on the table advertisement article continues below this ad sean one thing i was a little surprised by is that when i became a homeowner last year i assumed all right this is it this is the year i have to hire a cpa because now that i can potentially write off my property taxes it s going to be too complicated for me to file my taxes on my own so i need a pro to do it and when i looked into it it actually was not that complicated because i didn t itemize so i ended up doing my taxes through a diy software again this year so even though you do have big life changes that might not mean you need to hire someone to do your taxes for you liz there s certain things like becoming self employed where you really should have a tax pro and it doesn t necessarily need to be a cpa there s another level of tax pros called enrolled agents and most people know what these are but they essentially are tax pros they can represent you in front of the irs but they re not as expensive as a cpa so that s something else to keep in mind sean because that is one factor that in my mind is a little bit of a deterrent to hiring a cpa or any kind of tax pro is how much more expensive it can become to file your taxes liz so sabrina are there other situations where people should think about hiring a tax pro advertisement article continues below this ad sabrina whenever you are facing a new situation that s unfamiliar to you and you re not sure what the tax implications are it could be a good idea to work with the tax pro it doesn t necessarily mean that you ll end up using the tax pro to file your return anything like trading especially when it comes to virtual currencies changing your marital status moving to a new state those are tricky situations to navigate sometimes so it could lead to you wanting to work with the cpa sean one thing that i ve noticed a lot of this year is these online tax services promoting the fact that they have professionals on hand if you do have a question it seems like they re trying to bridge the gap between what they offer and what a cpa could do for you sabrina i think that s definitely become a more popular offering for a lot out of these diy providers it s usually in the form of onscreen help or sometimes a full review and that could be a good middle of the road option if you want to stick to the diy software but i think it s also important to know the qualifications of the human helper and make sure that they re able to help you with your particular tax situation sean and you may not be able to do that with someone that is just talking with you through a chat box advertisement article continues below this ad liz that does lead us to how do you vet a potential tax pro sabrina figuring out where to start can feel like the hardest part a good first step could be to ask around your friends coworkers or family members could have some good recommendations for you another resource is also the irs the treasury department has this online directory of tax preparers and it s pretty regularly updated and it works much like another search engine would you can plug in your zip code and filter for tax pros by proximity and even by their type of credential sean speaking of credentials what sort of titles and qualifications should people be looking for sabrina tax preparers can have a lot of credentials and i think it can be hard to wrap your head around that a basic requirement a tax preparer who charges for their services must at least have what the irs calls a ptin or a preparer tax identification number that s also a fairly basic requirement so you might want to look for someone who s credentialed someone who like liz mentioned earlier is a cpa or a certified public accountant or an ea an enrolled agent or even a tax attorney it could add some extra security to the process advertisement article continues below this ad sean what kind of questions would you want to ask any potential tax pro that you want to hire sabrina that is a really critical thing to think about because even if someone seems qualified you probably want to ask a few things before you sign on any dotted line you can ask how long have you worked as a tax preparer are you a generalist or do you specialize in some area of taxation how long will it take to prepare my return and importantly how will you bill me will it be a flat fee will it be hourly asking some of those questions could also help you to spot red flags i think for example you ll want to be wary of a tax preparer who promises you a refund without even looking at your tax documents liz yeah sean i can see how it could be tempting to go with someone who seems convenient and nearby but folks should remember that they re handing over very sensitive documents to any sort of person that they would hire so you want to make sure that they are certified to do this kind of work and that you feel good working with them and can trust them any other thoughts around the diy cpa debate advertisement article continues below this ad sabrina at the end of the day how you want to do your taxes and who you want helping you is going to be a highly personal decision so like any other thing that s important do your research and figure out what works best for you liz and back to my fear of audits not all tax pros can represent you in front of the irs so that s something else to keep in the mix when you re thinking about this sean well let s get onto our second listener question listener 2 hi nerds my name is ying and i m calling from pennsylvania and my money question to you guys is what are taxes and how would we know when something needs to be paid or filed for taxes and when we would need to pay or file for those taxes i know it might seem like a trivial question but i ve always had my parents take care of my taxes for me and as a soon to be college graduate i kind of want to learn about it more and hopefully take on that responsibility of myself so with that i ve recently opened a roth ira account and a brokerage account to start investing the money that i have on the side and to my understanding i do have to eventually file and pay for taxes on those i m just wondering if you guys can answer those questions and i just want to thank you guys for listening and big fan of the podcast thank you advertisement article continues below this ad sean ok i love this question because it gets a little philosophical what are taxes what are they i don t know i do know i wish i didn t but anyway our listener has a lot of things that they want information about and let s start at that basic level what are taxes liz well taxes are money you pay the government or else so not filing or not paying what you owe can incur serious penalties that s why this is so important to know sean our listener is also wondering about how taxes factor in with roths what s going on there liz ok the good news about roths is that you don t pay taxes on the growth or on withdrawals in retirement now that s different from most retirement accounts because most retirement accounts give you a deduction upfront and your money grows tax deferred but you pay taxes when it comes out with roths you don t get that upfront deduction but the money s tax free in retirement that s why people get so excited about it advertisement article continues below this ad sean it s the pretax versus post tax way of paying for retirement funding or retirement account with a roth you put money that s basically in your checking account into this retirement account manually versus with something like a 401 k it s automatically withdrawn typically and put into these accounts and is thus pretax liz exactly and we always talk about the importance of tax diversification of having money in different tax buckets so you can control your tax bill better when you get to retirement sean well speaking of taxes and investments one quick note we are not financial or investment advisors this is just general information our listener seems concerned about knowing how much they would potentially owe and how can people figure out what they might owe from their brokerage account and investments liz your brokerage account is going to send you a form that s called a 1099 b and that summarizes your transactions for the year you ll use that to fill out a schedule d on your 1040 tax return you can use tax filing software but if you are an active trader you might want to consider using a tax professional at least for a year or two while you get the hang of it something else people need to know crypto transactions are taxable too so if you ve been trading cryptocurrency or you have sold cryptocurrency and made a profit that is taxable honey and you need to declare to the irs sorry advertisement article continues below this ad sean this is the dark side of the gamification of buying crypto and investing is you got to pay taxes on it these things liz yeah sean now let s get onto our third listener question it comes from a listener s email and here it is they wrote if you sell stocks in less than a year of holding them and make a 15 500 profit it s taxed as capital gains right then if you sell some losses held short or long term does that lower the capital gains tax on the profits i m mixed up as to whether it s worth it to sell losses before the end of the year or just hold sincerely carol liz ok sabrina can you explain what capital gains tax is how it works and what s the difference between short term and long term when it comes to capital gains taxes advertisement article continues below this ad sabrina sure capital gains are a really critical concept for anyone who s investing to understand basically anytime that you make a profit on the sale of an asset like let s say the share of a stock that profit is called the capital gain and it gets subject to taxation and the rate at which that gain gets taxed depends on how long you held the asset for before you sold it so let s say that you held onto it for more than a year before you sold it it gets taxed at the long term rate which is either zero 15 or 20 depending on your income and your filing status and if you held the asset for less than a year before selling you ll get taxed at the short term rate which is equal to your ordinary income tax rate aka your tax bracket and that rate is generally less advantageous than the long term rate because it can be steeper for most people sean let s also talk about tax loss harvesting which it seems like our listener is also asking about here can you explain what that is and its relationship if any to capital gains sabrina sure so tax loss harvesting other than being a mouthful is also a tricky concept to wrap your head around but i think what it really boils down to is that you re essentially selling an asset at a loss to offset your gains now that doesn t sound great at first i don t think anyone really approaches investing with the goal of losing money right but when you sell an asset at a loss and you get to subtract that loss from your total gains for the year you re actually lowering the amount of your capital gains that reduces or even eliminates how much you might get taxed on them liz and the thing with capital gains is you first offset your long term capital gains with your long term capital losses and then your short term capital gains with your short term capital losses and then you net those two out so it s a lot of math sabrina talk about what happens if you have a loss after all that math is done advertisement article continues below this ad sabrina right so let s say you had a less than stellar year and you ended up realizing more losses than gains with tax loss harvesting there s another silver lining you can also deduct up to 3 000 of those losses from your ordinary income on your taxes each year let s say those losses exceed 3 000 another nice bonus is that you can continue deducting the balance on future returns until it s exhausted liz ok so it doesn t go away if you can t use it that year you can use it in subsequent years sabrina correct liz ok cool advertisement article continues below this ad sean i m going to say my head is spinning just slightly from all of this and to bring it back to our first listener s question i think this would be a great area where you might want to hire a professional to manage your taxes if you re even considering throwing out the word tax loss harvesting when it comes to filing your own liz but people need to be careful about something known as the wash sale rule sabrina typically when you participate in tax loss harvesting that asset that you ended up selling for a loss gets replaced with another similar asset and that s in order to maintain your portfolio s goals or your asset allocation but it s important to know that at least 30 days need to pass between the sale of that first asset that you sold for a loss and the purchase of the similar replacement otherwise you ll trigger a wash sale and that will basically disallow all that loss that you can claim liz it s also important to point out that tax loss harvesting only works for investments in taxable accounts it won t work on things like 401 k s iras 529s any account that s already tax sheltered advertisement article continues below this ad sean so our listener carol is also wondering about whether there s any benefit to timing the sale of stocks for a tax benefit what do you guys think sabrina as a precursor i think that it s important to say that taxes even though they might feel like it are not the be all and end all of life and you should generally not make a decision to do something just because of them but that being said tax loss harvesting does have the obvious benefit of resulting in some tax savings which can be great but that doesn t mean that it s an approach that makes sense 100 of the time sean yeah if you sell awesome stock that had a bad year you might potentially lose out on growth the next year right sabrina exactly advertisement article continues below this ad liz or if you bought something else to replace it it might not perform as well as the thing that you sold so you ve got to have another reason for doing this other than just wanting to offset some gains sean yeah and in the past we ve talked about the risks of timing the market and this seems like another one liz yeah any final thoughts about tax loss harvesting sabrina sabrina at the end of the day tax loss harvesting is a strategy that s important to know about but it should also operate hand in hand with your investment goals i think some people tend to use it as a year round strategy other people tend to use it at the end of the year some people don t use it at all if you have any doubts about what kind of approach makes sense for you i think it s always good idea like we talked about earlier to work with a tax professional they can help you think about what tax minimization strategies make sense for your long term goals advertisement article continues below this ad liz excellent good advice sean great sabrina thank you so much for answering our listeners questions today sabrina yeah thank you for having me sean and with that let s get on to our takeaway tips first up know your comfort level if your tax situation is simple you can probably get away with filing on your own but if you are unsure about how to manage your taxes you might want to hire a professional advertisement article continues below this ad liz next brush up on capital gains obligations the amount of time you hold onto an investment can have big implications for the taxes you owe sean and lastly consider using losses to offset some gains tax loss harvesting may help you reduce your tax bill but check with a tax pro if you are not sure and

are one of many variables that we consider ultimately whether society meets its goals to decarbonise is not within shell s control while we intend to travel this journey in step with society only governments can create the framework for success the sky 1 5 scenario starts with data from shell s sky scenario but there are important updates first the outlook uses the most recent modelling for the impact and recovery from covid 19 consistent with a sky 1 5 scenario narrative second it blends this projection into existing sky 2018 energy system data by around 2030 third the extensive scaleup of nature based solutions is brought into the core scenario which benefits from extensive new modelling of that scale up in 2018 nature based solutions required to achieve 1 5 c above pre industrial

estimates to 2020 from various sources particularly the extensive international energy agency energy statistics as with sky this scenario assumes that society achieves the 1 5 c stretch goal of the paris agreement it is rooted in stretching but realistic development dynamics today but explores a goal oriented way to achieve that ambition we worked back in designing how this could occur considering the realities of the situation today and taking into account realistic timescales for change of course there is a range of possible paths in detail that society could take to achieve this goal although achieving the goal of the paris agreement and the future depicted in sky 1 5 while maintaining a growing global economy will be extremely challenging today it is still a technically possible path shell s operating plan outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten year period and are updated every year they reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video a sonoma county judge approved a second delay in hearings on criminal charges from the 2019 kincade fire as pg e attempts to negotiate a settlement santa rosa calif a judge in sonoma county approved more time friday for settlement negotiations delaying hearings in the criminal case against pg e for the 2019 kincade fire despite voicing concerns about the length of the delay during an active preliminary hearing judge mark urioste granted the pause requested by both sides sonoma county prosecutors and pg e s attorneys reported making progress on a deal they first announced was in the works earlier this week asking until mar 14 neither side has said whether pg e would plead guilty to any crimes in the deal being negotiated a fact that leaves advocates for safety and accountability concerned sonoma county district attorney jill ravitch filed 33 criminal charges against pg e including reckless arson and environmental crimes for causing smoke pollution no one burned to death in the 2019 kincade fire but there were close calls prosecutors filed enhancements to felony charges that include serious injuries to firefighters the kincade fire destroyed more than 100 homes during a massive series of october windstorms in 2019 when pg e had intentionally switched off power to millions of californians in the name of preventing fires the high voltage transmission line that sparked the kincade fire was left on pg e admits to sparking the fire but denies it committed any crimes civil or criminal pg e has attempted to pay money to avoid criminal prosecution before after it sparked the 2018 camp fire pg e tried to avoid criminal prosecution by offering large monetary settlements under civil laws instead according to butte county district attorney mike ramsey he refused the offers arguing that it was important to label the company s criminal acts as the crimes they were you are a killer corporation ramsey said in an interview after pg e was convicted do you understand that in 2020 pg e pleaded guilty to 84 felony counts of involuntary manslaughter the deadliest homicide ever committed by a corporation in the united states the company was convicted of criminal negligence which amounts to an admission that the company acted in a way a reasonable person would know could cause injury and death it s similar to the kind of criminality in drunk driving fatalities only prosecutors contend pg e s actions were worse because they involved greedy and selfish motives of maximizing profits advocates for holding pg e accountable say the kincade fire which was sparked in a manner similar to the camp fire should also result in a criminal conviction for similar reasons this is not a matter that should be settled unless it includes guilty pleas said attorney mike aguirre who previously worked as a prosecutor and the city attorney for san diego the best way to do the most good for the most people is to enforce the law not to become part of the whole civil settlement debacle all of pg e s victims in the camp fire along with other fires the company caused in 2015 and 2017 are still waiting on compensation from pg e the company settled in bankruptcy court by creating a trust fund that was paid half in shares of pg e stock the shares have never been worth the 6 75 billion fire survivors were told to expect a recently introduced bill in the state legislature would declare an intent to make those victims whole but does not actually contain a plan to make that happen kincade evidence not being released to the public during the first days of preliminary hearings for the kincade fire cal fire arson investigator gary uboldi walked the court through evidence showing how pg e s power line sparked it he pointed to photographs showing a broken pg e power cable and scorch marks that it left on parts of the metal tower that it fell into after snapping apart while it was energized in a scene reminiscent of the 2019 camp fire uboldi said pg e workers were allowed into the crime scene to help collect evidence from the power line that started the kincade fire in both fire investigations pg e s workers were used due to a lack of anyone else qualified and willing to do the work on high voltage lines uboldi testified that on the night of the fire he saw large strings of ceramic insulators connected to the cables swinging almost perpendicular in the wind the power cables on one side of those insulators had been removed when a nearby geothermal power plant shut down years earlier judge urioiste s staff declined to provide copies or allow abc10 to record images of any of the photographs that were displayed in open court the judge had denied requests for news cameras to record on the days when photographs were shown keeping the images from public view has the effect of allowing them to sweep under the rug aguirre argued ahead of friday s hearing urioste denied requests from news outlets to open up the proceedings by providing a live online feed or allowing video or audio to be recorded in court he granted a request for a newspaper photographer who captured images of the lawyers in attendance for the very short hearing friday no evidence was shown other wildfire cases hang in the balance the kincade fire is one of several that has pg e facing criminal trouble right now prosecutors in shasta county filed charges that include four felony counts of involuntary manslaughter against pg e for the 2020 zogg fire butte and several of its neighboring counties also launched a criminal investigation of pg e because of the massive 2021 dixie fire that investigation is being led by the same prosecutors who successfully convicted pg e of sparking the deadly camp fire despite those convictions pg e was allowed last month to exit federal probation for yet more crimes the company committed in the 2010 san bruno gas explosion federal prosecutors declined to take u s district judge william alsup up on his offer to consider extending or ordering a do over of pg e s probation before the maximum five year sentence expired he s one of the multiple judges who ve told pg e it deserves to be in prison for its crimes despite the fictional legal concept that treats them as people corporations can t go to prison prosecutors have described pg e s offenses as crime by committee preventing them from being able to hold individual officers or employees of the utility criminally responsible in the kincade fire hearings before pg e s lawyers and the prosecutors spoke in the sonoma county courtroom they had to wait for judge urioste to read a real life human offender the terms of his probation sentence among the requirements urioste warned the new convict that he s required to obey all laws go deeper this story is part of abc10 s fire power money reporting project if you have a tip that could reveal more about california
