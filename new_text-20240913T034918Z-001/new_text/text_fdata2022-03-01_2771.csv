following russia s invasion of ukraine many self proclaimed ukrainians have asked for donations on social media we verify how to know which ones are untrustworthy russian president vladimir putin launched a military invasion of ukraine just before dawn on feb 24 since then tiktok has been full of videos and livestreams asking for donations for ukraine in most of these videos people ask viewers to donate to a charity but some of the videos and livestreams are of people claiming to be from ukraine asking for personal donations to help themselves or their families it can be difficult to know if a stranger asking for money over social media is who they say they are we ve put together some tips to help you figure out if an account is legit using one account soliciting for personal donations as an example the account sofiapalmroos111 has posted two videos since russia s invasion of ukraine began one of those videos is tagged donateme and the account itself lists a paypal username in its bio and claims to be a ukraine girl living in kiov editor s note we have a list of some legitimate organizations soliciting donations at the end of this article the sources laurie styron executive director of charitywatch says you should generally avoid donating to crowdfunding campaigns or individuals in most cases regarding a crisis like this the only exception to that might be if you personally know someone in the region or you have someone who can vouch for that person styron said in that case the crowdfunding site can be a very convenient easy way to get resources to someone in the region if you don t know the person it s really not the best way to give you re really kind of taking a big risk if you still want to donate directly to individuals you should at least take precautions to make it less likely you re scammed here are six things to be on the lookout for when figuring out if an account is real 1 is the profile picture generic one of the first things you should do is a reverse image search of the account s profile picture you can do a reverse image search by saving an image opening up google images or another search engine s image search clicking the search by image icon and uploading the image into the search bar if that search reveals the picture is actually another person s profile photo or is a stock image then it s likely the person running the account isn t who they say they are in the case of sofiapalmroos111 a reverse image search on google doesn t return any results but that doesn t necessarily mean the photo is unique a reverse image search of the image on the russian search engine yandex reveals that the photo is used for profiles on a number of russian social media websites often alongside different names none of those accounts use the name sofia palmroos which is the name the tiktok account uses a common profile picture or a stock photo profile picture doesn t necessarily mean an account isn t from ukraine or that it s fake a real ukrainian person might want to hide their identity for safety reasons or this might be the one account that actually belongs to the person in the photo but in conjunction with other red flags profile pictures can be the first indicator that a profile might be untrustworthy 2 is the account brand new an account s age is easy to check and can suggest someone might simply be looking to take advantage of a real world tragedy to benefit themselves a newly created account immediately looking for donations from others upon its creation is far less credible than an account that has been around and posting videos long before seeking help from others the sofiapalmroos111 account for example never posted a video until after russia s invasion of ukraine began once again this alone doesn t mean the owner of the account is from somewhere other than ukraine the account could belong to a ukrainian person who didn t use tiktok before heard about the donation drives on the platform and created an account to seek out emergency funds but like a generic profile picture the account s age makes it more suspicious when considering the rest of these five tips as an additional tip an older account might also have giveaways to its inauthenticity if an account has a history of posting videos located somewhere other than ukraine and the account s owner has never talked about being from ukraine or visiting ukraine then it makes it less likely that the person is actually from ukraine if they later seek out donations 3 do the videos posted to the account show real clips from ukraine if a person isn t actually in ukraine they won t be able to record their own video of the invasion one strategy such a person might use is to post video of other events in the place of real footage the first video posted by sofiapalmroos111 depicts an explosion near an apartment building tagged war and ukraine but a yandex reverse image search of a screenshot from that video reveals that it s an image flipped video of a gas station explosion in novosibirsk russia from 2021 the video can be found on an instagram post from june 15 2021 with its location tagged to novosibirsk russian media such as the moscow times and the state run ria novosti news agency reported that a fuel pump at a gas station within the city had exploded on june 14 2021 other angles of the same explosion can be found in a number of youtube videos this video is particularly deceptive because it is of an incident that got little press coverage in mainstream english speaking media most of the people who would have seen the video on tiktok would not have ever seen the original video before it was tagged as part of russia s attack on ukraine 4 have the videos on the account been posted elsewhere by someone else before another way a person from outside of ukraine might pretend to be from the country is to take authentic videos from other accounts and post them like they recorded the video themselves while a real ukrainian person seeking help may post videos from other people they are unlikely to pass it off as their own video the second video posted by sofiapalmroos111 is of a group of helicopters flying across the sky with the caption russian army attacking my country the video is really from kyiv ukraine s capital but it s not from russia s ongoing invasion that video was first posted online on aug 19 2021 by a russian speaking person on facebook who said the video was of helicopters over kyiv at that time ukraine s military was participating in daily rehearsals for a parade to celebrate the 30th anniversary of ukraine s independence scheduled for aug 24 2021 photos and news coverage of the final week of rehearsals could be found in the kyiv post the american government run radio free europe and the pacific press agency while this video is of something that occurred months before russia s invasion it s equally possible for fake accounts to take a video someone else posted the day before or even earlier that day and pass it off as their own if you think you may have seen the video before it s a good idea to see if you might be able to find it again 5 does the account make spelling mistakes it shouldn t make english isn t the first language of a person from ukraine so an account isn t suspicious just because it makes spelling mistakes or has poor grammar but some spelling mistakes put an account s credibility more in question than others the bio for the sofiapalmroos111 account states that the account owner is from kiov instead of kyiv that mistake stands out because based on the ukraine government s official transliteration of the ukrainian alphabet to the roman alphabet used for english ukraine s capital city київ should be spelled kyiv 6 does the account ask for donations through paypal or venmo does paypal work in ukraine what about venmo be wary of accounts asking for money through paypal or venmo the only paypal feature available to ukrainians is the ability to send or spend money ukrainians on paypal cannot receive money from others individuals have different money transfer options than businesses but monito a comparison service for international money transfers lists wise paysend moneygram and other services as ways americans can send money to ukraine monito explains that individuals can t use venmo to send money to ukraine either venmo requires both users in a transaction to have a u s bank account restricting its use internationally what are some credible places to donate to the official twitter account of the ukraine government posted a pair of donation links for helping ukraine s military the first is for a national bank of ukraine fund to support the country s armed forces and the second is a link to a fund for the charity come back alive which provides support for soldiers involved in the war the national bank of ukraine only takes donations through card payments while the come back alive fund accepts both card payments and bitcoin payments the red cross is also active in ukraine and has shared its own donation links for supporting its work in ukraine laurie styron executive director of charitywatch says charity organizations are typically better to donate to than crowdfunding campaigns or individuals because they make sure no one person gets all of the aid for themselves

statements with this non gaap information because management uses such information internally for its operating budgeting and financial planning purposes management also believes that presentation of the non gaap financial measures provides useful information to lucid s investors regarding measures of our financial condition and results of operations that lucid uses to run the business and therefore allows investors to better understand lucid s performance however these non gaap financial and key performance measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under gaap non gaap information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under gaap when understanding lucid s operating performance in addition other companies including companies in our industry may calculate non gaap financial measures and key performance measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures and key performance measures as tools for comparison a reconciliation between gaap and non gaap financial information is presented below investor relations contact investor lucidmotors com media contact media

following russia s invasion of ukraine many self proclaimed ukrainians have asked for donations on social media we verify how to know which ones are untrustworthy russian president vladimir putin launched a military invasion of ukraine just before dawn on feb 24 since then tiktok has been full of videos and livestreams asking for donations for ukraine in most of these videos people ask viewers to donate to a charity but some of the videos and livestreams are of people claiming to be from ukraine asking for personal donations to help themselves or their families it can be difficult to know if a stranger asking for money over social media is who they say they are we ve put together some tips to help you figure out if an account is legit using one account soliciting for personal donations as an example the account sofiapalmroos111 has posted two videos since russia s invasion of ukraine began one of those videos is tagged donateme and the account itself lists a paypal username in its bio and claims to be a ukraine girl living in kiov editor s note we have a list of some legitimate organizations soliciting donations at the end of this article the sources laurie styron executive director of charitywatch says you should generally avoid donating to crowdfunding campaigns or individuals in most cases regarding a crisis like this the only exception to that might be if you personally know someone in the region or you have someone who can vouch for that person styron said in that case the crowdfunding site can be a very convenient easy way to get resources to someone in the region if you don t know the person it s really not the best way to give you re really kind of taking a big risk if you still want to donate directly to individuals you should at least take precautions to make it less likely you re scammed here are six things to be on the lookout for when figuring out if an account is real 1 is the profile picture generic one of the first things you should do is a reverse image search of the account s profile picture you can do a reverse image search by saving an image opening up google images or another search engine s image search clicking the search by image icon and uploading the image into the search bar if that search reveals the picture is actually another person s profile photo or is a stock image then it s likely the person running the account isn t who they say they are in the case of sofiapalmroos111 a reverse image search on google doesn t return any results but that doesn t necessarily mean the photo is unique a reverse image search of the image on the russian search engine yandex reveals that the photo is used for profiles on a number of russian social media websites often alongside different names none of those accounts use the name sofia palmroos which is the name the tiktok account uses a common profile picture or a stock photo profile picture doesn t necessarily mean an account isn t from ukraine or that it s fake a real ukrainian person might want to hide their identity for safety reasons or this might be the one account that actually belongs to the person in the photo but in conjunction with other red flags profile pictures can be the first indicator that a profile might be untrustworthy 2 is the account brand new an account s age is easy to check and can suggest someone might simply be looking to take advantage of a real world tragedy to benefit themselves a newly created account immediately looking for donations from others upon its creation is far less credible than an account that has been around and posting videos long before seeking help from others the sofiapalmroos111 account for example never posted a video until after russia s invasion of ukraine began once again this alone doesn t mean the owner of the account is from somewhere other than ukraine the account could belong to a ukrainian person who didn t use tiktok before heard about the donation drives on the platform and created an account to seek out emergency funds but like a generic profile picture the account s age makes it more suspicious when considering the rest of these five tips as an additional tip an older account might also have giveaways to its inauthenticity if an account has a history of posting videos located somewhere other than ukraine and the account s owner has never talked about being from ukraine or visiting ukraine then it makes it less likely that the person is actually from ukraine if they later seek out donations 3 do the videos posted to the account show real clips from ukraine if a person isn t actually in ukraine they won t be able to record their own video of the invasion one strategy such a person might use is to post video of other events in the place of real footage the first video posted by sofiapalmroos111 depicts an explosion near an apartment building tagged war and ukraine but a yandex reverse image search of a screenshot from that video reveals that it s an image flipped video of a gas station explosion in novosibirsk russia from 2021 the video can be found on an instagram post from june 15 2021 with its location tagged to novosibirsk russian media such as the moscow times and the state run ria novosti news agency reported that a fuel pump at a gas station within the city had exploded on june 14 2021 other angles of the same explosion can be found in a number of youtube videos this video is particularly deceptive because it is of an incident that got little press coverage in mainstream english speaking media most of the people who would have seen the video on tiktok would not have ever seen the original video before it was tagged as part of russia s attack on ukraine 4 have the videos on the account been posted elsewhere by someone else before another way a person from outside of ukraine might pretend to be from the country is to take authentic videos from other accounts and post them like they recorded the video themselves while a real ukrainian person seeking help may post videos from other people they are unlikely to pass it off as their own video the second video posted by sofiapalmroos111 is of a group of helicopters flying across the sky with the caption russian army attacking my country the video is really from kyiv ukraine s capital but it s not from russia s ongoing invasion that video was first posted online on aug 19 2021 by a russian speaking person on facebook who said the video was of helicopters over kyiv at that time ukraine s military was participating in daily rehearsals for a parade to celebrate the 30th anniversary of ukraine s independence scheduled for aug 24 2021 photos and news coverage of the final week of rehearsals could be found in the kyiv post the american government run radio free europe and the pacific press agency while this video is of something that occurred months before russia s invasion it s equally possible for fake accounts to take a video someone else posted the day before or even earlier that day and pass it off as their own if you think you may have seen the video before it s a good idea to see if you might be able to find it again 5 does the account make spelling mistakes it shouldn t make english isn t the first language of a person from ukraine so an account isn t suspicious just because it makes spelling mistakes or has poor grammar but some spelling mistakes put an account s credibility more in question than others the bio for the sofiapalmroos111 account states that the account owner is from kiov instead of kyiv that mistake stands out because based on the ukraine government s official transliteration of the ukrainian alphabet to the roman alphabet used for english ukraine s capital city київ should be spelled kyiv 6 does the account ask for donations through paypal or venmo does paypal work in ukraine what about venmo be wary of accounts asking for money through paypal or venmo the only paypal feature available to ukrainians is the ability to send or spend money ukrainians on paypal cannot receive money from others individuals have different money transfer options than businesses but monito a comparison service for international money transfers lists wise paysend moneygram and other services as ways americans can send money to ukraine monito explains that individuals can t use venmo to send money to ukraine either venmo requires both users in a transaction to have a u s bank account restricting its use internationally what are some credible places to donate to the official twitter account of the ukraine government posted a pair of donation links for helping ukraine s military the first is for a national bank of ukraine fund to support the country s armed forces and the second is a link to a fund for the charity come back alive which provides support for soldiers involved in the war the national bank of ukraine only takes donations through card payments while the come back alive fund accepts both card payments and bitcoin payments the red cross is also active in ukraine and has shared its own donation links for supporting its work in ukraine laurie styron executive director of charitywatch says charity organizations are typically better to donate to than crowdfunding campaigns or individuals because they make sure no one person gets all of the aid for themselves

us allies failed to deter putin can tougher measures stop him now collapse at a spirited pro ukraine rally in new york s washington square park sunday more than one of the dozens of hand lettered signs implored president joe biden to do more to stop russian president vladimir putin s war on ukraine biden stop world war 3 read one biden stop putin save ukraine read another the signs held aloft in a sea of yellow and sky blue ukrainian flags raised critical questions about the effectiveness of the economic sanctions and other measures initially imposed by the united states and its western allies once mr putin launched thursday the biggest invasion of a european country since world war ii once weeks of diplomacy and u s led warnings of severe consequences if mr putin chose to go to war failed to deter russia the u s and its partners imposed measures widely criticized as too weak and unlikely to quickly alter the russian leader s calculus on display now around the world is a broad frustration with the limited deterrent ability of slow moving sanctions and other punitive measures in the face of fast moving military action moreover the new york demonstration and dozens more like it over the weekend in western capitals and other cities around the globe suggest a popular demand for tougher measures than perhaps leaders at first assumed their publics would tolerate in germany for example early on considered the weak link in western unity against russian aggression more than 100 000 people rallied for ukraine sunday at berlin s brandenburg gate leaders emboldened the global message underscored by ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy s highly effective daily video dispatches from a besieged kyiv imploring the u s led international community for bolder action seemed to be that timid measures aimed at punishing russia over time were not enough and while the impact of the pro ukraine anti putin demonstrations remains open to debate what is clear is that western leaders are feeling emboldened to move more forcefully over the weekend they went beyond their initial actions to measures that already monday were having an impact on russia s economy as well as on mr putin s diplomatic agenda signs are also mounting that as the invasion appeared to get bogged down and fall well short of initial expectations of a quick russian victory the u s and other western powers were prepared to offer stepped up defensive military support to ukraine reuters check in counters at sheremetyevo airport are all but deserted after russia closed its airspace to airlines from 36 countries in response to ukraine related sanctions targeting its aviation sector in moscow feb 28 2022 weekend actions targeting russia s central bank and financial transactions by russia s top banks caused the already weak ruble to plunge in value by 30 monday while the russian stock market closed over fears of a broad collapse the bank of russia more than doubled interest rates from 9 5 to 20 in an attempt to defend the ruble the turbulence caused mr putin to call an emergency meeting of his economic advisers while kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov spoke of russia entering a new economic reality need for quicker impact initially when mr putin launched his war on ukraine many officials and international affairs experts acknowledged that the u s and other western powers would likely be limited to measures that would inflict pain on russia over time sanctions raise the costs to russia of launching this war in the middle of europe but generally speaking they re not going to get you results tomorrow says bruce jentleson a professor of political science and international affairs at duke university in north carolina and a former senior adviser to the state department during the obama administration in no way is it giving up on ukraine he adds but it s an approach that is going to take some time to get you to your goal which is to raise the costs and make this an albatross for putin and a very close inner circle that supports him still recognition of a need for measures that have a quicker impact seemed implicit in comments from leaders and officials after the flurry of actions over the weekend very soon the russian leadership will feel what a high price they will have to pay for the invasion of ukraine german chancellor olaf scholz said sunday moreover in addition to the economic measures that the group of seven wealthy democracies took saturday germany announced it would reverse course and proceed to supply ukraine with advanced military equipment including anti tank and anti aircraft weapons beyond that mr scholz announced he would also seek to raise germany s military spending kept low over recent decades by german anti war sentiments the biden administration is also keen to dispel the notion that had been taking hold last week that the measures the western powers were imposing would only have a medium term impact and thus be easily dismissed by mr putin in comments monday with reporters senior biden administration officials said the financial measures adopted over the weekend by western leaders aimed to make the war of choice a strategic blunder for mr putin and to demonstrate that no country is sanction proof when we act together noting the immediate signs monday of economic instability in russia one official said the strategy is to make sure the russian economy goes backward as long as president putin goes forward with his invasion of ukraine one official noted that measures freezing russia s holdings in u s banks and in u s dollars globally would have an immediate impact on russia s ability to access the 630 billion in reserves it has carefully amassed over recent years switzerland sends a signal as a further sign that the world is coming together in unprecedented ways to limit russia s ability to insulate its economy from the war switzerland announced monday that it would set aside its traditional neutrality to join the european union in freezing russian financial assets swiss president ignazio cassis said that the unprecedented military action by russia on a sovereign european state was prompting his country to join other european states and the global community to freeze the swiss held assets of mr putin russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and more than 360 other russian individuals sanctioned by the eu last week dmitri lovetsky ap people stand in line to withdraw dollars and euros from an atm in st petersburg russia feb 25 2022 ordinary russians faced the prospect of higher prices and crimped foreign travel as western sanctions over the invasion of ukraine sent the ruble plummeting leading to more lines at banks and atms monday in a country that has seen more than one currency disaster in the post soviet era signs also multiplied monday that the rallying to ukraine s cause and in opposition to the russian war is spreading beyond the western powers south korea announced it is banning the export to russia of strategic products including semiconductors sensors lasers and aerospace equipment seoul also announced it was joining efforts to block some russian banks from the swift payments system for professor jentleson the growing number and variety of measures being taken by the u s and other countries point to what he calls a porcupine strategy to affect russia s behavior and tolerance for pursuing its war having failed to stop russia from invading ukraine the u s and others are employing sanctions and other quills to increase the pressure russia experiences as long as it keeps up its war he says so in addition to financial measures inflicting economic pain the u s and others are taking steps to bolster the ukrainian military as it confronts russia and then to support a ukrainian insurgency in the event the ukrainian military collapses but a russian occupation drags out calls for more still others with experience in imposing sanctions are lauding what the biden administration and partners have done so far but insist still more can be done no doubt we are in a better place on sanctions and military support than we were 48 hours ago but we are simply not there yet said richard goldberg a senior adviser at the foundation for the defense of democracies in washington who in 2019 20 directed iran sanctions policy for the trump national security council calling a new u s and european openness to supplying ukraine with critical weaponry excellent mr goldberg said in a series of tweets sunday that western sanctions on russia are still not maximalist and are not yet treating russia like a pariah state he called for moving beyond the partial barring of russian banks from the swift global payments system to a total ban while advocating more extensive sanctions against russian diplomats russia s invasion of a sovereign country remains at the heart of the mounting global outrage but at the same time it seems clear that ukrainians tenacity and resilience in the face of a much more powerful aggressor are also fueling the groundswell for action in washington friday ukraine s ambassador to the u s oksana markarova made another of her many pleas for international assistance for her besieged country that invoked humanity s natural tendency to side with any david facing a goliath we realize we are not a match in terms of weapons to the country that is attacking us a nuclear power she said in comments to the national coalition supporting eurasian jewry organization but that is not a reason to lose hope but to be very direct and open with our friends in the u s and elsewhere for help pleading for more weapons to allow us to defend ourselves and for stronger sanctions including a complete ban of russia from the swift system she said russia has already crossed all the red lines the world understands there are no more red lines to wait for for russia to cross

prismatic optics like the sig bravo 5 used to be relatively uncommon in the world of firearms the market was basically dominated by trijicon s acog and to a smaller degree the elcan spectre series of combat optics and a few years back sig sought to change all that with the introduction of a few solid optics that while good wasn t up to snuff with some of its competitor s offerings since then sig has increased both the quality and number of prismatic scopes in their optics line up but even with all these improvements can sig go toe to toe with more established prismatic optic makers let s take a closer look at the bravo 5 and find out for starters the sig bravo 5 is a fixed magnifications prismatic five power scope the body is constructed from black anodized aluminum and has a waterproof rating of ipx 7 or roughly being submerged under 13 feet of water the bravo 5 is a fairly light optic given its robust construction tipping the scales at 23oz as far as features the bravo 5 can be adjusted up to 80 moa for both windage and elevation and includes an excellent bdc horseshoe reticle the optic s zero is adjusted 0 5 moa per click this reticle has subtension holdovers for hitting targets from 300 to 800 yards in 100 yard increments the horseshoe itself is illuminated making it function as a makeshift red dot for close range targets while aiding the shooter by drawing their eye to the reticle another interesting feature of the bravo is its use of a proprietary built in picatinny mount personally i would have preferred if sig utilized a more common acog mount for the sake of shooters being able to utilize existing mounts especially firearm specific ones like the rs regulate akog that said the included mount features two hexagonal bolts that feature a small hole in them for users to stick an allen key a small punch or whatever they have on hand to easily tighten or loosen if need be light reception from the 32mm bravo is fantastic easily on par with the original acog although like the acog the bravo also suffers from relatively short eye relief in fact the eye relief on the bravo is just a hair over two inches but given that the optic is designed primarily for ar 15s and sig s mcx this makes sense the recoil on both these firearms is minimal bravo 5 testing to test the bravo 5 it was initially mounted on a daniel defense ddm4 v7 carbine where it saw some 250 rounds fired through the gun the mount never loosened and the zero stayed consistent i then decided to mount it on something with a little more recoil and installed it on my century arms c308 carbine chambered in 308 win here too the bravo held perfectly and really helped maximize the increased effective range of that caliber by providing a clear bright sight picture though the relatively short eye relief was a little uncomfortable on the very long length of pull cetme stock on the c308 but keep in mind that the author is only 5 9 even still i had to essentially mount the optic as far back as possible to achieve a proper comfortable sight picture verdict so is the sig bravo 5 an acog killer for some buyers yes yes the bravo offers excellent performance and solid build quality along with a host of desirable features it also boasts a very attractive msrp of 481 99 substantially cheaper than military grade prismatic scopes that said i m all but certain that the bravo 5 isn t capable of taking the same kind of beating as military grade combat optics like the elcan spectre or trijicon acog but with a price less than a third of the elcan that is to be expected about jim grant jim is a freelance writer editor and videographer for dozens of publications who loves anything and everything guns while partial to modern military firearms and their civilian counterparts he holds a special place in his heart for the greatest battle implement ever devised and other ww2 rifles when he s not reviewing guns or shooting for fun and competition jim can be found hiking and hunting with his wife kimberly and their dog peanut in the south carolina low country

launched a military invasion of ukraine just before dawn on feb 24 since then tiktok has been full of videos and livestreams asking for donations for ukraine in most of these videos people ask viewers to donate to a charity but some of the videos and livestreams are of people claiming to be from ukraine asking for personal donations to help themselves or their families it can be difficult to know if a stranger asking for money over social media is who they say they are we ve put together some tips to help you figure out if an account is legit using one account soliciting for personal donations as an example the account sofiapalmroos111 has posted two videos since russia s invasion of ukraine began one of those videos is tagged donateme and the account itself lists a paypal username in its bio and claims to be a ukraine girl living in kiov editor s note we have a list of some legitimate organizations soliciting donations at the end of this article the sources laurie styron executive director of charitywatch says you should generally avoid donating to crowdfunding campaigns or individuals in most cases regarding a crisis like this the only exception to that might be if you personally know someone in the region or you have someone who can vouch for that person styron said in that case the crowdfunding site can be a very convenient easy way to get resources to someone in the region if you don t know the person it s really not the best way to give you re really kind of taking a big risk if you still want to donate directly to individuals you should at least take precautions to make it less likely you re scammed here are six things to be on the lookout for when figuring out if an account is real 1 is the profile picture generic one of the first things you should do is a reverse image search of the account s profile picture you can do a reverse image search by saving an image opening up google images or another search engine s image search clicking the search by image icon and uploading the image into the search bar if that search reveals the picture is actually another person s profile photo or is a stock image then it s likely the person running the account isn t who they say they are in the case of sofiapalmroos111 a reverse image search on google doesn t return any results but that doesn t necessarily mean the photo is unique a reverse image search of the image on the russian search engine yandex reveals that the photo is used for profiles on a number of russian social media websites often alongside different names none of those accounts use the name sofia palmroos which is the name the tiktok account uses a common profile picture or a stock photo profile picture doesn t necessarily mean an account isn t from ukraine or that it s fake a real ukrainian person might want to hide their identity for safety reasons or this might be the one account that actually belongs to the person in the photo but in conjunction with other red flags profile pictures can be the first indicator that a profile might be untrustworthy 2 is the account brand new an account s age is easy to check and can suggest someone might simply be looking to take advantage of a real world tragedy to benefit themselves a newly created account immediately looking for donations from others upon its creation is far less credible than an account that has been around and posting videos long before seeking help from others the sofiapalmroos111 account for example never posted a video until after russia s invasion of ukraine began once again this alone doesn t mean the owner of the account is from somewhere other than ukraine the account could belong to a ukrainian person who didn t use tiktok before heard about the donation drives on the platform and created an account to seek out emergency funds but like a generic profile picture the account s age makes it more suspicious when considering the rest of these five tips as an additional tip an older account might also have giveaways to its inauthenticity if an account has a history of posting videos located somewhere other than ukraine and the account s owner has never talked about being from ukraine or visiting ukraine then it makes it less likely that the person is actually from ukraine if they later seek out donations 3 do the videos posted to the account show real clips from ukraine if a person isn t actually in ukraine they won t be able to record their own video of the invasion one strategy such a person might use is to post video of other events in the place of real footage the first video posted by sofiapalmroos111 depicts an explosion near an apartment building tagged war and ukraine but a yandex reverse image search of a screenshot from that video reveals that it s an image flipped video of a gas station explosion in novosibirsk russia from 2021 the video can be found on an instagram post from june 15 2021 with its location tagged to novosibirsk russian media such as the moscow times and the state run ria novosti news agency reported that a fuel pump at a gas station within the city had exploded on june 14 2021 other angles of the same explosion can be found in a number of youtube videos this video is particularly deceptive because it is of an incident that got little press coverage in mainstream english speaking media most of the people who would have seen the video on tiktok would not have ever seen the original video before it was tagged as part of russia s attack on ukraine 4 have the videos on the account been posted elsewhere by someone else before another way a person from outside of ukraine might pretend to be from the country is to take authentic videos from other accounts and post them like they recorded the video themselves while a real ukrainian person seeking help may post videos from other people they are unlikely to pass it off as their own video the second video posted by sofiapalmroos111 is of a group of helicopters flying across the sky with the caption russian army attacking my country the video is really from kyiv ukraine s capital but it s not from russia s ongoing invasion that video was first posted online on aug 19 2021 by a russian speaking person on facebook who said the video was of helicopters over kyiv at that time ukraine s military was participating in daily rehearsals for a parade to celebrate the 30th anniversary of ukraine s independence scheduled for aug 24 2021 photos and news coverage of the final week of rehearsals could be found in the kyiv post the american government run radio free europe and the pacific press agency while this video is of something that occurred months before russia s invasion it s equally possible for fake accounts to take a video someone else posted the day before or even earlier that day and pass it off as their own if you think you may have seen the video before it s a good idea to see if you might be able to find it again 5 does the account make spelling mistakes it shouldn t make english isn t the first language of a person from ukraine so an account isn t suspicious just because it makes spelling mistakes or has poor grammar but some spelling mistakes put an account s credibility more in question than others the bio for the sofiapalmroos111 account states that the account owner is from kiov instead of kyiv that mistake stands out because based on the ukraine government s official transliteration of the ukrainian alphabet to the roman alphabet used for english ukraine s capital city київ should be spelled kyiv 6 does the account ask for donations through paypal or venmo does paypal work in ukraine what about venmo be wary of accounts asking for money through paypal or venmo the only paypal feature available to ukrainians is the ability to send or spend money ukrainians on paypal cannot receive money from others individuals have different money transfer options than businesses but monito a comparison service for international money transfers lists wise paysend moneygram and other services as ways americans can send money to ukraine monito explains that individuals can t use venmo to send money to ukraine either venmo requires both users in a transaction to have a u s bank account restricting its use internationally what are some credible places to donate to the official twitter account of the ukraine government posted a pair of donation links for helping ukraine s military the first is for a national bank of ukraine fund to support the country s armed forces and the second is a link to a fund for the charity come back alive which provides support for soldiers involved in the war the national bank of ukraine only takes donations through card payments while the come back alive fund accepts both card payments and bitcoin payments the red cross is also active in ukraine and has shared its own donation links for supporting its work in ukraine laurie styron executive director of charitywatch says charity organizations are typically better to donate to than crowdfunding campaigns or individuals because they make sure no one person gets all of the aid for themselves

signs implored president joe biden to do more to stop russian president vladimir putin s war on ukraine biden stop world war 3 read one biden stop putin save ukraine read another the signs held aloft in a sea of yellow and sky blue ukrainian flags raised critical questions about the effectiveness of the economic sanctions and other measures initially imposed by the united states and its western allies once mr putin launched thursday the biggest invasion of a european country since world war ii once weeks of diplomacy and u s led warnings of severe consequences if mr putin chose to go to war failed to deter russia the u s and its partners imposed measures widely criticized as too weak and unlikely to quickly alter the russian leader s calculus on display now around the world is a broad frustration with the limited deterrent ability of slow moving sanctions and other punitive measures in the face of fast moving military action moreover the new york demonstration and dozens more like it over the weekend in western capitals and other cities around the globe suggest a popular demand for tougher measures than perhaps leaders at first assumed their publics would tolerate in germany for example early on considered the weak link in western unity against russian aggression more than 100 000 people rallied for ukraine sunday at berlin s brandenburg gate leaders emboldened the global message underscored by ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy s highly effective daily video dispatches from a besieged kyiv imploring the u s led international community for bolder action seemed to be that timid measures aimed at punishing russia over time were not enough and while the impact of the pro ukraine anti putin demonstrations remains open to debate what is clear is that western leaders are feeling emboldened to move more forcefully over the weekend they went beyond their initial actions to measures that already monday were having an impact on russia s economy as well as on mr putin s diplomatic agenda signs are also mounting that as the invasion appeared to get bogged down and fall well short of initial expectations of a quick russian victory the u s and other western

economic reality need for quicker impact initially when mr putin launched his war on ukraine many officials and international affairs experts acknowledged that the u s and other western powers would likely be limited to measures that would inflict pain on russia over time sanctions raise the costs to russia of launching this war in the middle of europe but generally speaking they re not going to get you results tomorrow says bruce jentleson a professor of political science and international affairs at duke university in north carolina and a former senior adviser to the state department during the obama administration in no way is it giving up on ukraine he adds but it s an approach that is going to take some time to get you to your goal which is to raise the costs and make this an albatross for putin and a very close inner circle that supports him still recognition of a need for measures that have a quicker impact seemed implicit in comments from leaders and officials after the flurry of actions over the weekend very soon the russian leadership will feel what a high price they will have to pay for the invasion of ukraine german chancellor olaf scholz said sunday moreover in addition to the economic measures that the group of seven wealthy democracies took saturday germany announced it would reverse course and proceed to supply ukraine with advanced military equipment including anti tank and anti aircraft weapons beyond that mr scholz announced he would also seek to raise germany s military spending kept low over recent decades by german anti war sentiments the biden administration is also keen to dispel the notion that had been taking hold last week that the measures the western powers were imposing would only have a medium term impact and thus be easily dismissed by mr putin in comments monday with reporters senior biden administration officials said the financial measures adopted over the weekend by western leaders aimed to make the war of choice a strategic blunder for mr putin and to demonstrate that no country is sanction proof when we act together noting the immediate signs monday of economic instability in russia one official said the strategy is to make sure the russian economy goes backward as long as president putin goes forward with his invasion of ukraine one official noted that measures freezing russia s holdings in u s banks

advocating more extensive sanctions against russian diplomats russia s invasion of a sovereign country remains at the heart of the mounting global outrage but at the same time it seems clear that

the batman franchise s quest for realism continues in matt reeves new reboot a 3 hour crime drama taking cues both from classic comics batman year one the long halloween and gritty 1970s thrillers like taxi driver and klute the penguin is now a generic mob boss the riddler is a politically motivated serial killer much of gotham s theatricality has been sacrificed on the altar of seriousness a continually puzzling direction for the franchise because if batman isn t surrounded by operatic freaks then what s the point the batman release date march 4 2022 director matt reeves robert pattinson stars in this new reboot of the batman franchise a neo noir crime thriller featuring the riddler paul dano as a serial killer it s a new more mature vision for batman but with a 3 hour runtime and rather shallow characterization it outstays its welcome robert pattinson offers a fresh ish take on bruce wayne a young awkward recluse with no public persona to speak of at home in his vampiric lair wayne manor has been replaced by an apartment made from recycled gothic cathedrals he lurks around with smudged eyeliner and unwashed bangs ignoring alfred s pleas to participate in the family business he interacts with the city exclusively in his guise as batman which is just as well because if young bruce was a tabloid fixture people would recognize that crisp jawline in a heartbeat since this version of bruce wayne is neither a philanthropist nor a businessman the film explicitly teases one of the more annoying critiques of the batman mythos wouldn t it be more effective to just donate his fortune to charity there are plenty of ways to poke holes in this argument but on a macro level the answer is obvious if gotham s problems could be solved with money then we wouldn t have a story while the city s criminal ecosystem thrives on corruption and poverty batman s biggest foes are invariably fueled by madness so when you start connecting them to real systemic problems you get dangerously close to batman s narrative third rail in the same way that joker tried to diagnose its title character with a realistic mental illness the batman swaps the riddler s zany puzzles for grisly domestic terrorism inspired by the zodiac killer he s now a serial murderer targeting gotham s elite lieutenant gordon jeffrey wright invites batman to assist in the investigation setting the tone for a neo noir procedural drama more cerebral than previous batman movies without necessarily being smarter surveilling the mobsters carmine falone john turturro and the penguin colin farrell in a wildly unnecessary amount of makeup batman spends more time doing detective work than beating people up matt reeves action sequences are noticeably above the blockbuster average though both in a technical sense they lack the weightless cgi sheen of marvel studios fare and in what they re trying to communicate pure spectacle wouldn t be appropriate for this murky tale yes the fight choreography is great but the focus here is on physical impact and atmosphere with one long chase sequence filmed for better or worse through blurry sheets of rain along the way batman meets nightclub waitress selina kyle aka catwoman zoë kravitz kravitz is very well cast as this cynical femme fatale although she s let down somewhat by the script despite a very direct moment where selina calls out the white male privilege of gotham s leadership reeves and his co writer peter craig seem unaware of their own blindspots selina is the lone female character in a sea of men making it clear whose perspectives are prioritized the only other woman of import is a mayoral candidate jayme lawson who plays an important symbolic role a principled black woman standing against gotham s corrupt establishment but has barely any screentime compared to falcone gordon alfred etc meanwhile the moral conflict between bruce and selina takes on a frustrating edge batman and catwoman traditionally have a push pull dynamic drawn to each other by sexual tension and shared experiences but separated by their differing attitudes to crime he refuses to kill while she has a more flexible attitude to retribution so far so good in the batman however this conflict veers more toward bruce imposing his morality over selina this makes it increasingly hard for us to root for them as a couple a problem that might have been solved by ramping up the horniness pattinson and kravitz are beautiful people positioning catwoman s sinuous sex appeal opposite a more sensitive downbeat batman but in keeping with recent hollywood trends the batman tones down the chemistry paling in comparison to michael keaton and michelle pfeiffer in batman returns bruce and selina are surprisingly chaste for the batman s otherwise adult tone which skirts the edge of its pg 13 rating in terms of violence opening with a gruesome riddler murder if i seem overly down on the batman it s because i truly feel like this film could ve done more pattinson is one of the premier weirdos of his generation yet the batman restrains him and his co stars into generic crime drama roles and while paul dano s riddler is a major departure from previous iterations he s a hollywood serial killer cliché a nerdy loner who crafts sadistic puzzles to terrorize the cops as ever this trope acts as a perverse kind of fantasy what if creepy school shooter types were actually fascinating masterminds and the only way to defeat them was with an equally clever detective in many ways reeves gotham is a welcome new direction for the franchise after zack snyder s characterless videogame landscapes and christopher nolan s rather sterile aesthetic reeves offers a more appropriate home for batman s street level adventures with detailed atmospheric production design by james chinlund gotham is grimy and ragged at the seams riddled with tunnels and vertiginous towers 1970s new york is clearly a key inspiration shot cleanly although still mostly in shades of grey and black by oscar nominee greig fraser here gotham s old fashioned crime epidemic actually makes sense you can see why warner bros was happy with this idea technically speaking we ve never seen a batman movie like this before at the same time the batman is still very conservative no stylized shadows or quirky costumes here a narrative that fits closely into familiar tropes about crime and punishment starring a stock cast of cops and gangsters another reboot of bruce wayne as a rageful loner rather than as in the comics a hero with a family of interesting protégés the most effective element of this new gotham is its looming sense of societal collapse which feels palpably relevant even when the plot rehashes old territory when superhero directors cite legendary filmmakers like hitchcock and scorsese as inspiration it s always interesting to see what this actually translates to onscreen joker for instance was a direct ripoff of taxi driver and the king of comedy whereas captain america the winter soldier only had vague similarities to 1970s espionage thrillers like three days of the condor the one thing these films all have in common is how shallow they feel when compared to their vintage counterparts the batman is an hour longer than klute or taxi driver however its characters are simpler its outlook is more derivative and it has far less to say about human nature by contrast the best superhero movies succeed because they re doing their own thing batman 1989 black panther logan spider man into the spider verse for the most part the batman is a skillfully executed retread blending neo noir elements with our post dark knight expectations for gotham city it caters to an audience who like to see bruce wayne be violent and troubled with as little eccentricity as possible

downbeat market mood augmented demand for the yellow metal vladimir putin retaliates western sanctions putting the russian army on high nuclear alert xau usd price forecast it is upward biased but subject to market sentiment update gold is 1 higher towards the electronic close on a day where russian sanctions are kicking in russia holds nearly 2300 tonnes of gold worth nearly usd140billion in their fx reserves representing 22 of fx reserves as of their latest filings from november 2021 analysts at td securities explained while that estimate is defined as gold in vaults en route in allocated and unallocated accounts including those that are held abroad the bank of russia s annual report suggests that precious metals are stored in the territory of the russian federation in turn this gold could theoretically be used to skirt swift sanctions but it s not clear how immediately effective this route will be after all these sanctions will eliminate location swaps which will restrict trading with most counterparties the gold would therefore have to be physically shipped to a destination that would be willing to purchase it suggesting some form of discount to the war chest which blurs the implications for global gold prices meanwhile wall street ended mixed in volatile trading on monday the markets are now in anticipation of the federal reserve as well atlanta fed president raphael bostic said on monday that the us federal reserve could need to raise interest rates by a half percentage point at its next meeting on march 15 and 16 if economic data between now and then shows high inflation persists bostic also said that as of today he is still in favour of a 25bp move at the march meeting for the week ahead fed chair jerome powell will deliver his regular semi annual monetary policy update to the us house financial services committee on wednesday and appear before the senate banking committee on thursday end of update gold xau usd reached a daily high during the asian pacific session as the week began the financial market s mood worsened over the weekend when the eurozone us uk canada among other countries imposed stringent sanctions on ukraine russia s response was fast when president putin put its military on high nuclear alert those factors caused a gap on monday when the markets opened at 1 919 15 at the time of writing xau usd is trading at 1 903 the sanctions included the removal of various russian banks from the important swift financial system furthermore the us placed sanctions on russia s top 10 financial institutions while having frozen assets of the russian president and russian ministers moreover a dozen russian oligarchs with ties with putin witnessed the same alongside a travel ban in the meantime us treasury yields keep falling signaling that the appetite for us treasuries increased contrarily the us dollar index a gauge of the greenback s value against a basket of six rivals advance 0 19 up at 96 81 the us economic docket featured goods trader balance for january which printed a deficit of 107 63 b vs 100 47 b estimated at the same time february s chicago and dallas fed manufacturing indexes came better than expected at 56 3 and 14 respectively xau usd price forecast gold xau usd gapped up and recorded a daily high at 1 919 15 but retraced to monday s daily pivot point around the 1 897 21 on a market sentiment swing late in the session xau usd approaches the 1 900 mark as market mood remains unchanged indicators like the daily moving averages dmas reside below the spot price suggesting that gold is upward biased the relative strength index rsi is at 63 aims higher after dropping to 60 70 on february 25 confirming the abovementioned and with enough room to spate before reaching overbought conditions that said xau usd s first resistance would be june 1 2021 a daily high at 1 916 61 followed by february 28 daily high at 1 927 48 and then the ytd high at 1 974 48
following russia s invasion of ukraine many self proclaimed ukrainians have asked for donations on social media we verify how to know which ones are untrustworthy russian president vladimir putin launched a military invasion of ukraine just before dawn on feb 24 since then tiktok has been full of videos and livestreams asking for donations for ukraine in most of these videos people ask viewers to donate to a charity but some of the videos and livestreams are of people claiming to be from ukraine asking for personal donations to help themselves or their families it can be difficult to know if a stranger asking for money over social media is who they say they are we ve put together some tips to help you figure out if an account is legit using one account soliciting for personal donations as an example the account sofiapalmroos111 has posted two videos since russia s invasion of ukraine began one of those videos is tagged donateme and the account itself lists a paypal username in its bio and claims to be a ukraine girl living in kiov editor s note we have a list of some legitimate organizations soliciting donations at the end of this article the sources laurie styron executive director of charitywatch says you should generally avoid donating to crowdfunding campaigns or individuals in most cases regarding a crisis like this the only exception to that might be if you personally know someone in the region or you have someone who can vouch for that person styron said in that case the crowdfunding site can be a very convenient easy way to get resources to someone in the region if you don t know the person it s really not the best way to give you re really kind of taking a big risk if you still want to donate directly to individuals you should at least take precautions to make it less likely you re scammed here are six things to be on the lookout for when figuring out if an account is real 1 is the profile picture generic one of the first things you should do is a reverse image search of the account s profile picture you can do a reverse image search by saving an image opening up google images or another search engine s image search clicking the search by image icon and uploading the image into the search bar if that search reveals the picture is actually another person s profile photo or is a stock image then it s likely the person running the account isn t who they say they are in the case of sofiapalmroos111 a reverse image search on google doesn t return any results but that doesn t necessarily mean the photo is unique a reverse image search of the image on the russian search engine yandex reveals that the photo is used for profiles on a number of russian social media websites often alongside different names none of those accounts use the name sofia palmroos which is the name the tiktok account uses a common profile picture or a stock photo profile picture doesn t necessarily mean an account isn t from ukraine or that it s fake a real ukrainian person might want to hide their identity for safety reasons or this might be the one account that actually belongs to the person in the photo but in conjunction with other red flags profile pictures can be the first indicator that a profile might be untrustworthy 2 is the account brand new an account s age is easy to check and can suggest someone might simply be looking to take advantage of a real world tragedy to benefit themselves a newly created account immediately looking for donations from others upon its creation is far less credible than an account that has been around and posting videos long before seeking help from others the sofiapalmroos111 account for example never posted a video until after russia s invasion of ukraine began once again this alone doesn t mean the owner of the account is from somewhere other than ukraine the account could belong to a ukrainian person who didn t use tiktok before heard about the donation drives on the platform and created an account to seek out emergency funds but like a generic profile picture the account s age makes it more suspicious when considering the rest of these five tips as an additional tip an older account might also have giveaways to its inauthenticity if an account has a history of posting videos located somewhere other than ukraine and the account s owner has never talked about being from ukraine or visiting ukraine then it makes it less likely that the person is actually from ukraine if they later seek out donations 3 do the videos posted to the account show real clips from ukraine if a person isn t actually in ukraine they won t be able to record their own video of the invasion one strategy such a person might use is to post video of other events in the place of real footage the first video posted by sofiapalmroos111 depicts an explosion near an apartment building tagged war and ukraine but a yandex reverse image search of a screenshot from that video reveals that it s an image flipped video of a gas station explosion in novosibirsk russia from 2021 the video can be found on an instagram post from june 15 2021 with its location tagged to novosibirsk russian media such as the moscow times and the state run ria novosti news agency reported that a fuel pump at a gas station within the city had exploded on june 14 2021 other angles of the same explosion can be found in a number of youtube videos this video is particularly deceptive because it is of an incident that got little press coverage in mainstream english speaking media most of the people who would have seen the video on tiktok would not have ever seen the original video before it was tagged as part of russia s attack on ukraine 4 have the videos on the account been posted elsewhere by someone else before another way a person from outside of ukraine might pretend to be from the country is to take authentic videos from other accounts and post them like they recorded the video themselves while a real ukrainian person seeking help may post videos from other people they are unlikely to pass it off as their own video the second video posted by sofiapalmroos111 is of a group of helicopters flying across the sky with the caption russian army attacking my country the video is really from kyiv ukraine s capital but it s not from russia s ongoing invasion that video was first posted online on aug 19 2021 by a russian speaking person on facebook who said the video was of helicopters over kyiv at that time ukraine s military was participating in daily rehearsals for a parade to celebrate the 30th anniversary of ukraine s independence scheduled for aug 24 2021 photos and news coverage of the final week of rehearsals could be found in the kyiv post the american government run radio free europe and the pacific press agency while this video is of something that occurred months before russia s invasion it s equally possible for fake accounts to take a video someone else posted the day before or even earlier that day and pass it off as their own if you think you may have seen the video before it s a good idea to see if you might be able to find it again 5 does the account make spelling mistakes it shouldn t make english isn t the first language of a person from ukraine so an account isn t suspicious just because it makes spelling mistakes or has poor grammar but some spelling mistakes put an account s credibility more in question than others the bio for the sofiapalmroos111 account states that the account owner is from kiov instead of kyiv that mistake stands out because based on the ukraine government s official transliteration of the ukrainian alphabet to the roman alphabet used for english ukraine s capital city київ should be spelled kyiv 6 does the account ask for donations through paypal or venmo does paypal work in ukraine what about venmo be wary of accounts asking for money through paypal or venmo the only paypal feature available to ukrainians is the ability to send or spend money ukrainians on paypal cannot receive money from others individuals have different money transfer options than businesses but monito a comparison service for international money transfers lists wise paysend moneygram and other services as ways americans can send money to ukraine monito explains that individuals can t use venmo to send money to ukraine either venmo requires both users in a transaction to have a u s bank account restricting its use internationally what are some credible places to donate to the official twitter account of the ukraine government posted a pair of donation links for helping ukraine s military the first is for a national bank of ukraine fund to support the country s armed forces and the second is a link to a fund for the charity come back alive which provides support for soldiers involved in the war the national bank of ukraine only takes donations through card payments while the come back alive fund accepts both card payments and bitcoin payments the red cross is also active in ukraine and has shared its own donation links for supporting its work in ukraine laurie styron executive director of charitywatch says charity organizations are typically better to donate to than crowdfunding campaigns or individuals because they make sure no one person gets all of the aid for themselves
the battle for ukraine continues to draw international attention to the plight of the ukrainian people we ve seen protests around the world condemning the russians for their invasion from bar owners to grocery stores business owners have refused to sell russian vodka popular russian vodka brands you might see in idaho when it comes to vodka in the state of idaho there are a lot of great options including many that are made right here in the state some of these options are even based from our special idaho grown potatoes there are plenty of russian made vodkas available as well now some of the nation s most prominent governors are getting into the act of sticking up for ukraine the hill reports that governors in several states are pulling russian products from the shelves governors of virginian new hampshire utah colorado georgia and a few other states have refused to do anything with russian products the united states and the rest of the world have issued strict sanctions that have begun to cripple the russian financial markets the question remains will other states follow the lead of the several that we ve mentioned above why hasn t idaho joined the russian boycott several boise based bars have begun not to sell russian vodka you can read that report from our friend mateo here most folks voting in the upcoming republican primary would like to see the state follow the actions of the state governments we listed above why not remove russian vodka from idaho s state liquor stores as suggested in the tweet above idaho making a statement can only help our friends in the ukraine who are fighting for their lives an executive order from governor little would quiet his critics on the right as he prepares for his reelection let s hope someone in the governor s office passes this idea to him saying that idahoans are standing with our friends in ukraine idaho law don t forget to wear underwear in public or else

as an invasion unfolds in eastern europe the reverberations from heavy shelling in ukraine are rippling across the world as putin s russia invades the sovereign country and the gears of war begin to turn there are more questions than answers about the impact that the tragedy unfolding in ukraine will have on the rest of europe and the global economy for one thing as a critical lynchpin for the european continent s energy security conflict in russia and ukraine will have far reaching consequences for the average resident in the european union already the attacks have caused oil prices to soar above 100 a barrel for the first time in nearly a decade and have also sent renewable energy stocks surging as the liquefied natural gas market takes a major hit russia historically provides around 40 of the european union s natural gas supply and approximately 50 of germany s all of which is to say that the kremlin has considerable leverage in europe and this codependence has created a geopolitical nightmare as russia has ignored the west s pleas not to enter ukraine since well before the russian invasion of ukraine europeans have been struggling under the weight of runaway energy bills in germany some residents are now paying as much for one month of energy as they used to pay for an entire calendar year in the united kingdom the government raised the price cap for energy bills by a whopping 54 and while the individual stories of financial strife stress and sacrifice are heartbreaking the impact on local businesses and industries is nothing short of frightening all kinds of small businesses across europe have been forced to cease their operations as energy costs outweigh profits large industries have not been immune to sticker shock either almost two thirds of the 28 000 companies surveyed by the association of german chambers of commerce and industry this month rated energy prices as one of their biggest business risks the new york times recently reported for those in the industrial sector the figure was as high as 85 percent as european politicians have tried to respond to the energy crisis their efforts have amounted to a bandaid where a tourniquet is needed european governments have spent tens of billions of euros trying to shield consumers from record high energy prices and themselves from voters wrath but the measures look set to fall short reuters reported last month for policymakers the volatility of the energy markets has been nothing short of a nightmare especially for poorer countries with little financial buffer in poland for example hospitals reliant on embattled public budgets are left wondering if they ll be able to keep the lights on critically europe s reliance on russian natural gas to keep the lights on and the economy running has weakened the continent s bargaining power with putin as the west imposes sanctions on russia in light of this week s ukrainian invasions world leaders have been hesitant to hit russia where it can hurt them the most energy exports the sanctions that are being imposed today as well that could be imposed in the near future are not targeting and will not target oil and gas flows an anonymous u s official was quoted by reuters on tuesday we would like the market to take note that there s no need for increasing the price at the moment over the weekend the world tightened its financial sanctions on russia cutting many russian banks out of the international monetary system swift and while political leaders continue to drag their feet over energy focused sanctions for fear of making their own citizens vulnerable to soaring gas and electricity prices the private sector has taken matters into its own hands bp and shell have both abandoned russian projects taking a stand on the side of ukraine and making strong statements condemning putin s aggression the way that the world has rallied to defend ukraine has been stunning even switzerland has taken a side and the manner in which the private sector has stepped up to do what the government would or could not do is history in the making it must be pointed out however that for shell and bp higher oil prices are not necessarily a problem ironically the west and russia have returned to a context of mutually assured destruction this time it s not nuclear holocaust but economic devastation that s on the line if energy sanctions are placed on russian exports at the same time that energy supplies are already devastatingly tight if europe is unwilling to go further than placing sanctions on russian banks and freezing oligarch s assets however the kremlin will have little reason not to continue a reign of terror in ukraine by haley zaremba for oilprice com advertisement more top reads from oilprice com

almost 400 points or 1 1 at 33 670 while the tech laden nasdaq composite shed 0 8 and the s p 500 was down by 1 the response to previous sanctions was underwhelming to say the least but the latest batch undoubtedly has the teeth that the others lacked noted craig erlam senior market analyst uk emea oanda that s been most clearly evident in the fx markets where the rouble plunged more than 30 to record lows and that could have been much worse but for swift action by the central bank western countries proceeded to bar key russian banks from the swift system over the weekend which connects over 11 000 banks and financial institutions worldwide the central bank of russia followed up with an emergency rate hike raising the key rate to more than double from 9 5 to 20 as a response to the volatile currency markets erlam noted that this measure has enabled the rouble to pare those initial losses but the russian currency remains under severe pressure the latest sanctions are hard hitting and will weigh heavily on the economy and that s before we see the second round effects bp has shown us today the political pressure that companies are going to be under to sever ties with russia especially where there s shared interest with the kremlin erlam said the level of horror at the events in ukraine being experienced around the world combined with that political pressure will continue to see companies cut ties which will compound the impact of the sanctions 6 30am us stocks seen opening mixed us stocks are expected to open mixed as officials from ukraine and russia meet in

a worker checks production data at a fuyao glass america workshop in ohio the u s on july 27 2019 the company is a subsidiary of chinese auto glass manufacturer fuyao group xinhua during his icebreaking visit to china in 1972 u s president richard nixon was invited by chinese leaders to recommend the best american enterprises from 10 sectors to drive economic exchanges between the two countries honeywell uop a supplier and licenser of petroleum refining solutions operated by technology and manufacturing giant honeywell international inc was the only company in its field named by nixon thanks to the economic cooperation and exchanges between china and the united states honeywell has been participating in china s economic development and promoting technological innovation and industrial upgrading together with our chinese partners steven lien president of honeywell aerospace asia pacific told beijing review according to lien honeywell moved its asia pacific headquarters to shanghai in 2003 subsequently established the company s largest research and development r d center in asia there and has been continuously expanding its investment in china ever since in 2016 the company invested an additional 100 million to expand its asia pacific headquarters and the r d center in shanghai s pudong new area it later launched its emerging market headquarters and innovation center in wuhan hubei province in early 2020 to explore the potential of central china becoming the first fortune 500 company to set up a subsidiary in the city that year nowadays china has developed into honeywell s second largest single market and the company s largest growth market the country s opening up efforts and its focus on sustainability and digitalization have created a favorable investment environment and business opportunities lien said like honeywell many u s enterprises that have developed businesses in china maintain their confidence in the market despite trade tensions between the two countries and the covid 19 pandemic in a 2021 survey of 107 u s enterprises doing business in china conducted by the u s china business council uscbc 95 percent of respondents reported they were profitable while u s businesses continue to expand their investment in china a growing number of chinese enterprises have also entered the american market such as auto glass manufacturer fuyao group which rose to prominence through the 2019 documentary american factory according to a report released in mid 2021 by the american chamber of commerce in china amcham china and global financial services provider ernst young ey up to 65 percent of the roughly 180 chinese funded companies they interviewed in the u s will still invest in the local market with profits made there up 15 percentage points from the previous year on the bright side more than 70 000 u s multinationals have had a presence in the chinese market with their combined annual sales reaching approximately 700 billion according to liao qun chief economist with the chongyang institute for financial studies at renmin university of china many u s enterprises including intel and qualcomm conduct the majority of their research and development within their china based subsidiaries the 2021 american business in china white paper released by amcham china showed that 75 percent of its member enterprises surveyed totaling around 1 000 proved optimistic about china s economic recovery in the next two years more than 50 percent said the growth of domestic consumption and the rise of chinese middle income group present great business opportunities given their strong commercial gains and positive growth prospects the majority of u s companies in china remain committed to the chinese market and very few have plans to divest according to the uscbc survey among the respondents 64 percent saw revenue growth in 2020 also 78 percent viewed china s growth prospects as better than those in other emerging markets in line with their strong performance and favorable growth prospects 43 percent of the firms said they would increase resource commitments in the chinese market in 2021 only 6 percent planned to reduce investment agriculture and food company cargill is one of the u s companies that have increased investment and presence in china this year it will open its first global innovation center for animal nutrition and health in asia in shanxi province and build a new factory for pet food in zhejiang province in east china the company said it would enhance its input in the chinese market as the country pushes ahead with rural vitalization the survey also showed 87 percent of the u s companies did not shift any segments of their supply chains out of china in 2020 that percentage has remained unchanged for three years since 2019 among those that made adjustments only 2 percent backshored one or more segments to the united states while 12 percent moved elsewhere the small number of companies shifting supply chains can speak to the strength of china s supply chain ecosystems and to the difficulty of relocating although the case may be indefinite according to the survey report nevertheless challenges remain the report cited increased costs and uncertainties resulting from china u s frictions as top reasons for the small number of american businesses moving their operations to other locations other challenges include the pandemic competition with chinese companies and data flow the national development and reform commission ndrc china s top economic planner held several roundtable meetings with representatives of u s multinationals in china last year according to ndrc officials u s enterprises do not need to worry about being treated unfairly despite china u s trade tensions they said the chinese government would continue to enhance intellectual property right protection open up sectors like telecommunications culture and healthcare and ease market access restrictions for foreign investors to ensure a more level playing field prudent but confident eyeing a larger platform and increased access to financing a growing number of chinese firms have been listed on u s stock exchanges in recent years many have also entered the u s market and are improving their brand reputation boosting innovation and enhancing compliance management for stronger competitiveness data from u s based research provider rhodium group showed that china s direct investment in the u s rose by nearly 1 billion year on year to 7 2 billion in 2020 in addition to state owned enterprises such as cosco shipping corp ltd and air china private chinese firms have also gained a footing in the u s market fuyao glass america the u s branch of fuyao group began production in 2016 it is ohio s largest chinese company employing more than 2 000 workers chinese car manufacturer byd opened a plant in lancaster california in 2013 as the california air resources board ruled in 2018 that all buses used in the state s airport facilities must be carbon free by 2029 byd has been focusing on the production of electric buses and creating jobs for local people according to the company it has grown to become the largest battery operated electric bus manufacturer in north america with around 1 000 employees as of 2021 the pandemic has most affected chinese funded businesses in the consumer services and property sectors in the u s while financial and telecommunication enterprises were only slightly affected and healthcare companies have made progress around 40 percent of the surveyed chinese enterprises believe china u s relations will thaw the report by amcham china and ey said in addition to the external impacts chinese businesses in the u s are facing increasing risks from the politicization of economic issues that make their business more difficult to run most recently the office of u s trade representative on february 17 labeled aliexpress an online retail service owned by alibaba and all purpose social media platform wechat owned by tencent as notorious markets the list had already included chinese e commerce platforms dhgate pinduoduo and taobao earlier the u s federal communications commission announced it would revoke its authorization to operate for the u s unit of china unicom one of china s major telecommunication carriers in january according to liao china and the u s have developed close economic and trade ties were a decoupling to occur nearly 200 000 staff of chinese enterprises in the u s would lose their jobs and the american access to the chinese market would further narrow in order to obtain the most mutual benefit the two sides must put an end to trade and technological frictions enhance cooperation on energy

today is monday welcome to equilibrium a newsletter that tracks the growing global battle over the future of sustainability subscribe here thehill com newsletter signup pregnant elephant seals embark on a treacherous 240 day journey across the eastern north pacific ocean each year for the sole purpose of giving birth in the comfort of their own home a new study has found we found that migrating elephant seals know how far they are from their breeding beach thousands of kilometers away roxanne beltran of the university of california santa cruz said in a statement they also know approximately how long it will take them to get back the authors who published their findings in current biology on monday detected an impressive navigation system in female elephant seals that functions like a built in gps according to the study not only do the seals know exactly where to go but they also give birth within five days of arrival the scientists found today we ll look at one of the most important and most neglected factors in heading off the worst forms of climate disaster ambitious organized spending on adaptation then we ll look at some of the latest sustainability impacts of russian president vladimir putin s invasion of ukraine including the decision of international energy giants to sever ties with russia for equilibrium we are saul elbein and sharon udasin please send tips or comments to saul at selbein thehill com or sharon at sudasin thehill com follow us on twitter saul_elbein and sharonudasin let s get to it for livable future start adaptation now un nowhere near enough money is being spent to help countries cities and corporations adapt to climate change even as record amounts are pledged for reducing emissions according to a landmark u n report released on monday first words we found that more than 90 percent of climate finance is currently going to mitigation rather than adaptation said kathryn bowen a professor at australian national university and a lead author on the intergovernmental panel on climate change s ipcc sixth assessment report there s a very large gap in our adaptation efforts to date bowen added behind the lines no matter how quickly humans stop burning fossil fuels the world will continue to warm throughout the century leading to a range of acute and chronic disasters from the ever worsening blows of storms fires and heat waves to the choking rise of sea levels the authors found adapt now or suffer later by beginning to invest in adaptation immediately and by making sure its costs and benefits are equitably spread governments and companies can drastically reduce the costs and damage resulting from climate change the researchers found here are six takeaways from monday s ipcc report on the urgent need and opportunity to make climate adaptation a greater focus in everything from infrastructure planning to public health six guidelines for climate adaptation 1 start now adaptation efforts are more effective the sooner they start because the longer governments and corporations wait the more they will be squeezed by ever increasing climate threats according to the report authors the earlier the adaptation measures are implemented the more the world will benefit because the potential to reduce risks through adaptation is higher until mid century and for global warming levels below 1 5 c the researchers found 2 avoid maladaptation in a warming world measures that are effective now in one place might not work in 20 years or in other places which is why monitoring and evaluation of the implemented actions are so important the researchers wrote adaptation strategies might have to be revised constantly they added noting that the presence of existing government entities prepared to handle such revision is critical today however few nations have any such framework the authors found this lack of preparedness increases the risk of haphazard expensive forms of maladaptation public works projects and other measures that end up making climate risks worse 3 include everyone traditionally large public works and development decisions are made by policymakers and business interests with limited comment from the public which in the era of climate change only raises the risk of maladaptation according to the ipcc report such exclusionary policymaking can also spark resistance to the measures officials come up with the researchers warned 4 enlist the power of nature climatic risks to people can be lowered by strengthening nature encouraging governments to invest in protecting nature and rebuilding ecosystems to benefit both people and biodiversity the authors wrote the benefit of these measures like restoring wetlands in river floodplains or salt marshes on vulnerable coasts is that they are inexpensive in many parts of the world because they do not rely on complex machinery or on the development of extensive infrastructure the researchers found 5 work with the coming urbanization boom the era of climate change is happening in tandem with the greatest wave of urbanization in human history hundreds of millions of people worldwide moving to cities for the first time many of them to climate vulnerable cities such as mumbai in india or lagos nigeria this is an opportunity as much as a challenge the authors wrote because it means the cities of the future have yet to be built creating an enormous canvas to construct them in new and sustainable ways 6 think big when it comes to climate urban planning remains dominated by minor modifications generally restricted to dealing with the risk from extreme weather events while this may suffice in the short term the long term risks may require more extensive transformative changes in our behavior and infrastructure the authors wrote last words it is clear now that minor marginal reactive or incremental changes won t be sufficient the researchers added instead shifts in most aspects of society are required to overcome limits to adaptation build resilience reduce climate risk to tolerable levels without leaving anyone behind be in the know we ve got you covered morning noon and night sign up now

following russia s invasion of ukraine many self proclaimed ukrainians have asked for donations on social media we verify how to know which ones are untrustworthy russian president vladimir putin launched a military invasion of ukraine just before dawn on feb 24 since then tiktok has been full of videos and livestreams asking for donations for ukraine in most of these videos people ask viewers to donate to a charity but some of the videos and livestreams are of people claiming to be from ukraine asking for personal donations to help themselves or their families it can be difficult to know if a stranger asking for money over social media is who they say they are we ve put together some tips to help you figure out if an account is legit using one account soliciting for personal donations as an example the account sofiapalmroos111 has posted two videos since russia s invasion of ukraine began one of those videos is tagged donateme and the account itself lists a paypal username in its bio and claims to be a ukraine girl living in kiov editor s note we have a list of some legitimate organizations soliciting donations at the end of this article the sources laurie styron executive director of charitywatch says you should generally avoid donating to crowdfunding campaigns or individuals in most cases regarding a crisis like this the only exception to that might be if you personally know someone in the region or you have someone who can vouch for that person styron said in that case the crowdfunding site can be a very convenient easy way to get resources to someone in the region if you don t know the person it s really not the best way to give you re really kind of taking a big risk if you still want to donate directly to individuals you should at least take precautions to make it less likely you re scammed here are six things to be on the lookout for when figuring out if an account is real 1 is the profile picture generic one of the first things you should do is a reverse image search of the account s profile picture you can do a reverse image search by saving an image opening up google images or another search engine s image search clicking the search by image icon and uploading the image into the search bar if that search reveals the picture is actually another person s profile photo or is a stock image then it s likely the person running the account isn t who they say they are in the case of sofiapalmroos111 a reverse image search on google doesn t return any results but that doesn t necessarily mean the photo is unique a reverse image search of the image on the russian search engine yandex reveals that the photo is used for profiles on a number of russian social media websites often alongside different names none of those accounts use the name sofia palmroos which is the name the tiktok account uses a common profile picture or a stock photo profile picture doesn t necessarily mean an account isn t from ukraine or that it s fake a real ukrainian person might want to hide their identity for safety reasons or this might be the one account that actually belongs to the person in the photo but in conjunction with other red flags profile pictures can be the first indicator that a profile might be untrustworthy 2 is the account brand new an account s age is easy to check and can suggest someone might simply be looking to take advantage of a real world tragedy to benefit themselves a newly created account immediately looking for donations from others upon its creation is far less credible than an account that has been around and posting videos long before seeking help from others the sofiapalmroos111 account for example never posted a video until after russia s invasion of ukraine began once again this alone doesn t mean the owner of the account is from somewhere other than ukraine the account could belong to a ukrainian person who didn t use tiktok before heard about the donation drives on the platform and created an account to seek out emergency funds but like a generic profile picture the account s age makes it more suspicious when considering the rest of these five tips as an additional tip an older account might also have giveaways to its inauthenticity if an account has a history of posting videos located somewhere other than ukraine and the account s owner has never talked about being from ukraine or visiting ukraine then it makes it less likely that the person is actually from ukraine if they later seek out donations 3 do the videos posted to the account show real clips from ukraine if a person isn t actually in ukraine they won t be able to record their own video of the invasion one strategy such a person might use is to post video of other events in the place of real footage the first video posted by sofiapalmroos111 depicts an explosion near an apartment building tagged war and ukraine but a yandex reverse image search of a screenshot from that video reveals that it s an image flipped video of a gas station explosion in novosibirsk russia from 2021 the video can be found on an instagram post from june 15 2021 with its location tagged to novosibirsk russian media such as the moscow times and the state run ria novosti news agency reported that a fuel pump at a gas station within the city had exploded on june 14 2021 other angles of the same explosion can be found in a number of youtube videos this video is particularly deceptive because it is of an incident that got little press coverage in mainstream english speaking media most of the people who would have seen the video on tiktok would not have ever seen the original video before it was tagged as part of russia s attack on ukraine 4 have the videos on the account been posted elsewhere by someone else before another way a person from outside of ukraine might pretend to be from the country is to take authentic videos from other accounts and post them like they recorded the video themselves while a real ukrainian person seeking help may post videos from other people they are unlikely to pass it off as their own video the second video posted by sofiapalmroos111 is of a group of helicopters flying across the sky with the caption russian army attacking my country the video is really from kyiv ukraine s capital but it s not from russia s ongoing invasion that video was first posted online on aug 19 2021 by a russian speaking person on facebook who said the video was of helicopters over kyiv at that time ukraine s military was participating in daily rehearsals for a parade to celebrate the 30th anniversary of ukraine s independence scheduled for aug 24 2021 photos and news coverage of the final week of rehearsals could be found in the kyiv post the american government run radio free europe and the pacific press agency while this video is of something that occurred months before russia s invasion it s equally possible for fake accounts to take a video someone else posted the day before or even earlier that day and pass it off as their own if you think you may have seen the video before it s a good idea to see if you might be able to find it again 5 does the account make spelling mistakes it shouldn t make english isn t the first language of a person from ukraine so an account isn t suspicious just because it makes spelling mistakes or has poor grammar but some spelling mistakes put an account s credibility more in question than others the bio for the sofiapalmroos111 account states that the account owner is from kiov instead of kyiv that mistake stands out because based on the ukraine government s official transliteration of the ukrainian alphabet to the roman alphabet used for english ukraine s capital city київ should be spelled kyiv 6 does the account ask for donations through paypal or venmo does paypal work in ukraine what about venmo be wary of accounts asking for money through paypal or venmo the only paypal feature available to ukrainians is the ability to send or spend money ukrainians on paypal cannot receive money from others individuals have different money transfer options than businesses but monito a comparison service for international money transfers lists wise paysend moneygram and other services as ways americans can send money to ukraine monito explains that individuals can t use venmo to send money to ukraine either venmo requires both users in a transaction to have a u s bank account restricting its use internationally what are some credible places to donate to the official twitter account of the ukraine government posted a pair of donation links for helping ukraine s military the first is for a national bank of ukraine fund to support the country s armed forces and the second is a link to a fund for the charity come back alive which provides support for soldiers involved in the war the national bank of ukraine only takes donations through card payments while the come back alive fund accepts both card payments and bitcoin payments the red cross is also active in ukraine and has shared its own donation links for supporting its work in ukraine laurie styron executive director of charitywatch says charity organizations are typically better to donate to than crowdfunding campaigns or individuals because they make sure no one person gets all of the aid for themselves

some couples mutually decide that they want to have a one income household but for others the decision is made for them the covid 19 pandemic has left many in this situation this story originally appeared on nerdwallet some couples mutually decide that they want to have a one income household but for others the decision is made for them the covid 19 pandemic has left many in this situation especially at its outset when companies folded and jobs in hard hit industries disappeared and with schools and day cares closing so frequently many couples may have felt it made sense to have a parent at home full time such an upheaval can leave you both feeling powerless before you operated as equals now one of you worries about losing your independence while the other feels the added pressure to provide suddenly your relationship dynamic isn t the one you originally signed up for any change can be hard especially one that can make you rethink who you are your identity your purpose and your role within your family but when it comes to making money related decisions with your partner the best path forward is a combination of logic and heart acknowledge the emotional component even if you agree that one of you dropping out of the workforce is the best option for your family both of you may feel conflicted not only do your responsibilities change but the way you view each other can also change especially if part of what sparked your interest in your partner in the first place was their passion for their career you align in this professional way to then lose that you might learn some things about your partner that maybe aren t attractive or you have to adjust to says stacey sherrell a licensed marriage and family therapist in glendale california who co founded decoding couples which provides courses videos and other relationship support if you re the one staying at home it s essentially like starting a new unpaid job that your previous work experience didn t prepare you for without an income you might feel like you no longer have as much of a say in financial matters at the same time you may welcome a break from trying to do it all because now you ll be able to focus solely on home responsibilities i ve actually seen clients have relief about not having a job anymore sherrell says on the other hand if you re the newly minted sole breadwinner you might be wondering when you ll get your break from juggling a career and family there s a lot of stress involved when you re the only person earning an income even though your partner s labor at home will give you extra time to focus on your career prepare for the financial realities with one of you at home and the reduction in income it s time to revisit your budget maybe you no longer need thrice weekly takeout a professional dog walker or a cleaning service depending on which chores the stay at home partner will take on you ll likely have some major costs you can scale back on don t forget about the valuable work benefits you may lose if you leave your job like access to life insurance through your employer unused funds in your flexible spending account or stock options you ll have a limited time to exercise after you leave before your last day at work discuss these details with your company s benefits person here s a potentially sticky situation allocating money for the stay at home partner for their own discretionary spending definitely budget for this but whatever you do sherrell says don t call it an allowance that word in itself alludes to i m giving you something this is mine and i m allowing you to have this in exchange for something she says that in itself negates any we language we re deciding this together we are a team we are partners in this and this is how we re deciding to use our money recognize all the ways you both contribute in some families being the breadwinner can also mean being the chief decision maker and that s simply not fair money has become synonymous with entitlement and that doesn t work in a relationship says rachel facio a licensed marriage and family therapist in glendale who co founded decoding couples with sherrell in an equal thriving relationship that doesn t give you the master key to the castle society has to catch up on that change the nonworking partner has much to contribute when it comes to family finances they already made spending saving and investing decisions when they worked outside the home and now they may have more time to manage the family s finances shari greco reiches co founder of rappaport reiches capital management in skokie illinois finds that stay at home partners make ideal financial planning clients when i give them a list of things to do they do them faster she says check in with each other once a week not just to review what each of you need to do to help keep things running but also to give yourselves a distraction free moment to talk openly this is the time to lean into that discomfort and counterintuitively be more vulnerable with your partner about what s going on sherrell says there has to be some kind of regular safe space to be able to talk about what s going on for each partner this article was written by nerdwallet and was originally published by the associated press sara rathner writes for nerdwallet email srathner nerdwallet com

government posted a pair of donation links for helping ukraine s military the first is for a national bank of ukraine fund to support the country s armed forces and the second is a link to a fund for the charity come back alive which provides support for soldiers involved in the war the national bank of ukraine only takes donations through card payments while the come back alive fund accepts both card payments and bitcoin payments the red cross is also active in ukraine and has shared its own donation links for supporting its work in ukraine laurie styron executive director of charitywatch

on feb 24 2022 president biden announced significant new export controls and sanctions against russia in response to the russian invasion of ukraine the latest sanctions package comes on the heels of a first wave of u s sanctions announced over the past several days and combines financial restrictions implemented by the u s department of the treasury s office of foreign assets control ofac and significant new export controls implemented by the u s department of commerce s bureau of industry and security bis second wave of sanctions in his speech on feb 24 2022 president biden announced a second wave of sanctions designed to seriously impact russia s financial sector and access to capital these measures follow an initial sanctions package announced on feb 22 2022 which was targeted at the so called donetsk people s republic and the luhansk people s republic collectively the covered regions as well as the sanctions relating to nord stream 2 issued feb 23 2022 in conjunction with president biden s announcement ofac implemented the following additional sanctions measures cut off sberbank russia s largest financial institution from the u s financial system by prohibiting correspondent and payable through accounts designated several other russian financial institutions as specially designated nationals sdns including russia s second largest financial institution vtb bank rendering their u s assets blocked and prohibiting u s persons from engaging in virtually all dealings with them restricted u s person dealings in new debt and equity of over a dozen significant russian enterprises and entities and designated several russian and belarusian individuals and entities as sdns which as noted above freezes their assets and prevents virtually all u s person dealings issuance of russia related general licenses on feb 24 2022 in conjunction with the sanctions measures described above ofac issued a number of russia related general licenses permitting certain types of limited activities by u s persons in or with covered regions or with sanctioned entities or individuals including temporarily permitting certain activities to divest transfer or wind down impacted

stock company or 4 any entity in which one or more of the abovementioned parties owns directly or indirectly individually or in the aggregate a 50 or greater interest historic export control restrictions on u s items and technology to russia concurrent with the announcement of new ofac sanctions bis issued an amendment to the export administration regulations ear effective feb 24 2022 implementing the sanctions against russia the export controls package will severely restrict russia s access to u s technologies and other commodities the controls are largely directed at russia s defense aerospace and maritime sectors and are designed to limit russia s access to the essential technological inputs and undermine russia s strategic ambitions to exert its influence globally the export control measures impose new export licensing requirements on a broad range of products software and technology when destined for russia add two new foreign direct product fdp rules specific to russia and russian military end users specify a policy of denial for license applications for exports re exports to or transfers within russia expand existing russia military end use and military end user control scope to all items subject to the ear significantly restrict the use of ear license exceptions for exports re exports and in country transfers destined for russia redesignate 45 russian entities from the military end user meu list to the entity list resulting in more stringent broad license requirements on exports reexports and in country retransfers of all products subject to the ear including foreign produced products subject to russia meu fdp rules and add two new russian entities to the entity list and military end user designations to two russian entities already found in the entity list ccl items subject to licensing requirements perhaps the most significant aspect of the above measures is the imposition of license requirements for all export control classification numbers eccns in categories 3 through 9 of the commerce control list ccl categories 3 through 9 of the ccl include electronics computers telecommunications and information security sensors and lasers navigation and avionics marine and aerospace and propulsion certain license exceptions as well as exports of ear99 products without a license remain authorized however the change means a majority of dual use products subject to the ear will now require export licenses to russia when combined with bis s policy of denial of license applications for exports to russia this will significantly impact russia s ability to source u s origin goods key takeaways as a result of the dynamic security and legal situation in the region all companies and organizations engaged in activities involving russia ukraine and belarus should quickly assess the nature and type of activities nationalities of personnel involved in those activities for example u s and eu citizens are required to comply with the sanctions laws regardless of where they reside and the steps necessary to wind down those activities if they cannot permissibly continue under the current sanctions measures additionally in light of the severe u s export controls effective immediately companies assessing their activities in the region should also consider what items goods software and technology are exported reexported or retransferred to or in russia and take internal compliance measures to prevent unauthorized and even inadvertent exports of controlled items to russia it is vital now more than ever for companies that export or reexport goods products or software to russia to ensure they have classified all of the abovementioned commodities under u s export controls regulations to determine whether the measures trigger new export licensing requirements given the fluid situation of the russia ukraine conflict companies and organizations should continue to closely monitor communications guidance from bis the department of the treasury s office of foreign assets control and the white house as the conflict escalates president biden and other leaders have indicated a willingness to escalate sanctions in response the latest u s measures are part of a multilateral sanctions response that includes measures already announced or currently considered by the uk eu canada australia japan and others given the overlapping but distinct sanctions regimes at play companies and organizations with dealings in the region should carefully consider the sanctions measures of all applicable jurisdictions

adapted from the skyscraper curse and how austrian economists predicted every major economic crisis of the last century during the 1980s japan was feared as an economic and technological powerhouse most observers attributed their stock market bubble and high growth rates to easy monetary policy management style and government managed technological development since 1990 the japanese government has been fighting price deflation with monetary inflation and trying to increase growth by government deficit spending by all accounts it has not worked their economy remains mired in low growth they have by far the highest ratio of government debt to gdp in the world and they face a dramatic demographic crisis as their population continues to age this chapter is the lesson of what not to do and who not to listen to for advice business cycles and bubbles differ from one another but the technical similarities between the japanese and us bubbles are striking the japanese bubble began in the early 1970s the us bubble started in the early 1980s both stock markets grew rapidly for thirteen years and then went parabolic to form bubbles which peaked in japan at the end of 1989 and in the united states during early 2000 both stock markets lost about a third of their value eighteen months after their peaks the nikkei stock index has since lost as much as three quarters of its peak value while the dow jones industrial average has been down 40 percent and the nasdaq composite down by 75 percent of its peak value the real estate bubble continued in japan for some time after the stock market began its meltdown and likewise real estate particularly housing experienced two bubbles since the initial breakdown of the us stock market in 2000 the surprising thing is that in the united states the lessons of the japanese bubble seem to have almost gone unnoticed japan experienced fourteen years now more than twenty five years of economic stagnation since its bubble popped most troubling the united states not only failed to heed the warnings of the japanese bubble it has thus far mimicked japan s failed attempts to stimulate its economy with extremely low interest rates and large government budget deficits both countries have opted for a slow agonizing recovery rather than a sharp correction of past errors that would quickly reallocate resources and return the economy to sustainable growth experts tell us that the japanese and their economy are very different from the americans and their economy and that the japanese bubble and japan s policy response to its crash were likewise different but while there certainly are many important differences between the us and japanese bubbles the technical features and new age thinking are strikingly similar in both bubbles for example there is no doubt that technology and new era thinking played a major role in the japanese bubble during the bubble japan took over leadership of high technology in the areas of consumer electronics the automobile industry manufacturing and even robotics and was perceived as a major threat to dominate all technological development around the globe just as the united states is today the threat posed by japan s growing technological prowess can be seen in the titles of books published during the bubble era japan s high technology industries edited by hugh patrick and larry meissner 1986 the technopolis strategy japan high technology and the control of the twenty first century by sheridan tatsuno 1986 a high technology gap europe america and japan edited by andrew j pierre 1987 the science and technology resources of japan a comparison with the united states by maria papadakis 1988 created in japan from imitators to world class innovators by sheridan m tatsuno 1990 japan as a scientific and technological superpower by justin l bloom 1990 japanese technology policy what s the secret by david w cheney and william w grimes 1991 and japan s growing technological capability implications for the u s economy edited by thomas s arrison et al 1992 writing near the pinnacle of the bubble in the stock market fumio kodama explained that the japanese takeover of technological progress was a result of a new japanese paradigm that was ushering in a new era japan is becoming one of the frontrunners in industrial technology which means that prominent science and technology policy researchers all over the world now pay more attention to japan considering this change more deeply one can understand the reason for the researcher s academic interest the paradigm of technological innovation is shifting kodama found that in japan the innovation of high technology seems to be different from that for conventional technologies and therefore studies focused on europe and the united states would not lead to a new scientific framework for analyzing innovation of high technologies he suggested that we break away from the inadequate linear model of the past to the unlimited model experienced under the unique social and cultural context of japan kodama even ended his book with the suggestion that it was the japanese cassette tape recorder vcr and fax machine that made the iranian revolution philippine revolution and tiananmen uprising possible this is classic new era bubble thinking another component of modern new era thinking is the belief that the so called scientific management of the economy creates perpetual prosperity here the japanese experience epitomizes this phenomenon because the japanese economy was said to represent a new third way positioned between the free market economy and that of the centrally planned economy in japan government and corporations act cooperatively in both their self interest and the general interest of the nation bureaucracies help plan and coordinate the economy they provide incentives such as financing and tax breaks in order to channel investment in profitable directions corporations in turn participate in joint research programs with their competitors but share the results among participating firms with each choosing what technological advances to employ in their firms production planning is facilitated by an overlap of ownership between final good producers and their input suppliers japanese management especially during the bubble was said to spur innovation enhance product quality and reliability and create large market shares in export markets for japanese industries alas none of this could prevent a meltdown of the japanese stock market and well more than a decade now more than a quarter century of stagnation in the japanese economy new era thinking about the scientific management of the economy was never more prominent and bold than during the japanese bubble of the 1980s it was often said that the japanese system would lead to economic dominance and threaten the preeminence of the us economy laura d andrea tyson who would later become chairman of president clinton s council of economic advisors outlined at the apex of the bubble the threat of japan s technological superiority certainly japan continues to obtain technology wherever it is available and to translate it into commercial advance as the united states itself did for so long however now talk has begun of a new technoeconomic paradigm emerging in japan a new trajectory of technological development that trajectory emerged from a pattern of industrial catch up shaped by policies of import substitution and export promotion as japan reaches industrial maturity in a broad range of industries its government is exerting substantial efforts to build a japanese position in advancing technologies agencies such as the ministry of trade and industries miti which have become familiar names in policy discussions in the united states are involved in japan the government channeled research and development efforts directed financing and protected markets for business this new third way of government management of the economy was thought to be japan s source of economic strength and was to inevitably place it in a position of economic preeminence as tyson and zysman confidently asserted a generation from now japan will almost certainly have created its own mechanism for advancing the technological frontiers in a range of domains now the continuing pace of productivity increase suggests that japan may indeed be on a growth trajectory different from that of the united states as japan ascends america frets about its decline tyson and her coauthors dosi and zysman questioned the validity of traditional economic thought as all new era thinkers must they justified japan s often flagrant and self aware violations of the nostrums of traditional economic thinking because when technological change is a key determinant of market outcomes standard economic models that treat such change as exogenous are a poor guide to understanding the dynamics of market competition and the effects of policy on such competition they argued that the nostrum of economic efficiency should be abandoned in favor of the less constraining and poorly defined notions of growth efficiency and technological efficiency leaving the anchor of economic efficiency and traditional economic thinking behind tyson zysman and dosi were able to justify a variety of noneconomic policies such as beggar thy neighbor protectionism she heralded the concept of growth efficiency which is essentially a keynesian idea that rests on the assumption that there are always unutilized resources that can be mobilized to meet growing demand it is exactly this kind of thinking that led the japanese to target industries whose products were perceived to have high income elasticities as a foundation for rapid economic growth ignoring the economic condition of scarcity and grasping at the concept of an economy of perpetually unutilized resources is a precondition for new era thinking as well as a quintessential mistake of freshman college students taking their first course in economics if resources are perpetually available then an unlimited amount of all goods and services can be produced and there are no economic problems to solve this would seem to be the most basic of economic errors and a particularly grievous one to make in analyzing resource and land poor japan naturally tyson also had to offer a rationale for why markets do not work and she concluded that entrepreneurs will pass up more profitable long run investments in order to pursue short run profits under certain conditions tyson zysman and dosi even admitted that their argument was simply a variation of the long discredited infant industry argument for protectionism under conditions of nondecreasing returns there is simply no way that markets can relate the varying future growth efficiencies of various industries to relative profitability signals facing individual producers basically this argument is a variant of the infant industry argument because of increasing returns current market signals can be misleading indicators of future profitability consequently government policies to promote a domestic industry with high future growth potential can improve economic welfare in the long run it would seem from the perspective of tyson zysman and dosi that modern day entrepreneurs might invest in the production of black and white television sets or mechanical typewriters made out of jute if not for the prodding and oversight of government bureaucrats in their justification of japan s new era thinking tyson zysman and dosi viewed technology from the historical rather than economic perspective in an age of information and communication technology their path dependent and sticky processes of technological development seem odd and not entirely appropriate for new age theorists who often view technology as spontaneous perfectly flexible and ever present nevertheless they clearly are new era philosophers of the japanese bubble and its new technological paradigm the expression technological paradigm involves a new set of best practice rules and customs new approaches to how to relate technology to market problems new solutions to established problems the notion of a major industrial transition of a second industrial divide of a shift from fordist to flexible manufacturing that has become a fad in some debates points to just such a shift in technological paradigm in retrospect the new era thinkers of the japanese bubble economy seem conceited and hopelessly naïve but that is the power of bubbles to deceive one of the few observers to correctly identify and characterize the bubble was christopher wood who wrote that japan became so arrogant in the late 1980s because it really believed it was immune from the natural laws of the marketplace this really was one of the most astonishing acts of mass delusion ever and future historians will marvel at it the japanese people might be particularly susceptible to the delusions of a stock market bubble because their culture has so long emphasized honesty and respect for authority and the government has carefully maintained the isolation of its people both of which could contribute to herd like behavior and which make them ripe for what charles mackay famously called the madness of crowds the japanese also have characteristics in their social psychology as well as their well known emphasis on precision and details that might make them more susceptible to new era delusions the truth is that all these psychological characteristics are unimportant in terms of the cause of bubbles in the wake of the bubble and bust japan experienced a long series of corruption scandals a procession of failed prime ministers the ousting of financial ministers the conviction of bureaucrats for corruption and the breakup of its one party system however the japanese have failed to truly recognize the cause of their bubble and to liquidate their economic mistakes instead they embarked on a post bubble course of easy credit public works and deficit spending that has only served to condemn the japanese economy to continuing economic doldrums postscript the success of japan after wwii was due entirely to the free market economy small government low taxes an appreciating currency and a very high personal savings rate that all changed when the bubble was born in the late 1980s because of overly stimulating monetary policy a quarter century after the stock market meltdown japan is still mired in an economic slump at the prodding of mainstream economists such as paul krugman japan has embarked on massive amounts of public works projects enormous amounts of government borrowing and extreme levels of monetary stimulus and quantitative easing none of this has worked it has left the country with the largest national debt relative to gdp in the world it has also diverted the attention of the japanese people and thus prevented the country from addressing its demographic crisis in fact it might have made the demographic crisis worse after all why get married and have children when the children will have to bear the enormous burden of the national debt

following russia s invasion of ukraine many self proclaimed ukrainians have asked for donations on social media we verify how to know which ones are untrustworthy russian president vladimir putin launched a military invasion of ukraine just before dawn on feb 24 since then tiktok has been full of videos and livestreams asking for donations for ukraine in most of these videos people ask viewers to donate to a charity but some of the videos and livestreams are of people claiming to be from ukraine asking for personal donations to help themselves or their families it can be difficult to know if a stranger asking for money over social media is who they say they are we ve put together some tips to help you figure out if an account is legit using one account soliciting for personal donations as an example the account sofiapalmroos111 has posted two videos since russia s invasion of ukraine began one of those videos is tagged donateme and the account itself lists a paypal username in its bio and claims to be a ukraine girl living in kiov editor s note we have a list of some legitimate organizations soliciting donations at the end of this article the sources laurie styron executive director of charitywatch says you should generally avoid donating to crowdfunding campaigns or individuals in most cases regarding a crisis like this the only exception to that might be if you personally know someone in the region or you have someone who can vouch for that person styron said in that case the crowdfunding site can be a very convenient easy way to get resources to someone in the region if you don t know the person it s really not the best way to give you re really kind of taking a big risk if you still want to donate directly to individuals you should at least take precautions to make it less likely you re scammed here are six things to be on the lookout for when figuring out if an account is real 1 is the profile picture generic one of the first things you should do is a reverse image search of the account s profile picture you can do a reverse image search by saving an image opening up google images or another search engine s image search clicking the search by image icon and uploading the image into the search bar if that search reveals the picture is actually another person s profile photo or is a stock image then it s likely the person running the account isn t who they say they are in the case of sofiapalmroos111 a reverse image search on google doesn t return any results but that doesn t necessarily mean the photo is unique a reverse image search of the image on the russian search engine yandex reveals that the photo is used for profiles on a number of russian social media websites often alongside different names none of those accounts use the name sofia palmroos which is the name the tiktok account uses a common profile picture or a stock photo profile picture doesn t necessarily mean an account isn t from ukraine or that it s fake a real ukrainian person might want to hide their identity for safety reasons or this might be the one account that actually belongs to the person in the photo but in conjunction with other red flags profile pictures can be the first indicator that a profile might be untrustworthy 2 is the account brand new an account s age is easy to check and can suggest someone might simply be looking to take advantage of a real world tragedy to benefit themselves a newly created account immediately looking for donations from others upon its creation is far less credible than an account that has been around and posting videos long before seeking help from others the sofiapalmroos111 account for example never posted a video until after russia s invasion of ukraine began once again this alone doesn t mean the owner of the account is from somewhere other than ukraine the account could belong to a ukrainian person who didn t use tiktok before heard about the donation drives on the platform

countries honeywell uop a supplier and licenser of petroleum refining solutions operated by technology and manufacturing giant honeywell international inc was the only company in its field named by nixon thanks to the economic cooperation and exchanges between china and the united states honeywell has been participating in china s economic development and promoting technological innovation and industrial upgrading together with our chinese partners steven lien president of honeywell aerospace asia pacific told beijing review according to lien honeywell moved its asia pacific headquarters to shanghai in 2003 subsequently established the company s largest research and development r d center in asia there and has been continuously expanding its investment in china ever since in 2016 the company invested an additional 100 million to expand its asia pacific headquarters and the r d center in shanghai s pudong new area it later launched its emerging market headquarters and innovation center in wuhan hubei province in early 2020 to explore the potential of central china becoming the first fortune 500 company to set up a subsidiary in the city that year nowadays china has developed into honeywell s second largest single market and the company s largest growth market the country s opening up efforts and its focus on sustainability and digitalization have created a favorable investment environment and business opportunities lien said like honeywell many u s enterprises that have developed businesses in china maintain their confidence in the market despite trade tensions between the two countries and the covid 19 pandemic in a 2021 survey of 107 u s enterprises doing business in china conducted by the u s china business council uscbc 95 percent of respondents reported they were profitable while u s businesses continue to expand their investment in china a growing number of chinese enterprises have also entered the american market such as auto glass manufacturer fuyao group which rose to prominence through the 2019 documentary american factory according to a report released in mid 2021 by the american chamber of commerce in china amcham china and global financial services provider ernst young ey up to 65 percent of the roughly 180 chinese funded companies they interviewed in the u s will still invest in the local market with profits made there up 15 percentage points from the previous year on the bright side more than 70 000 u s multinationals have had a presence in the chinese market with their combined annual sales reaching approximately 700 billion according to liao qun chief economist with the chongyang institute for financial studies at renmin university of china many u s enterprises including intel and qualcomm conduct the majority of their research and development within their china based subsidiaries the 2021 american business in china white paper released by amcham china showed that 75 percent of its member enterprises surveyed totaling around 1 000 proved optimistic about china s economic recovery in the next two years more than 50 percent said the growth of domestic consumption and the rise of chinese middle income group present great business opportunities given their strong commercial gains and positive growth prospects the majority of u s companies in china remain committed to the chinese market and very few have plans to divest according to the uscbc survey among the respondents 64 percent saw revenue growth in 2020 also 78 percent viewed china s growth prospects as better than those in other emerging markets in line with their strong performance and favorable growth prospects 43 percent of the firms said they would increase resource commitments in the chinese market in 2021 only 6 percent planned to

country pushes ahead with rural vitalization the survey also showed 87 percent of the u s companies did not shift any segments of their supply chains out of china in 2020 that percentage has remained unchanged for three years since 2019 among those that made adjustments only 2 percent backshored one or more segments to the united states while 12 percent moved elsewhere the small number of companies shifting supply chains can speak to the strength of china s supply chain ecosystems and to the difficulty of relocating although the case may be indefinite according to the survey report nevertheless challenges remain the report cited increased costs and uncertainties resulting from china u s frictions as top reasons for the small number of american businesses moving their operations to other locations other challenges include the pandemic competition with chinese companies and data flow the national development and reform commission ndrc china s top economic planner held several roundtable meetings with representatives of u s multinationals in china last year according to ndrc officials u s enterprises do not need to worry about being treated unfairly despite china u s trade tensions they said the chinese government would continue to enhance intellectual property right protection open up sectors like telecommunications culture and healthcare and ease market access restrictions for foreign investors to ensure a more level playing field prudent but confident eyeing a larger platform and increased access to financing a growing number of chinese firms have been

competitiveness data from u s based research provider rhodium group showed that china s direct investment in the u s rose by nearly 1 billion year on year to 7 2 billion in 2020 in addition to state owned enterprises such as cosco shipping corp ltd and air china private chinese firms have also gained a footing in the u s market fuyao glass america the u s branch of fuyao group began production in 2016 it is ohio s largest chinese company employing more than 2 000 workers chinese car manufacturer byd opened a plant in lancaster california in 2013 as the california air resources board ruled in

company it has grown to become the largest battery operated electric bus manufacturer in north america with around 1 000 employees as of 2021 the pandemic has most affected chinese funded businesses in the consumer services and property sectors in the u s while financial and telecommunication enterprises were only slightly affected and healthcare companies have made progress around 40 percent of the surveyed chinese enterprises believe china u s relations will thaw the report by amcham china and ey said in addition to the external impacts chinese businesses in the u s are facing increasing risks from the politicization of economic issues that make their business more difficult to run most recently the office of u s trade representative on february 17 labeled aliexpress an online retail service owned by alibaba and all purpose social media platform wechat owned by tencent as notorious markets the list had already included chinese e commerce platforms dhgate pinduoduo and taobao earlier the u s federal communications commission announced it would revoke its authorization to operate for the u s unit of china unicom one of china s major telecommunication carriers in january according to liao china and the u s have developed close economic and trade ties were a decoupling to occur nearly 200 000 staff of chinese enterprises in the u s would lose their jobs and the american access to the chinese market would further narrow in order to obtain the most mutual benefit the two sides must put an end to trade and technological frictions enhance cooperation on energy

following russia s invasion of ukraine many self proclaimed ukrainians have asked for donations on social media we verify how to know which ones are untrustworthy russian president vladimir putin launched a military invasion of ukraine just before dawn on feb 24 since then tiktok has been full of videos and livestreams asking for donations for ukraine in most of these videos people ask viewers to donate to a charity but some of the videos and livestreams are of people claiming to be from ukraine asking for personal donations to help themselves or their families it can be difficult to know if a stranger asking for money over social media is who they say they are we ve put together some tips to help you figure out if an account is legit using one account soliciting for personal donations as an example the account sofiapalmroos111 has posted two videos since russia s invasion of ukraine began one of those videos is tagged donateme and the account itself lists a paypal username in its bio and claims to be a ukraine girl living in kiov editor s note we have a list of some legitimate organizations soliciting donations at the end of this article the sources laurie styron executive director of charitywatch says you should generally avoid donating to crowdfunding campaigns or individuals in most cases regarding a crisis like this the only exception to that might be if you personally know someone in the region or you have someone who can vouch for that person styron said in that case the crowdfunding site can be a very convenient easy way to get resources to someone in the region if you don t know the person it s really not the best way to give you re really kind of taking a big risk if you still want to donate directly to individuals you should at least take precautions to make it less likely you re scammed here are six things to be on the lookout for when figuring out if an account is real 1 is the profile picture generic one of the first things you should do is a reverse image search of the account s profile picture you can do a reverse image search by saving an image opening up google images or another search engine s image search clicking the search by image icon and uploading the image into the search bar if that search reveals the picture is actually another person s profile photo or is a stock image then it s likely the person running the account isn t who they say they are in the case of sofiapalmroos111 a reverse image search on google doesn t return any results but that doesn t necessarily mean the photo is unique a reverse image search of the image on the russian search engine yandex reveals that the photo is used for profiles on a number of russian social media websites often alongside different names none of those accounts use the name sofia palmroos which is the name the tiktok account uses a common profile picture or a stock photo profile picture doesn t necessarily mean an account isn t from ukraine or that it s fake a real ukrainian person might want to hide their identity for safety reasons or this might be the one account that actually belongs to the person in the photo but in conjunction with other red flags profile pictures can be the first indicator that a profile might be untrustworthy 2 is the account brand new an account s age is easy to check and can suggest someone might simply be looking to take advantage of a real world tragedy to benefit themselves a newly created account immediately looking for donations from others upon its creation is far less credible than an account that has been around and posting videos long before seeking help from others the sofiapalmroos111 account for example never posted a video until after russia s invasion of ukraine began once again this alone doesn t mean the owner of the account is from somewhere other than ukraine the account could belong to a ukrainian person who didn t use tiktok before heard about the donation drives on the platform and created an account to seek out emergency funds but like a generic profile picture the account s age makes it more suspicious when considering the rest of these five tips as an additional tip an older account might also have giveaways to its inauthenticity if an account has a history of posting videos located somewhere other than ukraine and the account s owner has never talked about being from ukraine or visiting ukraine then it makes it less likely that the person is actually from ukraine if they later seek out donations 3 do the videos posted to the account show real clips from ukraine if a person isn t actually in ukraine they won t be able to record their own video of the invasion one strategy such a person might use is to post video of other events in the place of real footage the first video posted by sofiapalmroos111 depicts an explosion near an apartment building tagged war and ukraine but a yandex reverse image search of a screenshot from that video reveals that it s an image flipped video of a gas station explosion in novosibirsk russia from 2021 the video can be found on an instagram post from june 15 2021 with its location tagged to novosibirsk russian media such as the moscow times and the state run ria novosti news agency reported that a fuel pump at a gas station within the city had exploded on june 14 2021 other angles of the same explosion can be found in a number of youtube videos this video is particularly deceptive because it is of an incident that got little press coverage in mainstream english speaking media most of the people who would have seen the video on tiktok would not have ever seen the original video before it was tagged as part of russia s attack on ukraine 4 have the videos on the account been posted elsewhere by someone else before another way a person from outside of ukraine might pretend to be from the country is to take authentic videos from other accounts and post them like they recorded the video themselves while a real ukrainian person seeking help may post videos from other people they are unlikely to pass it off as their own video the second video posted by sofiapalmroos111 is of a group of helicopters flying across the sky with the caption russian army attacking my country the video is really from kyiv ukraine s capital but it s not from russia s ongoing invasion that video was first posted online on aug 19 2021 by a russian speaking person on facebook who said the video was of helicopters over kyiv at that time ukraine s military was participating in daily rehearsals for a parade to celebrate the 30th anniversary of ukraine s independence scheduled for aug 24 2021 photos and news coverage of the final week of rehearsals could be found in the kyiv post the american government

posted the day before or even earlier that day and pass it off as their own if you think you may have seen the video before it s a good idea to see if you might be able to find it again 5 does the account make spelling mistakes it shouldn t make english isn t the first language of a person from ukraine so an account isn t suspicious just because it makes spelling mistakes or has poor grammar but some spelling mistakes put an account s credibility more in question than others the bio for the sofiapalmroos111 account states that the account owner is from kiov instead of kyiv that mistake stands out because based on the ukraine government s official transliteration of the ukrainian alphabet to the roman alphabet used for english ukraine s capital city київ should be spelled kyiv 6 does the account ask for donations through paypal or venmo does paypal work in ukraine what about venmo be wary of accounts asking for money through paypal or venmo the only paypal feature available to

recognition of the so called donetsk people s republic dnr and luhansk people s republic lpr regions of ukraine by issuing executive order 14065 this new authority is substantially similar to the sanctions imposed on the crimea region of ukraine following its purported annexation by russia prohibitions under executive order 14065 as of february 21 u s persons companies and entities organized in the united states and their foreign branches and natural persons physically in the united sates as well as citizens and green holders irrespective of their physical location are prohibited from the following absent a license from ofac new investment in the dnr or lpr regions importation into the united states of goods services or technology from the dnr or lpr regions exportation reexportation sale or supply from a u s person of goods services or technology to the dnr or lpr regions and facilitation of the above transactions conducted by non u s persons unfortunately like the sanctions prohibitions involving the crimea region the relevant sanctions regulations do not currently incorporate the new executive order in absence of explicit definitions and guidance provided by ofac to the contrary it is reasonable to interpret these prohibitions as having the same general contours as those in other sanctions programs for example prohibited new investment is defined in other sanctions programs as a commitment of contribution of funds or other assets or a loan or other extension of credit and it would be reasonable to apply that definition to dealings involving the dnr or lpr regions we note that ofac has previously interpreted property abandoned in war torn regions as not being new investments under other sanctions programs but any u s company that must leave behind significant property in the dnr or lpr regions should consider providing notification to ofac executive order 14065 sanctions designation criteria executive order 14065 grants ofac authority to impose blocking sanctions on any individual or company determined to operate or have operated in the dnr or lpr regions since february 21 2022 be a leader official senior executive officer or member of the board of directors of an entity operating in the dnr or lpr regions or be owned or controlled by have acted for or on behalf of or have provided support to any individual or entity sanctioned pursuant

operation of accounts gl no 21 exportation of certain services and software incident to internet based communications gl no 22 executive order 14065 compliance considerations the sanctions targeting the dnr or lpr regions are substantially similar to those involving the crimea region u s companies as well as non u s companies that engage in dealings with u s persons the u s financial system or u s origin goods and technology should therefore consider applying the same procedures established to maintain compliance with those prohibitions depending upon the specific risk profile of a given company this generally includes the following ensuring that economic sanctions compliance screenings include the full postal codes of all russian and ukrainian counterparties identification of customers who are ordinarily resident in the dnr or lpr regions and due diligence review of distributors resellers who sell into the dnr or lpr regions to identify those that sell predominantly into those regions and those who may special order shipments for those areas as opposed to selling from their general inventory u k sanctions on february 22 the hm treasury s office of financial sanctions

further sanctions on feb 26 2022 the leaders of the european commission commission france germany italy the uk canada and the united states adopted a joint statement on further restrictive economic measures in the joint statement the following sanctions are announced the removal of selected russian banks from the swift messaging system the introduction of restrictive measures preventing the russian central bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of the sanctions taking measures to limit so called golden passports the forthcoming launch of a transatlantic task force that will ensure the effective implementation of financial sanctions by identifying and freezing the assets of sanctioned persons in that context the leaders will also engage other governments across the world and stepping up coordination against disinformation and other forms of hybrid warfare on feb 27 2022 the president of the commission ursula von der leyen announced further sanctions at the time of the writing of this gt alert not all text of these sanctions is yet available but we understand these sanctions to include the following a prohibition on all russian

sanctions in relation to lukashenko s regime including a prohibition on exports of products from belarus e g mineral fuels tobacco wood timber cement iron and steel and the extension of export restrictions in relation to dual use goods similar to that for russia conclusion the new eu sanctions packages are part of a multilateral sanctions response that includes measures already announced or currently considered by the united states and the uk as well as e g germany s decision to halt the nord stream 2 pipeline given the likelihood of overlapping but potentially distinct sanctions regimes imposed by different authorities around the world companies and organizations that have dealings in russia belarus and or parts of ukraine should assess all their business operations there to understand and be poised to respond to whatever collection of sanctions and trade controls may be forthcoming in the coming days and weeks companies and organizations should also be aware that existing eu sanctions remain fully in effect they are therefore well advised to increase their focus on compliance with the eu sanctions and to exercise increased caution and due diligence when doing business with russia in this respect it is important to realize how far reaching the eu sanctions can be since the restrictive measures apply a within the eu territory including its airspace b on board any aircraft or any vessel under the jurisdiction of an eu member state c to any person inside or outside the territory of the eu who is a national of an eu member state d to any legal person entity or body inside or outside the territory of the eu which is incorporated or constituted under the law of an eu member state and e to any legal person entity or body in respect of any business done in whole or in part within the eu finally developments in the eu regarding sanctions on russia and belarus are highly dynamic and continuous and changes can occur swiftly and unexpectedly as events unfold it is therefore important to continuously monitor and review the situation

if you have some unexpected cash on hand that you don t need immediately this is a great time to buy stocks it s that time of year again but paying taxes isn t always a drag many u s taxpayers get a sizable refund from the internal revenue service irs and if you can put that money aside and don t need it for basics or emergencies you should consider using it to buy stocks now is an ideal time to comb through the many great deals on the market as we near correction territory three motley fool contributors have some great suggestions and they include rh rh 1 43 live nation entertainment lyv 1 26 and netflix nflx 2 52 taking your home and your portfolio up a notch jennifer saibil rh rh is not your typical home goods store aside from its web site the company formerly known as restoration hardware operates less than 100 u s stores including several galleries or artistically designed showrooms in large museum like spaces the company targets an upscale demographic with luxury housewares including furniture décor lighting and more as you might imagine the company stumbled at the beginning of the pandemic but it ended 2020 with a 8 year over year sales increase and it s rebounded since in the 2021 fiscal third quarter ended oct 30 revenue increased 19 to more than 1 billion and earnings increased nearly 300 to 46 million but it hasn t been smooth sailing supply chain backups forced rh to delay its launch of rh contemporary a new collection as well as the opening of several new galleries and sourcebook mailings however despite the challenges management slightly raised its full year outlook in its q3 earnings release it expects 32 to 33 year over year revenue growth or 3 77 billion average analyst estimates for fiscal 2021 revenue fall at 3 8 billion and earnings per share eps estimates are around 26 rh beat eps estimates by a large percentage for the past four quarters rh reports q4 earnings on march 29 management is expecting a big recovery in 2022 calling it the year of the new ceo gary friedman said let this be remembered as the time rh unleashed the greatest display of innovation our industry has ever seen besides the rh contemporary launch and new u s galleries it will enter the u k market at a historic location and it has also secured locations for galleries in london paris and germany it s also sourcing locations in madrid milan brussels and other parts of

for a company with rh s prospects it s an excellent choice if you have money available to invest from your tax refund a streaming pioneer poised to remain among the leaders parkev tatevosian netflix the streaming content pioneer thrived at the pandemic onset gaining millions of subscribers worldwide the boom times may be slowing for netflix as economies reopen but that is no reason to turn sour on this top growth stock instead the painful 41 price decline in netflix s stock can be viewed as a buying opportunity for long term investors as of dec 31 netflix boasts 222 million streaming subscribers despite economies reopening netflix managed to grow subscribers 9 year over year in the near term sign up figures may be volatile as consumers adjust to the evolution of the covid 19 pandemic over the more extended period netflix has a powerful tailwind at its back streaming content is more convenient and less expensive than traditional cable tv folks can take a netflix subscription with them anywhere they can take a connected screen that fact could funnel millions more subscribers to netflix over the years the rising competition will undoubtedly create friction for netflix s growth but it has achieved a level of scale that likely cements it among the leaders as of its quarter ended dec 31 netflix s revenue is at an annual run rate of 30 8 billion the massive sum gives it one of the largest content budgets in the industry fresh content keeps existing subscribers and attracts new ones in a perpetuating cycle furthermore the scale is expanding operating profits which grew from 306 million in 2015 to 6 2 billion in 2021 of course investors should not be blind to the near term challenge facing netflix however its stock has arguably already paid that price down 41 in three months it s now selling at a price to earnings p e ratio of 34 8 that s around the lowest at which investors have been able to purchase netflix in the last five years if you re considering

st paul minnesota s projected budget surplus has grown to 9 25 billion according to a new forecast from the state s budget office up from the original historically high estimate of 7 7 billion higher forecasts for incomes consumer spending and corporate profits as well as slightly lower spending on education and human services are behind the improved outlook for 2022 2023 the minnesota department of management and budget said monday feb 28 as it released new numbers however even with the positive outlook officials said inflation and geopolitics could introduce uncertainty in their projections the february forecast is based on economic conditions before the russian invasion of ukraine which could disrupt financial markets and cause energy prices to climb said management and budget commissioner jim schowalter this is news that is significant it could put a dent in the anticipated forecast he told reporters at a monday afternoon news conference announcing the new surplus projection we acknowledge there is some uncertainty and we plan to monitor and share information as we get it the higher projected surplus could impact negotiations on spending priorities between the republican controlled senate and the democrat controlled house which have struggled to reach an agreement on proposals to give out bonus checks to frontline pandemic workers and replenish the state unemployment insurance trust fund advertisement gov tim walz called on lawmakers to compromise on the issues saying the better than expected surplus forecast means they don t have to pick and choose he also said the roughly 1 5 billion higher surplus means his proposed direct payments to minnesota residents could be three times the size he originally proposed up to 500 for an individual and 1 000 per couple what this gives us is an opportunity as minnesotans to make sure that we re investing in minnesotans right now and i ll make my case again this gives us the opportunity to get those checks right in the hands of folks now he said walz first called for the direct stimulus checks in his january supplemental budget recommendations house minority leader kurt daudt r crown and other republicans have criticized the plan as an election year gimmick house speaker melissa hortman dfl brooklyn park said she thinks there are more efficient ways to distribute tax rebates senate majority leader jeremy miller speaks with reporters in st paul monday feb 28 following the announcement of a 9 25 billion budget surplus alex derosier forum news service following walz s remarks to the press senate majority leader jeremy miller r winona told reporters the even higher projected surplus is yet another sign the state needs to cut taxes we thought 7 7 billion was massive but a 9 3 billion surplus is absolutely mind boggling and i think today s forecast really strengthens the argument for permanent ongoing tax relief to working minnesotans and senior citizens he said the state of minnesota is overtaxing the people of the state of minnesota at a time when they re struggling with record inflation minnesota senate republicans last week rolled out an 8 51 billion proposal to cut income tax and social security benefit taxes gop lawmakers said the surplus is an opportunity to send back tax dollars to minnesotans on a permanent basis democratic farmer labor lawmakers are pushing for a 1 billion proposal to put 1 500 checks in the pockets of 667 000 workers who reported to jobs for at least three weeks during the worst of the pandemic the dfl controlled house passed the proposal last week but the senate has not signaled interest in going beyond the original 250 million lawmakers agreed on in 2021 or expanding eligibility beyond workers like nurses and first responders following the new surplus announcement hortman again made an appeal for expanding front line worker checks to workers such as day care providers and food service workers advertisement who kept our economy going well the grocery store workers who went to work every day so we can eat she said our childcare providers who took care of the children of first responders so that the first responders could continue uninterrupted services to all for us members of both parties in the senate approved a 2 7 billion proposal to pay back the federal government and replenish the unemployment insurance trust fund the governor must sign that proposal by march 15 or businesses will face higher taxes starting in april the house would like to pass expanded front line worker pay along with funding for the unemployment fund speaker hortman said she has offered a deal to senate republicans but that they have not shown signs they are willing to discuss a compromise on unemployment insurance and front line worker bonus checks

walking through the doha airport in the early hours of the morning andrii zadorozhnyi is wrapped in a ukrainian flag and is desperate to get home andrii works for the united nations in nepal and once he crosses into ukraine he won t be allowed to leave again but his new mission is deeply personal and he says absolute in its importance what i want right now is to be in my country he said this bloody dictator from russia has done this impossible thing he has united the country as no one in politics or our previous presidents did before that s another reason that we will win from across the world ukrainians are heading home to be on their land with their people and to fight for their future andrii flew from doha to warsaw picked up supplies and then boarded an overnight bus for the border he s now in western ukraine he said he was going home to first be with his family second to support his colleagues and if necessary he would take up arms there are plenty more like him for many ukrainians making the journey home west warsaw station is their last stop before heading to the poland ukraine border this terminal is a hive of activity as ukrainians who have travelled across the border to escape war file off buses that then turn around and carry men back towards the front on this day a group of colleagues from germany a seaman who left his vessel in the united states and a reservist working in saudi arabia are among them all ukrainian and all intent on defending their country they ve gone to great lengths just to get this far it s like a reflex oleksandr petrov is from crimea a region annexed by russia in 2014 he was once in ukraine s airborne division and now serves as a reservist i came from saudi arabia when it started i asked my company to provide me tickets to go home and my company organised a transfer for me he said when the foreign aggressors are coming it s like a reaction it s like a reflex we are understanding now our history is being written it s a big page and i m not happy this page is written by the bloody letters it s a very bad thing but it s the rules of our life oleksandr is angry at the slow pace of his travel home and nervous that he hasn t heard from some of his brothers in the military for several days like others his plan is to take a bus to the border cross to the other side and join the first unit he comes across there is a complete lack of apprehension over the battle ahead and a certainty of its outcome oleksandr s phone is ringing non stop with calls from friends and colleagues co ordinating their own missions home he s not surprised he wouldn t expect any other reaction ukrainians know the price of freedom he said and now we have to pay oleksandr has training and experience but at this bus station many ukrainians making the journey with him have never fought in a war actually i am a seaman and i was on a contract and right now i m coming from the united states of america oleh novikov said my home in marioupol is surrounded with this f king russian occupation my wife my son are inside so i cannot stay i must go home i will go to the nearest army i want to fight i have no experience i am a civilian it s estimated at least 2 million ukrainians work abroad and men represent 70 per cent of that figure a father and son waiting to board a bus only left ukraine a week ago they came to poland to work and send money home but now they re headed back to fight they re answering the calls of ukraine s president volodymyr zelenskyy who urged his people to take up arms and join the resistance against russia mr zelenskyy also called for foreign nationals to come and join the fight for all citizens of the world to join a foreign league and fight side by side with the ukrainians against the russian war criminals in australia there are concerns about what such a call could lead to political leaders and terror experts warn that australians with radical views could be drawn to take part in the conflict in ukraine potentially posing a security risk if they return home messages from the front for anyone who volunteers to join the fight there s no guarantee of basic equipment and so as well as medical and food supplies military equipment is loaded into buses and sent towards the border at the bus station in warsaw several men refuse to say what s inside their bags the military supply stores in town are busy running low on stock and also not eager to talk about what s being sold women arriving from inside ukraine are briefing those heading home on what s happening in their country urging them to take more equipment ola reminna is standing with oleh she s just come from the town of dnipro he s heading back to his home of mariupol tears in her eyes ola talks about how the volunteers are dying without protective equipment those who want to join the army they suffer because they don t have vests and helmets she said i think the most important need of our men are these bulletproof vests they asked me to ask she s just fled a war has been forced to leave her family behind and is still standing at the bus station but she s upset because she doesn t know where to go to buy the vests she promised those back home when andrii crossed the border he took with him enough cold weather gear for three soldiers he said now was not a time to care about private savings if he doesn t spend it now in the future it could be too late the logistics are not good right now we re lacking basic stuff like bread sugar tea cigarettes and basic things for soldiers he said so what people do here they buy and produce everything they can and they just send it by buses by private cars to other regions even those not ready to fight are trying to get supplies to their countrymen who are ukraine is like a gate to all europe at a military supplies store in warsaw the man behind the counter laments another person heading to the border as the door swings open minutes before closing time we are going to have to stay open for a while yet he said the men inside are trying on boots flicking switchblades and buying up as much equipment as they can afford like andrii mykhailo is wrapped in a ukrainian flag he s 19 years old and a student of law and european studies he and his friend igor spent a day putting together one backpack of supplies for one soldier they say it has everything one person will need to stay warm and fed and to keep fighting they also bought 100 pairs of tactical glasses something they heard was needed back home they believe no item and no effort is too small to help fight a war of such significance it s not just a war between ukraine and russia it s between democracy and totalitarianism igor says also a student of european studies everyone in the world needs to know it s not just a ukrainian war the men heading home have similar warnings unafraid to be the ones shouldering the weight of the moment the russians want to keep us because ukraine is like a gate to all europe oleksandr said putin the russian leader he only understands power if we fight he understands this analysis of the fighting says russia is facing a bigger fight for the capital than it expected and ukrainian forces have slowed its advance andrii believes small acts like preparing a backpack of supplies to major undertakings like crossing several oceans to take up arms will be the difference in this war he says the ukrainian people know exactly why they re fighting and have never been more unified in their cause ukraine is a very powerful country and the power is not about the amount of weapons provided by our partners it s about people and their bravery and their courage he said people are our strength just usual people abc

healthcare realty trust inked a big deal and its stock fell hard but that s actually not the most interesting thing here what happened shares of office focused real estate investment trust reit healthcare realty trust hr fell in early trading on feb 28 losing as much as 10 5 of its value by roughly 2 p m et the stock was still off by about 10 meanwhile office peer healthcare trust of america s hta shares were down as much as 4 at 2 p m et which is a bit odd given that there s an acquisition going on here so what healthcare realty trust and healthcare trust of america have agreed to combine their businesses with healthcare trust of america shareholders receiving total compensation of 35 08 per share according to the news release issued before the market opened today that said 4 82 of that will come from a special dividend paid to healthcare trust of america shareholders with the rest coming in the form of stock but it isn t that simple because this is designed as a reverse merger with healthcare trust of america buying healthcare realty trust so the dividend is the only tangible thing shareholders of healthcare trust of america will receive the rest of the value is implied based on the planned 1 for 1 stock exchange when all the dust settles healthcare trust of america shareholders will own 61 of the combined company while healthcare realty trust shareholders will own 39 that makes sense given that healthcare trust of america is the buyer but the combined entity will be renamed healthcare realty trust change its ticker to healthcare realty trust s hr the leadership team from healthcare realty trust will be running it and healthcare realty trust will have more board representation the dividend meanwhile will be set at healthcare realty trust s 0 3025 per share per quarter and not healthcare trust of america s higher 0 325 per share per quarter effectively leaving the latter reit s shareholders with a dividend cut if all of this seems complicated well it is perhaps overly so but that s how wall street works sometimes however digging in just a little here helps explain why both stocks fell on the kind of news that usually sends one stock higher and another other lower basically investors aren t pleased with the final and complex outcome and they are voting with their feet now what the logic for this transaction is that it will increase healthcare realty trust s scale and allow for cost synergies between the two companies that makes some sense but investors are clearly taking a show me attitude given that both of the healthcare reits involved fell on the news to be fair a big down day on wall street probably didn t help investor sentiment any but this complex deal doesn t seem to be particularly alluring for shareholders even though healthcare realty trust is clearly going to end up a bigger reit at the end of it all
