keithbinns getty images stock tulsa okla descendants of the 1921 tula race massacre are being urged to avoid submitting dna samples to the city s investigation project amid privacy concerns which would delay efforts to identify remains found in a mass grave many believe is linked to the tragedy tulsa s greenwood neighborhood was an affluent area known as black wall street and was home to 1 200 black residents and hundreds of black owned businesses in the early 1900s a confrontation between groups of white and black residents following the arrest of a young black man named dick rowland who was accused of assaulting a white girl ended with 35 city blocks being burned to the ground on the evening of may 31 1921 historians believe as many as 300 people were killed as white mobs destroyed homes businesses churches schools hospitals and other buildings more than 100 years later many of the massacre victims bodies have never been found experts discovered a mass grave at oaklawn cemetery in october 2020 archaeologists exhumed 19 burials and identified 14 individuals to be used for dna analysis descendants and relatives of massacre victims are being asked to submit their own dna to help identify the bodies the city of tulsa is working with utah based lab intermountain forensics to examine the remains scientists have been able to extract dna from two of the 14 individuals so far mayor g t bynum apologized for the tulsa s role in the 1921 massacre in may 2021 and his spokesperson michelle brooks told abc news his office is working with the lab to determine if the samples they have will be good enough to take more dna from or if they will need to re exhume the bodies justice for greenwood a group working to secure reparations on behalf of survivors and descendants of the 1921 tulsa race massacre has cautioned against submitting dna they hosted a public town hall thursday to discuss concerns and answer questions over the dna testing the city is trying to encourage descendants to feel a sense of buy in by donating their dna said eric miller an attorney with justice for greenwood during the town hall miller and other members of the group are concerned descendants could be opening themselves or their relatives up to potential criminal prosecution by providing dna this is information that doesn t just impact an individual but impacts whole families you give your dna up and you re dragging your whole family and perhaps your whole community into this mess miller said uc davis law professor elizabeth joh who has written extensively and teaches courses on criminal law and procedure policing and surveillance spoke during the meeting what tulsa does is going to be followed by other communities states are only beginning to start to look at this issue joh said at the townhall intermountain forensics executive director deborah dilley told abc news she was surprised by the pushback we had at least two conversations with justice for greenwood dilley said they asked a lot of questions about how genetic databases work but they didn t ask specifically about our project and how our methodology was on that the lab is asking descendants to upload their dna profiles to gedmatch a genetic genealogy research site gedmatch is free and open to the public and match results vary based on which dna test was used but typically include the name email and degree of relatedness shared between relatives a pro version of gedmatch is available to law enforcement agencies working to find dna matches in criminal cases dilley says anyone participating in the project can choose the level of confidentiality they want researchers at intermountain forensics will be able to see any genetic matches but will not have access to any raw data or individual genetic profiles we wanted to make sure that everybody understood the different categories said dilley and we have some people who said nope i want to be absolutely private and so we will process those separately miller says the current privacy options are not enough there s a high bar of trust to be overcome here and the city has done nothing to assure us of the privacy and security of that information there s so many things they could have done miller told abc news when the 9 11 commission did dna matching to identify the remains of people killed in the terrorist attack it created a secure dna database that was not generally accessible tulsa officials say the gedmatch database was the best choice for this project gedmatch is one of the only two databases that allow comparisons to unidentified human remains of those two gedmatch is the only one which allows users to opt out of law enforcement searches involving crime scene dna tulsa communications director michelle brooks told abc news a spokesperson for gedmatch says law enforcement is not allowed to use the consumer version of the site per the terms of service but conceded that it could happen we cannot prevent users from choosing to circumvent the terms of service brett williams wrote in an email to abc news however these violations would almost certainly be discovered during court proceedings by the defense councils in their discovery process greg robinson is a member of the city s mass graves public oversight committee and spoke during the town hall process matters it matters deeply robinson said at the townhall it s not simply what we re doing it s the way we go about it that will give the confidence that s needed for us to move forward how are we supposed to trust that we can actually move toward justice and reparation then reconciliation if we can t do the investigation part right copyright 2022 abc audio all rights reserved
retirement is something that most working people hope to eventually achieve but planning for retirement isn t always easy many different variables such as the future cost of living your life expectancy the housing market etc need to be accounted for it can be challenging to know just how much you ll need in order to live the rest of your life comfortably there are many different financial strategies products services and investment opportunities that will be presented to people planning to retire but as you might expect while some of these investments will make a lot of sense others will not be nearly as lucrative finding ways to avoid these common retirement money traps will inevitably make the entire retirement planning process much easier the more you know read and ask about and understand the financial sector the better off you will be so what are the most common retirement traps being faced today this article will discuss some of the most common challenges money pits and ineffective strategies affecting the modern worker we will review if it s smart to invest in a business for yourself or discover more about the people you should trust to help you make end of life financial decisions by making a deliberate effort to understand these common hazards and avoid them throughout the retirement planning process you can better position yourself to achieve your long term financial goals 1 waiting to save for retirement when you are young you likely have many expenses which makes having early financial goals crucial for example in the class of 2019 about 69 percent of students graduated with some type of student loan debt averaging about usd 29 000 per person other early life expenses such as weddings a down payment on a house and childcare can also quickly begin to add up you might also want to spend your younger years traveling which can be both fulfilling and expensive with many potential expenses being faced by people under 40 long term financial goals like retirement are often pushed to the backburner however waiting even just an additional few years to save for retirement can be very consequential down the road for example a million dollar retirement portfolio growing at five percent per year yields fifty thousand dollars per year this means that waiting one year to begin saving effectively takes away fifty thousand dollars from your future self not that you currently have a million dollars just sayin starting small even just a few hundred dollars per month can deliver big dividends in the future additionally be sure to see if your current employer offers any retirement contribution or matching programs 2 extending your debt many people wrongly assume that just because they can access higher debt levels it must be in their best interest to actually do so however maxing out all sources of borrowing will negatively affect your credit score but it will end up costing you significant amounts of money over time according to choosing to forego these programs essentially leaves free money on the table many people wrongly assume that just because theyaccess higher debt levels it must be in their best interest to actually do so however maxing out all sources of borrowing will negatively affect your credit score but it will end up costing you significant amounts of money over time according to experian debt held by american consumers is approaching 4 trillion dollars a problematic all time high having access to debt can be useful in case of emergencies and to help build your credit over time some types of debt like a mortgage are seemingly unavoidable however to the greatest extent you possibly can you should try to quickly pay down your debt this is especially true if the amount the debt is growing measured in apy is greater than the returns you can receive from investing in the market when this is the case you will be effectively losing spending power as time goes on 3 overactive trading many people engage in day trading and other short term trading strategies to beat the market and build wealth over time new platforms like robinhood and webull have helped spark a trading revolution especially among young people the s p 500 produces an average annual return of about 14 percent per year beating this average return is something that many active traders can certainly do but choosing an overactive trading strategy can create unforeseen issues for aspiring savers to start with short term trading is taxed as ordinary income rather than being taxed as capital gains if you engage in too many trades you will quickly begin to accumulate near term tax obligations which as a result will decrease your actual rate of return i m not suggesting you never engage in any sort of short term trading or active trading strategies however it is important to be mindful of the risks you are taking and the obligations you are pursuing when doing so if doubling your money overnight was really so easy just about everybody would be doing it 4 low return accounts in finance risk and reward are typically correlated with one another meaning that you will need to accept lower rates of return if you want your money to be safe likewise anyone who wants their money to grow at a faster rate will need to be willing to take some risk because few people want to risk their life savings when planning for retirement it is not uncommon for people to choose investments and wealth storage vehicles with minimal downside usually this results in people distributing their wealth in accounts that offer very low but guaranteed rates of return such as a savings account federal bonds or certificates of deposit cd however some accounts issue rates of return that are so low they are hardly even worth considering for example in the united states the average savings account distributes a dismal 0 07 percent interest rate considering that the average annual inflation rate is around 2 46 percent for all years 1990 2018 this means that choosing a traditional savings account will cause to effectively lose money over time some accounts particularly online banking options offer much better rates but even still it is important to realize that low return risk free investments actually carry with them a tremendous opportunity cost 5 lack of liquidity when saving for retirement many people will become entirely fixated on their number they will come up with a number or asset allocation strategy that they believe can last them for the rest of their predicted lives and then once they have reached this number they will consider themselves ready to retire having a ballpark estimate of what your lifetime expenses might be can obviously be very helpful however not all large sums of money should be considered equally in addition to the number itself there are other factors like liquidity that will need to be considered liquidity is a term used to describe how easily a prospective asset can be converted into spendable cash your home which likely represents a very significant portion of your total wealth is generally considered an illiquid asset because it would take time to convert your home into any sort of cash you could actually use 6 not preparing for the required minimum distribution rmd according to the irs specifically addresses several different types of retirement plans the rmd affects the rmd affects traditional iras sep iras 401 k 403 b profit sharing plans and other defined contribution plans therefore if you currently have one or more of these types of plans you must account for the inevitable rmd people that ignore the rmd will often count on their current wealth for generating future wealth however because a withdrawal and corresponding tax will be required by law this current wealth may not be able to grow at the rate you are initially counting on the ability for wealth to stay within a specific account is not something you should readily overlook 7 not having a solid withdrawal strategy in addition to liquidity the rmd and other factors one of the most important components of retirement planning is determining how you plan to exit whenever that might be your withdrawal strategy ultimately will be what directly affects paying for and owning the things you ll need throughout the course of your retirement of course i m not suggesting you not invest in or live in a permanent home but ask yourself if the answer is a clear no then you may want to reconsider how you structure your portfolio according to the irs your required minimum distribution is the minimum amount you must withdraw from your account each year the rmd that applies to any given individual will depend mostly on their age along with a few other possible factors the rmd affects traditional iras sep iras 401 k 403 b profit sharing plans and other defined contribution plans therefore if you currently have one or more of these types of plans you must account for the inevitable rmd however because a withdrawal and corresponding tax will be required by law this current wealth may not be able to grow at the rate you are initially counting on the ability for wealth to stay within a specific account is not something you should readily overlook in addition to liquidity the rmd and other factors one of the most important components of retirement planning is determining how you plan to exit whenever that might be your withdrawal strategy ultimately will be what directly affects paying for and owning the things you ll need throughout the course of your retirement if you are heavily invested in a specific stock for example you are exposed to the possibility that this stock will be at a low point the day you want to retire do you plan on selling some of it anyway all of it what do you plan on doing with the money and will you be prepared to pay all corresponding taxes the answers to these questions will naturally vary depending on your specific situation however the absolute need to have a solid withdrawal strategy still remains be sure to speak with a financial planner about how to turn your current wealth into something you can actually use and preserve at least to an extent in the future 8 having an undiversified portfolio diversification is a fundamental investment principle and one that has continued to prove itself to be necessary over time there are many different ways to diversify your current holdings like the s p 500 index an index fund allows you to enjoy the general growth of a corresponding asset class without needing to make any overly active investment decisions when a particular asset class is doing well such as tech stocks in the late 1990s it is okay to follow your instincts and make some investments however putting all of your eggs in one basket can be reckless and inefficient unfortunately too many investors have had to learn this lesson the hard way like the s p 500 index an index fund allows you to enjoy the general growth of a corresponding asset class without needing to make any overly active investment decisions pursuing other asset classes including real estate bonds foreign currency and even cryptocurrency will help further reduce your exposure to specific types of risk 9 expensive 401 k accounts while the fees attached to your 401 k are easy to overlook at first the difference between a high fee and a low fee account can really begin to add up contrary to what your employer might tell you not all 401 k funds are the same about five percent offer no fees whereas 95 percent include a fee averaging about 0 45 percent some accounts have fees around one percent or even higher currently there are nearly 6 trillion dollars in american 401 k accounts which according to cnbc represents about 20 percent of the total retirement pie in the united states about five percent offer no fees whereas 95 percent include a fee averaging about 0 45 percent some accounts have fees around one percent or even higher though this sounds small at first the fees can really begin to add up and cost you tens of thousands of dollars in the future so if possible be sure to compare multiple options before making any firm commitments 10 personal investments mixing business and your personal life can often be very problematic as you establish yourself as someone who is ostensibly nearing retirement it is not uncommon for those close to you to begin pitching potential investment ideas you might in fact have the money needed to help your nephew start his own business and his business idea might in fact be great however personal investments are categorically unnecessary and risky if things go wrong 11 saving instead of investing ultimately retirement planning strategies can fall into one of two categories saving plans and investing plans while savers are concerned with preserving the wealth they ve already accumulated investors are more focused on having their money work for them obviously both the pursuit of returns and the avoidance of risk will need to be carefully balanced however some things remain universally true developing a comprehensive tax saving retirement plan can help shield you from risk don t watch the amount of money you have worked so hard to build will begin to dwindle only in the rarest of circumstances should you pursue these sorts of late in life investments those close to you will understand ultimately retirement planning strategies can fall into one of two categories saving plans and investing plans while savers are concerned with preserving the wealth they ve already accumulated investors are more focused on having their money work for them however some things remain universally true developing a comprehensive tax saving retirement plan can help shield you from risk taking time to understand the market and financial sector so that you can make better informed decisions use the correct data when distributing your wealth to deliver quantifiably better results conclusion there is no single universally best way to prepare for your retirement but by avoiding these common traps you can put

oxford overheard this midway through saturday s practice session for the 49th annual oxford 250 this is all a waste of time the pursuit itself pouring maximum effort into winning the northeast s crown jewel motorsports event is an honest one the dollars and sweat equity spent on winning the nation s richest one day stock car race can barely be measured drivers have made entire careers out of winning the oxford 250 and teams have cemented themselves as among the very best at their craft by placing the 6 foot tall trophy in their race shop but after watching five hours of practice this weekend three on friday afternoon and two more on saturday morning and with an additional 90 minutes slated for sunday before racing begins one thing has become abundantly clear the competition has never been closer in the nearly five decade history of the oxford 250 and it s not necessarily the best thing for the future of the sport consider this during saturday s two hour practice session more than 60 cars hit the track to tune up for sunday s oxford 250 the top 53 cars on the speed chart and likely several others whose times were not recorded were separated by less than half a second 0 413 seconds at the session s end the line for finding success is finer than ever and it s a line that s not found with a racing groove tire selection or even elbow grease applied in the weeks leading into the big event the line forms at the collective doorstep of the chassis manufacturers who build these race cars from the ground up distance racing port city race cars dale shaw race cars and fury race cars are the builders of choice in the oxford plains speedway pit area this weekend and each has been represented in oxford 250 victory lane in each of the last three seasons the super late models they churn out annually are now cookie cutters as one former oxford 250 champion noted saturday all sculpted from the same block of metal advertisement what does it mean for the race itself during the heyday of the oxford 250 from the mid 1990s through the early 2000s when car counts were highest and the starting fields were a who s who of the northeast there wasn t the parity the field boasts in 2022 there were a small handful of drivers to watch with legitimate chances to win the race guys like dave dion ralph nason mike rowe jeff taylor and tracy gordon among them and another three dozen drivers who were either hoping for a solid finish or simply to qualify if you didn t win you went back to the shop and for the next year you bought a few new parts and pieces tried to improve on your setups or hoped to gain some more experience until gary drew s upset win in 2001 a driver currently competing weekly at oxford plains had never won the oxford 250 so just how close is the competition now advertisement there were four former oxford 250 winners ben rowe curtis gerry bubba pollard and glen luce who finished up saturday s practice firmly mid pack on the speed charts between the 20th and 40th fastest cars plus a nine time track champion jeff taylor the port city triple crown champion trevor sanborn and the current oxford weekly super late model point leader max cookson any of the drivers who landed in these 22 spots could make the case that they ve got an opportunity to win on sunday so could another 15 20 drivers leaving us with more than half of the race s 70 total entries viewing themselves as contenders should they have the right amount of good fortune come sunday evening while it might be the right formula from an entertainment perspective think nascar racing at daytona or talladega that victory could come from anywhere on the starting grid does lend to some unpredictability but it s not necessarily the right formula for the health of short track stock car racing nowadays if you re not competitive in the oxford 250 you don t head back to the shop and work on making a six year old race car run better you don t find tweaks for your engine or replace worn out parts instead you call distance port city or fury and you order a brand new chassis to try and beat the guy that just beat you your checkbook gets you access to the same equipment the same setups and the same knowledge as the dozens of other cars parked alongside you in oxford s jam packed pit area the days of ingenuity hard work and on track experience have been replaced by technological advances and the information superhighway there is no more junk as southerner tommy ellis infamously referred to his fellow competitors following his 1983 oxford 250 win the competition level for sunday s 49th annual oxford 250 will be as high as ever and the right to call oneself a champion of maine s largest sporting event is as difficult to earn on track as it s ever been it s just that everything leading up to sunday is kind of a waste of time send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under
the us military has signed a 182 million contract with major american weapons maker raytheon to manufacture nasams national advanced surface to air missile systems for the ukrainian armed forces the production of the short and medium range air defense weaponry will be carried out at raytheon s plants in tewksbury massachusetts with an estimated completion date of august 23 2024 the pentagon announced in a friday statement the statement was issued just days after us president joe biden unveiled yet another huge military aid package for ukraine in washington s persisting efforts to help kiev continue its war against russia which started a special military operation in the neighboring country as a security measure against the eastern expansion of the us led nato military alliance the nearly 3 billion military assistance marks the largest single us arms package for ukraine so far and will include six nasams systems the weapons shipment will reportedly be funded as part of the so called ukraine security assistance initiative usai which means that the military equipment will be specifically produced for kiev and not taken from us arms depots nasams were described in an article published in air force magazine earlier this month as a vital piece of technology that could enable ukrainian forces to shoot down russian cruise missiles which have so far been striking targets in the country nearly unhindered the latest military aid for ukraine was announced just a week after pentagon unveiled another 775 million package of armaments for the country including himars missiles artillery and mine clearing systems we want to make sure that ukraine has a steady stream of ammunition to meet its needs and that s what we re doing with this package a senior us defense official told reporters last week according to local press reports biden would authorize the military aid using his presidential drawdown authority which allows him to authorize the transfer of excess weapons from us stocks the us has so far shipped billions of dollars worth of weaponry to ukraine since russian president vladimir putin declared a special military operation in ukraine with the aim of demilitarizing and denazifying the country ranging from anti armor missiles to helicopters and beyond the publicly announced lethal aid packages have already exceeded 10 billion with the vast majority of transfers happening under the presidential drawdown authority since the beginning of august the pentagon has announced two other military aid packages worth 550 million and 1 billion they include himars ammunition artillery ammunition javelin missiles and other anti armor weapons most of the funding for those weapons comes from money that congress has set aside to arm kiev congress has approved two aid packages for ukraine including 13 6 billion in march and 40 billion in may half of those amounts were earmarked for military assistance meanwhile us media outlets also unveiled last week that washington was providing ukraine with more weapons than the biden administration had publicly announced rumors are swirling around washington that the united states military provided ukraine with more weapons than announced politico reported last monday according to the report a senior pentagon official had revealed earlier that the us military had quietly been supplying the ukrainian forces with high speed anti radiation missiles harm for some time to target russian radar systems this is while interpol raised concern that many of the arms shipped to kiev will be sold ending up in the hands of criminals the high availability of weapons during the current conflict will result in the proliferation of illicit arms in the post conflict phase secretary general of the international criminal police organization juergen stock warned moscow has long been critical of weapons supplies to kiev by washington and its allies saying that they only prolong the conflict and increase the risk of a direct confrontation between nato and russia

the upcoming film my son hunter is an incredible example of conservatives looking for alternate venues to spend their hard earned money donald trump jr said during a panel discussion thursday evening on truth social following the release of the film s full theatrical trailer look at disney stock look at netflix stock look at what s going on trump said our people have finally had enough we re no longer just saying well we re going to accept different views while the other side takes your hard earned money and uses it and weaponizes it against all of your belief systems day in and day out they ve said enough and now they re looking for alternate venues to spend their hard earned money and i think this movie is going to be an incredible example of that trump s remarks came during a panel discussion on truth social hosted by former california congressman and current truth social ceo devin nunes that also included my son hunter director robert davi licensed to kill die hard the goonies government accountability institute president breitbart senior contributor and bestselling author of red handed how american elites get rich helping china win peter schweizer and breitbart editor in chief alex marlow watch the panel my son hunter which marks breitbart s expansion into film distribution was a crowdfunded project inspired by the investigative reporting of peter schweizer and breitbart news about the biden family s corruption reporting which as the film s director robert davi noted the media and big tech sought to censor during the 2020 election no one was talking about the bidens until recently now the new york times says it s okay davi said this is i think the first peek that lifts the skirts so to speak from the bidens to show people in a humorous way it s like the laptop exploded onto film for me the film follows hunter biden aka the smartest guy the president of the united states knows as he navigates a tangled web of prostitution partying international business dealings drugs sex chinese spies a laptop from hell ukrainian oligarchs more sex more drugs and of course his responsibilities to the leader of the free world watch the trailer bestselling author peter schweizer who was the first to report on hunter biden s corrupt business dealings with foreign governments at a time when his vice president father was negotiating u s foreign policy with those regimes described my son hunter as an entertaining shorthand version of his 300 page bestselling book chronicling the biden family corruption i think what people are going to get in this film is information lifted from the pages of my book and turned into the flesh schweizer said in fact schweizer said that the truth about hunter biden s corruption seems almost too outrageous for fiction it s such an unbelievable story in a way schweizer said i mean imagine if you were a screenwriter and you went to producers in l a and you said hey i ve got this idea for a film it s going to be the vice president s son he s going to take tens of millions of dollars from the chinese he s going to be a coke addict and then he s going to leave his laptop computer at a repair store and that thing s going to but the mainstream media is going to try to cover it up i mean the producers would just laugh you out of the room yet that s exactly what happened indeed donald trump jr noted that had the news about hunter s laptop from hell not been censored the outcome of the 2020 election might have been very different the story was out but they did whatever they could to cover it up and that s part of the problem trump said that s why i love that you guys went about doing this because even though the story existed in the ether social entertainment mainstream media no one would actually cover it because they understood that it would hurt their cause and their narrative now we know something like 17 percent of all people would not have voted for joe biden just on the suspicion that where there s smoke there s fire that would have changed the election so you can see how these things were manipulated so so flagrantly panel host devin nunes made a pointed joke highlighting the fact that members of the u s intelligence community were among the driving forces behind censoring the news about hunter biden during the 2020 election by declaring all reporting about his laptop was russian disinformation the panel was quick to note the justice department and the fbi s disparate handling of the trump and biden families this is a story that the fbi should be all over and they re nowhere to be seen davi said about the hunter biden corruption scandals this is the biggest story in america as far as i m concerned because the corruption has been kept from the public i ve investigated corruption for decades on going after republicans and democrats schweizer said the treatment that the bidens and received compared with the treatment of the trumps there s absolutely no comparison when asked by nunes how biden family corruption compared to past political corruption schweizer called it absolutely the worst that i ve seen you literally have the most powerful family in the united states taking money from our sworn rivals and taking it from four businessmen who are linked with chinese intelligence schweizer stated if i was hunter biden i d be in jail donald trump jr said you know i m probably the most deposed slash subpoenaed human being civilian in the history of the u s government they ve done countless hours nothing there literally nothing or you would have heard about it by now and i d be in jail meanwhile as trump explained hunter biden has a laundry list of scandals that have seemingly gone unnoticed by the nation s various law enforcement agencies look at the international deals a billion dollars invested in a crackhead china trump quipped let s just say china does a little bit better diligence than that unless they re buying someone no show jobs in the ukraine for millions of dollars with no understanding of even the basic business or an understanding of the language doesn t matter money laundering operations for literal russian oligarchs with direct ties to putin i was told that s russian collusion apparently it doesn t matter that money couldn t go through a u s conventional banking system because it was literally linked to human trafficking rings and sex trafficking rings in eastern europe and that s not a problem and that s before we even get into probably the countless other personal issues the guy is actually on film with crack pipes and prostitutes talking about how the russian mob has his laptop because at this point which one of our enemies doesn t have a hunter biden laptop trump said ruefully about biden s son trump explained that it s this disparate treatment that has inspired his own political activism and his hope for the success of my son hunter i m just trying to be on the leading edge of the culture wars because we ve sat back for decades and allowed to assume control over every major institution in our country trump said even the u s military in terms of leadership has gone woke the fbi as evidenced by the hostage rescue team raiding mar a lago just last week against their political enemies simply for having the guts to call out the corruption at the fbi we then get to get lectured sanctimoniously from christopher wray how dare we not respect the fbi when it seems like they haven t done anything to deserve that respect when you re talking about forging fisa warrants lying before congress the people who did that whether that s andy mccabe or peter strzok they maintain their jobs they get contributorships at cnn and msnbc there s virtually no penalty the politicization of our institutions and the outright corruption at this point needs to be called out trump said and i think we ve actually hit a tipping point i think breitbart has done a great job of highlighting these things we created truth with devin to be able to point out these things trump noted that conservatives are now busy building their own and taking on the power structures that have been so heavily dominated by the left trump sees my son hunter as part of the tip of the spear in this conservative fight back the one thing i can say that s been great about joe biden and this administration is it s been so disastrous that the people who have been agnostic have been too busy to get involved in politics or thought they were too busy to get involved in politics they re involved they re motivated they re watching and they re getting it trump said i think we re creating an entire new economy as we speak with all of the things that are going on and this is going to be part of the tip of the spear of that so i want it to be successful because i want people to understand just how important this is we re fighting for our values we re fighting for our country and we re just fighting for the future that we want to leave our children with my five young kids i want to make sure i leave them in america they recognize breitbart editor in chief alex marlow sees breitbart s distribution of my son hunter as embracing the legacy of the company s founder andrew breitbart i m very proud and i know everyone at breitbart is to be extending andrew breitbart s legacy he of course famously said politics is downstream of the culture it is the culture that is really the driving force in american life and there is no one who executed on that premise more in recent years than the trump family marlow said my son hunter which is available for pre order now and will be available for download and streaming starting september 7 stars laurence fox victoria inspector lewis the professor and the madman as hunter biden gina carano the mandalorian dead pool heist as a secret service agent and john james dynasty as joe biden nunes noted that actress gina carano was herself the subject of a hollywood cancellation despite her large fanbase truth social has already shown its success in helping artists bypass woke cancellation the most recent example of this was truth social s successful promotion of john rich s song progress which hit number one in the apple itune s song chart after truth social promoted it nunes said he hopes truth social can repeat this success with the promotion of my son hunter hopefully we can recreate the success that john rich had with this new song progress marlow joked about the beneficial publicity that comes from cancellation i m hoping for at least some level of a cancellation because that seems to be the best way to get publicity these days marlow quipped i m guessing a lot of people are not going to want this film out good we should hear from you by all means let us know what you think mysonhunter com is where people should go marlow summarized how breitbart s embrace of this film is in keeping with the site s mission and core beliefs we believe the american people are smarter than the average bureaucrat in washington they re smarter than the average democrat politician marlow said this isn t just conservative content it s blatantly anti woke content and of course the bidens aren t going to be happy about it but this is about using entertainment as an art form to try to convey some deadly serious ideas in a humorous way and that elevates that s stuff that america was all about director robert davi revealed that lawyers associated with hunter biden actually tried to infiltrate the my son hunter set while he was filming in serbia hunter was in serbia and belgrade a month before we started the film davi explained they sent a team of lawyers saying they were doing a documentary to infiltrate the set and we find out later on that they were sent down they were representing hunter biden now what s he doing in serbia when we re filming in september what was hunter doing in serbia in belgrade in september very interesting it s hardly surprising that anyone associated with the bidens would not want americans to see this film as marlow noted the film brings back so many of the biden family scandals that you re shocked at how many incidences that went down for real in hunter biden joe biden s life that you ve forgotten there s so many scandals you ve forgotten so many that you could barely count them all my son hunter

in this sept 19 2014 photo the alibaba logo is displayed during the company s ipo at the new york stock exchange ap file photo washington the u s and china have reached a tentative agreement to allow u s regulators to inspect the audits of chinese companies whose stocks are traded on u s exchanges in a long festering dispute u s regulators have threatened to boot a number of chinese companies off the new york stock exchange and nasdaq if china doesn t permit inspections the deal announced friday by market regulators in the u s and china is preliminary securities and exchange commission chairman gary gensler said the proof will be in the pudding while important this framework is merely a step in the process gensler said in a prepared statement this agreement will be meaningful only if u s regulators actually can inspect and investigate completely audit firms in china if they cannot roughly 200 china based issuers will face prohibitions on trading of their securities in the u s if they continue to use those audit firms an agreement would mean that u s investors will maintain access to shares of important chinese companies while at the same time being protected by the integrity of company audits this is unequivocally positive news and a major step toward averting mass delisting of chinese companies in the u s analyst tobin marcus at evercore isi said in a note to clients however he said a deal is only the first step toward avoiding delisting what ultimately needs to happen is that u s inspectors need to show up and complete inspections he said the inspections could take months the u s regulators plan to have inspection teams on the ground in china by mid september the public company accounting oversight board is due to determine by year s end whether the chinese government is continuing to block access to the audit books a negative finding could result in u s actions such as stock trading bans although it s preliminary the agreement is a rare instance of accord at a time when relations between the u s and china are fraught by sparring over trade the war in ukraine and human rights the tension was ratcheted higher by u s house speaker nancy pelosi s recent trip to taiwan the self governing island that china claims as its territory the chinese responded to the visit by pelosi second in line to the u s presidency with military drills around the island u s regulators had warned that without an agreement some 200 companies including alibaba group the world s biggest e commerce competitor might be ejected from u s exchanges or face trading restrictions the americans said that other governments have agreed to allow such audit reviews which are required by u s law and that china and hong kong are the only holdouts three of china s biggest state owned companies announced this month they would remove their shares from the new york stock exchange but gave no indication that the action was related to the audit dispute petrochina ltd china life insurance ltd and china petroleum chemical co cited the small volume of trading of their shares in the new york market and the expense of complying with regulations in a foreign market the companies said their shares still would be traded in hong kong which is chinese territory but open to non chinese investors the dispute over audits of chinese companies dates back more than a decade scores of chinese companies were suspended or kicked off u s exchanges most of them for failing to file timely financial reports at least two dozen were hit with sec fraud or accounting charges but investigations stalled because the companies audit papers were in china beyond the sec s reach under terms of the new agreement u s accounting inspectors in the pcaob would have independent discretion to select any chinese company audit for inspection or investigation and they would get direct access to interview all personnel of the audit firms whose work is being inspected the inspectors could see complete audit work papers with no redactions in beijing the china securities regulatory commission called the agreement an important step in resolving the issue of common concern of audit and regulatory cooperation investors and companies on both sides will benefit from keeping chinese shares trading on u s exchanges the commission said the terms the commission outlined would give chinese officials a role in any possible investigations china won the right to conduct similar reviews of u s audit firms where relevant according to the chinese regulators allowing beijing to portray the agreement as mutually positive rather than an instance of china giving in to american pressure china has yet to express any need to carry out such reviews of its own chinese regulators also would be allowed to participate in interviews with audit personnel

keithbinns getty images stock tulsa okla descendants of the 1921 tula race massacre are being urged to avoid submitting dna samples to the city s investigation project amid privacy concerns which would delay efforts to identify remains found in a mass grave many believe is linked to the tragedy tulsa s greenwood neighborhood was an affluent area known as black wall street and was home to 1 200 black residents and hundreds of black owned businesses in the early 1900s a confrontation between groups of white and black residents following the arrest of a young black man named dick rowland who was accused of assaulting a white girl ended with 35 city blocks being burned to the ground on the evening of may 31 1921 historians believe as many as 300 people were killed as white mobs destroyed homes businesses churches schools hospitals and other buildings more than 100 years later many of the massacre victims bodies have never been found experts discovered a mass grave at oaklawn cemetery in october 2020 archaeologists exhumed 19 burials and identified 14 individuals to be used for dna analysis descendants and relatives of massacre victims are being asked to submit their own dna to help identify the bodies the city of tulsa is working with utah based lab intermountain forensics to examine the remains scientists have been able to extract dna from two of the 14 individuals so far mayor g t bynum apologized for the tulsa s role in the 1921 massacre in may 2021 and his spokesperson michelle brooks told abc news his office is working with the lab to determine if the samples they have will be good enough to take more dna from or if they will need to re exhume the bodies justice for greenwood a group working to secure reparations on behalf of survivors and descendants of the 1921 tulsa race massacre has cautioned against submitting dna they hosted a public town hall thursday to discuss concerns and answer questions over the dna testing the city is trying to encourage descendants to feel a sense of buy in by donating their dna said eric miller an attorney with justice for greenwood during the town hall miller and other members of the group are concerned descendants could be opening themselves or their relatives up to potential criminal prosecution by providing dna this is information that doesn t just impact an individual but impacts whole families you give your dna up and you re dragging your whole family and perhaps your whole community into this mess miller said uc davis law professor elizabeth joh who has written extensively and teaches courses on criminal law and procedure policing and surveillance spoke during the meeting what tulsa does is going to be followed by other communities states are only beginning to start to look at this issue joh said at the townhall intermountain forensics executive director deborah dilley told abc news she was surprised by the pushback we had at least two conversations with justice for greenwood dilley said they asked a lot of questions about how genetic databases work but they didn t ask specifically about our project and how our methodology was on that the lab is asking descendants to upload their dna profiles to gedmatch a genetic genealogy research site gedmatch is free and open to the public and match results vary based on which dna test was used but typically include the name email and degree of relatedness shared between relatives a pro version of gedmatch is available to law enforcement agencies working to find dna matches in criminal cases dilley says anyone participating in the project can choose the level of confidentiality they want researchers at intermountain forensics will be able to see any genetic matches but will not have access to any raw data or individual genetic profiles we wanted to make sure that everybody understood the different categories said dilley and we have some people who said nope i want to be absolutely private and so we will process those separately miller says the current privacy options are not enough there s a high bar of trust to be overcome here and the city has done nothing to assure us of the privacy and security of that information there s so many things they could have done miller told abc news when the 9 11 commission did dna matching to identify the remains of people killed in the terrorist attack it created a secure dna database that was not generally accessible tulsa officials say the gedmatch database was the best choice for this project gedmatch is one of the only two databases that allow comparisons to unidentified human remains of those two gedmatch is the only one which allows users to opt out of law enforcement searches involving crime scene dna tulsa communications director michelle brooks told abc news a spokesperson for gedmatch says law enforcement is not allowed to use the consumer version of the site per the terms of service but conceded that it could happen we cannot prevent users from choosing to circumvent the terms of service brett williams wrote in an email to abc news however these violations would almost certainly be discovered during court proceedings by the defense councils in their discovery process greg robinson is a member of the city s mass graves public oversight committee and spoke during the town hall process matters it matters deeply robinson said at the townhall it s not simply what we re doing it s the way we go about it that will give the confidence that s needed for us to move forward how are we supposed to trust that we can actually move toward justice and reparation then reconciliation if we can t do the investigation part right copyright 2022 abc audio all rights reserved
by ron paul even after decades educating americans on economics and liberty i m still amazed by the number of people who have no idea what the federal reserve is or what they do sometimes if put on the spot folks will hazard a guess they re a bank right sort of but not really they re the ones who make the stock market go up while that s true it s not actually their job to pull the strings on wall street they print money don t they true technically the bureau of engraving and printing a subsidiary of the department of the treasury physically produces greenbacks or federal reserve notes or dollars what the federal reserve does is decide the total supply of dollars and then create or destroy but usually create however many dollars they think the world needs thus as i explained in my article forget about the gold standard let s talk about the copper standard the federal reserve is in charge of either creating or destroying inflation mostly creating today i m going to show you exactly how the federal reserve has abused their inflationary powers to steal from you if you re not absolutely furious by the time you re done reading this article well call the pope you must be a saint if like me you re not a saint get ready to feel your blood boil inflation robs responsible savers rewards debtors when my father was getting ready to retire back in the 60s his nest egg was invested very conservatively in cds at the bank that made sense for him because at the time banks paid 2 3 over the rate of inflation he didn t have to worry about the value of his money declining faster than it grew fast forward to today banks are paying less than 1 apy on cds and savings accounts on average while inflation is 9 1 one of the things you hear a lot in the investing world is there are no guarantees well i ll tell you right now these days anyone interested in saving their money at these rates is guaranteed to lose since 2008 and the massive bailouts associated with our nation s last financial crisis the federal reserve has kept inflation rates artificially low there are two reasons to do this low interest rates encourage borrowing and spending borrowing and spending create economic growth which means jobs and ideally more productive economic activity unfortunately not all borrowing and spending is equally beneficial think about this if you take advantage of say a one year zero percent financing deal to buy a new bigger tv does this make you more productive probably not in fact probably the opposite on the other hand a family farm might take advantage of the same sort of financing deal to upgrade to a modern combine harvester a computer programmer working from home might replace an aging computer with a newer faster system these choices would lead to greater productivity now from the fed s perspective they simply can t tell the difference between productive and non productive economic activity they re just looking at the numbers and as long as economic activity increases they re happy we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us and they aren t the only ones low interest rates allow the federal government to continue deficit spending just like american families the federal government benefits from low interest rates too when you spend more than you make every year for over a decade you definitely don t want interest rates to go up so low interest rates encourage economic activity know what they discourage saving money living responsibly below your means stashing away something for an emergency or for your future the federal reserve hates that saving money does not create economic activity of course money you have sitting in the bank isn t idle the bank is busy lending it out to other people but banks even irresponsible ones don t create as much economic activity with your money as you would if you spent it so the federal reserve represses interest rates that encourages american families and businesses to go out and spend even to go into debt hopefully they do so to increase their productivity meantime the federal government is doing the same thing borrowing money to fund spending on everything from latest generation fighter jets to bird watching not a joke that interest rate repression is effectively taking money away from people who save and handing it out to those in debt and not just a little we re 4 trillion poorer thanks to the fed at the end of 2021 economist alex j pollock ran the numbers and figured out exactly how much this interest rate repression has cost american savers an absolutely jaw dropping 4 trillion since 2008 not coincidentally that figure is pretty close to the amount of retirement savings deficit americans currently have now obviously there s no guarantee that 4 trillion would go into retirement accounts that these two numbers would really balance one another out however it s clear that the federal reserve is more than willing to impoverish responsible families living within their means saving for the future in the name of greater economic activity and that s just the direct cost of the fed s interest rate repression there s an indirect cost as well we call that inflation fortunately there s one form of savings the fed can t penalize just say no to interest rate repression inflation and the federal reserve the federal reserve controls the nation s interest rates and the amount of u s dollars in circulation now that s a lot and it has a huge economic impact but it isn t everything there are still assets that everyday american families can use to help protect themselves against the fed s backdoor taxation financial assets that can t be inflated that can t be hacked and that do a great job of storing purchasing power for the future i m talking about physical gold and silver precious metals have a centuries long track record of preserving purchasing power against inflation don t make the mistake of thinking that gold and silver are only for billionaires or doomsday preppers there s a reason that nearly every central bank in the world owns precious metals for their intrinsic value and economic stability until our nation returns to its senses and gets back to a firm economic foundation based on honest money it s up to us to ensure our family s financial futures are secure you can use money you ve

menafn jordan times london in the year since us president donald trump escalated america s trade war with china policymakers and financial markets have been obsessed with the dangers to both countries economies yet the real threat the conflict poses to the global economy lies elsewhere despite all the lurid headlines about the trade war causing a recession in the united states or some kind of collapse in china and its asian neighbours recent economic data reveal a very different picture the us and chinese economies have performed quite decently and in line with trends that were already well established before the escalation of the trade war the main victim has been an innocent bystander europe the unexpected distribution of damage can be clearly seen in the international monetary fund s imf quarterly revisions of its economic projections the latest revisions published in late july forecast 3 2 per cent global growth in 2019 down from 3 7 per cent in the imf s october 2018 projection but this downward revision was attributable to neither the us nor china the chinese economy is expected to grow by 6 2 per cent exactly the rate predicted a year ago the forecast for us growth is 2 6 per cent up 0 1 percentage points from a year ago the projections for japan and other asian economies are also essentially unchanged this leaves europe responsible for almost the entire global slowdown the imf now expects eurozone growth to reach 1 3 per cent this year down 0 6 percentage points from its forecast a year ago and german growth is expected to amount to just 0 7 per cent compared to the 1 9 per cent rate predicted a year ago thus if any region will soon pull the world into recession it is europe and specifically germany not the us china or asia there are three reasons why the european economy has suffered far more this year than either of the belligerents in the us china conflict for starters europe is extremely vulnerable to collateral damage from a trade war because it is more dependent on trade exports account for 28 of the eurozone s gdp compared to only 12 per cent for the us and 19 per cent for china moreover europe s policy response to economic shocks is almost always wrong when the us or china experience a shock that threatens to reduce economic growth they generally respond with a pre emptive and counter cyclical demand stimulus in response to the trade war the us federal reserve board almost immediately reversed its monetary policy course and began cutting interest rates china has expanded monetary fiscal and credit policies to ensure that consumption housing construction and infrastructure spending compensate for lost exports and private investment in europe by contrast the policy response to weak demand tends to be pro cyclical when growth falters instead of expanding fiscal policy european governments raise taxes and cut public spending to control budget deficits and financial regulators tighten credit conditions by forcing banks to build up their capital and increase their provisions for risky loans third europe has been hit by two internal political shocks that were even more damaging than the us china trade war last summer s budget clash between the european commission and italy s new populist government revived fears of a currency and banking collapse even worse than the euro crisis that erupted a decade ago and in march just as the italian risk subsided a no deal brexit suddenly emerged as a serious threat because the eu exports almost twice as much to the united kingdom as it does to china a sudden stop in commercial relations with the uk could be as damaging as the sudden stop in finance that occurred in 2008 now for the good news two of the three reasons for europe s poor performance misguided macroeconomic policies and conflict with italy or britain are moving toward resolution and although excessive exposure to global trade especially in germany continues at least europe s overdependence on exports is starting to be recognised as a structural vulnerability not a sign of competitiveness or fundamental economic health starting with macroeconomics an easing of fiscal policy is now being seriously debated in almost every european country within the incoming european commission and at the european central bank ecb while opposition to any significant fiscal expansion remains strong in germany the largest eurozone economy resistance there is likely to crumble under the combined pressure of weak economic growth fears of populist parties demands for green investment and increasingly pointed criticism from the european commission and the ecb and even if germany sticks to fiscal retrenchment for another year or two the rest of europe will move toward lower taxes and higher public spending for a reason that is not widely recognised the interaction between monetary and fiscal policy the ecb s recent decision to resume quantitative easing and maintain negative interest rates without any time limit guarantees that debt service costs will fall drastically for highly indebted governments such as those in italy spain belgium and france lower interest payments will give these governments more budgetary space to cut taxes or increase public spending this is especially true for italy whose interest costs currently exceed 3 5 per cent of gdp this easier fiscal environment has ended italy s conflicts with the eu over budget rules which seemed to threaten a euro breakup a few months ago at the same time the uk supreme court s decision striking down prime minister boris johnson s suspension of parliament has virtually eliminated the risk of a no deal brexit with the political and macroeconomic climate improving europe should be able to overcome the structural handicap of excessive exports and avoid recession germany may be less fortunate because it cannot be cured of its export addiction until it abandons its misguided budget consolidation until then germany will be stuck in its unfamiliar new role as the laggard of europe for the rest of the world however this may not matter what matters for the global economy is whether europe as a whole

menafn jordan times london the us election has passed without any big surprises and the enthusiastic reaction in global financial markets has been exactly what any economics textbook would predict if a predictable conventional centrist replaced an erratic extremist populist as us president beyond investor psychology there are several fundamental reasons that justify a biden rally the near certainty of further fiscal stimulus in the short term the high probability of pro growth keynesian demand management in the medium term and the possibility of a global investment boom in new energy and transport technologies in the long term yet most investors economists and political pundits are skeptical about all these possibilities because of the democrats failure to retake control of the senate according to conventional wisdom biden will find himself immediately paralysed because republicans will follow the same playbook they used to sabotage barack obama s administration after winning a house majority in 2010 speaker john boehner blocked almost all legislation turning obama into a lame duck president for six of his eight years in office now the senate under gop control since the 2014 midterm election will again create gridlock and prevent pandemic relief block fiscal expansion and thwart new investment in energy or infrastructure but this is not the whole story there are five new features of political dynamics in america that this gloomy conventional wisdom has overlooked first a big covid 19 relief bill is almost certain to pass congress even before biden is sworn in now that the election is over the demands for government support from business lobbies will overwhelm senate republicans obstructionism while the democrats must create conditions for a strong economic recovery in the first few months of biden s term thus there is every chance of a quick and dirty compromise whereby republicans agree to a package of slightly above 1 trillion democrats accept previously rejected conditions such as immunity for employers from liability for covid 19 and trump takes credit for the whole deal second when biden becomes president he will find it much easier to maintain public support for government spending and resist pressures for budget consolidation than obama did after losing the house in 2010 the covid 19 crisis has transformed public attitudes to government spending and borrowing but even before the pandemic voter interest in government debts and deficits was rapidly eroding because the trump administration s policies had clearly demonstrated that deficits did not cause the economic damage that conservative propagandists claimed republican efforts to resurrect the obsession with deficits which served the party well in 2010 will go nowhere until well after the covid 19 recession is over third a republican senate majority will not be the rock solid monolith that many commentators suggest while the republicans will certainly unite to stop biden from significantly raising taxes mcconnell will find it difficult to maintain 100 per cent unanimity against a biden fiscal stimulus plan especially if the stimulus is delivered mainly through tax cuts for the middle class a one or two seat senate majority will also be insufficient to block expansionary public spending especially if the biden administration is clever about directing government investment at local projects in key senators states in this respect the washington tradition of influencing congressional votes with carefully targeted pork barrel spending will benefit from biden s 36 year record in the senate biden starts with washington experience and personal relationships unmatched by any president since lyndon johnson the horse trading that lies ahead could prove particularly effective in breaking republican unity because six of the 20 current gop senators who will face voters in the 2022 election happen to represent swing states florida georgia north carolina ohio pennsylvania and wisconsin it is far from obvious that senators who are running for re election in states that have just voted for biden or have come close to doing so will vote blindly against popular policies such as middle class tax cuts or government spending in their own states merely for the sake of party unity and sabotaging biden to make matters worse for the republican leadership at least three senators who do not face reelection mitt romney barbara murkowski and susan collins are longstanding moderates with a record of compromise and crossing party lines since mcconnell is aware of these challenges to party unity he is likely to behave less obstructively at least until the 2022 election than he has in the past fourth a gop senate majority may not even exist to keep control republicans must win at least one of the two senate seats to be contested in georgia on january 5 now that georgian voters have backed biden albeit by a razor thin margin it is doubtful they will reverse this decision in two months conventional wisdom assumes that democrats will be less motivated to vote again because winning the white house will lull them into complacency while republicans will be desperate to check the new president but the opposite is just as likely democratic voters may be energised to an even bigger turnout by their unexpected victory while republicans may be so disillusioned that they stay at home a lower republican turnout is even more likely because trump will no longer be on the ballot and many of his fervent supporters may be less interested in voting for more conventional politicians finally a new kind of trump disruption may soon hit us politics starting with the senate election in georgia trump plans to spend the next two months pursuing lawsuits which few republican politicians will over time support responding to this perceived betrayal trump could turn his fury as much against gop treason as against democrat cheating this means that trump will be unlikely to campaign for the republican senate candidates in georgia and without the galvanizing effect of trump s rallies his hard core base may not vote in short trump s refusal to accept defeat will make it harder for republicans to keep senate control in the longer term trump s constitutional defiance could permanently split the american right between trump s army of zealots and republican politicians who still believe in an orderly transfer of power with trump railing against the stab in the back from gop politicians who refuse to support his baseless fraud allegations and possibly raging from the sidelines for years to come the monolithic conservative unity that has paralysed us politics throughout this century may start to crumble

menafn jordan times london do you believe in fairy tales if so you could probably earn good money nowadays as a financial trader or gain power and prestige as a central banker while annual inflation in the united states the eurozone and the united kingdom has soared to 40 year highs and will probably hit double digits after the summer financial markets and central banks seem confident that the war against surging prices will be over by christmas and that interest rates will start falling by next spring if this happens the world economy will soon return to the financially perfect conditions of the goldilocks fairy tale that has entranced investors for the past decade neither too hot nor too cold and always just right for profits investors optimism can be seen in the trillions of dollars staked recently on three closely related market bets money markets are now predicting that us interest rates will peak at below 3 5 per cent in january 2023 and then decline starting from next april to around 2 5 per cent in early 2024 bond markets are priced for us inflation to collapse from 9 1 per cent today to just 2 8 per cent in december 2023 and equity markets assume that the economic slowdown that causes this unprecedented disinflation will be mild enough for us corporate profits to increase by 9 per cent in 2023 from this year s record levels central bankers are more nervous than investors but they are reassured by their economic models which are still based on updated versions of the rational expectations hypothesis that failed so miserably in the 2008 global financial crisis these models assume that expectations of low inflation are the key to maintaining price stability central bankers therefore see well anchored inflation expectations as evidence that their policies are working when central bankers and markets follow each other both are likely to be led astray but this only partly explains financial markets willingness to bet against warnings by eminent commentators such as larry summers mohamed el erian jim o neill and nouriel roubini of a return to 1970s style stagflation i have just spent three months traveling around the world to discuss with hundreds of professional investors why i also have shifted to an unequivocally bearish outlook after a decade of panglossian optimism about financial markets prospects these discussions have convinced me that today s investor confidence rests on four fallacies or at least cognitive biases the first cognitive bias is to downplay and defy geopolitics a view summed up by nathan rothschild s legendary instruction in the napoleonic wars to buy on the sound of cannons professional investors take pride in trading against panicky retail investors who sell their assets because of wars this contrarian approach has often proved right though with one glaring exception the october 1973 war between israel and a coalition of arab states led by egypt and syria permanently transformed the world economy in ways that ruined a generation of overconfident investors they downplayed events that are eerily reminiscent of today an energy shock a surge in inflation after a long period of monetary and fiscal expansion and bewilderment among policymakers who simultaneously faced high inflation and rising unemployment squeezing russia one of the world s largest producers of energy and many other commodities out of global markets has triggered a supply shock that is at least as serious as the 1973 74 arab oil embargo and will last for years restoring price stability will therefore now require a long term demand constraint tough enough to match the commodity supply reduction that implies an increase in us interest rates to 5 per cent 6 per cent or 7 per cent instead of the 3 4 per cent peak that investors and central banks now assume yet investors pavlovian reflex is to downplay this geopolitical upheaval and focus instead on small adjustments in us monetary policy this stance reflects a second cognitive bias summarized in the investment adage the trend is your friend which implies that changes in market moving economic indicators such as inflation unemployment or interest rates are more important than their levels many investors accordingly believe that monetary conditions have become very tight because central banks have raised interest rates in increments of 0 75 percentage points instead of the usual 0 25 percentage points despite the fact that rates are still much lower than in any previous tightening cycle similarly investors seem unperturbed by inflation rising above 9 per cent because they expect it to fall to only 7 per cent by december but businesses and workers in the real economy will still see prices rising at their fastest rate in decades which is bound to drive corporate pricing strategies and pay negotiations for 2023 such a conclusion seems obvious except to financial traders subject to a third cognitive bias don t fight the fed this favorite market saying asserts that once the us central bank gets serious about achieving an objective such as an inflation target investors should always assume that it will get its way this makes sense when the fed is genuinely prepared to do whatever it takes to meet its goals for example by clearly pursuing low inflation regardless of the effect on unemployment stock markets and debt servicing costs but today s fed is so focused on well anchored inflation expectations that it is quite relaxed about backward looking data that continue to show prices rising much faster than most businesses and workers have ever seen that leads to a final bias most people find it difficult to imagine events that have never happened in their lifetimes for many investors and policymakers stubbornly high inflation falls into this category market wisdom expresses this bias with the adage that there are no new eras but new eras do happen as the world learned painfully in 1973 and today s interaction of russia and covid 19 with monetary and fiscal expansion has created unprecedented conditions which guarantee that the period ahead will be very different from the past 40 years the question is whether the new era now dawning will be dominated for the first time in a generation by persistently rapid price growth or whether for the first time in history we will painlessly overcome an inflationary crisis with negative real interest rates and without the collateral damage of a major recession markets and central banks confidently expect a new carefree epoch if they are right we can all live happily ever

menafn jordan times london wars end when the belligerents give up fighting the surest way for this to happen and sometimes the least destructive is through a decisive battle that leads to unconditional surrender boris johnson s overwhelming victory in the united kingdom s general election this month was such a battle with the opposition parties completely routed johnson now enjoys the unlimited power bestowed on british prime ministers with large majorities britain s unwritten constitution dispenses with the checks and balances in other national constitutions allowing an absolute sovereignty to the majority in parliament often described as elective dictatorship johnson s reputation for recklessness makes this a frightening prospect but history suggests that elective dictatorship has one important redeeming feature the concentration of power means concentration of responsibility with parliamentary opposition now irrelevant johnson will have to confront a more powerful opponent economic and social reality johnson will now have to reconcile his many contradictory promises and inconsistent policies and he will be personally blamed if he cannot make two plus two equal five with brexit now set to take effect on january 31 2020 the most important challenge johnson faces is negotiating the uk s new relationship with the european union the outcome will determine whether johnson succeeds or fails as prime minister and the process got off to a bad start three days after the election when he vowed to enact a law ruling out any extension of the post brexit transition period beyond december 2020 this would require completing the negotiations within a totally impracticable 12 month deadline johnson s announcement caused near panic in financial markets with the pound rapidly losing all its gains from johnson s election this reaction was understandable since johnson s unrealistic deadline will prolong the debilitating uncertainty that has blighted britain s economy this year but what if johnson s rigid 12 month deadline is just a bluff johnson s career has never suffered from broken promises and his parliamentary majority means that he can repeal his negotiating deadline as easily as he enshrines it in law the key question therefore is not how johnson says he will conduct the eu negotiations it is what negotiating tactics will be in johnson s interests to employ he has strong incentives to make the negotiations with europe as non controversial as possible if he wants to achieve his economic political regional and national goals first comes economics johnson s government programme depends entirely on a strong recovery in business investment and consumer confidence to provide the additional tax revenues he will need to finance his promises of higher public spending to convert his electioneering success into policymaking credibility johnson needs to prove that his fantastic brexit deal really was in britain s economic interests and to do that he must avoid any abrupt rupture in uk eu economic relations any revival of last summer s panic about a breakdown in eu negotiations would prolong this year s investment slump and might confront johnson with the threat of a financial crisis before he can deliver any policy successes one possible rationale behind johnson s 12 month deadline may be to encourage a step by step approach non contentious issues such as tariff free trade in manufactures would be agreed first allowing more difficult negotiations on financial services agriculture and fishing to be deferred to 2021 and beyond there is also a political imperative for avoiding confrontational eu negotiations johnson won the election with the slogan get brexit done to most voters this meant that johnson and other politicians would stop talking about europe and concentrate instead on everyday domestic issues such as health crime and transport a year of headlines and parliamentary debates dominated by eu negotiations would be a political disaster for johnson this is another reason why he may want to settle easy issues such as tariffs within his 12 month deadline while trying to delay politically controversial decisions on service industries regulation and immigration then there is regional politics johnson s landslide victory was due mainly to former labour voters in manufacturing regions whose factories are highly dependent on trade with europe to jeopardise these regional economies by risking a breakdown in eu trade relations would be politically suicidal on the other hand britain s manufacturing regions would welcome the high standards of social and employment protection demanded by the eu as a condition for frictionless trade finally and perhaps most important for johnson s place in history is the uk s survival as a unitary state this month s electoral landslide for johnson s conservative party was matched by equally impressive victories in scotland for the scottish national party and the weakening of pro british unionist parties in northern ireland if the uk continues to experience weak economic performance next year or faces any kind of financial crisis that could plausibly be blamed on brexit the next scottish parliamentary election due in may 2021 will probably produce an overwhelming mandate for the separatists a referendum on scottish independence might then be impossible for johnson to resist because british public opinion is quite sympathetic to scottish separatism and would certainly not tolerate a catalonia style confrontation to protect himself from a rise of scottish separatism which would certainly be echoed in northern ireland johnson needs to avoid any possibility of a brexit related economic setback or financial crisis the best way to do this will be to keep the negotiations on britain s long term relationship with europe out of the headlines by making them as tedious and non controversial as possible and to delay the most

one of the most visited residential houses in south africa is located on 8115 vilakazi street soweto in the gauteng region of that country it was the residence of famed south africa s anti apartheid hero and former president nelson rolihlahla mandela at an interactive session with journalists not long ago the state s commissioner for housing moruf akinderu fatai claimed that those that stay back neither have beforehand arrangements of what to do in the city nor where to live akinde fatai added that lagos prosperity had become its major challenge as people come from all over the world to tap from the opportunities it offers lagos state is the smallest state in the country but with a very high urban population in 2017 governor akinwunmi ambode while speaking at a round table on infrastructure financing organised by the harvard business school association of nigeria hbsan in collaboration with the state government confirmed that the population of the state had swelled above 24 million ambode who added that the population of the state was equal to that of 30 african countries combined explained that by 2050 the state would be a city of 36 million people or the sixth largest city in the world after mumbai delhi dhaka kinshasa and kolkata and ahead of tokyo karachi new york and mexico city we have a migration rate of 86 people moving into lagos every hour higher than new york london or mumbai we have a population density of 6 939 persons per kilometre and an average of five persons per household the former governor said adding that lagos state requires one million housing units every year for 5 to 10 years to fix the housing deficit be that as it may with each household size pegged at 4 9 people and a housing stock of 1 49 million units a silhouette of the true picture of the state s housing deficit is massive in its 2019 36 shades of nigeria report renaissance capital equally agreed that 4 9 people on average reside in each lagos household deductively the state needs at least 4 69 million residential units to cater to its ever expanding population the governor maintained that turning around the state s housing deficit en route to attaining 21st century economy required exploring innovations and partnerships with private investors this submission however runs contrary to how the state government has treated subscribers to some of the numerous residential housing schemes which previous administrations initiated mounting discontent over government initiated residential housing schemes while the state government has partnered with some real estate developers to deliver on major and mini housing schemes in some neighborhoods across the state including those that raise the state s housing stock it has also been very unfair to subscribers of residential schemes which it initiated in the last two decades or thereabouts orisan oko orisan water front residential scheme in lekki ajah ogudu garden valley residential scheme igbogbo residential scheme in ikorodu fortune gardens at alapere and the paradise city residential scheme in gbagada are some of the schemes which the state government appears to have treated subscribers unfairly and with contempt in some if not all of these schemes the government collected monies from subscribers as payment for the plots of land and issued them with a certificate of occupancy cofo it also collected money to develop infrastructure on them before the subscribers take possession of the plots allotted this infrastructure included road and drainage networks among others but over 10 years after all these transpired most of these subscribers have neither taken possession nor been reimbursed even as some of the beneficiaries have passed on fortune garden residential schemes allottees move to salvage their fortunes like ogudu garden valley residential scheme allottees of fortune garden residential housing scheme alapere ketu paid for their allotted plots of land and were issued with c of o but are still being denied access to their plots 12 years on also the over 130 allottees paid millions of naira for the development of road and drainage networks on the large expanse of land now in the 12th year none of these infrastructures has been provided we shall be delighted to receive from you the latest developments on this issue the letter signed by falore and olasoko read residential schemes subscribers would soon possess their plots govt when contacted on the delay in handing over the slots to the beneficiaries and the general state of things on the numerous government residential housing schemes the director of public affairs ministry of housing mrs adeola salako simply retorted please reach out to the lands bureau the guardian last friday at 3 34pm also contacted the ntda which the lands bureau said it was liaising with to create alternative access to the facility after being informed that the views of the general manager of the agency o j aboyeji were being sought regarding the agency s failure to execute the assignment to date the lady that picked up the call via phone number 08026269223 asked the guardian to call back in minutes to be connected to the boss all attempts to get through afterwards came to nought as the operator kept saying that the mobile number was unavailable at the lands bureau ajetunmobi the executive secretary assured us that soon all allottees would take delivery of their plots we are working towards ensuring that every allottee takes possession of plots that belong to them unfortunately i cannot tell you exactly what we are doing asked to put a time frame for when the plots would be delivered she responded i ve told you the much that i can tell you but i can assure you that very soon everyone would take possession of their plots also commenting the commissioner for information gbenga omotoso said he had nothing to say other than what the head of the lands bureau has said regarding the residential schemes what you are saying happened before we came on board there is nobody that the babajide sanwo olu led government has sold land to that has not taken possession of the land

various microorganisms it is also involved in the removal of the body s own damaged and altered cells activation of the complement system is a very precise process and it is strictly controlled by regulatory proteins present in both plasma and at host cells surfaces the excessive activation of complement proteins is often discovered to be the reason for many diseases these include e g

washington august 28 ani the us defense department has started sending the shipment of weapons to ukraine by sea according to the washington post citing us defense officials ships are able to transport large quantities of cargo despite being slower than aircraft which could allow kyiv to build up a bigger weapons arsenal the newspaper said on saturday local time the pentagon started sending weapons to ukraine by sea a few weeks after russia started its special military operation at the end of february but maritime shipping has been broadened significantly this spring us defense officials told the washington post once we started to provide them howitzers we knew that we were going to need more ammunition said army col steven putthoff the deputy director of operations at us transportation command so we could plan ahead a little bit more and then we could start to use more sealift to provide that support and to get it there sometimes even ahead of the request he said as quoted by the washington post the us defence department had earlier announced that it would provide a new usd 775 million in additional military assistance to ukraine including himars missiles artillery and mine clearing systems earlier this week the united states announced a new usd 2 98 billion package of military aid for ukraine which includes six additional national advanced surface to air missile systems nasams from the ukraine security assistance initiative usai which finances the us defense industry to boost production of certain weapons most of the previous security packages for ukraine were presidential drawdown packages that sent weapons and equipment from the us national defense stockpile however the united states does not have nasams in stock that are immediately available for ukraine under secretary of defense for policy colin kahl said deliveries of military equipment in the usd 2 98 billion package will begin in the next several months and continue into the coming years since 1993 the us has invested over usd 4 2 billion for the safe clearance of landmines and explosive weapons of war erw as well as the securing and safe disposal of excess small arms and light weapons sa lw and munitions in more than 100 countries and territories the us is the world s single largest financial supporter of conventional weapons destruction the statement reads in total the united states has now committed approximately usd 9 8 billion in security assistance to ukraine since the beginning of the biden administration since 2014 the united states has committed more than usd 11 8 billion in security assistance to ukraine ani
the past few months have seen a growing backlash against environmental social and corporate governance esg this is driven by concerns about greenwashing confusion about metrics and performance and even pushback on the grounds that responsible or sustainable investment is woke and a politicisation of market forces concern that asset managers are promoting funds as esg without commitment analysis has led to accusations that investors are being misled the offices of deutsche bank and dws were raided as part of an investigation into whether the group was consistent and credible in its esg and green claims goldman sachs is reportedly under investigation by the us securities and exchange commission sec over its esg funds and in may 2022 bny mellon investment advisers paid a penalty over sec concerns about claims that its investments had all been done under an esg review without that in fact being the case esg market inflows falter for the first time in six years investment flows have shifted too according to bloomberg may 2022 saw outflows from esg funds for the first time in nearly six years investors have put 300 billion 254bn into esg funds in the past three years and the annual trend has been consistently upwards 30bn 25 4bn in 2019 94bn 79 5bn in 2020 and 159bn 134 6bn in 2021 may reportedly saw inflows of 400 million 338 5m against a 2021 average of 11bn 9 3bn a serious shift in direction performance in terms of equity funds specifically was even worse with a loss of 200m 169 2m given the intensification of interest in esg over the past two years combined with the fact drivers behind that focus only continue to grow why the backlash overall it appears to be a response to a basic misunderstanding of esg itself what it is and what it was intended to do this was highlighted by the controversy surrounding the removal of tesla from the s p500 esg index for many the question was how could tesla whose product is leading the net zero transition be booted out of the index while fossil fuel giant exxon remained a leading constituent the answer is that most people don t understand what esg ratings and indices are for esg doesn t tell us how sustainable a business is many observers believe an esg rating is an indicator of how sustainable a business is or that a positive rating is equivalent to showing a company is having a positive impact on the world either through its operations or products what an esg rating reflects however are the risks likely to affect the financial operation of a business in the environmental social or governance sphere esg is an investment lens not a cure all for sustainability issues but appears to have become a catch all replacement term for sustainable responsible or green investment it s not like this has been hidden msci one of the world s largest esg ratings agencies and provider of around one third of the world s esg ratings data says esg is not about what the company does to the world but what the world does to the company and its shareholders this is the conventional definition of esg referring to financially material risks to the business and the battle over whether this is sufficient lies at the heart of the different approaches taken by those responsible for setting international accounting standards failure to incorporate impact results in lower perception of risk the difference between inward looking and externally facing analysis is what has led the financial sector to underplay not only climate risk but also the growing risks of social upheaval inequality pollution environmental degradation biodiversity loss resource scarcity and much more not only that but the variability between ratings providers on the metrics assessed or the analysis made are incredibly inconsistent it can come as a shock to find the world s largest 20 esg funds hold an average of 17 fossil fuel stocks in their portfolio mix there is no doubt the lack of a standardised approach to esg scoring means ratings are dependent on the underlying methodologies and assumptions and that s why ratings can differ dramatically it also explains why companies can be high performers in terms of an esg rating yet still have an overall negative impact on the environment society and the economy over the longer term arguments over the esg scores of fossil fuel giants versus tesla are a prime example are you scoring overall impact performance on gender balance human rights equal pay resource use different assumptions and approaches mean different answers so esg tools and data often lack the rigour and transparency that asset managers need for effective portfolio strategy and risk management this creates confusion over how esg can be measured and which results can be considered accurate lack of standardisation makes esg ratings less robust than credit ratings an issue that still needs to be resolved is that many regard esg ratings like credit ratings and they are not the same many users of esg ratings treat them as if there is an agreed framework for esg some approaches are overweight on governance others on environment many technology stocks are prominent in esg ratings scores and current market volatility in such stocks is wreaking havoc in esg funds that may perform better if focused on resilience and new market opportunities it s also important to remember esg is not climate it is not green and it is not about sustainability whatever your assumptions might have been avoiding emissions might be a key first step and compliant with regulator goals on climate risk reporting but it doesn t address systemic environmental and social risks from pollution to healthcare and education esg does not tell you anything about corporate or investor impact and it doesn t consider the role new products may have to play in the coming global economic transition but just because different ratings tell investors different things that doesn t make it pointless what it means is we need to develop a greater understanding of what is material where and to whom and to pay attention to the underlying approach analysis takes esg analysis should only be a starting point for risk assessment nikita singhal co head of sustainable investment and esg at lazard asset management warns that materiality is highly contextual and what is material to one company may differ greatly from another based on sector region etc she says ratings are simply a starting point and how they are used will be in large part due to the investment approach used differentiating between governance and social problems and the impact of a product is an important debate to have and it s one that needs to come front and centre of the esg backlash and resulting discussion that means the current backlash is part of the growing pains of an evolving realisation of how we need to rethink economic behaviour if we are to build a sustainable future esg backlash intensified after tesla removal elon musk famously called esg a scam when tesla was removed from the s p500 esg index it s not so much a scam but rather something tesla s chief executive has clearly failed to understand tesla s rating fell due a combination of energy profile performance in terms of business practice and labour standards as well as a growing swathe of claims around working practices labour discrimination and more the company s impact report complained that esg reporting focused solely on the financial value of risk and return and not impact but that is exactly what it was designed to do identifying financially material risks to operations these can differ depending on time horizons effective accounting for different types of value accounting for impact or a range of diverse reasons esg is a tool like any other and if you don t like the ways it is being used then instead of attacking a growing attempt to refocus capital expenditure join forces with the eu central bank regulators concerned about systemic climate risk the impact investment community and activists around the world and help it grow and evolve this article comes from sg voice where purpose meets progress visit sgvoice energyvoice

friday at jackson hole wyoming federal reserve chairperson jerome powell said the fed must continue to raise interest rates even though it will bring some pain to households and businesses this with all due respect is nuts true inflation is near a four decade high but the fed s aggressive effort to tame it through steep interest rate hikes the fastest series of rate hikes since the early 1980s raises the risk of recession powell s remarks signal that the fed will probably increase rates again in september by another three quarter of a percent raising the risk still further the pain is already being felt across the land wage gains haven t kept up with inflation this means most americans continue to lose economic ground powell is in effect telling them they ll lose even more ground higher interest rates he admits will slow economic growth and result in softer labor market conditions a euphemism for lower wage increases and fewer jobs but these are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation meanwhile though corporate profits continue to soar profit margins are at their highest since 1950 according to commerce department figures published thursday stop for a moment and let your mind dwell on this the prices businesses are charging their customers are outpacing whatever increased costs businesses are facing for materials and labor in other words wages aren t pushing up inflation the costs of production aren t pushing up inflation corporations are pushing up inflation the biggest single unique source of inflation in the united states is the pricing power of corporations so why is the fed raising interest rates because that s what the fed does when prices are rising that s the only tool in the fed s toolkit to quote the old saying when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail or in this case an interest rate to hike the problem this mostly burdens working people and the low income with fighting inflation they re the first to lose pay and jobs as the economy slows they re already getting hammered if the fed continues to raise rates to slow inflation they ll get hammered even more this might be justifiable if corporations were investing their windfall profits in more productive capacity adding factories materials warehouses and jobs which would expand their ability to meet future demand and thereby better guarding against inflation but they aren t they re using their profits to buy back their shares of stock so that their share values won t sag too much further after already sagging due to the anticipated fed induced slowdown at the beginning of the year goldman sachs estimated that 2022 would see a record breaking 1tn in buybacks that s unlikely to happen but buybacks are continuing at a strong pace in the second quarter buybacks were up by about 7 over the year before some economists argue that there s no reason to think corporations would now exert more pricing power than they ve had all along why would they wait for the costs of materials and labor to rise before increasing their profit margins the answer is simple inflation gives them cover they can say as many now do that they have no choice but to raise prices in light of the rising costs of materials and labor they re just not advertising the fact that their profits are rising as they do so which brings us to the central policy question why can t the burden of fighting inflation be placed where it belongs on big corporations continuing to raise their prices in pursuit of larger profit margins and higher share prices the simple answer is big corporations have so much political clout that they d never allow the sorts of policies that would have that effect say a windfall profits tax price controls higher taxes on themselves and the wealthy and bolder and more effective antitrust enforcement although the democrats did pass a 1 percent tax on stock buybacks in the recently enacted inflation reduction act they weren t able to take these other steps not even a democratic president and democrats in control of both houses of congress could overcome vested corporate interests so it s all on jerome powell and the fed which means it s all on working people
farmers are being urged to put measures in place to prevent major loss in an already stressful economic situation in the event of major tropical storms or hurricanes last week meteorologists highlighted two areas of disturbed weather for the possibility of such and jamaicans were warned to stay alert with 250 million in relief support issued by the ministry of agriculture and fisheries to farmers who were affected by tropical storms grace and ida in october 2021 ainsworth riley the inter american institute for co operation on agriculture iica agribusiness specialist in jamaica said farmers should take as much precaution as possible properly store away farm records such as herd records receipts land titles sales agreement etcetera the process for replacing land titles can be costly and lengthy especially if you are in custody of a title that does not have your name on it i have personal experience with going through the land administrative process it can be expensive because you require the services of a lawyer to facilitate the process he advised in an interview with the jamaica observer last wednesday in the case of the farmer the government of jamaica s land administration and management programme lamp with the national land agency nla can sometimes assist but you still need the support of a lawyer riley said sale agreements are sometimes used as security for financing the farm operation for example to get a loan this is called factoring usually the financing entity is paid by the buyer of the produce based on the agreed payment terms an amount is retained and the remainder is remitted to the farmer additionally if the farmer is a taxpayer he or she would need to have these records for completing tax returns riley further cautioned farmers and fisherfolk to act on other hurricane tips and not wait until situations escalate remove cladding from greenhouses and use to cover crops after laterally placing them on the ground if possible stock on seeds seedlings and other inputs for quick recovery fisherfolk should remove their fish pots and take to shore fishing boats should be taken further from shore and properly secured all farmers and fisher folk should listen to the bulletins from the met office ensure that there is access to battery operated radio and secure life and property as best as possible he advised the rural agricultural development agency rada revealed that as a result of heavy rains from january 31 to february 1 this year alone damage to livestock and crops in the parishes of st mary and portland amounted to approximately 76 8 million leaving more than 551 farmers affected back in 2021 following tropical storms grace and ida agriculture minister audley shaw said the heaviest loss was experienced in the poultry sector at an estimated value of 12 million shaw said that 100 million was for support for crop and livestock farmers â 28 million was made available through the members of parliament and the remaining 71 million would be disbursed under the recovery programmes being executed by rada in october 2020 then agriculture minister floyd green said based on estimates from rada there was an excess of a 1 5 billion economic loss across the agricultural sector impacting over 11 000 farmers as a result of tropical storm zeta green noted that the entire southern belt had taken the brunt of the damage including st elizabeth manchester clarendon parts of st catherine st thomas and westmoreland the ministry said farmers and agriculturists must be re educated on the dangers of climate change as jamaica had suffered approximately 30 billion in crop losses due to irregular weather patterns between 2004 and 2019 wordsworth gordon chairman of the st mary based jeffrey town farmers association told the sunday observer that farmers usually get early hurricane warnings and prepare adequately especially those with livestock but the thing i dread the most is not the wind so much it is the rain there is a lot of water and wind and rain together is very destructive for example trees fall down and things like that but more trees will fall because the ground is saturated and they topple over quicker you can t really guard against those sort of things happening other than cutting back the trees if they are close to your home he said gordon said another concern especially in his area is that many people are planting cash crops i m worried about them because they are not using the necessary land husbandry procedures to protect their crops against heavy rain for example i notice they are ploughing the land and the roads are downhill and things like that and they don t have drains and holding trenches to hold the water so what happens when it rains it just washes everything away and top soil is gone and you lose your crops he explained gordon added that one can get away with that type of practice under normal rainfall but not developed weather systems but it doesn t have to be a hurricane or anything like that especially now you don t know when you re going to get a shower of rain where you will get 12 inches of rain in the space of 20 hours that happens and those are the kinds of disasters i am concerned about we think climate change is something in the air and not something real and i can see a lot of damage being done to agriculture in our community and elsewhere he lamented citrena atkins co founder of gerty s agro produce in new hall district in manchester said she hasn t started making any preparations for the atlantic hurricane season i ve been so distracted by the recent drought that i m just elated to get rain however i need to exercise prudence going forward and put the necessary measures in place to mitigate against any possible damage i ll ensure that my water tanks are secured and nearby trees are pruned i m involved in outfield farming so i m limited in what i can do to protect my scotch bonnet peppers from excessive rainfall atkins told the sunday observer noting however that she has some concerns i m concerned about the negative impact the season might have on the country s food security it s very challenging when a farmer s livelihood is interrupted the impact is multiplied across many sectors we ve put in so much work in the past few months to establish our fields and struggled through the drought so we re expecting a return on my investment goat farmer lafranze gayle said in order to minimise the colossal damage he will be cleaning drains and securing all objects that can damage crops also when planting on a slope i implement terrace farming to mitigate soil erosion by preventing or minimising rain washing away the soil i am also sceptic on the types of crops that are planted as not all crops will be able to sustain such weather as a farmer my biggest concern is if a hurricane or tropical depression hit the island the damage that can be caused by it he said anthony cole who operates cole s fresh produce in kingston said his preparation involves the digging of trenches to prevent the various crops from being water soaked crops that have reached maturity stage will be reaped other crops will be secured by the trimming of branches and the removal of some leaves my concerns are more centred on the cost of fertiliser and constant irrigation for some crops that rely heavily on water riley also suggested that farmers should harvest crops that are in the field and are at the stage of maturity and secure livestock by taking them to a secured sheltered area while gordon agreed he argued that farmers can only do so if space is available no storage facility is the biggest drawback we have people can do that if they have place to store it but there is no storage facility so you leave the crop and in other words you re just in time reaping you are reaping to take it to market and that is a major concern we have the management of agriculture has gone rapidly downhill to be honest rada is doing their best but they have basket to carry water some regional farmers have similar concerns barbadian farmer devane toppin recently added onions to his string of crops right now we are coming off of this drought where we were getting two hours of water a day so currently i haven t really gotten anything planned because the economy here is very down right now nothing was really selling so i wasn t really fussing he said in a dejected tone barbados ministry of agriculture and food security said the farmers challenges were two fold excess water from run off during heavy rainfall and a lack of water during the dry season keeta bowens a st vincent farmer told the sunday observer that she is putting plans in place to prevent major loss i make drains about my crops so that water won t run down in the crops also i will store a lot of water and feeds for the goats and pigs i also try to harvest watermelons and tomatoes before the season starts because they tend to burst from the rain she said my biggest concern is losing my animals after a storm because they tend to stray since they are not in a barn i have two pigs and six goats i lost everything during the volcano eruption in april 2021 minister of agriculture of st vincent and the grenadines saboto caesar said the local agricultural losses amounted to more than ec 150 million following a series of volcanic eruptions the same month that left the country in a state of emergency affecting the availability and affordability of food bajan farmer devane toppin said he uses chemicals to prevent crop

bloomberg the energy crisis that s sent inflation soaring across the world is getting worse each week leaving stock traders with a challenge to figure out where to put their money the nightmare scenario that s developed this year has already walloped equities which suffered a bruising first half a rally over the summer helped to reduce losses but the worsening crisis which appears nowhere near over is putting up a huge hurdle to further gains the surge in power prices along with threats to supply is affecting businesses from china to germany to the us it jacks up costs and threatens margins while also sucking money out of their customers pockets destroying demand and from industrial gas guzzlers to retailers who rely on consumers with money to spend the damage is proving widespread germany s heavy reliance on russian fuels has left its corporate heavyweights particularly vulnerable a citigroup inc basket of stocks sensitive to a gas shock that includes covestro ag

slumped about 35 so far this year the energy crisis brings a huge amount of unknowns and concerns in the market said clive burstow barings london based head of global resources high prices are driving inflation and pushing industrial capacity offline which is worsening an already constrained supply chain the inflation surge has also prompted an aggressive response from the world s major central banks which have been jacking up interest rates to get the situation under control federal reserve chair jerome powell signaled on friday that the us central bank will keep tightening policy and pushed back against the idea it would reverse course soon some european central bank officials want to discuss a hike of 75 basis points in september consumers are faced with higher prices for frankly everything said ben powell an investment strategist at the blackrock investment institute earnings look at little bit wobbly over the next several quarters he said investor worries were on show in the

vast amounts of electricity to make ever smaller semiconductors the damage is already ripping through industrial and chemical firms yara international asa and grupa azoty sa have slashed output and

law association reports skippy to police the law association has asked the police to look into the academic qualifications which junior barrington skippy thomas submitted to be admitted to practise as a lawyer the law association of trinidad and tobago latt has filed a criminal complaint against opposition activist and radio talk show host junior barrington skippy thomas it is calling on the police to investigate what it says are bogus academic qualifications which thomas submitted to be admitted to practise as a lawyer the complaint dated august 19 a copy of which has been obtained by sunday newsday was delivered to acting commissioner of police mcdonald jacob and sets out a series of events between april 13 and may 19 detailing latt s attempts to verify a diploma thomas submitted from a purported uk university on april 13 thomas 47 applied for a certificate of fitness from latt which is needed for admission to the roll of attorneys duly qualified to practise law in tt as part of that process for people who obtain law degrees in the uk latt must get proof that the applicant has passed the legal practice course at an institution validated by the law society of england and wales according to the complaint thomas submitted a postgraduate diploma in professional legal practice from colston university dated june 16 2016 questions were raised during the verification process and latt sought a legal opinion on the matter then on may 13 latt was notified by e mail by an assistant registrar of the supreme court that thomas was seeking to be admitted to practise law in tt via a petition to the high court without a certificate of fitness and the matter had been listed to be heard that same day before justice joseph tam and sharon gibson latt president sophia chote sc and kavita roop boodoo a legal officer of the association attended that hearing and the matter was adjourned to allow the association to complete its investigation into thomas s qualifications during the investigatory process to verify the authenticity of the diploma from colston university the association made enquiries of the solicitors regulation authority in the uk which provides a listing of all institutions authorised to provide legal practice certificates according to the complaint the latt caused an examination of its own records to determine if any previous applicant had submitted a legal practicing certificate issued by colston university but found none further enquiries were then made to the department of education in the united kingdom the office of students and a degree verification website service prospect hedd but the latt was still unable to verify that colston university was a duly registered institution or that it was authorised to issue the legal practice certificate according to the complaint on may 19 the association contacted the president of the law society of england and wales and received a response on may 27 from richard jones the engagement manager wales of the law society which supported its position latt said the colston university twitter page colstonuniversity1 appears on the face of it to be a made up institution and photographs used on the twitter page are stock photographs the twitter account refers to coronavirus information issued by the welsh government while colston university purports to be based in london jones said in his opinion having been a qualified document examiner with the uk home office that the certificates that was provided by the latt albeit a low resolution black and white scan does appear to be a counterfeit a google search for colston university is directed to a twitter account opened in february 2021 with an image of two buildings and a coat of arms dated 1998 it states welcome to colston university official twitter profile follow to keep up to date with what s new with us a google search on the london address on the twitter account 182 184 high street london appears to be a service address and not a university campus colston university joined in february 2021 with just 221 followers the last tweet was dated april 13 2021 on its facebook page colston university on may 7 2021 says do you want to obtain university degree from uk by clicking on the url a message says the domain may be for sale a post pinned to the link states buy university degree with an accompanying website buybritishdegree com but after clicking the link a message states this page doesn t seem to exist the social media site describes colston university as a world leader in modern distance learning edu in a march 6 2021 post the university makes reference to spring semester unlike term as other uk universities use there are no earlier posts than march 6 2021 sunday newsday learned that in light of the findings latt submitted an affidavit detailing its efforts to verify the authenticity of thomas s diploma in response to the petition he filed seeking admission to practise in tt the court subsequently dismissed the application even though thomas s lawyer tried to withdraw the matter latt through its secretary bijili lalla called on the acting cop to investigate to determine whether any criminal charges arose and submitted all the supporting documents it had gathered during its own probe contacted for comment via his mobile phone on august 25 thomas said this is the first time i am hearing about those issues and until i am properly advised on those issues i have no deficit of lawyers and we will respond appropriately and if anything is written that is not substantiated properly or is libellous of course the courthouse is there to deal with those issues asked if he had applied for a certificate of fitness thomas said he had already given his comments on the matter and repeated his previous comment he said when he is informed about it officially not by a journalist he will treat with it at that time he later said the allegations were baseless and the questions posed to him were laced with misinformation thomas said latt was inviting me back into the arena after taking a conscious decision to stay away and remain quiet after i speak to the police if they come to me the police will be a very busy organisation concerning the law association he claimed the association never told me what the issues were this is the first time i am hearing it from a reporter he who alleges must prove and i am not worried the least about that and the battle will only last until the last man is standing thomas said he had filed a complaint on june 8 as a civic minded citizen and not on behalf of the unc or its political leader seeking an investigation into attorney general reginald armour sc over his role in a us multi million dollar civil forfeiture lawsuit against people charged in the piarco airport corruption case in may a us judge in a miami court disqualified armour and the us law firm hired to represent tt in the case because of armour s previous role as a defence lawyer for former government minister brian kuei tung one of those accused in the miami case jacob on august 26 said he had received the complaint from latt and that it had been forwarded to acting deputy commissioner wendell williams for action
the residential real estate market shows no signs of cooling in northwest arkansas where prices in the second quarter rose faster than anywhere else in the country according to industry figures but the market is changing buyers want smaller spaces little lawns and location location location near city centers and trails they want to bike to work and walk to dinner real estate professionals and economists said hannah cicioni is owner and principal broker for crd real estate development in rogers her company deals mainly with commercial projects the increasingly tight housing market affects her company s commercial enterprises she said one of cicioni s commercial projects highlighted an attitude change about housing her company started the 81 project in downtown rogers to make up for the lack of a hotel there she said the development named after the founding of rogers in 1881 is putting seven housing units on 0 62 acres the size of two small house lots the units were intended for day by day rental like a hotel but with much larger rooms that aren t connected two of the units are fully accessible to the handicapped the dwellings range in size from less than 600 square feet to one of over 1 000 would be buyers seeking permanent residences contacted her as the cabin like units went up cicioni said demand was so great she will launch another project like it with units to sell she said the original project is sticking with the nightly rental plan she said the units would be buyers weren t frustrated after failing to find a conventional house cicioni said the small closely grouped buildings with little lawn to tend near a downtown were what they are looking for she said and that preference fits in with what she other builders local economists and housing experts say it s not just the latest trend its a changing of the mindset cicioni said the quest for smaller more densely set homes isn t being driven by the desire to be cheaper either she said a small space in a highly sought after location can be just as expensive or even more costly than a big lot with a big home farther from downtown the first question i m asked when someone wants to bring a business here whether its a restaurant retail or manufacturing anything is where are my workers going to live cicioni said a lot of these businesses are bringing their people with them and the first conversation they want to have is how their people are going to get to and from work those workers want to live close enough to bike or walk to work she said duke mclarty made the same point about home preferences changing in an earlier interview mclarty is executive director of the workforce housing center of the northwest arkansas council the council is a nonprofit group of community and business leaders that focus on regional issues encouraging development of places where people can afford to live is the council s top priority smaller high density housing near workplaces is not just a way of easing the housing shortage mclarty said it s what much of the market for housing demands no bubble to burst housing prices rose at a faster percentage rate in northwest arkansas than anywhere else in the united states during the second quarter of this year according to the national association of realtors quarterly report the median price for single family homes in northwest arkansas hit 350 000 rom april through june up 31 9 from where that price was at the end of the second quarter of 2021 the report said a lack of supply drives home price increases said both mclarty and mervin jebaraj director of the business and economic research center at the university of arkansas fayetteville northwest arkansas situation now bears no meaningful resemblance to the housing bubble of the early 2000s they said the last time housing prices climbed steeply the market eventually crashed in 2008 but there is no prospect of that here they said the lending environment is completely different from what it was in the years before 2008 mclarty said the housing boom collapsed nationwide in 2008 because of foreclosures on bad loans to marginal borrowers you have to be a much stronger buyer to get a loan now he said back then it was the wild west speculative homebuilding in california florida and nevada in particular crashed the housing market nationwide the federal reserve s recent increase in interest rates has yet to dampen demand mclarty said i think it s still a little too early to tell if those increases will affect rising prices but they did immediately price out people who were at the lower end of qualifying for a home loan mclarty said rising prices pushed out many of those at the lower more affordable end of the housing market before the rate increase he said our housing stock at that level was limited to begin with builders and lenders reacted much faster to the interest rate increases jebaraj said at least for now higher interest rates discourage builders more than buyers he said jebaraj agreed no signs of any sudden decrease in home prices are visible when you have a bubble homes are going unsold and apartments are not being rented he said that is not happening here the vacancy rate is functionally zero for both single and multifamily homes jebaraj said some apartment complexes have waiting lists seeking silver bullets mclarty said there s no cure all solution a variety of approaches is needed there s not a silver bullet mclarty said there s a lot of different things you can do you can allow some different types of housing in your building codes and that might shave off 5 or 10 you can add capital and that might shave off another 5 or 10 you can do things to improve the supply of labor and material and again save 5 or 10 you have to take a multifaceted approach and chip away northwest arkansas doesn t have a single authority to make changes in local regulations with two counties four major cities and a number of smaller cities this variety presents no problems so far though mclarty said at the executive and council level of local government at least there is an acknowledgement rising housing prices are a problem he said there s virtually no resistance to taking it on bentonville s set up a task force on it springdale s changed its downtown master plan the other cities are doing their part one problem should get more attention cicioni said infrastructure particularly wastewater access much of the land in the region needs access to sewer service if it is ever going to be developed she said the answer to higher housing costs in downtown areas has traditionally been to build cheaper housing farther out of town centers jebaraj said that option was becoming uneconomical even before recent spikes in gasoline prices he said now the prices for cheaper housing in areas farther afield are rising too he said figures from center for neighborhood technology in chicago agree with jebaraj the center maintains a h t affordability index the searchable database compares local housing and transportation costs with local incomes the nonprofit center defines attainable housing as combined housing and transportation costs that do not exceed 45 of a household s income 30 for housing and 15 for transportation fifty one percent of springdale residents for instance spend more than 45 of their household income on housing and transportation according to the affordability index of those 19 8 spend 54 or more average transportation costs as a portion of household income still exceeds rapidly rising housing costs in all four of the regions largest cities according to the center s figures those figures for transportation costs are 25 in bentonville 27 in rogers 25 in springdale and 24 in fayetteville combined housing and transportation costs as a percentage of income in northwest arkansas passed chicago and new york city no later than early last year center figures show housing plus transportation costs compared with income now average 46 in fayetteville 47 in springdale 53 in rogers and 52 in bentonville according to the index the tight housing situation soon will affect decisions on whether to open a new business here jebaraj predicted i think we re already close to that point he said particularly in the leisure and hospitality sectors restaurants are constantly looking for workers he said

said the last time housing prices climbed steeply the market eventually crashed in 2008 but there is no prospect of that here they said the lending environment is completely different from what it was in the years before 2008 mclarty said the housing boom collapsed nationwide in 2008 because of foreclosures on bad loans to marginal borrowers you have to be a much stronger buyer to get a loan now he said back then it was the wild west speculative home building in california florida and nevada in particular crashed the housing market nationwide the federal reserve s recent increase in interest rates has yet to dampen demand mclarty said i think it s still a little too early to tell if those increases will affect rising prices but they did immediately price out people who were at the lower end of qualifying for a home loan mclarty said rising prices pushed out many of those at the lower more affordable end of the housing market before the rate increase he said our housing stock at that level was limited to begin with builders and lenders reacted much faster to the interest rate hikes jebaraj said at least for now the interest rate increase discourages builders more than buyers he said jebaraj agreed no signs of any sudden decrease in home prices are visible when you have a bubble homes are going unsold and apartments are not being rented he said that is not happening here the vacancy rate is functionally zero for both single and multifamily homes jebaraj said some apartment complexes have waiting lists seeking silver bullets mclarty said there s no cure all solution a variety of approaches is needed there s not a silver bullet mclarty said there s a lot of different things you can do you can allow some different types of housing in your building codes and that might shave off 5 or 10 you can add capital and that might shave off another 5 or 10 you can do things to improve the supply of labor and material and again save 5 or 10 you have to take a multifaceted approach and chip away northwest arkansas doesn t have a single authority to make changes in local regulations with two counties four major cities and a number of smaller cities this variety presents no problems so far though mclarty said at the executive and council level of local government at least there is an acknowledgement rising housing prices are a problem he said there s virtually no resistance to taking it on bentonville s set up a task force on it springdale s changed its downtown master plan the other cities are doing their part one problem should get more attention cicioni said infrastructure particularly wastewater access much of the land in the region needs access to sewer service if it is ever going to be developed she said the answer to higher housing costs in downtown areas has traditionally been to build cheaper housing further out of town centers jebaraj said that option was becoming uneconomical even before recent spikes in gasoline prices he said now the prices for cheaper housing in areas further afield are rising too he said figures from center for neighborhood technology in chicago agree with jebaraj the center maintains a h t affordability index the searchable database compares local housing and transportation costs with local incomes the nonprofit center defines attainable housing as combined housing and transportation costs that do not exceed 45 of a household s income 30 for housing and 15 for transportation fifty one percent of springdale residents for instance spend more than 45 of their household income on housing and transportation according to the affordability index of those 19 8 spend 54 or more average transportation costs as a portion of household income still exceeds rapidly rising housing costs in all four of the region s largest cities according to the center s figures those figures for transportation costs are 25 in bentonville 27 in rogers 25 in springdale and 24 in fayetteville combined housing and transportation costs as a percentage of income in northwest arkansas passed chicago and new york city no later than early last year center figures show housing plus transportation costs compared to income now average 46 in fayetteville 47 in springdale 53 in rogers and 52 in bentonville according to the index the tight housing situation soon will affect decisions on whether to open a new business here jebaraj predicted i think we re already close to that point he said particularly in the leisure and hospitality sectors restaurants are constantly looking for workers charles proctor

legendary money managers have been eager to scoop up shares of these beaten down growth stocks have you noticed there are some beaten down growth stocks that appear more valuable than the market gives them credit for if so you re in good company steven cohen of point 72 asset management and james simons of renaissance technologies have been buying up shares of some growth stocks that peaked last year and have been beaten mercilessly ever since following in the footsteps of great investors isn t a bad way to pick your own stocks before blindly following anyone though let s look at the bets these billionaire investors recently placed and see what makes them attractive in the first place 1 shopify james simons of renaissance technologies started a new position in shopify shop 2 04 by purchasing around 14 million shares during the second quarter the e commerce giant was seen as a big winner during the stickiest moments of the covid 19 pandemic but the stock has fallen around 81 from its peak last year since its founding in 2006 shopify has emerged as the leader when it comes to providing merchants with business solutions the company has expanded from just offering online stores that accept payments to offering point of sale and fulfillment solutions the stock has been under pressure lately because it s investing heavily in warehouses and fulfillment services in an attempt to keep up with amazon the investments are working more merchants joining shopify plus existing merchants keeping their subscriptions pushed monthly recurring revenue during the second quarter 13 higher year over year amazon is still the king of e commerce in north america but shopify has significant advantages for example third party sellers can easily get lost in a sea of competitors that often include amazon itself when merchants sell products on shopify they can retain far more control over their relationships with customers than they d would from amazon 2 stoneco steven cohen and point72 asset management significantly increased a long position in stoneco stne 2 79 a brazilian fintech company during the second quarter this is a little surprising because the stock has lost around 90 of its value since peaking in early 2021 stoneco mainly offers solutions for merchants that want to sell across borders with a concentration in brazil the stock is down mainly because the company tried to rapidly institute a credit offering that blew up in its face as a result the previously profitable company reported a loss of 285 5 million in 2021 the debacle led to some dramatic executive leadership changes and ended its ambition to be a major financier of small to medium sized businesses cohen and point72 were likely attracted to stoneco because the company s core businesses are still going strong once we exclude the impacts of the company s ill fated credit products stoneco reported second quarter revenue that more than doubled year over year after adjusting for one time charges net income in the second quarter came in at 15 1 million compared to a 30 7 million loss a year earlier good stocks to buy now at recent prices stoneco stock trades for just 2 1 times trailing sales the company s credit product offering was poorly executed but it looks like the worst problems are already in its rear view mirror there are probably better stocks to buy in the e commerce arena right now that said you could also do a lot worse than stoneco shopify s more established and far more expensive at 8 2 times trailing sales despite the higher multiple shopify looks like a much better stock to buy at the moment the sheer amount of merchandise purchased via shopify solutions has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 50 over the past three years the company still has a lot of room to grow and a proven ability to execute plans that expand its offerings
legislation looming in the us congress could emulate european food standards by copying european agricultural regulation pacta protect america s children from toxic pesticides act legislation sponsored by senators elizabeth warren cory booker and bernie sanders would outlaw any pesticide that is illegal in either european union member states the european union itself or canada to many americans europe represents the epitome of culinary civilization and it s true that italian standards for pasta french standard for bread and spanish standards for seafood often far outrank what the average restaurant will serve in the united states but with that said we shouldn t confuse the presence of prime cooking schools in france with a better food market europe s increasing hostility towards crop protection in the form of pesticides is not going to do itself any favors a cornerstone of the eu s continuous ambitions to revamp its food regulation is the farm to fork strategy known as f2f this strategy which is part of the european green deal is a roadmap for a set of package bills set to hit the eu s legislature in the coming years two of its cornerstone proposals are a reduction of pesticides by 50 percent by 2030 and increasing organic food production to 25 percent by 2030 it is currently at about 8 percent the european commission has yet to release an impact assessment on what the farm to fork strategy would mean for farmers and consumers despite repeated calls from eu parliamentarians it has been unable to provide hard numbers backing up the political argument that these environmental reforms would also be good economically thankfully the us department of agriculture usda did its own study in fact when the usda made an impact assessment it found that if implemented f2f would result in a 12 percent reduction in agricultural production in europe and increase the prices of consumer goods by 17 percent in the eu by 5 percent in the us and by 9 percent worldwide in addition the usda also found that in the adoption scenario trade flows would be reduced and that europe s gdp would decline significantly as result of the increase in food commodity prices europe s gdp decline would represent 76 percent of the overall global gdp decline as a result of f2f developing nations would also be hard hit because as a result of these stringent food rules the eu would implement protectionist measures by 2030 the number of food insecure people in the case of eu only adoption would increase by an additional 22 million more than projected without the ec s proposed strategies usda concluded you could ask why it all matters since europeans do pay less for food that apparently is also cooked better it is true that grocery shopping in germany can be quite eye opening to americans a pound of wild caught smoked salmon costs anywhere between 10 and 20 in america or more while in germany those prices vary between 2 and 10 most of that is because the united states does not shower its farmers and fishers with the same lavish farm subsidies that europe does while the us also subsidies farmers research shows that europe out subsidises the states by a long shot so while supermarket prices are lower for consumers it s the tax returns of europeans that tell the real story in countries such as belgium effective income tax rates with social security are upwards of 50 percent in fact single belgian workers are the highest taxed in the entire oecd and they are closely followed by those in germany and france both nearing the 50 percent mark and this doesn t even go into detail of how the european union uses its farm subsidies to undercut producers in developing markets and as the new york times put it how oligarchs milk these millions of farm subsidies for their own benefit reducing pesticides by political decree rather than through innovative technology is a non scientific approach if the argument of the european union were that with modern farm equipment such as smart sprays the amount of pesticides could be reduced because farmers are able to make their use more efficient then that would be a forward thinking approach instead the 50 percent reduction target looks good on a poster but has little to do with evidence based policy making after all if the existing 100 percent are bad for human health why only restrict 50 percent and not the entirety of all these substances incidentally that is what the eu did on a large scale with neonicotinoids by banning certain ones for farming use neonicotinoids or neonics are insecticides that are essential for farmers not to lose a significant amount of their crops each season in december last year the french parliament voted for a three year suspension of the ban on neonics because sugar beet farmers were risking going completely out of business over crop losses the bans exist in europe because neonics have been accused of harming pollinators the bee pocalypse in the early 2000s was blamed first on gmos then subsequently on neonics when the gmo argument was quickly found to be false but neonics also aren t at fault bee colony reductions and disappearances occur naturally and periodically throughout history in fact there were sporadic bee colony declines all throughout recorded history namely the 19th and 20th century before neonics were first introduced in 1995 in fact not only are bees not affected by neonics they aren t even declining as the washington post reported in two separate articles in 2015 call off the bee pocalypse u s honeybee colonies hit a 20 year high and believe it of not the bees are doing just fine the hysteria of global bee declines are simply inaccurate you can even do this for yourself visit the un s food and agricultural organization s fao website select beehives in the visualised data section and click on any country or region you like most countries and regions have a steady upwards trend in the prevalence of bees in the united states the bee population is actually set to double in the coming years compared to the 1960s level so why lie about it why is it such a prevalent narrative that gmos or any given pesticide of the day kill the bees the argument is politically convenient but not scientifically sound in europe the enemies of modern agriculture have a view of the world that does not match the society of comfort and availability the eu s green deal commissioner frans timmermans bemoaned in may last year mind you this is at the height of the first covid 19 lockdown that we ve gotten used to food being too cheap he didn t mean that agriculture subsidies were out of proportion but rather that being able to buy meat or fish on any given day and for low prices were problematic in nature for a man paid 30 000 a month for his commission job while romanian consumers paid upwards of 20 percent of their income on food that s the definition of tone deaf in the united states availability and competition are key also while europe s dreams of a world where nature politely sends no insects to eat our crops no mold to befall food stocks and where no other natural conditions could endanger food security the united states has always enabled scientific innovation case in point the us is far ahead on developing genetic engineering while europe lags behind there is simply no argument in favor of copying eu food regulations

former armstrong flooring executives say they are owed more than 4 5 million for unpaid earned vacation severance and deferred retirement contributions president and ceo michel vermette chief financial officer amy trojanowski general counsel and chief compliance officer christopher parisi human resources director john bassett vice president scott hess and senior vice president and controller philip gaudreau filed separate claims in delaware bankruptcy court the claims come on top of the 4 8 million early payment of their annual incentives disclosed in court and security and exchange commission filings in may the incentive payments a portion of which they would get for a full year were made in the first quarter of the year as lnp lancasteronline has previously reported such bonuses are typically handed out at year s end and based on whether the company reached certain sales or revenue targets the bonuses were predicated on the lower target levels after months of trying to find a buyer or other solution armstrong flooring filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on may 8 payouts to executives prior to bankruptcy in other cases have caught the attention of federal authorities and even threatened to thwart armstrong flooring s chapter 11 plan a report by the federal governmental accountability office in september 2021 found 42 companies paid out 165 million five months to two days before filing bankruptcy in 2020 the gao study was conducted in response to potential abuses involving executive bonuses after congress amended the bankruptcy code in 2005 to restrict debtors in chapter 11 from paying executives retention bonuses for staying through bankruptcy and to a lesser extent incentive bonuses to achieve performance targets there was a provision in a congressional report for gao to review bankruptcy code on bonuses and a selected number and amount of court requested and approved bonuses in fiscal year 2020 the gao concluded that congress should consider amending the bankruptcy code to clearly subject bonuses debtors pay executives shortly before a bankruptcy filing to bankruptcy court oversight and to specify factors courts should consider to approve such bonuses armstrong flooring s lender pathlight capital had opposed a new bankruptcy loan because it argued that the loan was essentially in part being used to restore funds that went to the executives ultimately pathlight dropped its argument and judge mary walrath approved the financing more than 2 900 claims filed the executives claims are part of more than 2 900 claims seeking a piece of the remnants of a 200 million sale of the company s assets in july armstrong flooring owed creditors 317 8 million in debt including 160 million to pre bankruptcy lenders pathlight capital and bank of america and another 24 million to the same lenders for bankruptcy financing the lenders are first in line for payment because those loans are secured by property that was sold armstrong flooring as the debtor in possession will have to give a full accounting of its finances in reports filed after the confirmation of a plan of reorganization and before the case is closed in its last report it had a cash balance of 788 678 at the end of june the next report covering the month of july when the sale of the company was completed will likely be filed at the end of this month when a company files for bankruptcy its creditors including employees can file claims for debts owed for up to 180 days prior to bankruptcy some creditors don t file claims because they don t expect there to be any money while others file just in case there is some in armstrong flooring s case it s not likely they will see all of that money if any employee wages have priority up to a certain amount if earned within 180 days of the bankruptcy filing according to bankruptcy attorney barry solodky of manheim township based saxton stump solodky helped some armstrong flooring workers who are not executives file claims for pension benefits and severance pay an lnp lancasteronline review of claims showed that some employees were paid for part of their 2021 and 2022 incentives on july 6 while the lnp review showed no employees seeking back pay there are retirees seeking an untold amount of pension and life insurance benefits and more than two dozen former workers who live in lancaster county seeking more than 1 million in severance earned prior to the bankruptcy the employee claims range from more than 1 million to a few thousand dollars some sought simply 15 150 for a priority claim which is the highest any employee can receive under bankruptcy law each individual employee of a bankrupt employer is given a priority of 15 150 as of april 2022 adjusted to inflation every 36 months of all wages salaries or commissions the employee earned up to 180 days prior to the organization filing for bankruptcy according to the society of human resource managers in some cases there will be sufficient assets to satisfy employee claims in full in others employees may be compensated for only a portion of their claims or receive nothing at all law firms representing the company unsecured creditors and retirees and financial advisors have applied to be paid more than 15 million for their services some of the executives are seeking severance which is subject to contracts between the company and employee solodky said executory contracts whether employee or otherwise can be assumed or rejected in the bankruptcy case the buyer of most of armstrong flooring s north american assets ahf products assumed union contracts with some modifications it did not assume the executives contracts and company officers except for vermette and parisi were laid off on july 22 along with a few hundred of mostly headquarters staff a 2016 severance agreement for armstrong flooring executives filed with the securities and exchange commission says the company may permanently suspend benefits under severance allowances in pay status in the event of the company s insolvency liquidation or bankruptcy reorganization or in the event the cost of providing such benefits would lead to the company s insolvency liquidation or bankruptcy reorganization former armstrong flooring ceo vermette was paid 2 157 530 in 2021 and the total compensation for the median employee in 2021 was 56 826 resulting in an estimated ratio of ceo s pay to the pay of a median employee for 2021 of 37 to 1 vermette s employment agreement says it is enforceable except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally the contract was for three years from august 2019 also the bankruptcy estate may be able to recover some money via a preferential transfer preference allows money spent 90 days prior to bankruptcy to be brought back into the estate if the money was given preferentially to a creditor solodky said the debtor in possession or the u s trustee has two years from the bankruptcy filing for transfer actions which usually happen towards the end of the process for money paid out to company insiders officers directors shareholders or anyone with an extremely close relationship to the debtor the preferential lookback is a year solodky said in 2020 vermette saw the value of his pay plunge 73 7 to 1 19 million from 4 52 million the prior year when he was hired and was given stock valued at the time at 3 8 million spread over five years the stock grant was to replace compensation he would have received if he had stayed at his prior post at mohawk industries and was to reward him if armstrong flooring common stock s stock price hit certain marks lnp lancasteronline reported in 2021 that armstrong flooring didn t raise the salaries of vermette and the other top executives because of the pandemic which slashed the company s financial results armstrong still gave the executives an annual incentive payout albeit at the minimum level because the company made progress on its strategic overhaul
menafn trend news agency a decline in the u s economy will significantly impact the global economy particularly the developing economies trend reports citing xinhua as the u s real gross domestic product has contracted for two consecutive quarters josua pardede chief economist at indonesia s permata bank told in a recent interview that the u s economy has shown signs of declining some components of the u s economy like consumption have contracted making inflation surge to its highest point in over four decades said the economist he also said the expectation of a u s recession in the next 12 months will be much higher as higher inflation followed by higher interest rates will lead to lower consumption and lower investments the shock in the u s economy will slow down the global economy and the global trade volume will be also declining he said noting the export performance of indonesia and other developing countries will go down since the united states is their main trading partner he suggested that developing countries including indonesia should mitigate or offset the impact from the slowdown in u s demand by finding other trading partners strengthening the fundamentals of its domestic economy and spurring domestic consumption when there is a recession in the united states risk averse sentiment will rise he pointed out adding such sentiment will lead to capital outflow from the financial market particularly in the bond market foreign ownership of indonesian government bonds has declined around 7 8 billion u s dollars so basically this leads to a weaker rupiah against the u s dollar the economist said he further said the governments and central banks of developing countries need to take measures to stabilize the currency exchange rate

facility in the past 24 hours negotiations for a visit to the nuclear power plant by u n inspectors are nearing completion but the kremlin is insisting on a russian media presence for the visit ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba told the washington post the russians want to send russian media to the power plant to welcome the delegation and to stage a propaganda show kuleba said at the united nations russia blocked the final draft of a declaration on a joint treaty on nuclear security after weeks of negotiations the russian delegation objected to a clause in the text regarding the situation at the zaporizhzhia power plant ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said it was essential for international atomic energy agency representatives to get to the plant as soon as possible and to help keep it under permanent ukrainian control the situation remains precarious and dangerous zelenskyy said friday any repetition of events i e any disconnection of the station from the grid or any actions by russia that could trigger the shutdown of the reactors will once again put the station one step away from disaster ukraine has claimed russia is using the power plant as a shield by storing weapons there and launching attacks from around it moscow for its part accuses ukraine of firing on the nuclear complex ukraine has canceled an agreement with russia according to a parliamentary official it was not clear which agreement he was referring to though in a deal signed by russian ukrainian and american leaders in 1994 ukraine agreed to give up its nuclear weapons for security guarantees elsewhere in ukraine one person was killed and another wounded in russian firing in the mykolaiv region local government officials said mykolaiv city is an important black sea port and shipbuilding center the governor of the eastern donetsk region pavlo kyrylenko said saturday that two people were killed in russian firing on the city of bakhmut a significant target for russian and separatist forces seeking to take control of the parts of the region they do not already hold almost 75 of donetsk s population has been evacuated since the war began kyrylenko said adding that ukraine retained control of about 45 of the region but all cities were being shelled constantly the area along with neighboring luhansk has long been a flashpoint for conflict between russia and ukraine ukraine s southern command used rockets to take out a key bridge used by russian troops in the southern kherson region reuters reported russia probably has increased the intensity of its assaults in the donbas region in response to speculation that ukraine is planning a major counteroffensive britain s defense ministry said in an intelligence update saturday however russian forces have secured few territorial gains overall it added the british government announced saturday that it was giving ukraine underwater drones and training sailors to use them to clear mines from the ravaged country s coastline mines laid in the black sea during the war have hampered seaborne exports of ukrainian grain to world markets although an agreement reached in july has allowed shipments to resume along a single corridor low expectations russia blocked the adoption of a joint statement to close out a united nations conference on an ongoing nuclear arms treaty western officials said a diplomatic broadside that underscored the global ramifications of the war in ukraine moscow s representatives at the monthlong conference objected to language in the agreement that raised concerns about ukraine the russian state news agency tass reported the monthlong conference on upholding and strengthening the 50 year old global treaty on the non proliferation of nuclear weapons is held every five years and had once been seen as a chance to deal with loopholes that have allowed a resurgence in the spread of nuclear weapons expectations for breakthroughs were low the last conference also failed to result in a consensus document a high ranking russian diplomat in moscow s delegation andrey belousov blamed the lack of agreement on efforts by other nations to use the document to settle scores with russia raising topics that are not directly related to the treaty the conference has become a political hostage to those states that over the last four weeks poisoned discussions with their politicized biased groundless and false statements with regard to ukraine belousov said in a statement at the close of the session western officials immediately slammed russia for throwing a wrench in the proceedings which early on had included discussions on the threat of a nuclear confrontation or a nuclear accident emerging from russia s invasion of ukraine russia obstructed progress by refusing to compromise on proposed text accepted by all other states australia s foreign minister penny wong wrote on twitter the conference was taking place after a two year delay because of the covid 19 pandemic high level representatives from member states including the prime minister of japan the u s secretary of state and dozens of foreign ministers and delegations attended u s officials made clear that russia s objections were related to ukraine we were not able to achieve a consensus document because of the inexplicable choice of one state adam scheinman the u s special representative for nuclear nonproliferation wrote on twitter the u s deeply regrets russia s refusal to acknowledge the grave situation in ukraine it is absurd that russia could not do so using shipping more meanwhile the pentagon has expanded its use of maritime shipping to deliver weapons for the war in ukraine u s defense officials said after relying heavily on aircraft early in russia s invasion to get arms to kyiv as quickly as possible the defense department began sending some items by sea a few weeks after the invasion but significantly broadened the effort this spring because the united states began providing ukraine with howitzer artillery and other heavy weapons that require a steady flow of large caliber ammunition u s defense officials said at the headquarters of u s transportation command during a recent visit by deputy defense secretary kathleen hicks once we started to provide them howitzers we knew that we were going to need more ammunition said army col steven putthoff the deputy director of operations at u s transportation command so we could plan ahead a little bit more and then we could start to use more sealift to provide that support and to get it there sometimes even ahead of the request the expansion underscores a new phase in the campaign after a russian assault on kyiv was repelled and ukraine and its partners settled in for what is expected to be a grinding war that could continue for months more and possibly years the biden administration has approved 12 9 billion of military assistance for ukraine so far and pledged wednesday an additional 2 98 billion of support u s military officials declined to detail specific routes used to get weapons to ukraine but said some of the weapons coming from the continental united states find their way directly to the battlefield while others are being used to replenish american stocks elsewhere in europe from which u s military officials withdrew supplies to arm ukraine while aircraft can reach europe from the united states much more quickly ships can haul vast quantities of cargo that could allow ukraine to build up a larger arsenal for future campaigns in the war the effort comes a year after the united states carried out a harrowing evacuation of more than 124 000 people from afghanistan taxing the pentagon s fleet of cargo jets at the height of the operation a c 17 was landing at hamid karzai international airport at least once per hour that heavy schedule required the transportation command to suspend other operations until the evacuation was completed and then catch up aircraft on maintenance putthoff said during the evacuation putthoff said everything else on the world kind of went on hold what we call broken glass we had to go back in and clean that up the next few months the weapons deliveries to ukraine are different he said while virtually all flights landing in kabul during the evacuation were military jets the pentagon has relied heavily on chartered aircraft and ships to move equipment for ukraine leaving the u s military free to carry out a variety of other transport missions at transportation command hicks met aug 18 with military officials including air force gen jackie van ovost the command s top officer van ovost said that anticipating possible needs and setting routes as quickly as possible is key equipment usually moves from a military depot by train or truck to an airport or seaport and then arrives in a second location from where it often must be moved again we re not graded on getting it to a location where it s not being used van ovost said speaking to hicks the pentagon s no 2 official we re getting graded on end to end van ovost said the manual calculations that u s military officials had to do in the past to move equipment took days now we have systems that allow us to perfect it she said it s less airplanes in the right locations at the right times and it s done by the press of a button and three or four seconds later we have three or four options hicks credited transcom officials with carrying out an impressive ballet to move everything that is needed she told reporters after that she wants to make sure the military has the ability to sustain its fleets and keep them appropriately sized ukraine as challenging as it is does not compare really to the level of lift and mobility and refueling that need to be done in a major conflict hicks said among the weapons the pentagon has delivered to ukraine so far are more than 1 400 anti aircraft stinger missiles 8 500 javelin anti armor missiles critical in destroying russian tanks 700 switchblade drones and 142 pieces of howitzer artillery with more than 900 000 rounds on wednesday senior pentagon officials said they expect even more military assistance to flow to ukraine after the recent 3 billion commitment this may be our largest security assistance package to date but let me be clear it will not be our last said colin kahl the undersecretary of defense for policy in a news briefing we will continue to closely consult with ukraine on its near mid and long term capability needs information for this article was contributed by

over the past decade governments around the world threw money at renewable power private investors followed hoping to cash in on what looked like an imminent epic shift in the way the world produced electricity it all seemed intoxicating and revolutionary a way to boost jobs temper fossil fuel prices and curb global warming while minting new fortunes in the process much of that enthusiasm has now fizzled natural gas prices have plummeted in the united states the result of technology that has unlocked vast supplies of a fuel that is cleaner than coal the global recession has nudged global warming far down the political agenda and led cash strapped countries to yank back renewable energy subsidies and some big government bets on renewable power have gone bad most spectacularly the bet on solyndra the california solar panel maker that received a 535 million loan guarantee from the u s department of energy before going bankrupt last fall critics of taxpayer sponsored investment in renewable energy point to solyndra as an example of how misguided the push for solar and wind power has become indeed the drive has been sloppy failing to derive the most bang for the buck in the united states the government has schizophrenically ramped up and down support for renewable power confusing investors and inhibiting the technologies development it has also structured its subsidies in inefficient ways in europe where support for renewable power has been more sustained governments have often been too generous doling out subsidies so juicy they have proved unaffordable and in china the new epicenter of the global renewable power push a national drive to build up indigenous wind and solar companies has spurred u s allegations of trade violations and has done little to curb china s reliance on fossil fuels but these challenges don t justify ending the pursuit of renewable power they justify reforming it it is time to push harder for renewable power but to push in a smarter way recent advances have made wind and solar power more competitive than ever now for renewable power to reach its potential the world s approach to it will have to grow up too governments will have to redesign their renewable power policies to focus ruthlessly on slashing costs renewable power producers will also have to act more strategically picking the technologies they deploy and the locations where they place them in ways that make more economic sense as renewable power comes of age it needs some tough love this rigor will be crucial because today s energy challenge is fundamentally harder than those of past decades historically countries have made big energy shifts only when confronted with acute fossil fuel crises oil embargoes debilitating pollution or wars that is why in the wake of the 1970s oil shocks france embraced nuclear power denmark ramped up its energy efficiency and then its development of wind power and brazil began fueling some of its auto fleet with ethanol but today s threats climate change fluctuating energy prices and the prospect that other countries might dominate a still nascent clean energy industry are more chronic and less immediate thus they are unlikely to sustain the generous spending that has nurtured renewable energy so far so fresh and so clean the first step to adopting a more mature approach to renewable power is to understand how the various technologies work and what challenges they face historically most renewable electricity has come from hydroelectric dams which now provide about 16 percent of the world s electricity today the sources growing the fastest and receiving the most investor attention are wind and solar power wind power which generates about 1 4 percent of the world s electricity is produced as pinwheel style turbines spin atop towers that rise hundreds of feet above the ground solar power provides an even smaller share of global electricity just 0 1 percent techniques for generating it vary the most popular uses panels containing wafers of silicon thinner than a fingernail to convert sunlight into electrical current a few of these photovoltaic panels as they are known can be mounted directly on a building s roof letting the occupants produce at least some of their own power or hundreds of panels can be grouped together on the ground in vast arrays that funnel power into the electrical grid sprawling centralized power plants of a new sort some of which have been built in the american southwest although wind power is more widespread today solar power is theoretically more attractive the sun emits a nearly limitless supply of energy and it does so during the daytime when people use the most electricity wind tends to blow most strongly at night solar power also is easily distributed panels can be placed on a streetlight or a soldier s backpack whereas wind power is mostly a centralized energy source requiring clumps of turbines to generate sizable amounts of power but both wind and solar energy offer big advantages over fossil fuels wind and sunshine are clean emitting neither the pollutants that cause smog nor the carbon dioxide that contributes to climate change they are ubiquitous providing a domestic energy source even in places with no indigenous fossil fuels and they are essentially never ending there are huge caveats to this rosy assessment and they come down mostly to money in most places producing electricity from new wind and solar projects is more expensive than making it in new conventional power plants wind and solar power are younger technologies with much work left to be done to wring out cost the downsides of fossil fuels notably their geopolitical and environmental risks are not fully reflected in their market prices and everything about the modern electrical system is predicated on the use of fossil fuels the coal mines and gas fields that produce them the railroads pipelines and ships that transport them and the power plants that burn them that system has been built up and its costs largely paid down over decades wind and solar power enjoy no such entrenched infrastructure the challenge of making and installing the wind turbines and solar panels is just the start massive new transmission lines must be built to move large amounts of renewable electricity from the out of the way places where it is generated to the metropolitan areas where it is consumed this new equipment costs money and it often stokes opposition from people who are not used to living near industrial scale energy infrastructure of any sort along with other opponents a group of landowners in cape cod massachusetts for instance has managed to delay the construction of an offshore wind farm that was proposed back in 2001 even environmental activists often fight large renewable energy projects out of concern for local landscapes or animals last spring the obama administration temporarily halted construction on part of a solar project in the mojave desert because of concerns that it would harm endangered tortoises the government later let the construction resume taking wind and solar power mainstream will also require better ways to get it to consumers when they need it since the times when wind turbines and solar panels generate the most electricity are not necessarily the times when people use electricity most power plants fired by natural gas can be dialed up or down to meet changing electricity demand but the sun shines and the wind blows only at certain times one potential solution is to stockpile renewable power either in large scale storage equipment such as massive batteries or in smaller scale devices such as people s plug in hybrid cars other approaches include better technologies to predict gusts and rays and smart electrical transmission grids that could tie together far flung renewable power projects both could help compensate in one place for doldrums or gray skies somewhere else scientists are working to bring down the cost of all these ideas for now in some places with dense concentrations of wind turbines some of the power they could produce is wasted the turbines are shut off when the wind is blowing so hard that the turbines would produce more power than the grid could handle wind and solar power will not replace fossil fuels anytime soon not by a long shot the international energy agency projects that by 2035 wind and solar could be producing ten percent of global electricity up from 1 5 percent now and that renewables of all sorts could be generating 31 percent of the world s electricity up from about 19 percent now but even that expansion would require an increase in subsidies support that in some cases the iea notes cannot be taken for granted in this age of fiscal austerity some countries with particularly generous subsidies and high electricity prices have made wind and solar power big enough to matter denmark gets 18 percent of its electricity from wind and spain gets two percent from the sun the world s leaders by share according to the iea s latest figures but even that renewable electricity is backed up by fossil fuel power plants last year fully one third of the new electricity generating capacity brought on line in the united states came from wind and solar projects even so given the vastness of the conventional energy system wind and solar power remained relatively tiny accounting for just three percent of the electricity the country actually produced for the foreseeable future renewable power is likely to supplement not supplant conventional energy that is why two other shifts will be at least as important as renewable power in addressing the energy problem one is cleaning up the burning of coal and natural gas fuels that are cheap plentiful and according to most estimates likely to continue to generate the lion s share of the world s electricity for a long time the other is wasting less of the power the world produces from all sources that means making buildings appliances and industrial processes more energy efficient a complicated but potentially profitable shift that policymakers and entrepreneurs are working on according to iea estimates between now and 2035 improving the efficiency of fossil fuel power plants would likely cut global carbon emissions more than 1 5 times as much as would rolling out more wind and solar power considering what renewable power is up against the drive for it might seem a folly but giving up now would be a mistake as a result of recent technological improvements the prospect of renewable power as an economically competitive part of the energy mix is no longer a pipe dream wind turbines and solar panels have gotten more efficient and less expensive according to government and wall street analyses in some particularly windy places the long term cost to investors of producing power from new wind projects can now be less than the cost of producing it from new coal or gas fired power plants solar power remains more expensive than conventional power except in a few sunny places with high power prices such as hawaii but its costs too are falling rapidly now more than ever sustained but strategic support could produce blockbuster innovations with the potential to meaningfully change the energy mix paying for power wind and solar power would be nowhere near as viable without the subsidies they get from governments to be sure all energy sources including fossil fuels receive state support but as the energy world s upstarts wind and solar power will have to be especially scrappy to gain ground so far governments worldwide have tended to promote renewable power in ham fisted ways spending money inefficiently the modern renewable power push dates to the 1973 arab oil embargo at the time the west generated much of its power from petroleum so the embargo threatened not just transportation but also the electricity supply many countries decided to seek alternative sources of power the united states made a particular push into wind in 1978 it rolled out a subsidy called the investment tax credit it gave wind farm developers a tax break for every dollar they spent on wind projects regardless of how many megawatts those projects produced the goal was wind turbines not efficient wind turbines and the result was predictable by the early 1990s many of those subsidized machines were breaking down in 1992 the u s government enacted a smarter wind subsidy called the production tax credit it pegged a wind farm developer s tax break to the amount of electricity the project produced around the same time states began passing laws requiring power companies to produce a given percentage of their electricity from renewable sources today 29 states plus washington d c and puerto rico have such standards on their books the combination of the federal tax break and the state renewable energy mandates transformed wind power from an inventor s dalliance into an investment banker s dream wind power became a nationwide industry with guaranteed buyers and an attractive rate of return the tax break did not directly help the mom and pop wind developers their tax liabilities were too small to exploit the full value of the credit but it appealed to financial institutions which by buying into the developers wind projects could apply the federal tax break to their own bottom lines propelled by the tax break wind turbines have spread across the united states particularly in the so called wind alley running from north dakota down to texas but the tax break strategy has made the campaign for renewable power more expensive than it might have been whereas tax breaks for the fossil fuel industry are long term those for wind power have come in only one or two year bursts a sign that the country has viewed renewable power as an afterthought the consequence has been an inefficient boom bust cycle of wind farm development companies race to get wind projects built before the current subsidy expires often installing more turbines than the grid can handle in some parts of windswept texas so many turbines are competing to shove power into the transmission grid that wind farms have had to hold back on windy days the tax break moreover is not just paying for the construction of wind turbines it is also lining bankers pockets the financial institutions investing in wind farms in exchange for the tax break exact a profit that s capitalism of course and energy is hardly the only industry in the united states that relies on financing from tax breaks yet according to some estimates about 30 percent of the value of renewable power tax credits ends up benefiting financiers rather than funding renewable energy production the united states is not alone in spending inefficiently on renewable power some western european countries have spent even more money than the united states for each unit of renewable power that they have produced their solar panel push in particular illustrates how poorly designed subsidies can stymie the development of renewable power germany hardly a sunny place was europe s first big solar power enthusiast it began promoting the sector in earnest in the early 1990s largely in response to two crises the 1986 chernobyl nuclear accident which soured many germans on nuclear power as a fossil fuel alternative and the 1990 reunification of poor east germany and rich west germany which launched a national push for job creation programs such as solar industry subsidies by the late 1990s germany had rolled out a subsidy more generous than the united states renewable power tax credit called a feed in tariff it lets solar project developers sell power to the german electrical grid at a premium price guaranteed by the government by the middle years of the last decade the country had become the world s biggest solar market investors from big banks to small entrepreneurs profited handsomely other countries in europe eyed germany s solar stampede with envy by 2007 with the global economy roaring and popular concern about climate change cresting spain enacted its own solar feed in tariff which guaranteed a similarly high electricity price sure enough solar developers raced to build projects in spain a sunnier place than germany and the spanish government found itself paying out more in subsidies than it had anticipated then the global recession hit and spain decided its solar power extravaganza was a luxury it could no longer afford several european countries are now dialing back their subsidies germany and italy have slashed the guaranteed prices they offer new solar projects the czech republic and spain are going further retroactively pulling back subsidies they already gave to existing projects that retrenchment has slammed the brakes on the development of solar power in europe and it has had a ripple effect worldwide eroding the stock prices of solar panel makers from california to china that had ramped up their production to supply the european market china s renewables push as western governments have scaled back their support for renewable power china has been pushing full steam ahead probably more than any other country today china feels an imperative to develop renewable power to boost jobs and exports to consume cash and counter inflationary pressure to ease the country s rising fossil fuel demand and to help clean up its polluted air in china the global leader renewable energy investment excluding spending on research and development surged to about 50 billion in 2010 according to bloomberg new energy finance next came germany at 41 billion and then the united states at about 30 billion the scale of china s push although massive should not be overstated china still generates about 80 percent of its electricity from coal it is building dozens of new coal fired power plants each year and is laying a massive network of pipelines to import more natural gas according to iea figures wind and solar in china as worldwide together provided about 1 5 percent of electricity in 2009 and that share might rise to ten percent by 2035 china s push has produced some of the biggest wind turbine makers in the world bigger however does not necessarily mean more efficient china s early wind power subsidies like those in the united states rewarded installing wind turbines not producing wind power that subsidy structure combined at the time with rules requiring that a certain percentage of the material for each turbine to be produced domestically gave chinese wind power companies a powerful leg up on foreign competitors in the past two years the chinese company sinovel displaced general electric as the world s second biggest wind turbine manufacturer by market share behind denmark s vestas but the chinese system also led to overkill in the region of inner mongolia chinese companies installed more turbines than the grid could handle and about 25 percent of those turbines have yet to be connected to transmission lines china is racing to beef up the grid but for now the excess turbines amount to very tall white elephants china s solar power industry has grown even faster than its wind power sector more than any other factor the torrid expansion of low cost chinese manufacturing to feed the heavily subsidized european solar power market is what has slashed the price of silicon and of solar panels over the past two years indirectly the chinese solar power juggernaut killed solyndra the company s product a novel system of photovoltaic tubes that used less silicon than traditional flat panels was not competitive in a world where silicon was suddenly cheap last fall a handful of western solar panel makers filed a trade complaint against their chinese counterparts alleging that china s solar power subsidies violate trade laws allowing chinese companies to dump solar panels on the u s market at prices below the cost of production beijing has denied the charge saying in return that it will investigate the fairness of u s renewable power subsidies u s officials are expected to issue a final decision later this year about whether to impose unfair trade duties on imported chinese panels but beyond this legal dispute lies a larger lesson if the goal of the renewable power push is a cleaner more diversified power supply then low cost solar equipment from china or anywhere else is a good thing that in turn suggests a bedrock principle for a smart u s renewable power strategy exploit globalization rather than fight it power play a sensible push for renewable power in the united states would start with a broader effort to make the nation s energy system cleaner and more secure the obama administration s stimulus plan sought to compensate for the lack of a comprehensive energy strategy by picking a portfolio of short term winners such as solyndra even if some of those bets pay off and many still might those sorts of wagers are insufficient a better approach would be to set a broad direction for the energy system and then let that newly defined market determine which technologies and companies rise to the top one worthwhile move would be for the government to boost funding for advanced energy research just as it raised funding for space research when it wanted to send a man to the moon and ratcheted up spending on defense research when it wanted to win the cold war another would be to aggressively prioritize improvements in energy efficiency because it makes no sense to pay for wind and solar power that then will be frittered away in inefficient buildings and machines yet another reasonable step would be to slap a price on carbon emissions although its effectiveness would depend on the details many corporations and investors have been advocating a carbon price but they disagree mightily over how to structure it and the structure would determine how the policy affected u s consumers various industries and indeed the planet an essential part of any shift to a cleaner and more secure energy system would be rationalizing the patchwork of conflicting energy subsidies that has been stitched together over decades according to the iea renewable energy worldwide receives less money in annual subsidies than fossil fuels do renewable energy including fuels for transportation and electricity got 66 billion in subsidies globally in 2010 the iea says a fraction of just one subset of subsidies for fossil fuels the 409 billion to defray their cost to consumers but the flip side some studies conclude is that renewable sources in their early years have been more heavily subsidized than fossil fuels for every unit of electricity they actually produce an apples to apples comparison of energy subsidies and an open debate about which ones most effectively promote the kind of energy system the united states wants should appeal to honest partisans of all stripes once the united states sets out a sensible overall energy approach it should tailor its wind and solar strategies to play to the country s strengths that means focusing on the higher end of the market developing next generation technologies and business models that have the potential to make wind and solar power truly cost competitive with fossil fuels despite much hype about the potential for green jobs the united states should be selective about the kinds of green jobs it pursues not run of the mill assembly line positions that can be easily outsourced but jobs in engineering high value manufacturing and renewable power installation financing and servicing studies of the solar power industry suggest that the bulk of the jobs are not in making the panels they lie upstream in producing the raw materials and the machinery that are used to make the panels and downstream in installing and servicing the panels indeed much of the machinery used in chinese solar panel factories today is made in america similarly some of the most innovative business models for deploying solar panels on rooftops such as that in which companies install the equipment for property owners at no up front cost and then charge the consumers a favorable electricity price come from u s firms to the extent that the united states installs today s renewable energy equipment it should relentlessly squeeze out cost one way to do that would be to auction renewable power subsidies to companies that agree to produce the largest amount of electricity at the lowest price another would be to expand the box of tools used to finance wind and solar power moving beyond today s tax credits to instruments that broaden the pool of investors and thus lower the cost of capital a third would be to clear away the thicket of regulatory barriers that impede innovation and distort the renewable energy market in the united states regulators at the federal state and local levels should simplify the permit process for wind and solar projects including the installation of transmission lines even in the face of opposition from landowners and environmentalists some studies suggest that upward of 20 percent of the cost of installing solar panel systems in the united states comes not from the panels themselves but from administrative red tape balancing the desire for renewable power with property rights and local environmental concerns is crucial but prioritizing certain areas of the country for renewable energy development and then streamlining the process of breaking ground on projects would accelerate those ventures that make the most economic sense globally policymakers should resist the urge to slap tariffs and local content requirements on renewable energy equipment all countries including china should be forced to comply with international trade rules if they play fair however they should be allowed to play hard in renewable power as in other industries tough competition will produce the most cost effective products the most enduring way for the united states to snag a profitable piece of the global renewable power market is to do certain things better than other countries not to try to deny american consumers commodities that other countries can make legally at a lower cost if the united states followed this strategic approach far from ceding its ambitions as a global renewable power leader it would harness its strengths as a technological innovator to make wind and solar power more competitive as a complement to coal and natural gas on the one hand such a strategy would recognize that renewable power has benefits over fossil fuels that in this early stage of its development are worth paying extra for on the other hand it would seek to ensure that subsidies for renewable power as well as subsidies for conventional energy gradually shrink and eventually even stop the energy debate has been too ideological for too long wind and solar power will never reach the scale necessary to make a difference to national security or the environment unless they can be produced

u s federal reserve chair jerome powell center takes a coffee break with attendees of the jackson hole economic symposium in the u s state of wyoming friday bank of korea bok governor rhee chang yong also attended the symposium of central bankers ap yonhap bok chief says it s difficult to end rate hikes earlier than fed by yi whan woo the bank of korea bok is likely to face more pressure to pursue additional rate hikes throughout this year after the head of the u s federal reserve reaffirmed his hawkish stance friday to raise borrowing costs at a faster pace to fight inflation the bok has been open to additional hikes as signaled by governor rhee chang yong that the country s monetary policy will continue to focus on taming inflation after the base rate was raised for the fourth straight time to 2 5 percent thursday under the circumstances fed chair jerome powell warned friday that interest rates will remain elevated for some time the fed took a rare giant step of delivering a 75 basis point rate hike for the second consecutive month in july the historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy powell said on the sidelines of the jackson hole economic symposium of central bankers in the u s state of wyoming we must keep at it until the job is done he referred to u s inflation that accelerated to a 40 year high of 9 1 percent in june the pace of price rises slightly slowed to 8 5 percent in july but signs of a relief remain uncertain powell went on to say a single month s improvement falls far short of what fed policymakers will need to see before we are confident that inflation is moving down stressing that a failure to curb prices would mean far greater pain powell s comment comes after the fed s minutes from the july rate setting meeting were released in mid august in which officials committed themselves to rate hikes until they find compelling evidence that inflation is falling such a hawkish stance increases the possibility of the u s policy rate which currently remains in the range of 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent becoming higher than korea s the bok has two rate setting meetings remaining this year in october and november while the fed has three more to come in september november and december the bok finds small incremental increases appropriate while the u s is believed to be open to a third giant step if necessary at the jackson hole meeting in the u s sunday bok governor rhee chang yong hinted that the bok will maintain a credit tightening mode longer than the fed we are now independent from the government but we are not independent from the fed rhee said in a reuters interview on the sidelines of the conference so if the fed continues to increase the interest rate it will have a depreciation pressure for our currency if the fed continues to hike interest rates it will further build pressure on the weakening of the korean won taking into consideration the fed s impact on our monetary policy and inflation i don t think we will stop interest hikes earlier than the fed he said concerning the korean economy analysts say powell s hawkish message and the bok s possible additional rate hikes can further heighten economic risks they include a weakening korean currency against the u s dollar a surge in import prices a widening trade deficit the flight of foreign capital in search of safer haven assets a plummeting stock market and growing household debt those risks certainly make the bok feel more burden in balancing between inflation and growth in its rate policy said joo won deputy director of the hyundai research institute jun sung in a hongik university economics professor warned that a rate hike in the future may affect consumer spending in the midst of a slowdown in exports
fredericksburg virginia as the fight for control of the house heats up rep abigail spanberger d va says she believes recent legislative wins and the supreme court s decision to overturn roe v wade are shifting the political climate ahead of the midterm elections spanberger is in a heated race against the gop candidate prince william county board supervisor yesli vega in virginia s 7th congressional district a battleground seat that encompasses the washington d c exurbs political forecasters have largely rated the seat as a toss up with republicans making it one of their top targets and while strategists have widely projected that republicans take back the house in november the virginia democrat said she feels confident in her voting record citing the recent passage of the inflation reduction act a party line climate and healthcare bill that republicans have slammed as counterproductive to its title and the bipartisan infrastructure law as legislation she feels has resonated with voters i think the climate has been changing and i think i ll say climate meaning kind of beyond just our individual race i think a lot of the successes that we ve had the legislation that we ve passed including really important bipartisan legislation i think people are feeling heartened by she told the washington examiner in an interview democrats in competitive races break with biden on student loan forgiveness you know congress is doing stuff we re sending things to the president s desk and in fairness we have been all along but there s been a number of pieces of legislation that are far more high profile and you know just earlier this week i was out visiting a bridge project a bridge that needs repair that is central to the community and commerce and it s getting the repair because of the bill she said spanberger is no stranger to tough races the centrist democrat managed to oust conservative rep dave brat in 2018 from a seat that had been held by a republican since 1971 she narrowly beat gop opponent nick freitas in 2020 while redistricting has shifted the seat from an r 3 to a d 2 the gop sees the battleground district as a viable pickup opportunity with strategists noting that historically the minority party picks up seats when the opposing party holds control of both chambers and the white house during midterm elections the house gop s campaign arm republican super pacs and her opponent have looked to paint spanberger as a progressive attempting to link her to speaker nancy pelosi d ca far left lawmakers such as rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny and the defund the police movement a strategy that proved to be effective in a number of swing districts during the last cycle but the virginia democrat who previously worked as a cia officer with a focus on counterterrorism said she thinks the strategy will fail in her district running a localized campaign and getting to know voters she said has provided an opportunity to distinguish herself from others in the party on the trail she has touted her push for police funding bills legislation that received pushback from progressives and her efforts to bar members of congress from trading individual stocks i mean it s silliness and they tried it in 2018 and it didn t work they tried it in 2020 and it didn t work i have a record i mean for starters i didn t vote for pelosi either time and that s you know a simple little proof point but like usually if you re someone s puppet you vote for them you know i have many occasions where i have called out the party or pushed for things that weren t popular within the party she said i mean you know a piece of legislation that i believe in wholeheartedly prohibiting members of congress from being able to buy and sell stocks is not as one might imagine not the most popular with some of my colleagues who either they or their spouses like to buy and sell a ton of stock right she added there s plenty of places where the divergence between us is quite clear i think if they re attacking me over someone else s record it s because they can t attack me over mine spanberger also dismissed the notion that president joe biden s low approval ratings will have an impact on her race i m the one on the ballot i m running a local campaign somebody else s approval rating being not ideal i think that that can signal overall feeling of a voting electorate she said but you know quite frankly some of the criticisms people might have of biden are just not relevant to me as democrats fight to hold their house majority another issue that spanberger said has resonated possibly more in her district than others is the jan 6 attack on the capitol largely due to the number of government employees and law enforcement officers who live in the district a lot of capitol police officers live in the district we also have quantico we ve got the fbi we ve got a lot of federal employees who if you re a career public servant there s this sort of different mentality in the capitol you know if you are a career public servant you might work over at the department of commerce an agency in a government building even if it s not the capitol maybe it resonates slightly differently in our district than others she said a number of democrats have pointed to the party s victory in the special election for new york s 19th congressional district where abortion was a major topic in the race as a bellwether demonstrating that flipping the house won t be as easy for republicans as election analysts previously projected spanberger said the issue is something she is hearing about from voters leaning into abortion access the virginia democrat released her first ad of the general election hitting vega who supports a ban for doubting whether women can get pregnant as easily as a result of rape the dobbs decision has been interesting in a couple of ways for some people it is about the dobbs decision it is about abortion was legal and now it is not protected right and for some people it is about that for some people it is that was settled case law for 50 years and now we re regressing and that is more of the theoretical we have literally lost freedoms that for 50 years have been in place what s next she said and people say well what about marriage equality oh no no marriage equality can t be on the chopping block are you kidding remember how roe was settled case law for 50 years marriage equality is very recent not even 10 years old and so there s that kind of worry about freedoms she added click here to read more from the washington examiner spanberger said she s heard concerns from constituents about access to certain medical care beyond abortion if a ban goes into effect in the state literally justice thomas talked about whether or not birth control should be legal and then there s the sort of area in between where it isn t actually just about abortion it s about if you re a victim of rape and you go to a hospital and their standard of care would be to give you the morning after pill she said there is report after report of women who have miscarried and have not been able to get a d c when they have miscarried the pregnancy is not viable but if there is still any activity on the sonogram machine even though now they re facing a loss of a pregnancy she continued now they re not denied the standard of care which would not only protect their lives but also protect their fertility into the future
bismarck with abortion likely to be outlawed in north dakota activists on both sides of the divisive issue are mapping out their next moves it s a long road to 2024 most agree but the next election year could prove pivotal in the future of abortion access last week a bismarck judge temporarily blocked an abortion ban from taking effect in the state but a trigger law passed by lawmakers in 2007 dictates that the procedure should become illegal with the supreme court s decision to overturn roe v wade elsewhere in the great plains kansans voted earlier this month to shoot down a proposed constitutional amendment that would have removed abortion protections abortion rights advocates see the result in the conservative leaning state as a sign that the public favors open access to the procedure voters in at least four other states including montana will respond to questions on abortion during november s general election but in north dakota it s too late for any abortion related measures to end up on the ballot some north dakota abortion rights activists have begun to think about mounting a ballot measure campaign in 2024 to re legalize the procedure if it becomes prohibited advertisement prairie action north dakota director amy jacobson told forum news service members of her progressive organization have spoken about a possible ballot measure but she noted that the first priority is keeping an eye on conservative lawmakers that could further restrict reproductive rights during next year s legislative session jacobson the former state director of planned parenthood said she and like minded activists couldn t even begin an initiated measure campaign for about a year but it s important to continue conversations about what a ballot measure could look like on the other side of the issue anti abortion lawmakers and advocates say they are not eying a ballot measure to cement abortion restrictions in the state constitution north dakota catholic conference director christopher dodson said he doesn t see why such a constitutional amendment would be necessary if state law contained an abortion ban the consensus among pro life leaders nationally is to let the new abortion laws settle down to focus on programs for women and children and to see what the abortion rights side does next dodson said state sen janne myrdal an edinburg republican and fervent abortion opponent told forum news service she hasn t heard any rumblings about a lawmaker led effort to directly place an anti abortion constitutional measure on the ballot sen janne myrdal r edinburg speaks on the senate floor on monday march 29 2021 jeremy turley forum news service myrdal said she thinks north dakota will have some of the best abortion laws in the country once the trigger law takes effect like dodson the lawmaker said she plans to aim her attention at improving the lives of children and young mothers by creating a culture of life where abortion is unthinkable where do north dakotans stand on abortion the fate of an abortion related ballot question would hinge on north dakotans attitudes toward the issue but public opinion isn t exactly clear because most of the data points used to measure it are outdated advertisement in 2014 nearly two thirds of voters rejected a legislatively referred measure that would have amended the state constitution to include language stating that the inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development must be recognized and protected but activists don t agree on how much stock to place in the vote eight years ago jacobson who worked to oppose the measure pointed to the result as evidence that north dakotans are thoughtful voters who want access to abortion dodson said the 2014 measure was strangely worded and failed because it left voters confused the most recent reliable polling found by forum news service also came from 2014 a pew research center study found that 51 of north dakota adults believed abortion should be illegal in most or all cases while 47 thought it should be legal in all or most cases however there are some indicators that public opinion has shifted nationally toward abortion rights in the last eight years in 2014 55 of respondents to a national pew survey said abortion should be legal in all or most cases that majority grew to 61 in a survey taken earlier this year survey results published in june suggest a majority of americans disapprove of the supreme court s decision to overturn roe v wade even in states like north dakota where abortion is expected to be restricted advertisement a july poll from south dakota which is demographically and politically similar to its northern sister state found that a majority of respondents thought the state s abortion ban was too restrictive according to south dakota news watch jacobson believes that if north dakotans were given the chance to vote on abortion they will uphold abortion rights because they have in the past dodson said north dakotans election of a largely anti abortion legislature proves that most are opposed to legalizing the procedure university of north dakota political science professor mark jendrysik said he thinks there s a strong pro life majority in north dakota but an abortion rights measure could resonate with some voters who see a total ban on abortion as too harsh jendrysik said the wording of a ballot question to re legalize abortion would be critical if the measure aims to allow abortion on demand it probably won t succeed but a more modest proposal has a better chance the professor said getting on the ballot if activists on either side of the issue decide to launch an initiated measure effort they will face a steep climb to the ballot a statutory measure needs about 15 500 valid signatures to make the ballot while a constitutional measure requires about 31 000 signatures dave owen a political consultant and veteran of north dakota s ballot measure process said an abortion rights campaign would likely have to go the more onerous constitutional measure route to avoid getting overridden by the republican led legislature owen noted that he personally doesn t want to touch the abortion issue advertisement owen the leader of multiple campaigns to put marijuana legalization before voters said the cost of making a serious run at the ballot would come in around 750 000 for a constitutional measure such a campaign would need well paid petitioners senior staff liability insurance and signature verifiers dave owen chairman of marijuana legalization group new approach north dakota stands in front of 31 boxes containing signed petitions on july 11 2022 jeremy turley forum news service an abortion rights group would have difficulty finding signature gatherers due to the resentment they might receive from protesters owen said he noted that his marijuana legalization circulators had to cancel a shift one time because of protester interference circulators will be yelled at and screamed at owen said no one s going to want to work for 20 an hour an anti abortion group might have an easier time gathering signatures since they could likely gain access to church congregants more easily owen said owen believes an abortion measure on either side of the issue could make it onto the ballot in 2024 but the funding and staffing hurdles stand in the way

springdale leif kindberg executive director of the illinois river watershed partnership said he answers phone calls every week from northwest arkansas property owners saying they re seeing stormwater on their land they ve not experienced before precipitation in northwest arkansas is increasing significantly he said kindberg shared numbers recorded at lake elmdale by the u s army corps of engineers they said the average annual rainfall in springdale has risen by 10 5 inches from 2000 to 2021 he said data from the national weather service shows 41 65 inches of rain fell in 2000 at northwest arkansas national airport according to the service s website the airport recorded 51 2 inches of rain in 2021 climate change is happening agreed ben peters director of springdale s engineering department peters became head of the department aug 1 replacing brad baldwin who retired aug 20 we are seeing larger rain events and more rain falling over shorter periods of time than it used to elizabeth bowen a project manager with the northwest arkansas regional planning commission said leaders of cities and counties in the area want to develop a regional stormwater management plan the plan will call for both quantity and quality stormwater drainage management bowen said kindberg quoted regional planning s projection of 1 million people living in northwest arkansas by 2045 even with all the lots driveways roofs and infrastructure we see half of what we will need in 23 years is not built yet we need to get ahead of it and create a plan so citizens can do their very best he said the watershed partnership has under revision its own management plan for stormwater to identify sources of pollution carried by runoff into waterways in the illinois river watershed the plan also will consider using low impact design features to mitigate the runoff like riparian repair of stream banks or rain catchment systems for homeowners bowen noted and the region s cities might have to update their drainage requirements she said the developers are meeting minimum requirements kindberg said but are minimum criteria good enough what new levels do we have to meet the flow of stormwater managing peaks springdale allows no more runoff from a piece of property after its development than it had before development peters said however the total volume of water running off could increase with the same amount leaving the property in a longer span of time he said we re really managing peaks he said peaks that probably aren t happening in rivers and major creeks but more likely in small ditches and tributaries the construction engineering industry has determined rainfall formulas for developers to determine amounts of stormwater that require extra mitigation to remove peters said these include rainfall data over the last 80 years but like the stock market history does not dictate future events he noted several different formulas are approved to determine runoff levels but each measures differently peters said the difference in peak flows could be statistically insignificant or wrong by about 25 he said every developer proposing a project in springdale is required to submit to the city the results of hydrology and hydrotics surveys of the property and the development peters said the department currently works with about 80 or 85 development projects underway he said hydrology looks at the distribution of water both on and below the earth s surface as well as the impact of human activity on water availability and conditions hydrotics considers the sources of that water peters explained water flows off land in two ways concentrated and sheet concentrated flow runs off into channels ditches creeks the most common flow for subdivisions sheet flow is a shallow flow of water coming off of a wide area if sheet flow exists developers must have a sheet flow study peters said the most common practice regionally and the national norm for removing stormwater is detention ponds peters said the ponds most likely are dry until rain fills them and the water is gone in 24 to 48 hours he said it s a holding pond that limits the volume of water leaving at any one time the size of pipes in the pond s drainage or weirs which change the shape or speed of the flowing water make the difference peters said the city also offers a handbook of low impact design features a developer may use to mitigate storm drainage these can include rain barrels and stormwater catchment systems which are not commonly used because they require higher maintenance for homeowners peters said ponds or pavers springdale developer tom lundstrum does not like detention ponds he said they take up space that could be better used the parking lot at lundstrum s little emma mixed use development in downtown springdale is made of pervious pavers which let the water flow through into the ground lundstrum said we had only 3 4 acre at that site and we needed the land instead of the pond he said the design and engineering processes are continuing for lundstrum s big emma project across east emma avenue and plans for managing stormwater drainage have not been finalized he said land is still relatively cheap in northwest arkansas so developers generally don t mind the pond taking up space peters said david gilbert an engineer with plymouth engineering in lowell noted storm water management must be unique for each site each site has different runoff patterns he said gilbert worked recently with scout enterprises developers of the proposed hawksview subdivision on east brown road in the city s northwestern quadrant developers wanted to create a unique low impact community using older existing houses these houses will be moved to the site and renovated inside and out the developer proposed gravel road shoulders and gravel driveways as well as rain catchment systems to reduce runoff the planning commission did not approve the plan citing neighbors concerns about drainage city council on june 14 overturned the commission s decision and accepted the planned use development fixing it gilbert noted he also has been working with the city of elm springs to mitigate problems in the camelot subdivision he noted the subdivision was built before that city had standards in elm springs 10 years ago their attitude was build it and we ll fix it later peters said even today smaller cities do not have an engineering staff unless the city hires one on contract he said no one reviews drainage reports he said gilbert said a home builder filled in an existing drainage ditch and built a house across it he didn t take into account where it could flood gilbert said it would not be built the same way today legendary a subdivision immediately north was abandoned by the developer amid the 2008 recession that subdivision had no retention ponds gilbert said the water flowed downhill into camelot springdale helped to control the flooding in camelot immediately west of shaw family park by building extra large detention ponds in the park to control runoff gilbert said in another case the city had permitted construction for a single story house but in the middle of construction the owner decided to add a basement without planning gilbert said but that basement sat lower than the property s flood level if it s too low it will flood he said flooding problems are individual decisions gilbert said you ve got to be careful about what you do on each piece of property
but the biggest buyer is now going to become a seller threadneedle street announced this month that it will start offloading the bonds it amassed back into the market the sale will mark a slow predictable but significant shift in policy at a time of extreme market volatility the question is who if anyone is willing to pick up the tab mark capleton a uk rates strategist at bank of america says there will be buyers but only if the price is right he says demand from pension funds is likely to be limited after years of de risking in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis capleton notes that pension funds now hold less than a quarter of assets in shares down from more than 60pc before the crisis firms are already a long way along their de risking path he says that leaves banks and overseas investors the latter have been crucial to funding the uk s yawning current account deficit which at more than 8pc of gross domestic product gdp is at the worst since comparable records began in the 18th century current account deficits occur when there s more money flowing out of a country than coming in the uk has traditionally lived beyond its means by spending more and saving less this shortfall is met by what former bank of england governor mark carney described as the kindness of strangers if these overseas investors lose faith and pull their money out it could trigger a renewed drop in the value of the pound sterling has already weakened significantly against the dollar this year as the us federal reserve has continued on an aggressive path of rate hikes a survey of economists shows nobody expects the value of the pound will reach its 2021 heights of 1 38 until 2025 rohan khanna at ubs says the uk s hot jobs market and vulnerability to high energy prices has made it a petri dish for the stagflation hypothesis a toxic combination of high inflation in a declining economy this raises the clearing price for uk debt to be attractive to investors he says with more fiscal stimulus higher interest rates and the bank of england selling bonds for the average non uk investor to be willing to buy gilts they ll have to cheapen sufficiently to find that clearing price cheaper bonds means higher borrowing costs if this is a permanent shift as bank of america expects keeping a lid on price rises will be a tougher task for the uk normal policy rates tended to be much higher in the uk than in the us or the euro area before the global financial crisis says capleton inflation was well behaved but the bank needed to wave a big stick to keep it in check but not everyone is worried about britain s attractiveness to outside investors robin brooks chief economist at the institute of international finance in washington says investors burnt from tying their money up in russia are now looking for a safer bet i talk to a lot of chief investment officers who lost a lot of money in russia so now people are really nervous about countries with autocratic regimes we ve seen sizable outflows from china and democratic checks and balances are being looked at in a new light it puts democracies like the uk on a much better footing no matter how colourful the politics it s still better than the alternative
30 relative risk reduction seen in symptomatic ischemic strokes in three milvexian arms compared to placebo dose response not observed for primary study objective no fatal bleeding and no increase in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage observed in patients treated with milvexian even with all patients receiving 21 days of background dual antiplatelet therapy followed by single antiplatelet therapy data from phase 2 axiomatic tkr and ssp studies collectively demonstrate potential of milvexian in thromboembolic diseases and warrant further investigation in phase 3 studies bristol myers squibb nyse bmy in collaboration with janssen pharmaceuticals inc one of the janssen pharmaceutical companies of johnson johnson janssen today announced results from the phase 2 axiomatic ssp dose ranging study of the investigational oral factor xia fxia inhibitor milvexian which showed an approximate 30 relative risk reduction in recurrent symptomatic ischemic strokes and favorable safety profile in three arms compared to placebo when used in combination with background antiplatelet therapy in patients with an acute non cardioembolic ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack the primary objective of this study was to detect a dose response for the composite endpoint of symptomatic ischemic stroke mri detected covert brain infarction across a 16 fold dose range a dose response was not observed a relative risk reduction of approximately 30 in symptomatic ischemic stroke with milvexian was observed in patients receiving either 25 50 or 100 mg twice daily compared to placebo these data were presented today in a hot line session at the european society of cardiology esc congress 2022 early stroke recurrence after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack tia remains a significant risk despite advances in secondary prevention due to bleeding concerns there are currently no anticoagulants used when a patient suffers an acute non cardioembolic ischemic stroke however these data suggest that milvexian has potential to improve outcomes for stroke patients in clinical practice said mukul sharma m d msc frcpc director of the stroke program at mcmaster university population health research institute and hamilton health sciences i the most important factor for stroke clinicians is the ability to reduce the risk of symptomatic ischemic stroke and the axiomatic ssp study demonstrates this potential benefit with milvexian without increase of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage or fatal bleeding there was no increase in severe bleeding e g symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage versus placebo and there was no fatal bleeding in any arm of the study even with all patients on background dual antiplatelet therapy for 21 days followed by single antiplatelet therapy for the duration of the trial the rate of major bleeding for milvexian 25 mg once daily and twice daily doses was similar to placebo while a numerical increase was observed in

the patients and investigators involved in the axiomatic phase 2 clinical trials about axiomatic ssp axiomatic ssp is a phase 2 global randomized double blind placebo controlled dose ranging study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of milvexian an oral factor xia fxia inhibitor for the prevention of new symptomatic ischemic stroke or new covert brain infarction in patients receiving aspirin and clopidogrel following acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack tia the primary endpoint was the composite of new symptomatic ischemic stroke and new covert brain infarction detected by mri at day 90 a total of 2 366 patients were randomized 2 1 to receive one of five regimens of oral milvexian covering a 16 fold dose range given once or twice daily all participants received background treatment with open label aspirin and clopidogrel for 21 days followed by open label aspirin from day 22 to day 90 about axiomatic tkr axiomatic tkr was a phase 2 randomized open label parallel group dose ranging multicenter study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of milvexian an oral factor xia fxia inhibitor versus subcutaneous enoxaparin in patients undergoing elective total knee replacement tkr surgery the primary efficacy outcome was the incidence of total venous thromboembolism vte up to 14 days the principal safety outcome was any bleeding defined as the composite of major clinically relevant nonmajor and minimal bleeding a total of 1 242 patients were randomized to receive one of seven regimens of oral milvexian given twice or once daily or to receive 40 mg of subcutaneous enoxaparin once daily the assignment to milvexian or enoxaparin was open label while the milvexian dose assignment was blinded treatment was given for 10 14 days in this study milvexiandemonstrated efficacy and no increase in bleeding across doses with no major bleeds in the milvexian arms when compared with enoxaparin for postoperative vte prevention in patients undergoing

detention ponds peters said the ponds most likely are dry until rain fills them and the water is gone in 24 to 48 hours he said it s a holding pond that limits the volume of water leaving at any one time the size of pipes in the pond s drainage or weirs which change the shape or speed of the flowing water make the difference peters said the city also offers a handbook of low impact design features a developer may use to mitigate storm drainage these can include rain barrels and stormwater catchment systems which are not commonly used because they require higher maintenance for homeowners peters said ponds or pavers springdale developer tom lundstrum does not like detention ponds he said they take up space that could be better used the parking lot at lundstrum s little emma mixed use development in downtown springdale is made of pervious pavers which let the water flow through into the ground lundstrum said we had only 3 4 acre at that site and we needed the land instead of the pond he said the design and engineering processes are continuing for lundstrum s big emma project across east emma avenue and plans for managing stormwater drainage have not been finalized he said land is still relatively cheap in northwest arkansas so developers generally don t mind the pond taking up space peters said david gilbert an engineer with plymouth engineering in lowell noted storm water management must be unique for each site each site has different runoff patterns he said gilbert worked recently with scout enterprises developers of the proposed hawksview subdivision on east brown road in the city s northwestern quadrant developers wanted to create a unique low impact community using older existing houses these houses will be moved to the site and renovated inside and out the developer proposed gravel road shoulders and gravel driveways as well as rain catchment systems to reduce runoff the planning commission did not approve the plan citing neighbors concerns about drainage city council on june 14 overturned the commission s decision and accepted the planned use development fixing it gilbert noted he also has been working with the city of elm springs to mitigate problems in the camelot subdivision he noted the subdivision was built before that city had standards in elm springs 10 years ago their attitude was build it and we ll fix it later peters said even today smaller cities do not have an engineering staff unless the city hires one on contract he said no one reviews drainage reports he said gilbert said a home builder filled in an existing drainage ditch and built a house across it he didn t take into account where it could flood gilbert said it would not be built the same way today legendary a subdivision immediately north was abandoned by the developer amid the 2008 recession that subdivision had no retention ponds gilbert said the water flowed downhill into camelot springdale helped to control the flooding in camelot immediately west of shaw family park by building extra large detention ponds in the park to control runoff gilbert said in another case the city had permitted construction for a single story house but in the middle of construction the owner decided to add a basement without planning gilbert said but that basement sat lower than the property s flood level if it s too low it will flood he said flooding problems are individual decisions gilbert said you ve got to be careful about what you do on each piece of property
by david randall new york reuters the 10 7 rally in the s p 500 from its june lows is stumbling as it runs into what has historically been the toughest month for the u s stock market sparking nerves among some fund managers of a broad sell off in september the s p has been in a bear market since plummeting early this year as investors priced in the expectation of aggressive federal reserve interest rate hikes but the index has rallied strongly since june regaining half its losses for the year that rebound has been fueled by a combination of strong earnings from bellwether companies and signs that inflation might have peaked potentially allowing the fed to slow rate hikes but as investors and traders return from summer holidays some are nervous about a bumpier ride in september due to seasonal concerns and nervousness about the fed s pace of hikes and their economic impact the s p 500 fell nearly 3 4 friday after fed chair jerome powell reiterated the central bank s commitment to taming inflation despite a possible recession these are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain powell said in a closely watched speech in jackson hole wyoming september typically is a down month for the stock market because fund managers tend to sell underperforming positions as the end of the third quarter approaches according to the stock trader s almanac we ve had a breathtaking run and i wouldn t be shocked if the market takes a hit here said jack janasiewicz lead portfolio strategist at natixis investment management solutions the s p 500 could fall as much as 10 in september as investors price in the likelihood that the fed will not start to cut rates as early as some had hoped janasiewicz said september has been the worst month for the s p 500 since 1945 with the index advancing only 44 of the time the least of any month according to cfra data the s p 500 has posted an average loss of 0 6 in september the worst for any month the index is down 14 8 year to date and has been in a bear market hitting its lowest level in june since december 2020 after the fed announced its largest rate hike since 1994 chief among the reasons for the gloomy outlook is a belief that the fed will continue hiking rates and keep them above neutral longer than markets had anticipated as recently as a week ago weighing on consumer demand and the housing market nearly half of market participants now expect the fed funds rate to end the year above 3 7 by the end of the year up from 40 a week ago according to the cme fedwatch tool the fed funds rate is currently between 2 25 and 2 5 the sept 20 21 fomc meeting will also likely drive volatility during the month prompting the s p 500 to fall near its june lows said sam stovall chief investment strategist at cfra ahead of that will be critical economic data such as a reading on consumer prices that will give investors more insight into whether inflation has peaked the strong rally since june however suggests the index will continue to rebound through december stovall said while we might end up retesting the june low history says that we will not set a new low he said while fund managers as a whole remain bearish the ratio of bulls to bears has improved since july reducing the likelihood of outsized gains in the months ahead according to bank of america survey released aug 16 the bank s clients were net sellers of u s equities last week for the first time in eight weeks suggesting that investors are growing more defensive the bank said at the same time the use of leverage by hedge funds a proxy for their willingness to take risk has stabilized since june and is near the lowest level since march 2020 according to goldman sachs investors may rotate into technology and other growth stocks that can take market share despite an economic slowdown said tiffany wade senior portfolio manager at columbia threadneedle investments who is overweight mega cap stocks like amazon com inc and microsoft corp we expect the pullback will start with some of the riskier names that have run up a lot since june she said reporting by david randall editing by megan davies and chizu nomiyama and richard chang
jakarta aug 28 xinhua a decline in the u s economy will significantly impact the global economy particularly the developing economies an indonesian economist has said as the u s real gross domestic product has contracted for two consecutive quarters josua pardede chief economist at indonesia s permata bank told xinhua in a recent interview that the u s economy has shown signs of declining some components of the u s economy like consumption have contracted making inflation surge to its highest point in over four decades said the economist he also said the expectation of a u s recession in the next 12 months will be much higher as higher inflation followed by higher interest rates will lead to lower consumption and lower investments the shock in the u s economy will slow down the global economy and the global trade volume will be also declining he said noting the export performance of indonesia and other developing countries will go down since the united states is their main trading partner he suggested that developing countries including indonesia should mitigate or offset the impact from the slowdown in u s demand by finding other trading partners strengthening the fundamentals of its domestic economy and spurring domestic consumption when there is a recession in the united states risk averse sentiment will rise he pointed out adding such sentiment will lead to capital outflow from the financial market particularly in the bond market foreign ownership of indonesian government bonds has declined around 7 8 billion u s dollars so basically this leads to a weaker rupiah against the u s dollar the economist said he further said the governments and central banks of developing countries need to take measures to stabilize the currency exchange rate
commentary u s stock markets tumbled more than 3 percent on aug 26 after federal reserve chairman jerome powell offered up a stark eight minute soliloquy telling wall street s masters of the universe to straighten up fast because the fed wasn t going to refill the punch bowl i said in my july jobs report that the prognostications of the stock peddlers cum analysts on business tv were a bit sanguine that the fed will loosen its tightening of rates and predicted the overnight federal funds rate would need to go up to as much as 5 percent to strangle inflation powell seemed to reiterate that hawkish view on aug 26 when he said that the fed is moving policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent he went on to say in current circumstances with inflation running far above 2 percent and the labor market extremely tight estimates of longer run neutral are not a place to stop or pause game set match the wall street pitchmen who were anticipating the fed would let up rate hikes have been mowed down like dandelions in the path of a weed whacker more rate hikes and likely above a half percent are coming when the fed meets in september and will not likely pause for some time federal open market committee members june 15 projections for the federal funds rate capped at 4 percent through the end of 2023 those projections will be updated for september but powell made another statement that should send chills down the backs of the wall street stock pushers while acknowledging the role of supply chain issues in inflation powell said in my view the current high inflation in the united states is the product of strong demand and constrained supply and that the fed s tools work principally on aggregate demand none of this diminishes the federal reserve s responsibility to carry out our assigned task of achieving price stability the reason that should trouble wall street is that it seems an almost masochistic acceptance by the fed chair of responsibility to restrain even supply side inflationary pressures but those pressures are caused by u s federal state and foreign policies that constrain supplies for example the biden administration s constraint of oil and gas production and its sanctions against russia over the ukraine invasion have all radically escalated inflation in fuel and food in the northeast we in new york state have lived for years with critical moratoriums on fracking and new pipeline construction in favor of green policies that favor electricity over natural gas similarly china s ongoing zero tolerance pandemic policies have limited production in and exports from huge swaths of its economy i have written ad nauseam about as regular followers will aver milton friedman s adage that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon my essays have also acknowledged the quantity theory of money mv pq but if powell views constraining even supply side inflation as exclusively his task as seems clear from his remarks on aug 26 consumers will suffer far more than they must and at a critical time for working people and middle income americans the caption for his illustration on the new york fed website says that credit card debt had increased at its highest rate year on year in 20 years household debt new york federal reserve bank right now tens of millions of u s households are putting their daily cost of living expenses on their credit cards because wage growth has failed to keep up with inflation household debt now exceeds 16 trillion with a t 70 percent of the u s economy and nearly 4 5 trillion of that is consumer debt twenty million american households 15 percent of them are risking a tsunami of shutoffs as an expert quoted by bloomberg called it because they can t afford their utility bills which have increased an average of 15 percent over last year meanwhile the biden administration is raising taxes hiring tens of thousands of new irs agents who will reduce productivity already the lowest on record by diverting business owners and workers attention from their businesses and fueling the fire of inflation with new spending and student debt forgiveness meanwhile the yield curve between the 10 year and the 2 year treasury is inverted by 35 basis points bps with the return on the 10 year long money being less than the return on the short term rate that occurs because the market has cut back from investment in businesses favoring treasury obligations instead of private investment for this reason an inverted yield curve is almost a guarantee of recession or worse i ve advocated a reduction in the fed balance sheet and targeting longer term rates what economists call yield curve control for quite some time as a better means of means of tightening the money supply raising longer term rates and reversing yield curve inversion as the best monetary policy i believe that while this would inflict pain on the economy particularly in the housing and capital investment markets it s a quicker and more efficient means of ameliorating inflation and particularly inflation expectations than periodic increases in the federal funds rate notwithstanding powell s seeming embrace of the sisyphean chore of what he calls the federal reserve s responsibility to carry out our assigned task of achieving price stability the only actual true function the fed has and the only mandate for which it has tools is monetary policy the fed for all its good intentions can t control a spendthrift congress or a failing white house administration bent upon using the president s executive powers to enhance its political prospects in the midterms the fed shouldn t attempt to do anything more doing so only spooks the markets unnecessarily as it did on aug 26 and eventually harms consumers and businesses
the official verdict is the u s is not in a recession the traditional standard definition of a recession has been met textbooks define a recession as two consecutive quarters of negative gdp growth gdp is gross domestic product and is the total monetary or market value of finished goods and services produced within a country s borders in a specific period of time the u s gdp decreased at an annual rate of 1 6 in the first quarter of 2022 and decreased 9 in the second quarter thus meeting the typical definition of a recession however a u s recession is only official when the national bureau of economic research nber declares a recession nber is an american non profit private research organization and they are the unbiased organization that declares when the economy is or is not in a recession nber defines a recession as a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months given gdp reports what s stopping nber from declaring a recession first recessions are usually called late after they have already started the same is true of bull and bear markets outside the u s two declining quarters of gdp growth means recession in the united states nber also looks at employment output and household income let s start with u s employment one of the main reasons nber doesn t believe we are in a recession is the health of the labor market in a typical recession the number of unemployed workers rises the unemployed find it harder to find new jobs and the average length of unemployment increases u s job growth has shown an acceleration in july 2022 the unemployment rate fell to 3 5 from 3 6 in june and the average hourly earnings rose 5 or 5 2 year over year labor market strength is allowing the federal reserve to continue raising interest rates to stem inflation and is stopping nber from calling a recession nber may not declare a recession but the economy is slowing as gdp portrays when the federal reserve raises interest rates as the economy is slowing recessions tend to follow another indication of a forthcoming recession is an inverted yield curve in a normal economic environment the longer you lend someone your money the more interest they will pay you the lender is paid for the risk a longer time frame entails however in recent months the interest rate on short term treasuries bonds issued by the u s government were higher than the 10 year yield this happens because the federal reserve has more power over short term rates than long term rates thus when the federal reserve tightens raises interest rates it can lead to higher rates on the short term part of the curve the yield curve has inverted 28 times and in 22 of those times a recession followed therefore an inverted yield curve precedes recessions but does not guarantee one the chances are increasing that we will see a recession global growth is slowing and the federal reserve continues to fight inflation by raising the interest rates this slows our economy the small business optimism index is at record lows and many americans believe the u s economy is in a recession according to a i i tipp poll the good news is that given the employment climate a u s recession is expected to be shallow stocks are also a leading indicator and typically start an upward trend within the first six months of a recession all investing is subject to risk including possible loss of the money you invest nothing in this article should be construed as investment or retirement advice always consult with a professional advisor and consider your risk tolerance and time to invest when making investment decisions review your personal situation with a professional before planning any gifting or estate planning judy loy is a registered investment advisor chfc ricp and ceo of nestlerode loy inc in state college
bismarck with abortion likely to be outlawed in north dakota activists on both sides of the divisive issue are mapping out their next moves it s a long road to 2024 most agree but the next election year could prove pivotal in the future of abortion access last week a bismarck judge temporarily blocked an abortion ban from taking effect in the state but a trigger law passed by lawmakers in 2007 dictates that the procedure should become illegal with the supreme court s decision to overturn roe v wade elsewhere in the great plains kansans voted earlier this month to shoot down a proposed constitutional amendment that would have removed abortion protections abortion rights advocates see the result in the conservative leaning state as a sign that the public favors open access to the procedure voters in at least four other states including montana will respond to questions on abortion during november s general election but in north dakota it s too late for any abortion related measures to end up on the ballot some north dakota abortion rights activists have begun to think about mounting a ballot measure campaign in 2024 to re legalize the procedure if it becomes prohibited advertisement prairie action north dakota director amy jacobson told forum news service members of her progressive organization have spoken about a possible ballot measure but she noted that the first priority is keeping an eye on conservative lawmakers that could further restrict reproductive rights during next year s legislative session jacobson the former state director of planned parenthood said she and like minded activists couldn t even begin an initiated measure campaign for about a year but it s important to continue conversations about what a ballot measure could look like on the other side of the issue anti abortion lawmakers and advocates say they are not eying a ballot measure to cement abortion restrictions in the state constitution north dakota catholic conference director christopher dodson said he doesn t see why such a constitutional amendment would be necessary if state law contained an abortion ban the consensus among pro life leaders nationally is to let the new abortion laws settle down to focus on programs for women and children and to see what the abortion rights side does next dodson said state sen janne myrdal an edinburg republican and fervent abortion opponent told forum news service she hasn t heard any rumblings about a lawmaker led effort to directly place an anti abortion constitutional measure on the ballot sen janne myrdal r edinburg speaks on the senate floor on monday march 29 2021 jeremy turley forum news service myrdal said she thinks north dakota will have some of the best abortion laws in the country once the trigger law takes effect like dodson the lawmaker said she plans to aim her attention at improving the lives of children and young mothers by creating a culture of life where abortion is unthinkable where do north dakotans stand on abortion the fate of an abortion related ballot question would hinge on north dakotans attitudes toward the issue but public opinion isn t exactly clear because most of the data points used to measure it are outdated advertisement in 2014 nearly two thirds of voters rejected a legislatively referred measure that would have amended the state constitution to include language stating that the inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development must be recognized and protected but activists don t agree on how much stock to place in the vote eight years ago jacobson who worked to oppose the measure pointed to the result as evidence that north dakotans are thoughtful voters who want access to abortion dodson said the 2014 measure was strangely worded and failed because it left voters confused the most recent reliable polling found by forum news service also came from 2014 a pew research center study found that 51 of north dakota adults believed abortion should be illegal in most or all cases while 47 thought it should be legal in all or most cases however there are some indicators that public opinion has shifted nationally toward abortion rights in the last eight years in 2014 55 of respondents to a national pew survey said abortion should be legal in all or most cases that majority grew to 61 in a survey taken earlier this year survey results published in june suggest a majority of americans disapprove of the supreme court s decision to overturn roe v wade even in states like north dakota where abortion is expected to be restricted advertisement a july poll from south dakota which is demographically and politically similar to its northern sister state found that a majority of respondents thought the state s abortion ban was too restrictive according to south dakota news watch jacobson believes that if north dakotans were given the chance to vote on abortion they will uphold abortion rights because they have in the past dodson said north dakotans election of a largely anti abortion legislature proves that most are opposed to legalizing the procedure university of north dakota political science professor mark jendrysik said he thinks there s a strong pro life majority in north dakota but an abortion rights measure could resonate with some voters who see a total ban on abortion as too harsh jendrysik said the wording of a ballot question to re legalize abortion would be critical if the measure aims to allow abortion on demand it probably won t succeed but a more modest proposal has a better chance the professor said getting on the ballot if activists on either side of the issue decide to launch an initiated measure effort they will face a steep climb to the ballot a statutory measure needs about 15 500 valid signatures to make the ballot while a constitutional measure requires about 31 000 signatures dave owen a political consultant and veteran of north dakota s ballot measure process said an abortion rights campaign would likely have to go the more onerous constitutional measure route to avoid getting overridden by the republican led legislature owen noted that he personally doesn t want to touch the abortion issue advertisement owen the leader of multiple campaigns to put marijuana legalization before voters said the cost of making a serious run at the ballot would come in around 750 000 for a constitutional measure such a campaign would need well paid petitioners senior staff liability insurance and signature verifiers dave owen chairman of marijuana legalization group new approach north dakota stands in front of 31 boxes containing signed petitions on july 11 2022 jeremy turley forum news service an abortion rights group would have difficulty finding signature gatherers due to the resentment they might receive from protesters owen said he noted that his marijuana legalization circulators had to cancel a shift one time because of protester interference circulators will be yelled at and screamed at owen said no one s going to want to work for 20 an hour an anti abortion group might have an easier time gathering signatures since they could likely gain access to church congregants more easily owen said owen believes an abortion measure on either side of the issue could make it onto the ballot in 2024 but the funding and staffing hurdles stand in the way
phippsburg nicole palmatier waded into the ocean at popham beach state park with her children as they talked and laughed they were on vacation from western new york and knew of the increase in great white shark sightings along the maine coast they read the large warning signs on their way into the beach but still wanted to enjoy the water safely we never swim that deep said palmatier who has been visiting popham beach since she was a child we just go out far enough where there are waves we re mindful not to swim out too far not to wear a wetsuit we re not hoping to see one they are dangerous popham beach along with nearby seguin and hermit islands along maine s midcoast has been a focal point of great white shark activity in maine since the state started monitoring the species two years ago swimmers have taken stock and are staying closer to shore patrick sabo of corinth has been going to popham for 35 years with his family he s already been six times this year sabo was never much of an ocean swimmer he said and he s less likely to venture beyond the surf now it seems to him that others are no longer venturing far from shore either you go to the beach now and it s a different feel sabo said in mid august i was there this weekend and there were only four to five people in the deeper stuff it seems to me there were a lot more people doing that before maine is one of several states on the east coast that have seen an increase in great white shark sightings satellite detections of tagged sharks and even shark attacks on swimmers and beach goers are adapting in maine and on cape cod in massachusetts many people are finding ways to enjoy a cool dip without going into the high surf advertisement there are sightings of white sharks all the way from the florida keys all the way up to passamaquoddy bay said john chisholm a former massachusetts shark biologist of 28 years vigilance increases after attacks vigilance about white sharks has heightened since maine s first and only documented fatal shark attack in 2020 the attack occurred off the peninsula next to popham beach on bailey island where summer resident julie dimperio holowach was swimming 20 yards from shore in a wetsuit similarly behaviors began to change on cape cod after two shark attacks on swimmers in 2018 including massachusetts first fatal shark attack in 80 years in wellfleet as a result town officials said swimmers became more respectful of lifeguards calls to clear the water it was hard for a couple of years people realized they had to pay attention to it some resented it said suzanne grout thomas wellfleet s director of community service but i think people are much more comfortable with the reality now and are still able to enjoy themselves even while they are aware there might be possible shark activity i think people are grateful they can go in the water at all and they appreciate the oversight on cape cod several beaches have registered numerous shark sightings or detections this summer via the sharktivity app operated by the atlantic white shark conservancy in chatham massachusetts which provides information about the location of great white sharks to help keep the public safe advertisement north beach island in chatham had at least a dozen confirmed reports of white sharks between july 13 and aug 15 nauset beach farther up the cape had nine white shark reports and one beach closure during the same period there were eight beach closures at two beaches in wellfleet in less than a month because of white shark detections chisholm who now works for the new england aquarium and is the administrator of the conservancy s app said because of the app and the social media reports that result from it swimmers on the cape have learned to enjoy the ocean while maintaining a healthy respect for the sharks that live there but chisholm worries about beach goers in maine one of the things that got to me was how many people were unaware that the sharks in cape cod don t always stay in cape cod they travel all the way up to canada historically they always did and just a fraction of the white sharks get tagged chisholm said residents on the cape say there is not only a greater awareness of great white sharks but also a growing interest in them i think people definitely have respect for them they were here first said aliya bornstein who works at tale of the cod gift shop in chatham it s kind of become a symbol for cape cod i think people are fascinated by the species it s been here so long one widely held misconception chisholm said is that white sharks do not swim close to shore the sharktivity app has reported white sharks on the cape swimming 50 feet off shore chisholm said they get as close as 25 feet it s where white sharks hunt seals that try to escape predation by hauling out on beaches advertisement you re sharing habitat with an apex predator you can still go to the beach and even go in the water as long as you take appropriate precautions chisholm said on long island new york there have been six confirmed shark attacks on swimmers this summer at state beaches none resulting in death said stephanie rekemeyer with the new york department of environmental conservation by comparison there were only 14 non fatal shark attacks in the previous 100 years she said rekemeyer said the abundance of atlantic menhaden off the coast of long island may be the reason why because sharks chase the bait fish lifeguards at some beaches this year are using drones or helicopters to identify white sharks near shore in maine the state department of marine resources has recorded at least 35 confirmed white shark reports this year in the form of sightings wounded mammals with signs of shark bites witnessed predation events and sharks detected via satellite tags said matt davis a state shark biologist the 35 reports confirmed through wednesday spanned the coast from kittery to passamaquoddy bay several were in casco bay notably between chebeague island and harpswell but there were plenty around popham pemaquid and rockland and farther south around the kennebunks it s unknown how close white sharks in maine have come to shore but historical accounts prove they will chase prey into very shallow water davis said advertisement at lewis farm on the road to popham beach celina del castillo lewis said the tourists who frequent her farm stand all ask about the sharks it has definitely changed the experience the idea is to just be careful don t go too close my grandchildren are afraid del castillo lewis said the shark is always in the conversation but there are more events going on at the beach and that brings people together yoga concerts it s beautiful people can still enjoy the beach many locals love to swim in the ocean said kate thompson who works at bisson s center store on the road to popham beach but thompson said most swim parallel to the beach most of us know that there are sharks in the ocean and we have been aware of that they follow the seals thompson said people still swim you just don t want to be out too deep even though the sharks are not looking for people they are looking for the seals send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

form factor refrigerators come with top freezers bottom freezers french doors and in side by side models the most popular one now is french doors noyes said adding that the debate about which style is best can be polarizing counter depth or standard depth counter depth is fashionable but standard depth will give you more space with a 36 inch refrigerator for instance you ll lose about 5 cubic feet with counter depth the equivalent of six to seven gallons of milk noyes said check the shelving configuration does it suit your grocery habits factor in door water and ice some people think these features are prone to break but noyes said that s not the case with newer models think about technology a wi fi connected smart refrigerator is noyes said kind of cool a smart fridge can ping your

reading time 4 minutes the 10 7 rally in the s p 500 spx from its june lows is stumbling as it runs into what has historically been the toughest month for the u s stock market sparking nerves among some fund managers of a broad sell off in september the s p has been in a bear market since plummeting early this year as investors priced in the expectation of aggressive federal reserve interest rate hikes but the index has rallied strongly since june regaining half its losses for the year that rebound has been fuelled by a combination of strong earnings from bellwether companies and signs that inflation might have peaked potentially allowing the fed to slow rate hikes as investors and traders return from summer holidays some are nervous about a bumpier ride in september due to seasonal concerns and nervousness about the fed s pace of hikes and their economic impact the s p 500 fell nearly 3 4 friday after fed chair jerome powell reiterated the central bank s commitment to taming inflation despite a possible recession these are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain powell said in a closely watched speech in jackson hole wyoming september typically is a down month for the stock market because fund managers tend to sell underperforming positions as the end of the third quarter approaches according to the stock trader s almanac we ve had a breathtaking run and i wouldn t be shocked if the market takes a hit here said jack janasiewicz lead portfolio strategist at natixis investment management solutions the s p 500 could fall as much as 10 in september as investors price in the likelihood that the fed will not start to cut rates as early as some had hoped janasiewicz said september has been the worst month for the s p 500 since 1945 with the index advancing only 44 of the time the least of any month according to cfra data the s p 500 has posted an average loss of 0 6 in september the worst for any month the index is down 14 8 year to date and has been in a bear market hitting its lowest level in june since december 2020 after the fed announced its largest rate hike since 1994 chief among the reasons for the gloomy outlook is a belief that the fed will continue hiking rates and keep them above neutral longer than markets had anticipated as recently as a week ago weighing on consumer demand and the housing market nearly half of market participants now expect the fed funds rate to end the year above 3 7 by the end of the year up from 40 a week ago according to the cme fedwatch tool fedwatch the fed funds rate is currently between 2 25 and 2 5 the sept 20 21 fomc meeting will also likely drive volatility during the month prompting the s p 500 to fall near its june lows said sam stovall chief investment strategist at cfra ahead of that will be critical economic data such as a reading on consumer prices that will give investors more insight into whether inflation has peaked the strong rally since june however suggests the index will continue to rebound through december stovall said while we might end up retesting the june low history says that we will not set a new low he said while fund managers as a whole remain bearish the ratio of bulls to bears has improved since july reducing the likelihood of outsized gains in the months ahead according to bank of america survey released aug 16 the bank s clients were net sellers of u s equities last week for the first time in eight weeks suggesting that investors are growing more defensive the bank said at the same time the use of leverage by hedge funds a proxy for their willingness to take risk has stabilized since june and is near the lowest level since march 2020 according to goldman sachs investors may rotate into technology and other growth stocks that can take market share despite an economic slowdown said tiffany wade senior portfolio manager at columbia threadneedle investments who is overweight mega cap stocks like amazon com inc and microsoft we expect the pullback will start with some of the riskier names that have run up a lot since june she added

the 90 degree plus days that week dream on equipment failures at the worst possible time are a recurrent theme in my kitchen several years ago a few hours before guests were due to arrive for the thanksgiving feast my oven went bust a decade before that you could have found me in my kitchen on a sunday morning in texas despairing as i peered into the oven at a pan of labor intensive sticky buns mid bake brunch guests expected at any moment a transformer down the block had blown and my oven was temporary collateral damage this summer it was the refrigerator and its timing was again impeccable it failed in the middle of a record breaking heat wave and two days before i had to drive to new york to pick up my 93 year old mother for her annual getaway in maine given its age 24 years fixing it was pointless i learned after some quick calling around according to the experts my kitchenaid refrigerator was both an energy hog and an old man as i frantically tried to finish up work ahead of a week off and ready the house for my mother tripping hazards removed nightlights secured rugs taped down and door to the cellar with steep staircase taped shut drugstore items purchased

refrigerator was operating with the merest suggestion of cool more visitors lay in my immediate future lee who would be housesitting while i attended a family reunion and katharina who would be coming to visit from germany with her teenage twins how was i to manage any of this without a working refrigerator over the next couple of days i frantically made blts for lunch and smoked salmon omelets for breakfast i baked scones to try to use up the butter tossing in chopped meant to be frozen cranberries with the same idea some of the soured milk went into pancakes but this race against time was a losing proposition quickly inevitably i began chucking spoilt food into my compost bin out went the lobster shells and vegetable peelings i d been saving for stock the once frozen haddock and ground pork the lemons the rhubarb from my garden the dinner leftovers and a couple of quarts of milk as for the pickles sesame oil pomegranate molasses and the dozens of other small jars of this and that that at one time or another i had apparently considered essential kitchen supplies i just hoped they could survive their newly coolish environment my neighbor jen solved my immediate problem she invited me to store a few necessities in her refrigerator while my mother visited i heaved a sigh of relief and on saturday morning my partner and i headed south on the long hot drive to fetch mom

the federal government s efforts to stanch inflation are disproportionately impacting black americans the federal reserve has hiked interest rates in the hopes of cooling off a red hot economy but its actions are hitting black americans who have historically been squeezed out of home ownership and affordable loans the hardest fed interest rate hikes are meant to slow consumer and business spending by making debt more expensive including mortgages mortgage rates rise as the fed hikes its baseline interest rate higher making monthly home payments more expensive for anyone seeking a new home or those who purchased one with an adjustable interest rate loan african americans have the lowest homeownership rates among the four major racial groups in the country romie tribble professor of economics at spelman college and secretary of the national economic association told the hill just 45 3 percent of black households owned their homes during the second quarter of 2022 according to the census bureau compared to 74 6 percent of white households 61 1 percent of asian households and 48 3 percent of hispanic households it s now going to be more difficult for them to acquire and to also keep a home tribble said black americans have long faced higher barriers to homeownership than their white counterparts which is one of several forces behind a steep racial wealth gap during the post world war ii economic boom racist lending practices and bans on home sales to non white families locked millions of minority families out of the housing market while congress passed laws intended to halt discriminatory lending practices during the 1970s discrimination in the housing market still persists and the racial wealth gap created in part by housing discrimination has left black families with fewer resources to help achieve homeownership for many black homeowners interest rates are already often higher than their white counterparts regardless of income according to a 2021 harvard university study this is in part because black homeowners are seen as a bigger financial risk than white homeowners combined with the short supply of housing around the country tribble said these concerns all exacerbate housing inequities while higher interest rates are likely to take a steeper toll on black americans the decades of near zero rates meant to help low and middle income households shore up their finances were not as helpful for them experts say the fed slashed its baseline interest rate range to near zero levels in the wake of 2007 08 financial crisis to help keep money flowing through the economy the central bank held rates near zero until 2015 and only hiked them gradually in the years that followed ultra low fed interest rates in the wake of both the great recession and the covid 19 recession helped fuel record breaking home prices as households with means to keep up enjoyed low mortgage rates homeowners were also able to refinance their mortgages at lower rates giving them more money to save up for the next home purchase but those super low rates did little to help black americans without homes and others on the margins of the housing market all while pushing home prices even higher the fed through that period argued that ultra low interest rates supported household wealth by virtue of allowing people with homes to reduce their cost of housing with refinancing and therefore improve their wealth position but that turned out not to be anywhere near as true for low and moderate income people particularly minorities said karen shaw petrou author of engine of inequality the fed and the future of wealth in america we ve now had 22 years of policies that make it harder for lower and moderate income households especially those of color to be homeowners but even for those who don t have mortgage payments high interest rates have led to the continued practice of banks offering predatory credit lines for black americans many african americans don t participate in the stock market said sharif muhammad ceo of unlimited financial group inc and board member of the association of african american financial advisor meaning whatever cash they do have doesn t have high growth prospects during a normal rate of inflation but now when we re in this hyperinflationary environment purchase power is even more profound said muhammad but a lack of financial literacy leads to consumers spending more and buying on credit more too the problem is muhammad said banks are capitalizing on that lack of knowledge by providing credit to unsuspecting african american communities who then use it as an extension of their purchase power rather than seeing it as an actual borrowing of money and when the interest rates hit muhammad said it becomes a double whammy your money is not growing because you re keeping it in a savings account or cash and not properly investing it he explained and then you re out there spending money using credit cards that are growing at almost usury level rates and compounding on a daily basis the impact of these high interest rates seep outside the home too and into businesses for many small business owners the pandemic deeply affected their ability to stay afloat and black owned businesses suffered the most now even as the country moves into post pandemic times the struggle to recover persists on average black owned businesses already pay 1 4 percent more in interest than white owned businesses according to the u s department of commerce s minority business development agency with interest rate increases the cost of borrowing goes up as well most of these small businesses operate with working capital or capital accessible to banks said tribble for a small restaurant rising interest rates in working capital means either i m going to have to cut back on employees or i m going have to cut back on the hours that i m open said tribble which in turn exacerbates racial disparities in unemployment black americans face higher unemployment than whites at every level of education according to the associated press and despite the seemingly good job market muhammad points out the jobs numbers are a lagging indicator that won t accurately reflect job retention until the next month still tribble advises black americans to try to hold on to their jobs i know that prices are really difficult he said i know that people in the low income category are having to make hard choices the limited money and limited funds that we have we ve just got to use them more efficiently than ever before muhammad also had advice get aggressive paying down debt he also added that now could be a good time to take advantage of investment opportunities and meeting with experts for those who may be bracing for a potential layoff he said this will allow them to ensure they have a rainy day war chest sit down with an advisor to really look at your tax situation and see if there s anything in the provisions for the new tax laws that you re not currently taking advantage of he advised for the latest news weather sports and streaming video head to the hill

species traded were considered to be at high risk of global extinction based on the iucn red list global assessments according to inquiries cited in the report made on shark markets in dubai in 2014 where most of the sharks fished in oman are initially exported to sharks waiting to head to the uae dubai has become a regional crossroads in the trade of sharks according to rima jabado a lebanese biologist sebastian castelier mee three hours away by truck from musandam governorate dubai is a gateway to the world for the omani fishermen dubai became during the last 15 years a regional market and a crossroads for the exports of the countries of the gulf cooperation council gcc the middle east africa and europe the report states most of the sharks caught in the middle east end up in hong kong sebastian castelier mee but the united arab emirates is only an exporting hub towards the ground zero of shark fins hong kong yes most of the fins produced in the middle east arrive at hong kong especially those from oman or yemen says gary stokes 45 director of the asia desk at sea shepherd conservation society a non profit marine conservation organisation based in washington a few years ago a trader admitted to me that it was via the aircraft company emirates that his shark fins were imported to hong kong i called emirates with this information to challenge them about their responsibility in this they answered that they did not transport sharks fins but the truth is they do not know what there really is in the boxes registered as seafood stokes added in response to the allegations a spokesperson from emirates airline told mee by e mail that the transportation of all shark fins has been banned on emirates skycargo flights since june 2013 emirates doesn t transport sharks from oman and all fish shipments must receive a certificate from oman s ministry of fisheries before they are accepted for carriage so there can be no risk of illegal shipments the emirates spokesperson said we work closely with the united for wildlife transport taskforce and we are committed to preventing the transportation of illegal wildlife and wildlife products foreign workers employed to repair fishing nets for omani fishermen take a short break on dibba beach sebastian castelier mee alan chan information assistant at the agriculture fisheries and conservation department of hong kong confirmed to mee that in 2015 and 2016 20 and 26 tonnes of shark fins of cites listed species under cites permits were imported respectively mainly from australia and central america in oman shark fishing can be a sensitive subject and fishermen remain powerful any bans or changes in legislation to regulate catches or even gear directly impacts the fishermen and their families especially in remote coastal areas where fisheries are a source of subsistence jabado says in the region fishermen are particularly strong because of the cultural role fisheries play and the fact that government would like to see this sector develop several sources interviewed by mee who asked to remain anonymous for safety reasons and are opposed to the fishing of sharks in oman spoke about facing violence and intimidation from the local authorities after attempted enquiries about the trade i am a fisherman i have a speedboat in the harbour to fish tuna king fish sharks and various other species says hossein ali muhammad saadi on the beach at dibba sebastian castelier mee christophe chellapermal the french owner of a diving club in dibba oman believed for a long time that he could convince the omani authorities and fishermen to move their businesses towards a solution involving tourism instead of shark fishing we went on spots with steven surina a tour guide specialising in providing experiences of diving with sharks but found nothing there is no longer anything under the water confirms abdellah mohammed ali al dahouri 70 a descendant of one of the most famous fishing families in the region uae based fish traders look at the day s catch in dibba harbour on this day about 150 sharks were captured by local fishermen sebastian castelier mee this dearth of sharks presents difficulties for musandam as the income generated by shark fishing is hugely important to the local economy and society however as chellapermal says with a sigh a living shark is worth one thousand times more than a dead shark sharks caught by local fishermen at the port of dibba waiting to be sold to traders based in the uae sebastian castelier mee

china has reached a point of no return in its battle to contain what could be the biggest property crash the world has ever seen experts believe creating a perilous moment for the country s communist leadership and the global economy as western countries stand on the edge of a potentially ruinous recession in the coming year china is also facing a slump thanks to total collapse of confidence among ordinary people in the once buoyant housing market the continued ravages of beijing s draconian zero covid strategy and an extreme heatwave that is affecting the supply of power and food alarm is spreading in china that tough times are on the horizon with the chief executive of huawei ren zhengfei causing a sensation this week when he warned that the chill from economic downturn would be felt by everyone for the next decade view image in fullscreen president xi jinping arrives for the opening session of the chinese people s political consultative conference in beijing march photograph carlos garcía rawlins reuters but just as it has become impossible for president xi jinping to u turn on the mass lockdowns that have stunted economic activity it also appears increasingly unlikely that he and his politburo will reverse the crackdown on reckless lending in the property market that has led to a 40 fall in the sale of homes this year the chinese housing market has driven growth for the past two decades and now represents the biggest asset class in the world with a notional value of between 55tn 47tn and 60tn which is bigger than the total capitalisation of the us stock market now developers are going bust after being deprived of easy credit prices are falling homeowners are refusing to pay mortgages on unfinished homes and the slump in properties being sold and construction is crippling local governments that rely on land sales for income view image in fullscreen a woman rides a motorbike next to a construction site in beijing this month photograph wu hao epa gabriel wildau a china expert at the global advisory firm teneo says beijing faces a crunch moment over whether to reverse the crackdown on lending or double down in its attempts to tame the beast of unproductive construction activity that has resulted in the emergence of ghost towns and airports as well as roads to nowhere the government faces a hard choice but it s like zero covid they have come so far they can t turn back because then it looks like a misjudgment or policy error wildau said this is where the rubber hits the road they want more hi tech growth and they don t want as much real estate but what replaces that there s been a total collapse of confidence in the housing market no industry can survive that trying to reinvigorate the economy was the focus of a huge package of measures unveiled by beijing in the past week including 300bn yuan 37bn in new infrastructure spending and an extension of borrowing to local governments worth 500bn yuan economists said the stimulus was expected and may not make much impact in an economy already awash with investment funding what is needed they say is for chinese households to have more cash in their hands to rebalance the economy away from the tired old investment model however such policies are politically difficult because they threaten the established order of powerful party cadres centralised state owned enterprises and local government panjandrums view image in fullscreen an unfinished skyscraper in tianjin china photograph anadolu agency getty images wildau says beijing has the money and the technocratic knowhow to bail out the property sector but it would be very expensive so far it looks as though xi despite the chaos unleashed is sticking to the plan to stamp out excesses and make sure that houses are for living in rather than speculation so far china s export industries have held up well and despite trade wars and lockdowns the country has actually increased its share of world manufacturing since the pandemic began even that however is at risk because demand from around the world seems likely to fall off a cliff during the coming 12 months in a feedback loop that spells more danger for china view image in fullscreen wehicles waiting for shipment at yantai port shandong province photograph vcg getty images as ren s comments on the outlook for huawei highlighted its not just china that faces uncertainty russia s throttling of gas supplies and western sanctions imposed over its invasion of ukraine are fuelling runaway inflation and stalling growth threatening a bleak winter for developed economies from the us to europe and from japan to south korea the worst cost of living crisis for nearly 50 years is slowly engulfing western nations and that seems certain to lead to reduced demand for chinese made goods as households have to focus on essentials such as food and fuel on friday the chair of the us federal reserve jerome powell shook stock markets by saying there would be pain for households and businesses as he indicated the central bank would keep raising rates until inflation is vanquished skip past newsletter promotion sign up to business

warned about is not clear but it adds an unknown factor to an already dangerous mix of issues says roland rajah the lead economist at the lowy institute a thinktank in australia these include mounting geopolitical volatility fragile supply chains political dysfunction in the us digital disruption and the accelerating effects of climate change the challenges even prompted the french president emmanuel macron to join in the gloomy forecasts by saying that the we are seeing the end of abundance back in global financial crisis of 2008 09 china rode to the rescue of the world economy with a 4tn yuan stimulus but with beijing in the process of decoupling from the western led world order and debt driven growth out of favour another chinese rescue mission seems very unlikely instead china faces japan style lost decades as it tries to absorb the billions of dollars of dud property loans in the short term china s economy is being hammered rajah says it remains to be seen what the medium to long term consequences could be but china also faces very significant longer term headwinds from demographic decline and ageing creeping statism and its increasingly difficult external relations and as china reaches its point of no return in its housing crisis the world economy itself is also at the crossroads the world economy does appear to be at a turning point says rajah though it is also still in a state of flux when things could still go in any number of directions people have to prepare for a much more uncertain world but we also need to expect much more from our politicians and policymakers because the need for wise policy is only getting higher and higher
