the fed wants to slow inflation without knocking the u s economy into recession a sensitive mission that will include increasing benchmark interest rates washington focused on relentlessly rising prices president joe biden plotted inflation fighting strategy tuesday with the chairman of the federal reserve with the fate of the economy and his own political prospects increasingly dependent on the actions of the government s central bank biden hoped to demonstrate to voters that he was attuned to their worries about higher gasoline grocery and other prices whiles still insisting an independent fed will act free from political pressure like biden the fed wants to slow inflation without knocking the u s economy into recession a highly sensitive mission that is to include increasing benchmark interest rates this summer the president said he would not attempt to direct that course as some previous presidents have tried my plan to address inflation starts with simple proposition respect the fed respect the fed s independence biden said the sit down on a heat drenched late spring day was biden s latest effort to show his dedication to containing the 8 3 leap in consumer prices over the past year rising gas and food costs have angered many americans heading into the midterm elections putting democrats control of the house and senate at risk biden is running out of options on his own his past attempts oil releases from the strategic reserve improving port operations and calls to investigate price gouging have fallen short of satisfactory results high prices have undermined his efforts to highlight the low 3 6 unemployment rate leaving a growing sense of pessimism among americans tuesday s meeting was the first since powell was renominated in november by biden to lead the central bank and came two weeks after his confirmation for a second term by the senate it also represented something of a reversal by biden as inflation weighs heavily on voters minds the president asserted in april 2021 that he was very fastidious about not talking with the independent fed and wanted to avoid being seen as telling them what they should and shouldn t do the white house along with the fed initially portrayed the inflation surge as a temporary side effect caused by supply chain issues as the u s emerged from the pandemic republican lawmakers were fast to criticize biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package from last year as pumping too much money into the economy and causing more inflation that narrative also has held some sway with leading economists who say the financial support was excessive even though it helped the job market roar back the administration has walked back its previous statements treasury secretary janet yellen told cnn on tuesday evening that she did not fully understand the impact that unanticipated large shocks and supply bottlenecks would have on the economy look i think i was wrong then about the path that inflation would take she said but we recognize that now the federal reserve is taking the steps that it needs to take it s up to them to decide what to do inflation has shown signs of moderating but is likely to remain far above the fed s 2 target through the end of this year gas prices are expected to keep rising particularly now that the european union has agreed to cut off 90 of its oil purchases from russia that will force the eu to buy more oil from elsewhere and it drove oil prices to 115 a barrel tuesday this was only the fourth meeting between the president and the federal reserve chair though powell breakfasts as often as once a week with treasury secretary janet yellen who also attended tuesday s meeting along with brian deese the white house national economic council director ahead of the meeting biden suggested that he and powell were aligned on addressing inflation my predecessor demeaned the fed and past presidents have sought to influence its decisions inappropriately during periods of elevated inflation biden said in an op ed posted monday by the wall street journal i won t do this i have appointed highly qualified people from both parties to lead that institution i agree with their assessment that fighting inflation is our top economic challenge right now in contrast president donald trump repeatedly attacked powell after the fed chair oversaw moderate interest rate hikes in 2018 and continued his public criticism even as powell cut rates in 2019 biden s endorsement of the fed s policies a stance echoed by congressional gop leaders gives powell important political cover for a series of sharp interest rate hikes intended to rein in higher prices yet the higher rates could cause layoffs raise the unemployment rate and even tip the economy into recession amid worries that the u s economy may repeat the high persistent inflation of the 1970s the cooperation between biden and powell represents a crucial difference from that time and could make it easier for the fed to restrain higher prices in the early 1970s president richard nixon pressured fed chair arthur burns to lower interest rates to spur the economy before nixon s 1972 reelection campaign nixon s interference is now widely seen as a key contributor to runaway inflation which remained high until the early 1980s that s why comparisons to the 1970s are wrong said sebastian mallaby a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations and author of a biography on former fed chairman alan greenspan the man who knew the president s essay was striking because he explicitly backed the fed biden faces an increasingly global challenge as energy and food costs have jumped after russian president vladimir putin ordered the invasion of ukraine in february simultaneously china imposed lockdowns tied to coronavirus outbreaks that further strained supply chains this has left the european union nursing record inflation and the risks of a recession while u s consumers are increasingly disgruntled by gas prices averaging a nominal record of 4 62 a gallon powell has pledged to keep ratcheting up the fed s key short term interest rate to cool the economy until inflation is coming down in a clear and convincing way but those rate hikes have spurred fears that the fed in its drive to slow borrowing and spending may push the economy into recession that concern has caused sharp drops in stock prices in the past two months though markets rallied last week

the u s government has had a wary relationship with cryptocurrencies some countries like japan and argentina have detailed regulations for cryptocurrencies but the united states has held the industry at more of an arm s length the u s regulatory landscape also makes creating crypto regulation a little more complicated said jeremy goss partner at financial accounting firm forvis llp unlike some other countries where one centralized regulator handles everything in the united states different market participants are regulated by different regulatory bodies in the traditional financial industry this includes specific banking regulators for banks the securities exchange commission and commodity futures trading commission for securities and derivatives markets and the financial industry regulatory authority for broker dealers states also may have different regulations of their own such as different money transmitter laws meant to prevent actions like money laundering possible future cryptocurrency regulations cryptocurrency exchanges will be required to issue 1099 b forms for all crypto transactions by investors starting in 2023 the wash sale rule may eventually be expanded to cover cryptocurrencies cryptocurrencies may eventually receive a de minimis tax reporting exemption stricter regulations around stablecoins may be implemented in the future because there are few existing regulations for the cryptocurrency industry market participants like banks that want to get into the crypto industry have to make do by slotting in their approach to crypto into existing regulatory frameworks for traditional finance goss said when making cash to crypto transactions for example companies may elect to follow all the different money transmitter laws passed by states without any real reassurance that those same rules would apply to crypto they re in conversations with their regulators saying if we were to do this activity is this how it would work under this regulation goss said and then their regulators may be like well we don t want to tell you yes but we also don t want to tell you no there s a lot that s just up in the air ultimately congress has to kick off the process of cryptocurrency regulation with legislation assigning regulators to do the work of figuring out the detailed rules goss said creating the right regulations around an emerging market can be a delicate balancing act they don t want to stifle innovation goss said but at the same time they want it to be safe and they want investors to be confident in what s going on so it s push and pull we re right in the middle of all of it right now infrastructure bill s new reporting regulations u s regulations around cryptocurrencies first appeared around 2014 when the irs classified cryptocurrencies not as a type of currency but as property similar to gold said andrew gordon president and tax lawyer at gordon law group that designation is still true today and as a result cryptocurrency investors need to report it in their taxes as property in 2021 congress passed the infrastructure bill which includes provisions requiring cryptocurrency exchanges to report all transactions on their exchanges on 1099 b forms those are the same forms investors currently receive from brokerages like e trade and robinhood during tax season gordon said the idea is that by requiring cryptocurrency brokers to follow the same standard as traditional brokers the government will be able to systematically track people s earnings from crypto and prevent tax evasion that provision when it takes effect in 2023 is also going to make it easier for the government to rein in and prosecute malicious hackers by explicitly linking crypto transactions to individuals cybercriminals regularly ask for payment in the form of cryptocurrencies when they launch ransomware attacks which is when attackers lock out users from their own computer systems and extort payment in exchange for the key the reality is that crypto is far from anonymous in fact the blockchain itself is an immutable ledger of activities there was for many years the false belief that crypto is anonymous gordon said which made it a popular currency for criminal activity the reality is that crypto is far from anonymous in fact the blockchain itself is an immutable ledger of activities blockchain technology is actually more pseudonymous where the account holder s corresponding id isn t explicitly tied to their identity in the outside world but all their activity within the ledger is recorded and can be easily traced back to that id time and time again the government has shown that they re able to trace through the blockchain and find people gordon said take for example the arrest of the founder of the online black market the silk road back in 2013 where federal agents uncovered the identity of dread pirate roberts and arrested him in a san francisco public library when the law requiring cryptocurrency brokers to notify the irs about crypto transactions takes effect the task of tying blockchain activities to individuals is only going to get easier especially because the government is currently able to do so even without this requirement historically there was little to no reporting required gordon said so now the government is going to be armed with a ton of information a treasure trove of information to trace transactions more on crypto20 best crypto wallets to know possible future expansion of the wash sale rule the build back better plan proposed by president biden that failed to pass the senate in 2021 gives hints of another possible regulation coming in the future gordon said in the plan it was proposed that the wash sale rule which currently only explicitly applies to stocks and securities would be amended to also cover cryptocurrencies the wash sale rule prevents investors from claiming a tax deduction on stocks or securities they sell at a loss if they buy back that same investment or a substantially identical one within a short period of time the wash sale rule doesn t currently apply to crypto so investors holding cryptocurrencies could make use of the loophole to claim tax deductions on losses while still holding onto the currency the build back better plan was an attempt to make that change i would assume in time that there s going to be efforts again to close that loophole gordon said the proposed expansion of the wash sale rule wasn t the reason the build back better plan failed to pass so it s likely that the proposal will appear again in future legislation find out who s hiring see jobs at top tech companies startups view all jobs could there be a de minimis tax rule for cryptocurrencies another rule gordon thinks will be implemented in the future is one that sets a minimum threshold for tax reporting called a de minimis tax rule there s always rumblings about having a de minimis tax law which means that you don t have to pay taxes or report crypto transactions under a certain dollar amount he said whenever cryptocurrency owners spend an amount of crypto whether to purchase a boat or a cup of coffee that transaction is considered a sale of the cryptocurrency gordon explained as a result investors need to calculate whether the price of the cryptocurrency at the time of the sale was higher or lower than the price when they acquired it for each instance they spend crypto in order to use it for tax reporting you re going to have to calculate the gain or loss on that cup of coffee which is a pain gordon said no one wants to do it and then it kind of bites people adopting and using crypto because you ve got to calculate gain or losses on a 5 transaction there s currently a de minimis rule around discount bonds allowing them to be taxed at the lower capital gains rate rather than the higher ordinary income rate under certain conditions when the discount is small enough for cryptocurrencies a de minimis rule might look like a law exempting lesser crypto transactions from tax reporting and therefore from calculating gains and losses in order to make the reporting process more manageable more on cryptocryptocurrency for change how token economies are upending markets regulation of stablecoins may be an early step when it comes to cryptocurrencies there is one specific type that will likely see future regulation stablecoin stablecoins are different from other types of cryptocurrencies because they are supposed to match the value of the u s dollar with each stablecoin having a value of 1 similar to how the u s dollar used to be pegged to gold stablecoins are supposed to be pegged to the dollar to help give the currency more stability stablecoins are often described as the lifeblood of the cryptocurrency ecosystem goss said they allow crypto investors to quickly and easily exchange cryptocurrencies like bitcoin for the value of the dollar without directly using the dollar without stablecoins investors may have to wait days for the transfer between dollars and cryptocurrencies to go through the traditional financial banking systems there are many different stablecoin cryptocurrencies including tether usd coin and terrausd which uses the cryptocurrency token luna different types of stablecoins are pegged to the dollar in different ways with many stablecoin issuers claiming to hold dollars or assets that equal the total volume of stablecoins issued some stablecoin companies like usd coin s issuer voluntarily invite independent accounting firms to attest that the company has what they consider to be sufficient assets to back up the stablecoin s value goss said other stablecoins use an algorithmic method to automatically encourage buying and selling of coins to regulate their value relative to the dollar but cryptocurrencies being unregulated still means there is no way to guarantee whether there are enough assets or any assets backing up the stablecoins gordon said there s no transparency there s no audits there s no regulation it s just the belief that what they re saying is true i can create a website called the gordon coin and tell everyone that i m going to put one dollar in the account for every dollar that someone buys of the token he said there s no transparency there s no audits there s no regulation it s just the belief that what they re saying is true just recently the value of terrausd s luna coin fell to less than a thousandths of a dollar illustrating how some stablecoins may not be that stable these developments make it more likely that regulations will come for stablecoins which the government had already indicated it was interested in regulating in april the biden administration proposed that stablecoin issuers be subjected to some of the same regulatory requirements as banks it s hard to predict what the eventual regulations would be but gordon said some examples of what could one day be required is that stablecoins are subject to audits to ensure their assets and holdings that they are required to hold their assets in u s banks or that they be fdic insured ultimately goss said regulators are focused on creating rules that will maintain the health of the broader financial system safeguard the emerging market from hackers and loss of assets and prevent market manipulation
washington following mass shootings in new york and texas the u s house judiciary committee is holding an emergency meeting on thursday to mark up gun control legislation though it s likely doomed the package includes eight gun related bills known as the protecting our kids act and they are expected to pass the democratic controlled house but the legislation has little chance of making it through the evenly divided senate where 60 votes would be required for any bill to advance assuming every democrat was in favor they would need 10 republicans to join the house package would raise the age of purchasing semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21 create new requirements for storing guns in a home with children prevent gun trafficking require all firearms to be traceable and close the loophole on bump stocks among other things the meeting was scheduled by committee chairman jerry nadler a new york democrat after a white supremacist killed 10 black people at a supermarket in a predominantly black neighborhood in buffalo new york on may 14 ten days later an elementary school in uvalde texas was attacked by an 18 year old man armed with a rifle and 19 children and two teachers were killed meanwhile with both the house and senate in recess this week a small bipartisan group of senators is also holding virtual talks to see if it is possible to develop any legislation on guns last week hours after the uvalde slaughter senate minority leader mitch mcconnell a kentucky republican did not commit to working on any gun control legislation with democrats however a few senate republicans seemed open to the idea of red flag laws which allow the courts or law enforcement to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is distressed over the memorial day weekend sen chris murphy a connecticut democrat who s worked for years to attempt to pass gun reform laws tweeted that he s been talking with senators of both parties about putting together a bipartisan gun violence bill senator schumer has given us just over a week to find a compromise he wrote this time failure cannot be an option senate majority leader chuck schumer a new york democrat said that if republicans do not work with democrats to come to an agreement the senate will still hold a vote on gun control legislation even if it fails when the chamber returns from recess after the uvalde massacre the nation s second deadliest mass school shooting since sandy hook elementary a decade ago schumer took a procedural step to begin debate on two background check bills with the possibility of calling for votes on them the house passed bills are h r 8 which establishes new background check requirements for firearm transfers between private parties and h r 1446 which increases the amount of time that a federal firearms licensee must wait to receive a completed background check prior to transferring a firearm to an unlicensed person on sunday president joe biden visited uvalde and called on congress to stand up against the gun lobby and send a bill to his desk gun rights groups such as the national rifle association and gun owners of america spent a record of nearly 16 million in lobbying in 2021 campaign finance records show i will meet with congress on guns i promise you biden told reporters tuesday the senate judiciary committee is set to hold a hearing on gun violence june 15

earlier today i wrote about the rise of inflation last year even as president biden and treasury sec janet yellen repeatedly downplayed the threat here s what yellen was saying a year ago advertisement yellen says that the federal reserve may need to respond to rising prices leading to a brief panic in the stock market and later a clarification from the treasury secretary it may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure our economy does not overheat yellen says at a forum sponsored by the atlantic on may 4 after the stock market dips yellen tells the wall street journal at a separate event the same day i don t think there s going to be an inflationary problem but if there is the fed can be counted on to address them yellen finally acknowledged the problem in june saying inflation would rise to 3 percent by the end of the year but even then she added but i personally believe that this represents transitory factors but six months later on december 10 it becomes clear that inflation is at 6 8 percent and it s not transitory today sec yellen admitted she was wrong us treasury secretary janet yellen admitted tuesday that she had failed to anticipate how long high inflation would continue to plague american consumers as the biden administration works to contain a mounting political liability i think i was wrong then about the path that inflation would take yellen told cnn s wolf blitzer on the situation room when asked about her comments from 2021 that inflation posed only a small risk advertisement as cnn points out this is part of the coordinated push coming from the white house to try to help biden s sagging poll numbers beyond yellen a number of other economic aides have flooded cable news airwaves in the hopes of driving the message that biden is dedicated to bringing down the prices of gasoline food and housing which have led to a slump in his approval ratings the president yellen said tuesday knows what an important and huge burden inflation is placing on american households in his wsj opinion piece biden said he was committed to fighting inflation as his top priority but then said step 1 in doing that was to acknowledge the federal reserve has a primary responsibility to control inflation so between laying this at the feet of the fed and having his own treasury secretary fall on her sword it s clear biden is looking to avoid taking the blame for this personally here s the interview with sec yellen her chief strength as a communicator seems to be the ability to run out the clock by offering long answers full of talking points wolf blitzer only manages to squeeze three questions into this 4 minute clip her first answer in which she admits getting it wrong last for 90 full seconds if you manage to stick it out to the end blitzer asks if it s going to get worse in the short term again yellen s answer rolls on for almost a minute but she finally says we can t rule out further shocks that s either a very long winded way of saying i don t know or it s a very sly way of avoiding saying that things will probably get worse before they get better advertisement finally the washington post did an interview with larry summers earlier today in which summers once again predicted a soft landing meaning curbing inflation without a recession was not very likely david nothing is certain in economics and so no forecast should be made with greater than a 75 or 80 percent probability but we do know this we know as your clip introducing this quoted me to say that when inflation has been above 4 percent and unemployment has been below 4 percent we ve always had a recession within the last next two years and right now inflation is well above 4 percent and unemployment is properly measured well below 4 percent so i think the likelihood is that we re not going to get through this with a soft landing now the consensus forecast is more optimistic than that and it may turn out to be correct but my own judgment is that given where we have been it is going to be very difficult to get through get through this that we now have wage inflation running at a close to 6 percent rate and the tightest labor markets we ve ever seen in our country and i don t see how we can get inflation to substantially decelerate without wage inflation falling substantially and i don t see any reason to think wage inflation will fall substantially unless there s a substantial loosening in labor markets which would mean higher unemployment advertisement here s the full interview update did yellen misspeak hard to believe but treasury is reacting as if this were a gaffe

the fed wants to slow inflation without knocking the u s economy into recession a sensitive mission that will include increasing benchmark interest rates washington focused on relentlessly rising prices president joe biden plotted inflation fighting strategy tuesday with the chairman of the federal reserve with the fate of the economy and his own political prospects increasingly dependent on the actions of the government s central bank biden hoped to demonstrate to voters that he was attuned to their worries about higher gasoline grocery and other prices whiles still insisting an independent fed will act free from political pressure like biden the fed wants to slow inflation without knocking the u s economy into recession a highly sensitive mission that is to include increasing benchmark interest rates this summer the president said he would not attempt to direct that course as some previous presidents have tried my plan to address inflation starts with simple proposition respect the fed respect the fed s independence biden said the sit down on a heat drenched late spring day was biden s latest effort to show his dedication to containing the 8 3 leap in consumer prices over the past year rising gas and food costs have angered many americans heading into the midterm elections putting democrats control of the house and senate at risk biden is running out of options on his own his past attempts oil releases from the strategic reserve improving port operations and calls to investigate price gouging have fallen short of satisfactory results high prices have undermined his efforts to highlight the low 3 6 unemployment rate leaving a growing sense of pessimism among americans tuesday s meeting was the first since powell was renominated in november by biden to lead the central bank and came two weeks after his confirmation for a second term by the senate it also represented something of a reversal by biden as inflation weighs heavily on voters minds the president asserted in april 2021 that he was very fastidious about not talking with the independent fed and wanted to avoid being seen as telling them what they should and shouldn t do the white house along with the fed initially portrayed the inflation surge as a temporary side effect caused by supply chain issues as the u s emerged from the pandemic republican lawmakers were fast to criticize biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package from last year as pumping too much money into the economy and causing more inflation that narrative also has held some sway with leading economists who say the financial support was excessive even though it helped the job market roar back the administration has walked back its previous statements treasury secretary janet yellen told cnn on tuesday evening that she did not fully understand the impact that unanticipated large shocks and supply bottlenecks would have on the economy look i think i was wrong then about the path that inflation would take she said but we recognize that now the federal reserve is taking the steps that it needs to take it s up to them to decide what to do inflation has shown signs of moderating but is likely to remain far above the fed s 2 target through the end of this year gas prices are expected to keep rising particularly now that the european union has agreed to cut off 90 of its oil purchases from russia that will force the eu to buy more oil from elsewhere and it drove oil prices to 115 a barrel tuesday this was only the fourth meeting between the president and the federal reserve chair though powell breakfasts as often as once a week with treasury secretary janet yellen who also attended tuesday s meeting along with brian deese the white house national economic council director ahead of the meeting biden suggested that he and powell were aligned on addressing inflation my predecessor demeaned the fed and past presidents have sought to influence its decisions inappropriately during periods of elevated inflation biden said in an op ed posted monday by the wall street journal i won t do this i have appointed highly qualified people from both parties to lead that institution i agree with their assessment that fighting inflation is our top economic challenge right now in contrast president donald trump repeatedly attacked powell after the fed chair oversaw moderate interest rate hikes in 2018 and continued his public criticism even as powell cut rates in 2019 biden s endorsement of the fed s policies a stance echoed by congressional gop leaders gives powell important political cover for a series of sharp interest rate hikes intended to rein in higher prices yet the higher rates could cause layoffs raise the unemployment rate and even tip the economy into recession amid worries that the u s economy may repeat the high persistent inflation of the 1970s the cooperation between biden and powell represents a crucial difference from that time and could make it easier for the fed to restrain higher prices in the early 1970s president richard nixon pressured fed chair arthur burns to lower interest rates to spur the economy before nixon s 1972 reelection campaign nixon s interference is now widely seen as a key contributor to runaway inflation which remained high until the early 1980s that s why comparisons to the 1970s are wrong said sebastian mallaby a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations and author of a biography on former fed chairman alan greenspan the man who knew the president s essay was striking because he explicitly backed the fed biden faces an increasingly global challenge as energy and food costs have jumped after russian president vladimir putin ordered the invasion of ukraine in february simultaneously china imposed lockdowns tied to coronavirus outbreaks that further strained supply chains this has left the european union nursing record inflation and the risks of a recession while u s consumers are increasingly disgruntled by gas prices averaging a nominal record of 4 62 a gallon powell has pledged to keep ratcheting up the fed s key short term interest rate to cool the economy until inflation is coming down in a clear and convincing way but those rate hikes have spurred fears that the fed in its drive to slow borrowing and spending may push the economy into recession that concern has caused sharp drops in stock prices in the past two months though markets rallied last week

if kwesst micro systems hasn t exactly been in stealth mode for the past five years it s been content to fly just under the radar as it builds out its technology aimed at helping soldiers and first responders thwart enemy threats and get a better bead on their surroundings the kanata company has been on a slow but steady ascent since it was founded in 2017 by former colt canada executives jeff macleod and warren downing but industry veteran david luxton kwesst s executive chairman and one of its largest shareholders says the firm is ready for its coming out party during this week s cansec defence and security trade show at the ey centre our mission and we think it s realistic is to be able to grow kwesst into a very significant enterprise he says kwesst started out developing sensors that could be attached to high powered rifles and other weapons to help soldiers pinpoint exactly where ammunition such as bullets or grenades would make contact with a target the tech soon turned heads in the u s marine corps and other military organizations kwesst then began developing other products like software that delivers images of a target s location to a display screen in a soldier s goggles the gleam in our eye is a calculated one the market for each of these segments could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars over time initially funded by its founders and a few well heeled angels the firm went public on the tsx venture exchange in the fall of 2020 since then kwesst has been diligently developing and acquiring technology in three main product areas systems that feed real time information to soldiers in the field measures that counteract deadly lasers and other space age weaponry and equipment such as high tech anti riot munitions designed to subdue aggressive protesters and other belligerents what might sound like gadgetry straight out of star wars to the average person is a real opportunity just waiting to be seized in luxton s universe the gleam in our eye is a calculated one he says the market for each of these segments could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars over time if anyone in ottawa can instinctively gauge the appetite for such tech it s luxton in more than three decades in the business the former infantry officer has seen and done it all including helping launch simunition a firm that became a world leader in equipment aimed at training soldiers and first responders for close quarters combat luxton who joined kwesst in october 2019 says its products have arrived at just the right time to serve militaries and police forces contending with volatile situations like the war in ukraine and the freedom convoy protests in ottawa earlier this year decoy system a hot item aerospace and defence giant general dynamics for example is installing kwesst s electronic decoy system dubbed phantom on hundreds of next generation armoured vehicles it s building for a u s military customer it s a pretty hot item these days luxton says of phantom which is designed to dupe enemy forces into attacking non existent targets it saves lives and buys time he says the firm has found another sweet spot in building a platform that takes data from an array of sources including cellphones radios and drone videos feeds it into software that provides soldiers and first responders with real time assessments of their surroundings and delivers that data to a user s smartphone or other mobile devices luxton says such information can be crucial in diffusing situations similar to last week s deadly school shooting in uvalde texas there s a digital gap that needs to be closed for the public safety market he says we see no reason why that market couldn t continue to just snowball kwesst s other products include technology that detects sophisticated weapons such as lasers designed to zap a combatant s eyeballs with deadly rays the kanata firm s system can locate the lasers and alert potential targets to the looming threat we don t know of anything else like it in the world luxton says earlier this year kwesst had a moment in the spotlight when one of its newest offerings played a high profile role in dispersing demonstrators against vaccine mandates in downtown ottawa police used the firm s anti riot devices to fire baton shaped projectiles into a group of people gathered near bank and sparks streets during february s freedom convoy protest prompting the company to issue a news release noting that the media said no one was hurt in the incident it very quickly resolved the situation without injuries and brought it to a safe conclusion luxton says of kwesst s anti riot weapon enfield line which it acquired last december everybody went home safe and alive all three product lines will be on display at cansec this wednesday and thursday where luxton expects kwesst to add to its growing list of admirers that includes former phoenix police chief daniel garcia garcia who also served as assistant chief of the dallas police department joined the company earlier this month to help spearhead its push into the wider u s market eyeing nasdaq listing he s a big believer in what kwesst is doing luxton says the company now has just over 30 employees about 20 of whom work in ottawa and the rest at offices in virginia london and abu dhabi kwesst has begun laying the groundwork for a listing on the nasdaq and luxton says an update could come in the next few weeks obviously we want to do it at a time of our choosing when capital markets are co operative he says adding the company hopes to make its debut on the exchange later in 2022 while luxton is bullish on kwesst s future he knows that in business just as in combat success can never be taken for granted there s what you can control and there s what you can t control he explains you know war breaks out pandemics break out geopolitical security arrangements get realigned supply chains get disrupted you have to stay poised with a plan a plan b plan

wall street analysts are telling their clients that this could be the right time to pick up clean energy stocks the eu s multibillion euro plan to reduce dependence on russian oil and gas is a boon for renewables renewable energy stocks have become a victim of the market wide selloff in may after another underwhelming start to the year clean energy stocks have lately been showing signs of sizzle thanks to the unveiling of the european union s multibillion euro plan to reduce dependence on russian fossil fuels according to the new repowereu plan the european commission has set a goal to have half the eu s energy coming from renewable sources by 2030 effectively more than double the current levels with total costs to be offset by 84b in annual savings on imported fuel repowereu says full implementation of its proposals would cut gas consumption 30 by 2030 the ec has proposed to introduce an obligation to have rooftop solar installations for all new buildings and all existing buildings of energy performance class d and above the european commission aims to speed up construction of wind farms and solar arrays by forcing member states to designate go to zones with lower environmental standards and processes for fast track approvals unlike their fossil fuel peers clean energy stocks have had another torrid year with the sector s popular benchmark ishares s p global clean energy index etf nasdaq icln down 5 6 in the year to date mainly due to inflation pressures supply chain snarls and a resurgence of covid 19 however a cross section of wall street analysts is advising investors that the current market turmoil is a perfect opportunity to buy clean energy stocks at bargain prices here are some top picks by the experts sunnova market cap 2 4b ytd returns 28 8

with a generation capacity of approximately 1 140 megawatts serving over 195 000 customers after a disastrous start to the year nova shares have climbed nearly 21 over the past five trading sessions after northland initiated an outperform rating on the stock along with a price target tagged to 30 on nova implying potential upside of 46 6 from stock s last close according to northland nova s current price offers a compelling entry point for investors looking for exposure to the residential solar market given the view that sunnova has a well oiled dealership based business model as well as very strong and dependable cash flows sunrun market cap 5 6b ytd returns 25 5 sunrun inc nasdaq run is a san francisco california based solar company that engages in the design development

like its solar peers fslr shares have been on the move after piper sandler upgraded shares to overweight from neutral with a 90 price target implying 25 upside to current price saying recent bookings momentum provides strong volume and pricing visibility into 2024 piper analyst kashy harrison sees 2022 as a trough margin year with the potential for improving as logistics normalize new contracting structures de risking margins manifest in 2023 24 and startup expenses associated with facility construction subside harrison says first solar revenues can grow from 2 4b in 2022 to 4 3b in 2024 and ebitda can surge from 100m in 2022 to 1 2b in 2024 first solar clearly stands to benefit from the u s commerce department s investigation of solar panel imports but harrison says her upgrade is not a call on the tariff outcome as the company could have pricing volume visibility through much of 2025 by the time a preliminary tariff is announced in august many solar stocks have been selling off in recent weeks in reaction to the u s government s probe into solar panel imports indeed in its latest earnings call nextera energy nyse nee has warned that as much as 2 8 gw of solar and storage projects will be delayed by at least a year due to the u s department of commerce investigation into solar panel imports if the commerce department were to find circumvention we believe it would be unwinding a decade of trade practice we are disappointed with the commerce decision to conduct this investigation nee cfo kirk crews has told bloomberg the government has until august 30 to issue preliminary findings but with some companies reporting canceled or delayed solar panels the industry is asking for a faster decision plug power market cap 11 0b ytd returns 33 8 one of the more famous

wider loss plug power reported q1 revenue of 140 8m 95 7 y y and gaap eps of 0 27 with both metrics falling short of the wall street consensus however some wall street experts see the huge selloff as a buying opportunity according to h c wainwright s amit dayal the decline in plug shares is a blessing in disguise with the analyst saying the company s business is likely to improve in the coming years and the stock climbing as well dayal rates the stock a buy with a price target of 78 good for a massive 309 upside dayal notes that plug power is expanding its business globally and has forecast that 25 of the company s estimated 909 million revenue in 2022 will come from international markets high natural gas prices have pressured plug power s fuel margins but it has still been able to expand its service margins nevertheless we believe the stock should get a better appreciation from the market on evidence of execution against margin improvements and global growth says dayal rivian

a proxy advisory firm is urging spirit airlines shareholders to vote against the company s proposed merger with frontier airlines institutional shareholder services wrote a report stating that the competing purchase offer from jetblue would provide a better financial deal to spirit shareholders on balance a potential agreement with jetblue would appear to offer shareholders superior optionality allowing those concerned with the turbulence ahead to exit at a significant premium while allowing those with a more optimistic outlook to reinvest the premium consideration iss said jetblue quoted excerpts from the report in a press release on tuesday iss declined to provide the full report to travel weekly jetblue ceo robin hayes also released a statement tuesday saying the report highlights what he called the flawed process followed by the spirit board in recommending the frontier proposal above the jetblue purchase offer jetblue is offering 30 per share to spirit investors while frontier s offer would provide spirit investors with 1 9126 shares of frontier stock plus 2 13 for each of their spirit shares frontier stock was trading at around 10 60 early tuesday afternoon making the value of frontier s offer 22 40 per share spirit s board and management have rejected jetblue s bid saying such a merger between the two airlines would have little chance of being approved by antitrust regulators at the justice department the doj is already suing to breakup jetblue s and american s northeast alliance and spirit ceo ted christie argues that regulators will look askance on the merger of ultralow cost carrier spirit with a higher cost airline like jetblue iss however noted in its report that jetblue has offered a 200 million termination fee to spirit in light of the risk of regulatory rejection and the spirit board has negotiated no such fee with frontier spirit s view that the frontier proposal may have a smoother glide path towards achieving regulatory approval appears reasonable but its assertion that the jetblue proposal has zero chance of approval appears far less so the proxy advisory firm said spirit did not immediately comment on the report on june 10 spirit shareholders will vote on the proposed merger with frontier

december 1928 by archer b gilfillan i in fairness to the reader it should be stated at the outset that there are two general theories about herding some hold that no man can herd for six months straight without going crazy while others maintain that a man must have been mentally unbalanced for at least six months before he is in fit condition to entertain the thought of herding since these theories taken together hold out little hope for the steady herder i ask the reader in case he should notice any irrationality in the following pages to impute it to environment rather than to heredity it is easier on the family to a mind uncontaminated by the higher criticism the herding profession as personified in the second son of adam holds a very high and honorable rank in point of antiquity it is significant that the first herder was killed by his brother the prejudice against sheep is evidently as old as the profession itself and yet the herder even to day has distant relatives ninety third cousins as it were in the higher ranks of life for every pastor of a church is by his very name and profession a shepherd or herder but if it would not be presumptuous it might be pointed out that the sheep herder has some advantages over even his wealthy and aristocratic kinsman in the first place the herder can tell his black sheep at a glance which is something no pastor can do furthermore the herder does n t lie awake nights wondering how he can turn his black sheep white he has sense enough to know that they will remain black to the end of the chapter nor does he worry for fear that his black sheep will smudge up some of the white ones turning them a rich mulatto besides all this the herder s black sheep will average only about one to the hundred where is the pastor who can boast a score like that lastly when the whole flock shows a tendency to go wrong as it frequently does the herder does n t tearfully beg it to go right and get in another herder to work over it a week or two no he addresses his flock in short concise phrases he alludes in passing to certain interesting facts about their ancestry touches briefly on the present state of their morals winds up with a reference to their hoped for destination and then sets the dog on them the pastor has certain inhibitions of speech the herder has none unless he is tongue tied and few are but after all the herder and the pastor speak much the same language only differently arranged copyright 1928 by the atlantic monthly company all rights reserved it is necessary however to differentiate between the sheep herder of fact and the shepherd of romance the latter is a gay and poetic figure the former anything but the shepherd leads his flock with a song the herder follows his with profanity the shepherd reclines on a mossy bank beneath a green tree and carols a roundelay the herder looks carefully about to make sure that he won t sit on a cactus eases his wearied limbs to the unshaded hillside and gives his vocal organs a well earned rest but to descend from the shepherd of romance to the shepherd of fact there is yet a great difference between him and the sheep herder roughly speaking about a thousand dollars a year the shepherd in modern life is the man who has charge of a comparatively small band of pure bred sheep he tells the hired man what to give them and he tells the boss what to give him the sheep herder is in charge of a large band of sheep but he does n t tell anybody anything if he has anything to say he tells it to the sheep there is another marked difference between the shepherd and the sheep herder it is best told in the words of an old scotch herder in montana he said that in the old country when he drove his band of sheep down to the lower pastures at the approach of winter people would exclaim here comes the noble shepherd and his flock out here on the other hand when they saw him coming they would say here comes that low lived herder and his bunch of woolies in biblical times the owner of flocks was a nomad he had his herdsmen but he moved with them from place to place as the need for fresh grass dictated taking with him his family and all he possessed to day the sheep owner is as stationary as any corn belt farmer but the herder is still a nomad a band of sheep will take all the feed within a reasonable distance in about a month or six weeks then the sheep must be moved to fresh pastures since the ranch buildings are usually situated near the centre of the sheepman s range and since the sheep swing around the edges of the range in the course of a year the herder may be likened to a planet swinging around its central sun all this necessitates a high degree of mobility for the herder and his belongings and the answer to this is the sheep wagon the most comfortable home a bachelor could desire but before describing this it ought to be said that not all herders have a wagon in fact there are many different kinds of herding there is herding from the ranch which means that the herder lives in the ranch buildings takes the sheep out to graze during the day and returns them to the corral at night most herders have a taste of this sometime during the year usually during the winter some herders are on government reserves and have to bed their sheep in a different spot every night and have a pack horse with which to carry their bed and provisions from place to place in some parts of the country the herder has a team hobbled out near the wagon and does his own camp tending that is gets his own provisions by the novel method of propping up the front end of his wagon detaching the front half of the running gears and jogging away comfortably to where his provisions await him but in most places a herder caught trying to take the front wheels off his wagon would quickly receive free transportation to some state institution where he would be assigned to a small but well upholstered room and given a toy wagon to take apart to his heart s content again there is a great difference in the kind of country herded over there is mountain herding and there is plains herding and there is herding on wooded slopes but to herders who cannot keep track of all their sheep on the open prairie it must ever remain a mystery how a herder can keep track of any of them in the woods where he will not see the whole bunch together from one day s end to the other but sheep nature is doubtless sheep nature the world over and herders all over the west have much the same problems to solve much the same life to live whether they herd on the mountains or on the plains or in the depths of the forest and wherever he is the herder is the foundation stone of the sheep business or the bottom rung of the social ladder it all depends on the point of view ii it has always been hard for me to understand why the big city newspapers publish daily weather reports and forecasts for the city dweller can have only an academic interest in the weather at best in the morning he leaves a warm comfortable house walks a block or two in whatever weather happens to exist enters a street car or l and is driven to the door of his place of business in the evening he reverses the process braving the weather for perhaps ten minutes before reaching the shelter of home it may well be that the paper publishes an account of the weather simply as news because the city man might never notice what the weather was unless it were called to his attention in this way the country dweller however being more a child of nature is more attentive to her moods the farmer s interest in the weather is proverbial that of the farm hand is still more intense and personal but the sheep herder s interest in it eclipses them all for him the weather is not an academic subject but the most practical subject there is it governs the actions of the sheep and his own comfort it dictates his food and his clothing in the midsummer he may go modestly clad in shoes shirt and overalls in the winter he is still more modestly clad in two pairs of trousers and a heavy sweater to say nothing of a sheep coat from sunrise to sunset every day in the year he must take the weather whatever it may be in fact the weather is such an allimportant factor in a herder s life that herding through the four seasons of the year is almost like holding four different jobs in succession of course they shade into each other by imperceptible gradations as day passes into night but in their essence they differ almost as much as day and night some herders prefer one season some another but by unanimous consent the worst season of all is the verdant springtime countless poets have expressed the emotions aroused in them by the sight of nature putting on her mantle of green again countless herders have done the same but here the resemblance ceases from a herder s standpoint the green grass is the villain of the piece imagine a child particularly fond of candy who has been deprived of it for six months or so and then picture him turned loose in a candy shop and told to help himself you can easily figure out how much control you would have over him for the next half hour after he had had his fill he would be amenable to reason again this is precisely what happens to the sheep they have been on dry feed all winter whether hay or grass cured on the ground and then with the coming of spring they get the chance to eat tender green grass once more no wonder they go wild but the trouble is that the grass comes gradually its growth still further retarded by cold spells and late frosts the sheep however smell the green before it is fairly above the ground and they run everywhere searching for a place where it is plentiful naturally without finding it even when the grass is an inch or two high it seems impossible for them to get their fill of it they crop a mouthful here run a few steps grab another mouthful and run a few steps more they always seem to think that the grass is plentiful just beyond them and they lose no time in getting there ordinarily a ewe will graze first on one side of her then on the other and then move forward a step but when hunger for green grass drives her on she will take four or five steps between each two bites that carries the bunch forward at an unusual rate the period of running lasts until green grass is so plentiful that the sheep can get their fill of it every day the length of the period depending on how fast the grass grows and how many setbacks it has which in turn depend wholly and exclusively on the weather if anyone thinks that a sheep can t run just let him try to head one off when running in spring the entire bunch moves faster than the herder can walk one herder told me of an experience he said he had with a bunch of antelope his sheep passed them on the run so just for an experiment he threw the antelope into the bunch as they loped past the antelope kept up for a while but the pace told on them and soon they were in distress their sides were heaving their flanks dripped with sweat and their tongues lolled out till they were in danger of being stepped on finally the herder said he was unable to stand the sight of their suffering any longer so he cut them back and left them to throw themselves on the ground and recuperate like the rest of us he had always believed that the antelope were the fastest things on the plains but now he said he knew better a footsore herder would listen to a story like this and it is not necessary to vouch for its truth but there can be little doubt that many a jack rabbit has been trampled to death through sheer inability to keep ahead of some old ewe looking for green grass it is not only the running however that makes sheep difficult to handle in the spring but the fact that they spread out so quickly at ordinary times sheep have a very strong herd instinct a small boy was asked by his teacher how many out of five sheep in a field would be left if one jumped over the fence he answered correctly none why johnny remonstrated the teacher one from five leaves four well replied johnny you may know arithmetic but you don t know sheep of course it is only this strong herd instinct that makes it possible for two or three thousand sheep to be handled by one man in fact certain breeds of sheep that do not have this instinct so strongly cannot be run on the open range at all but must be kept in woven wire pastures however when the green grass is coming even the close herding sheep seem to throw off their inhibitions temporarily and it seems as if every ewe forgetting the rest of the bunch grazes straight out in front of her the sheep spread out much faster than the herder can throw them together of course the dog can turn them but even he has his limits and can be used only so much it usually takes the assistance of a saddle horse in addition to keep the whole bunch in one county iii besides the running splitting and spreading in spring there are other factors that induce in the herder the belief that he has mistaken his vocation the frost has come out of the ground creek bottoms are soft every low place is muddy and some are boggy the sheep are in the poorest physical condition of the entire year they have stood the strain of the winter s cold the green grass has weakened them temporarily they are heavy with lamb and the muddy going is the proverbial last straw sheep get bogged down in muddy spots and wait patiently for death or the herder they try to cross streams in deep places their wool takes up water like a sponge and they are unable to climb out on the other side the really weak sheep will run themselves ragged when headed away from the wagon and then when they are turned toward it they simply drop from exhaustion it is no uncommon thing to find the weakest ewe in the bunch at the very tip of the lead and quite often she finds that she has lost her return ticket one of the peculiar things about sheep is the extraordinary facility with which they take leave of life and the great variety of ways in which they make their exits you might almost accuse them of having a morbid strain it so happens that several methods of dying are in vogue during the spring months and often the heaviest loss of the year occurs at this time when the snow first softens the draws or swales are filled with slush which may have the appearance of snow but when a ewe tries to cross she finds herself in a medium where she can neither swim nor struggle through i have seen four sheep drowned in slush within twenty feet of each other they also get stuck in soft creek bottoms and either drown or chill to death a weak ewe may be unable to make it back to the wagon and the herder will throw the sheep that way next day to pick her up only to find her missing or killed by coyotes with the sheep running as they do at this time a small bunch may cut off unseen by the herder and lose some of its number by coyotes before the remainder are picked up at any time a coyote may sneak up a draw and kill a ewe before his presence is discovered in addition there are certain weeds that are deadly poison to sheep and even wet grass after a rain may occasionally bloat one sometimes a number may be killed by licking too much alkali along the creeks besides this they are subject to all the diseases of the organs as other creatures are with a few peculiar to themselves thrown in for good measure there are so many ways in which sheep can and do die that it is a wonder any of them are left alive the most peculiar method of all is that called dying on their backs when horses or dogs roll they either roll all the way over or roll back to the position from which they started they are unable to balance themselves on their spine as it were but when a sheep rolls and reaches a position with its legs pointing upward it is often unable to complete the turn especially if it has a heavy coat of wool as is the case in spring the reason for this is that a sheep s legs being very thin are not able to exert any pull to one side or the other and thus aid the sheep in righting itself a horse s legs being long and heavy can exert a powerful leverage on his body and turn it but when a sheep is on its back its centre of gravity lies wholly within it and there is no leverage it can bring to bear its only chance is to twist itself violently in the hope that some movement may turn it on its side if unsuccessful in this the unnatural position for some reason causes gas to collect in its body and it begins to bloat finally the pressure of this gas on its heart and lungs becomes so terrific that these organs cease to function if the ewe is found at any time before life is extinct and is turned over on her stomach she will get up stagger off and deflate looking meanwhile like a misshapen balloon there is a great variation in the time it takes a sheep to die on her back she may be dead in fifteen minutes then again she may be alive at the end of an hour or more it all depends on how full her stomach was to start with but die she will unless discovered and turned right side up sheep are especially apt to roll when the sun comes out warm after a rain the herder may turn over half a dozen sheep in a day when conditions are such as to make them roll and he has to be eternally on the lookout for them the price of their lives is his vigilance finally to fill the herder s cup of woe to overflowing the days in spring are interminably long they approach in length the farmer s eight hour day eight hours before dinner and eight hours after this has one single advantage it gives the herder time mentally to reshape his future life so that he will never under any circumstances herd through another spring iv at the latter end of spring comes lambing and after that shearing continuing now with the herding year we come to summer a season differing radically from the other three as regards herding all the rest of the year the herder leaves the wagon in the morning carrying a lunch and does not return to it until evening his evening meal is apt to be the principal one of the day and he does most of his cooking then but in summer every day is really broken into two working days the reason for this is that the sheep will not graze during the intense heat of a summer s midday but will run to the nearest water and lie beside it till late in the afternoon consequently in summer the wagon is placed beside a stream or water hole and the day s schedule is somewhat as follows the sheep leave the bed ground about five o clock or shortly after sunrise and go out to graze usually working against the wind the herder snatches a hasty breakfast and overtakes them with the aid of his saddle horse the band grazes until the sun gets uncomfortably hot and then some of them start for water they do not all go at once but fall gradually into long lines usually they follow deep dusty paths already made by thirsty stock and the long lines of sheep smoking down to water on a hot summer s day are as characteristic of a sheep country as the sheep themselves when the sheep reach water they drink and then huddle together in large groups usually with their heads beneath one another s sides that is as you look at the bunch you can see only their backs their heads being down near the cool wet sand where there is protection also from the mosquitoes and flies a few may lie down but most of them stand huddled together right at the water s edge occasionally a lamb or so may stand in the water for the sake of coolness but a grown sheep almost never if there are any banks close by to cast a shadow this patch of shade will be packed as full of sheep as it can hold the sheep will probably all be on water by eleven o clock and from then on till three or four in the afternoon the herder is free to do as he pleases this does not mean that he can make a practice of visiting away from the wagon because there is always the chance that a stray coyote may drop in for dinner but since the wagon overlooks the sheep as they lie on water the herder has four or five hours in which to cook eat dinner read write or otherwise recreate himself about three or four o clock the sheep begin to leave water they straggle off one by one grazing into the wind and it will perhaps be an hour before the last one leaves the herder does not have to follow until they are pretty well out and occasionally he does not have to leave the wagon in the afternoon at all the sheep do not travel as fast or as far as they do in the morning and their grazing time is shorter they reach the bed ground about dark the herder going in ahead of them to prepare his evening meal the result of this schedule is that the noon meal becomes the principal one of the day because there is then plenty of time to cook while there is little time to spare for either of the other meals this is a pity because it forces the herder to hover over his stove during the hottest part of the day and to convert his wagon into a little inferno but even at that the heat of a dakota sun at noon is such as to tempt the herder to crawl into his oven to cool off it reminds you of the arizona man being cremated in chicago who after spending an hour in the furnace sat up in his coffin and cursed the attendant for opening the door and letting in a draft it takes an inland country like the great northwest or siberia to produce extremes of heat and cold as stated before the wagon without a fire in it is very comfortable even on a hot day since it is open at both ends it does not take a wood fire long to die down and as soon as the stove cools off the herder is as comfortable as may be since he does not have to leave the wagon till the cool of the day approaches he really does not suffer with the heat and does not have to stand nearly so much of it as the farm hand does often he prepares a cold supper to avoid heating up the wagon again before he goes to bed summer herding then means early rising and consequently early retiring but it provides several hours of freedom in the middle of the day there are times in the year notably in spring when the herder may envy the ranch hand but as the herder lies on his bed through the heat of a summer s day and through the door of the wagon watches the distant ranch hand sweating up and down the corn rows or pitching hay or doing some such other work requiring a strong back and a weak mind then the herder is apt to be pharisaically thankful that he is not as one of these one real drawback to summer is the flies they are not bad at first but from the beginning of august they become a pest and a torment since the door and the window of the wagon both open out it is impossible to screen against the flies the only way is to fight them as they come in i have killed by actual count six hundred flies with a swatter in one afternoon i might add that i did little else during that time the best way seems to be to let them accumulate for a day or two and then shut the wagon up and give them a dose of some good insecticide that wipes the slate clean and gives a chance for a fresh start v time and tide they say wait for no man gradually the days become shorter the heat moderates and the sheep lie on water a shorter time each day the first really cool day they do not stop on water at all but merely drink and go on or perhaps they do not go down to water at all and about this time as summer is slipping into fall comes shipping the bunch is taken in to the ranch the wether lambs that is the males are first cut out and penned by themselves then all the ewes that show signs of age are cut out and put in a separate pen the sheepman then examines the mouths of these old ones to see which have teeth enough to carry them through another winter the gummers that is those that have lost all their teeth and the broken mouths those that have some teeth missing are cut out and put in with the wethers and the rest are returned to the bunch a sheep s age can be accurately told by the number and state of its teeth a yearling has two teeth a two yearold four a three year old six and a four year old eight or a full mouth as it is called at five a ewe s teeth are apt to begin to spread and to be worn down from then on individuals differ somewhat some losing their teeth quickly and some keeping them for a year or two longer ordinarily it does not pay a man who runs sheep on the range to keep his ewes after their mouths begin to break they will be all right for a year or two where they have plenty of hay and some grain but range conditions are too hard for them consequently the sheepman culls out his gummers and broken mouths each fall at the time he markets his lambs and thus gets his bunch in shape for the coming winter then begins the journey to the railroad with the lambs and often the regular herder makes the trip for the sake of a change from the region where we are it is fifty five miles to the railroad on the north and seventy five miles if we go south this trip takes from six to eight days it is always an interesting event even though it is harder than the herder s regular work often two or three sheepmen throw in together and as the lambs are all freshly branded when they start they can be easily sorted out at the shipping point if there are even a few old ewes in the bunch it is not difficult to get the band trail broke but if it is a straight bunch of lambs the first few days are lively ones someone has said that a ewe has just sense enough to be ornery but a lamb does n t know even that much a band of ewes will keep a certain direction without much bother but direction means less than nothing to a lamb a rabbit a russian thistle or any little thing at all is sufficient to change his previous intentions if any he is afraid of running water and of everything else but a fence he is always glad to see a fence and always suspects that there is a ripe grain field on the other side of it and he is a great one to act on his suspicions but by degrees he steadies down learns to keep direction fairly well and by the time he reaches the railroad he is as easy to handle as a ewe would be at the start two men go with each bunch of lambs on the trail one drives the lambs and the other the wagon or truck that carries the camp outfit the second man also makes and breaks camp does the cooking and dishwashing and helps the other fellow at a pinch it is right here that the chance for trouble comes in it is natural for the one driving the sheep to want all the help he can get and it is just as natural for the other to fail to recognize the pinch when it arrives each is apt to think that the other is putting the burden on him and it is a tradition that of the dozens of pairs of men who start with the lambs few arrive at the railroad on the same cordial terms with which they started but with good weather the trip can be a very pleasant one old friendships are renewed along the road and new ones made there are sheep ahead and behind and there is visiting back and forth among the trailsmen there is always the discussion of what happened at this or that point last year there is news of the progress of the other bands in line news spread by trucks or cars that traverse the whole route every day on their way to and from the railroad finally there is the sight of a real town and of the railroad once more the crowded stock pens the dusty job of cutting the bunch again and again as each man s sheep are sorted from the rest the crowding of the sheep on to the scales the cutting into carload lots and the prodding of the sheep up the runways into the double decked cars then comes the ride up to the hotel the removal of at least a portion of the corral dust the good dinner on clean tables served by pretty waitresses they all look pretty after a summer spent in the exclusive society of the sheep and the hours spent lounging around town afterward last of all there is the trip home covering in hours the route that took days on the up trip then back to the wagon and the sheep again vi there was a young man of quebec who was buried in snow to the neck when they asked 4 are you friz he replied 4 yes i is but they don t call this cold in quebec it is n t cold for south dakota either but when the mercury sinks until it drops out of the bottom of the thermometer and rolls around on the floor and then freezes up so that the baby can play marbles with it that s cold there is locally however a difference of opinion regarding south dakota climate some claim that it is nine months winter three months wind and the rest summer others maintain that it is nine months winter and three months late in the fall both sides agree on the length of the winter and both probably would on the quality of the cold no less an authority than stefansson has made the statement that it gets colder in the state of montana than it does within the arctic circle our region lies just east of the montana border and there is evidence to show that temperature is no respecter of state lines some years ago a member of the fraternity of sob brothers writing about a certain class of workers asked our tears for them because they worked in a room so chilly that they had to exercise to keep warm what would he have said had he known that hundreds of herders regularly get wringing wet with sweat legging out bucks and then immediately go out and herd all day in sub zero weather if the sobbrother had known that he would have had the floors of congress awash with tears and the senators would have had to go out to the cloakrooms in boats there is a difference of opinion among herders as to whether winter or summer herding is preferable the majority of them seem to favor winter on account of its shorter days but personally i take the other side many a december 21 has seemed longer to me than the longest day summer ever saw as i pointed out before it is possible for a herder to keep reasonably cool through even the hottest summer but there is many a winter day when it is impossible for him to keep warm the great problem for the herder is to wear clothes enough to keep him fairly warm during long periods of inactivity and at the same time to dress lightly enough not to perspire too much when he walks but as in the case of the man who aimed so as to hit it if it was a deer and miss it if it was a cow this can t be done the herder must choose one or the other and his choice will depend on his temperament although i choose the heavy dressing for myself i must admit that one of the most disagreeable of sensations is to have your face fairly stinging with cold and your body bathed in perspiration it seems as if nature were attacking you two ways at once the sheep do not travel nearly so far in winter as in summer the deeper the snow the less inclined they are to ramble but if a thaw happens to clear the snow off they make up for lost time and run as they always do in spring it seems as if they were rejoicing at getting the free use of their legs again thaws and even total disappearance of snow are not uncommon in winter in fact south dakota weather is as much of a gamble as the radio is you set the dial and you hear some worldfamous pianist in new york thundering out a masterpiece and then another touch of the knob and your ears are soothed with the refined strains of the jackass blues sheep like horses paw snow to graze beneath it cattle do not they eat only what sticks above the snow or what they can nuzzle down to when the snow is soft sheep go to work systematically and methodically they paw four or five times with one front foot getting down to the grass and then paw somewhat crosswise to this with the other front foot where the two lines cross there is quite a bit of grass exposed and after cleaning this up they move a step or two and paw again they are seemingly tireless and bottomless when the snow is slightly crusted sheep are still able to paw through it but when the crust is hard or when as often happens there are two or three crusts the band must be fed they do not need water as long as they can get snow it is all the better if they have access to open water but when snow is on the ground they can get along without it this enables the sheepman to get the grass on the high and dry ridges during the winter on the other hand in summer the sheep must be where they can water every day while in spring and fall if they have water every other day they can get along vii one product of this region has gained nation wide if not world wide fame the dakota blizzard whatever the weather does in this part of the country it does with intense and single minded earnestness the force not to say violence of the wind may be judged by the fact that when it is due east or west the transcontinental trains often blow through our railroad towns as much as a day and a half ahead of schedule when the country decides to go dry and stay dry that is in a strictly aqueous sense the fishes have their choice of migrating downstream in their native element or of sticking by the country and playing around in the dust for a while when it decides to rain the culverts come up out of the road for a look around and the bridges play tag with one another down the streams when the weather decides to be hot the natives fry their eggs on their doorsteps and when it decides to be as ornery as it can be it produces its masterpiece the blizzard seven years ago there occurred a blizzard which is still referred to as the march storm while it was a storm of unusual violence it was the same sort of storm that occurs every winter and usually several times a winter this particular storm began on a sunday evening with a light snow and some wind by daylight the blizzard was in full blast it raged all that day with unabated fury and all that night and until about ten o clock tuesday morning thirty six hours in all during that time the wagon although in a comparatively sheltered spot rocked back and forth like a boat on a rough sea the air was so full of wet snow that it was almost impossible to face the wind and draw a breath the weather was not cold and this is characteristic of blizzards but the violence of the wind was such that the sting of the wet snow and sleet on the face and hands was unbearable no beast would face it and no human being did who could possibly avoid it the sheep were in a winter bed ground that is where the lie of the land afforded some shelter but from such a storm as this there was really no protection although we went around the sheep huddled under the bank every fifteen or twenty minutes during the day and even up to midnight yet sometimes during the storm the wind whipped two or three hundred head out of the top of the draw and drove them before it into other shelters we found them after the storm a few here and a few there gathered under banks and in low places the rest were huddled behind the wagon beside a large drift that had formed during the storm some of them half buried in it when we began to pull these out we noticed steam rising from little holes in the snow near them and as we dug we found a ewe at the bottom of each of these holes the steam having been made by her warm breath striking the upper air then we set out to dig the snow bank systematically all that day and parts of the next two we dug sheep out of that bank some alive and some dead the third day we dug out a ewe that was so much alive that it took a saddle horse to run her down when she found she was at liberty once more each ewe as we found her was lying in a hollow place about twice her size where the warmth of her body had melted the surrounding snow there were many sheep that we missed on account of their being in unexplored parts of the drift but altogether that snow bank yielded up thirty four dead sheep and probably as many live ones they had huddled close under the bank to be out of the wind the outside ones had refused to move and the inner ones had been gradually drifted under but our loss heavy as it was was surpassed by that of others one sheepman lost nine hundred head out of twelve hundred the wind had driven them into a swampy place where they bogged down and chilled to death another man a small farmer owned twenty seven head of cattle and a water hole but when the storm was over he had neither water hole nor cattle the water hole had happened to be in the southeast corner of his pasture and the storm had piled the cattle into it and drowned them in some places the barbs of the wire fences were matted with the bloody hair and flesh of horses where a bunch of them had been ground along the wires by the force of the wind the outside horses pressing those inside against the barbs in counting up the loss from such a storm as this you must include not only those that die during the storm but the many others who are so weakened by it that they succumb later storms like this however are simply one of the factors that must be reckoned with by the inhabitants of this region all sections of the country have their drawbacks with the exception of california poets have written voluminously about the beauties of winter but occasionally the thought will obtrude that the bathing beauties of southern california have a slight edge on the somewhat more frigid beauties of ice and snow still we cannot all lie on the sand and lie about the climate and dwellers in our region simply accept snow cold and blizzards as inescapable accompaniments of winter in the great northwest where for weeks on end the hired man has to thaw out the cow s bag with a blowtorch and milk with his mittens on the story of the author s dozen years as a sheep herder will be continued in a second paper

the fed wants to slow inflation without knocking the u s economy into recession a sensitive mission that will include increasing benchmark interest rates washington focused on relentlessly rising prices president joe biden plotted inflation fighting strategy tuesday with the chairman of the federal reserve with the fate of the economy and his own political prospects increasingly dependent on the actions of the government s central bank biden hoped to demonstrate to voters that he was attuned to their worries about higher gasoline grocery and other prices whiles still insisting an independent fed will act free from political pressure like biden the fed wants to slow inflation without knocking the u s economy into recession a highly sensitive mission that is to include increasing benchmark interest rates this summer the president said he would not attempt to direct that course as some previous presidents have tried my plan to address inflation starts with simple proposition respect the fed respect the fed s independence biden said the sit down on a heat drenched late spring day was biden s latest effort to show his dedication to containing the 8 3 leap in consumer prices over the past year rising gas and food costs have angered many americans heading into the midterm elections putting democrats control of the house and senate at risk biden is running out of options on his own his past attempts oil releases from the strategic reserve improving port operations and calls to investigate price gouging have fallen short of satisfactory results high prices have undermined his efforts to highlight the low 3 6 unemployment rate leaving a growing sense of pessimism among americans tuesday s meeting was the first since powell was renominated in november by biden to lead the central bank and came two weeks after his confirmation for a second term by the senate it also represented something of a reversal by biden as inflation weighs heavily on voters minds the president asserted in april 2021 that he was very fastidious about not talking with the independent fed and wanted to avoid being seen as telling them what they should and shouldn t do the white house along with the fed initially portrayed the inflation surge as a temporary side effect caused by supply chain issues as the u s emerged from the pandemic republican lawmakers were fast to criticize biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package from last year as pumping too much money into the economy and causing more inflation that narrative also has held some sway with leading economists who say the financial support was excessive even though it helped the job market roar back the administration has walked back its previous statements treasury secretary janet yellen told cnn on tuesday evening that she did not fully understand the impact that unanticipated large shocks and supply bottlenecks would have on the economy look i think i was wrong then about the path that inflation would take she said but we recognize that now the federal reserve is taking the steps that it needs to take it s up to them to decide what to do inflation has shown signs of moderating but is likely to remain far above the fed s 2 target through the end of this year gas prices are expected to keep rising particularly now that the european union has agreed to cut off 90 of its oil purchases from russia that will force the eu to buy more oil from elsewhere and it drove oil prices to 115 a barrel tuesday this was only the fourth meeting between the president and the federal reserve chair though powell breakfasts as often as once a week with treasury secretary janet yellen who also attended tuesday s meeting along with brian deese the white house national economic council director ahead of the meeting biden suggested that he and powell were aligned on addressing inflation my predecessor demeaned the fed and past presidents have sought to influence its decisions inappropriately during periods of elevated inflation biden said in an op ed posted monday by the wall street journal i won t do this i have appointed highly qualified people from both parties to lead that institution i agree with their assessment that fighting inflation is our top economic challenge right now in contrast president donald trump repeatedly attacked powell after the fed chair oversaw moderate interest rate hikes in 2018 and continued his public criticism even as powell cut rates in 2019 biden s endorsement of the fed s policies a stance echoed by congressional gop leaders gives powell important political cover for a series of sharp interest rate hikes intended to rein in higher prices yet the higher rates could cause layoffs raise the unemployment rate and even tip the economy into recession amid worries that the u s economy may repeat the high persistent inflation of the 1970s the cooperation between biden and powell represents a crucial difference from that time and could make it easier for the fed to restrain higher prices in the early 1970s president richard nixon pressured fed chair arthur burns to lower interest rates to spur the economy before nixon s 1972 reelection campaign nixon s interference is now widely seen as a key contributor to runaway inflation which remained high until the early 1980s that s why comparisons to the 1970s are wrong said sebastian mallaby a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations and author of a biography on former fed chairman alan greenspan the man who knew the president s essay was striking because he explicitly backed the fed biden faces an increasingly global challenge as energy and food costs have jumped after russian president vladimir putin ordered the invasion of ukraine in february simultaneously china imposed lockdowns tied to coronavirus outbreaks that further strained supply chains this has left the european union nursing record inflation and the risks of a recession while u s consumers are increasingly disgruntled by gas prices averaging a nominal record of 4 62 a gallon powell has pledged to keep ratcheting up the fed s key short term interest rate to cool the economy until inflation is coming down in a clear and convincing way but those rate hikes have spurred fears that the fed in its drive to slow borrowing and spending may push the economy into recession that concern has caused sharp drops in stock prices in the past two months though markets rallied last week

the fed wants to slow inflation without knocking the u s economy into recession a sensitive mission that will include increasing benchmark interest rates washington focused on relentlessly rising prices president joe biden plotted inflation fighting strategy tuesday with the chairman of the federal reserve with the fate of the economy and his own political prospects increasingly dependent on the actions of the government s central bank biden hoped to demonstrate to voters that he was attuned to their worries about higher gasoline grocery and other prices whiles still insisting an independent fed will act free from political pressure like biden the fed wants to slow inflation without knocking the u s economy into recession a highly sensitive mission that is to include increasing benchmark interest rates this summer the president said he would not attempt to direct that course as some previous presidents have tried my plan to address inflation starts with simple proposition respect the fed respect the fed s independence biden said the sit down on a heat drenched late spring day was biden s latest effort to show his dedication to containing the 8 3 leap in consumer prices over the past year rising gas and food costs have angered many americans heading into the midterm elections putting democrats control of the house and senate at risk biden is running out of options on his own his past attempts oil releases from the strategic reserve improving port operations and calls to investigate price gouging have fallen short of satisfactory results high prices have undermined his efforts to highlight the low 3 6 unemployment rate leaving a growing sense of pessimism among americans tuesday s meeting was the first since powell was renominated in november by biden to lead the central bank and came two weeks after his confirmation for a second term by the senate it also represented something of a reversal by biden as inflation weighs heavily on voters minds the president asserted in april 2021 that he was very fastidious about not talking with the independent fed and wanted to avoid being seen as telling them what they should and shouldn t do the white house along with the fed initially portrayed the inflation surge as a temporary side effect caused by supply chain issues as the u s emerged from the pandemic republican lawmakers were fast to criticize biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package from last year as pumping too much money into the economy and causing more inflation that narrative also has held some sway with leading economists who say the financial support was excessive even though it helped the job market roar back the administration has walked back its previous statements treasury secretary janet yellen told cnn on tuesday evening that she did not fully understand the impact that unanticipated large shocks and supply bottlenecks would have on the economy look i think i was wrong then about the path that inflation would take she said but we recognize that now the federal reserve is taking the steps that it needs to take it s up to them to decide what to do inflation has shown signs of moderating but is likely to remain far above the fed s 2 target through the end of this year gas prices are expected to keep rising particularly now that the european union has agreed to cut off 90 of its oil purchases from russia that will force the eu to buy more oil from elsewhere and it drove oil prices to 115 a barrel tuesday this was only the fourth meeting between the president and the federal reserve chair though powell breakfasts as often as once a week with treasury secretary janet yellen who also attended tuesday s meeting along with brian deese the white house national economic council director ahead of the meeting biden suggested that he and powell were aligned on addressing inflation my predecessor demeaned the fed and past presidents have sought to influence its decisions inappropriately during periods of elevated inflation biden said in an op ed posted monday by the wall street journal i won t do this i have appointed highly qualified people from both parties to lead that institution i agree with their assessment that fighting inflation is our top economic challenge right now in contrast president donald trump repeatedly attacked powell after the fed chair oversaw moderate interest rate hikes in 2018 and continued his public criticism even as powell cut rates in 2019 biden s endorsement of the fed s policies a stance echoed by congressional gop leaders gives powell important political cover for a series of sharp interest rate hikes intended to rein in higher prices yet the higher rates could cause layoffs raise the unemployment rate and even tip the economy into recession amid worries that the u s economy may repeat the high persistent inflation of the 1970s the cooperation between biden and powell represents a crucial difference from that time and could make it easier for the fed to restrain higher prices in the early 1970s president richard nixon pressured fed chair arthur burns to lower interest rates to spur the economy before nixon s 1972 reelection campaign nixon s interference is now widely seen as a key contributor to runaway inflation which remained high until the early 1980s that s why comparisons to the 1970s are wrong said sebastian mallaby a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations and author of a biography on former fed chairman alan greenspan the man who knew the president s essay was striking because he explicitly backed the fed biden faces an increasingly global challenge as energy and food costs have jumped after russian president vladimir putin ordered the invasion of ukraine in february simultaneously china imposed lockdowns tied to coronavirus outbreaks that further strained supply chains this has left the european union nursing record inflation and the risks of a recession while u s consumers are increasingly disgruntled by gas prices averaging a nominal record of 4 62 a gallon powell has pledged to keep ratcheting up the fed s key short term interest rate to cool the economy

washington focused on relentlessly rising prices president biden plotted inflation fighting strategy tuesday with the chairman of the federal reserve with the fate of the economy and his own political prospects increasingly dependent on the actions of the government s central bank biden hoped to demonstrate to voters that he was attuned to their worries about higher gasoline grocery and other prices whiles still insisting an independent fed will act free from political pressure like biden the fed wants to slow inflation without knocking the u s economy into recession a highly sensitive mission that is to include increasing benchmark interest rates this summer the president said he would not attempt to direct that course as some previous presidents have tried my plan to address inflation starts with simple proposition respect the fed respect the fed s independence biden said the sit down on a heat drenched late spring day was biden s latest effort to show his dedication to containing the 8 3 percent leap in consumer prices over the past year rising gas and food costs have angered many americans heading into the midterm elections putting democrats control of the house and senate at risk biden is running out of options on his own his past attempts oil releases from the strategic reserve improving port operations and calls to investigate price gouging have fallen short of satisfactory results high prices have undermined his efforts to highlight the low 3 6 percent unemployment rate leaving a growing sense of pessimism among americans advertisement tuesday s meeting was the first since powell was renominated in november by biden to lead the central bank and came two weeks after his confirmation for a second term by the senate it also represented something of a reversal by biden as inflation weighs heavily on voters minds the president asserted in april 2021 that he was very fastidious about not talking with the independent fed and wanted to avoid being seen as telling them what they should and shouldn t do the white house along with the fed initially portrayed the inflation surge as a temporary side effect caused by supply chain issues as the u s emerged from the pandemic republican lawmakers were fast to criticize biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package from last year as pumping too much money into the economy and causing more inflation that narrative also has held some sway with leading economists who say the financial support was excessive even though it helped the job market roar back inflation has shown signs of moderating but is likely to remain far above the fed s 2 percent target through the end of this year gas prices are expected to keep rising particularly now that the european union has agreed to cut off 90 percent of its oil purchases from russia that will force the eu to buy more oil from elsewhere and it drove oil prices to 115 a barrel tuesday this was only the fourth meeting between the president and the federal reserve chair though powell breakfasts as often as once a week with treasury secretary janet yellen who also attended tuesday s meeting along with brian deese the white house national economic council director ahead of the meeting biden suggested that he and powell were aligned on addressing inflation advertisement my predecessor demeaned the fed and past presidents have sought to influence its decisions inappropriately during periods of elevated inflation biden said in an op ed posted monday by the wall street journal i won t do this i have appointed highly qualified people from both parties to lead that institution i agree with their assessment that fighting inflation is our top economic challenge right now in contrast president donald trump repeatedly attacked powell after the fed chair oversaw moderate interest rate hikes in 2018 and continued his public criticism even as powell cut rates in 2019 biden s endorsement of the fed s policies a stance echoed by congressional republican leaders gives powell important political cover for a series of sharp interest rate hikes intended to rein in higher prices yet the higher rates could cause layoffs raise the unemployment rate and even tip the economy into recession amid worries that the u s economy may repeat the high persistent inflation of the 1970s the cooperation between biden and powell represents a crucial difference from that time and could make it easier for the fed to restrain higher prices in the early 1970s president richard nixon pressured fed chair arthur burns to lower interest rates to spur the economy before nixon s 1972 reelection campaign nixon s interference is now widely seen as a key contributor to runaway inflation which remained high until the early 1980s that s why comparisons to the 1970s are wrong said sebastian mallaby a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations and author of a biography on former fed chairman alan greenspan the man who knew the president s essay was striking because he explicitly backed the fed biden faces an increasingly global challenge as energy and food costs have jumped after russian president vladimir putin ordered the invasion of ukraine in february simultaneously china imposed lockdowns tied to coronavirus outbreaks that further strained supply chains this has left the european union nursing record inflation and the risks of a recession while u s consumers are increasingly disgruntled by gas prices averaging a nominal record of 4 62 a gallon powell has pledged to keep ratcheting up the fed s key short term interest rate to cool the economy until inflation is coming down in a clear and convincing way but those rate hikes have spurred fears that the fed in its drive to slow borrowing and spending may push the economy into recession that concern has caused sharp drops in stock prices in the past two months though markets rallied last week biden in his op ed indicated that the record setting pace of job creation in the aftermath of the pandemic would slow dramatically suggesting more moderate levels of 150 000 jobs per month from 500 000 that he said would be no warning of weakness but a sign that we are successfully moving into the next phase of recovery as this kind of job growth is consistent with a low unemployment rate and a healthy economy related headlines oil prices surge gas hits new high

in mid may the democratic socialists of america dsa congressional slate voted unanimously for a 40 billion bill endorsing the us led proxy war against russia no member of the dsa delegation issued a public statement explaining their vote and none even so much as tweeted to defend their actions the dsa evidently hoped that nobody would notice an article in the dsa affiliated jacobin magazine reported on the passage of the bill but did not mention the votes cast by the dsa s own members on monday jacobin magazine republished a 1916 article by american socialist eugene debs opposing the first world war and attacking those who attempt to reconcile socialism with support for imperialism in a written introduction jacobin presents itself as the inheritor of debs socialist anti war tradition this memorial day we should rededicate ourselves to fighting the horrors of war so here s a 1916 eugene debs piece about why internationalism is at the heart of socialist politics the dsa is not fighting the horrors of war it is funding them and debs article is a devastating exposure of the dsa itself debs denounces self called socialists who are nationalists first and who set the fatherland of their masters above the whole earth and above all the workers of the world he excoriates the parties of the second international for voting for imperialist war credits such parties and politicians are not socialists at all but traitors to the cause when the tocsin sounded debs continues international obligation was swept away or forgotten and in the frenzy aroused by the military clackers thousands of socialist party members became the intensest of nationalists and patriots utterly denying their international principles and obligations and turning traitors to the movement debs who would be jailed the following year for opposing us imperialism s entry into world war i writes true socialists cannot at the same time be nationalists militarists and capitalist patriots they are either one or the other they cannot be both the dsa s vote for the 40 billion military aid bill is an endorsement of the us led imperialist war which has brought the world to the brink of nuclear catastrophe the dsa acted unanimously with every dsa member voting for the bill including alexandria ocasio cortez jamaal bowman cori bush and rashida tlaib dsa endorsed ilhan omar and bernie sanders also voted yes details of the bill are now emerging which make clear that the dsa and its congressional delegation have endorsed the massive re armament of the american imperialist war machine and signed a blank check to the weapons manufacturers and the military industrial complex the missiles tanks bullets artillery shells drones and attack helicopters stamped made by the dsa will be used not only in ukraine but against the victims of american war all over the world the first weapons contracts made possible by the bill are now coming to light on may 27 the pentagon announced it had awarded raytheon technologies a 624 million contract to replenish the us military s stock of stinger missiles 1 400 of which the us has already sent to the us s far right proxy forces in ukraine citing a raytheon press release announcing the deal axios wrote that the contract is being funded through the 40 billion military and humanitarian aid package that congress passed for ukraine this month and that it will allow raytheon to build 1 300 stinger missiles each missile costs 450 000 enough to pay the yearly salary of ten teachers the dsa has also voted to fund the production of javelin missiles which are produced through a joint venture by raytheon and lockheed martin lockheed martin describes the javelin as the world s premier shoulder fired anti armor system which takes the fight to the enemy each missile costs an estimated 250 000 enough to feed 6 250 malnourished children for a year in the coming weeks new contracts will be announced for the production of advanced munitions such as laser and satellite guided weapons an army spokesperson told defense news last week the army is working on a proposal to use advanced procurement dollars to buy long lead parts and materials for advanced munitions according to an analysis by the think tank csis the bill also provides 6 billion in a special transfer account to provide training equipment weapons logistic support supplies and services salaries and stipends sustainment and intelligence support to the military and national security forces of ukraine i e just about anything ukraine might need csis notes that congress has typically not liked transfer accounts because they look like slush funds in this case the dsa is voting to arm fascist organizations like the azov battalion which hail from the ukrainian collaborators with the nazi holocaust furthermore the bill sends 4 billion to arm the 10 500 us troops in eastern europe including through the procurement of an additional patriot surface to air missile battery an element of the bill which csis noted was a surprise each patriot system costs roughly 1 billion enough to house 30 000 homeless people for a year patriot batteries are also produced by raytheon and lockheed martin the bill also includes 364 million in spending for research and development so that the military and weapons manufacturers can develop even more effective ways to kill and destroy the weapons manufacturers are celebrating the vote a los angeles times headline on may 27 reads buoyed by ukraine war defense stocks escape worst of market slump the article begins lockheed martin corp northrop grumman corp and other makers of military gear have avoided the worst of the broader stock market s recent seven week rout beating the s p 500 amid a pullback in consumer spending tightening monetary policy and concern about a potential recession speaking at a conference at bank of america shortly after the bill passed the house lockheed martin cfo jay malave said he was pleased with the bill and expected congress to increase military spending in the near future since the bill was signed by biden on may 21 lockheed martin s stock has increased four percent and raytheon and general dynamics shares have risen six percent generating millions of dollars for wealthy shareholders who have the dsa ocasio cortez and sanders to thank every dollar the dsa has voted to give to these merchants of death is a dollar it has taken out of the hands of american workers struggling to confront inflation poverty and the rising cost of living the vote will drastically prolong the war and drive prices up even further in the working class districts that the dsa congresspersons represent the average per capita income in alexandria ocasio cortez s new york congressional district is 29 356 and 20 percent of children in the district live below the official poverty line average income in jamaal bowman s new york congressional district is 46 866 and a sixth of children live below the poverty line in cori bush s missouri district the per capita income is 31 086 and 26 percent of children live below the poverty level the residents of rashida tlaib s district in michigan make an average of 21 642 while a staggering 41 percent of the district s children live below the poverty line each politician s vote for war is a vote to deprive hundreds of thousands of the workers in their own districts of basic social necessities the dsa s subordination of the interests of working people to the pentagon and weapons manufacturers is not a mistake it is an expression of its pro imperialist capitalist character this is the role the dsa has played for 40 years as debs wrote true socialists cannot at the same time be nationalists militarists and capitalist patriots they are either one or the other they cannot be both

the fed wants to slow inflation without knocking the u s economy into recession a sensitive mission that will include increasing benchmark interest rates washington focused on relentlessly rising prices president joe biden plotted inflation fighting strategy tuesday with the chairman of the federal reserve with the fate of the economy and his own political prospects increasingly dependent on the actions of the government s central bank biden hoped to demonstrate to voters that he was attuned to their worries about higher gasoline grocery and other prices whiles still insisting an independent fed will act free from political pressure like biden the fed wants to slow inflation without knocking the u s economy into recession a highly sensitive mission that is to include increasing benchmark interest rates this summer the president said he would not attempt to direct that course as some previous presidents have tried my plan to address inflation starts with simple proposition respect the fed respect the fed s independence biden said the sit down on a heat drenched late spring day was biden s latest effort to show his dedication to containing the 8 3 leap in consumer prices over the past year rising gas and food costs have angered many americans heading into the midterm elections putting democrats control of the house and senate at risk biden is running out of options on his own his past attempts oil releases from the strategic reserve improving port operations and calls to investigate price gouging have fallen short of satisfactory results high prices have undermined his efforts to highlight the low 3 6 unemployment rate leaving a growing sense of pessimism among americans tuesday s meeting was the first since powell was renominated in november by biden to lead the central bank and came two weeks after his confirmation for a second term by the senate it also represented something of a reversal by biden as inflation weighs heavily on voters minds the president asserted in april 2021 that he was very fastidious about not talking with the independent fed and wanted to avoid being seen as telling them what they should and shouldn t do the white house along with the fed initially portrayed the inflation surge as a temporary side effect caused by supply chain issues as the u s emerged from the pandemic republican lawmakers were fast to criticize biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package from last year as pumping too much money into the economy and causing more inflation that narrative also has held some sway with leading economists who say the financial support was excessive even though it helped the job market roar back the administration has walked back its previous statements treasury secretary janet yellen told cnn on tuesday evening that she did not fully understand the impact that unanticipated large shocks and supply bottlenecks would have on the economy look i think i was wrong then about the path that inflation would take she said but we recognize that now the federal reserve is taking the steps that it needs to take it s up to them to decide what to do inflation has shown signs of moderating but is likely to remain far above the fed s 2 target through the end of this year gas prices are expected to keep rising particularly now that the european union has agreed to cut off 90 of its oil purchases from russia that will force the eu to buy more oil from elsewhere and it drove oil prices to 115 a barrel tuesday this was only the fourth meeting between the president and the federal reserve chair though powell breakfasts as often as once a week with treasury secretary janet yellen who also attended tuesday s meeting along with brian deese the white house national economic council director ahead of the meeting biden suggested that he and powell were aligned on addressing inflation my predecessor demeaned the fed and past presidents have sought to influence its decisions inappropriately during periods of elevated inflation biden said in an op ed posted monday by the wall street journal i won t do this i have appointed highly qualified people from both parties to lead that institution i agree with their assessment that fighting inflation is our top economic challenge right now in contrast president donald trump repeatedly attacked powell after the fed chair oversaw moderate interest rate hikes in 2018 and continued his public criticism even as powell cut rates in 2019 biden s endorsement of the fed s policies a stance echoed by congressional gop leaders gives powell important political cover for a series of sharp interest rate hikes intended to rein in higher prices yet the higher rates could cause layoffs raise the unemployment rate and even tip the economy into recession amid worries that the u s economy may repeat the high persistent inflation of the 1970s the cooperation between biden and powell represents a crucial difference from that time and could make it easier for the fed to restrain higher prices in the early 1970s president richard nixon pressured fed chair arthur burns to lower interest rates to spur the economy before nixon s 1972 reelection campaign nixon s interference is now widely seen as a key contributor to runaway inflation which remained high until the early 1980s that s why comparisons to the 1970s are wrong said sebastian mallaby a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations and author of a biography on former fed chairman alan greenspan the man who knew the president s essay was striking because he

the fed wants to slow inflation without knocking the u s economy into recession a sensitive mission that will include increasing benchmark interest rates washington focused on relentlessly rising prices president joe biden plotted inflation fighting strategy tuesday with the chairman of the federal reserve with the fate of the economy and his own political prospects increasingly dependent on the actions of the government s central bank biden hoped to demonstrate to voters that he was attuned to their worries about higher gasoline grocery and other prices whiles still insisting an independent fed will act free from political pressure like biden the fed wants to slow inflation without knocking the u s economy into recession a highly sensitive mission that is to include increasing benchmark interest rates this summer the president said he would not attempt to direct that course as some previous presidents have tried my plan to address inflation starts with simple proposition respect the fed respect the fed s independence biden said the sit down on a heat drenched late spring day was biden s latest effort to show his dedication to containing the 8 3 leap in consumer prices over the past year rising gas and food costs have angered many americans heading into the midterm elections putting democrats control of the house and senate at risk biden is running out of options on his own his past attempts oil releases from the strategic reserve improving port operations and calls to investigate price gouging have fallen short of satisfactory results high prices have undermined his efforts to highlight the low 3 6 unemployment rate leaving a growing sense of pessimism among americans tuesday s meeting was the first since powell was renominated in november by biden to lead the central bank and came two weeks after his confirmation for a second term by the senate it also represented something of a reversal by biden as inflation weighs heavily on voters minds the president asserted in april 2021 that he was very fastidious about not talking with the independent fed and wanted to avoid being seen as telling them what they should and shouldn t do the white house along with the fed initially portrayed the inflation surge as a temporary side effect caused by supply chain issues as the u s emerged from the pandemic republican lawmakers were fast to criticize biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package from last year as pumping too much money into the economy and causing more inflation that narrative also has held some sway with leading economists who say the financial support was excessive even though it helped the job market roar back the administration has walked back its previous statements treasury secretary janet yellen told cnn on tuesday evening that she did not fully understand the impact that unanticipated large shocks and supply bottlenecks would have on the economy look i think i was wrong then about the path that inflation would take she said but we recognize that now the federal reserve is taking the steps that it needs to take it s up to them to decide what to do inflation has shown signs of moderating but is likely to remain far above the fed s 2 target through the end of this year gas prices are expected to keep rising particularly now that the european union has agreed to cut off 90 of its oil purchases from russia that will force the eu to buy more oil from elsewhere and it drove oil prices to 115 a barrel tuesday this was only the fourth meeting between the president and the federal reserve chair though powell breakfasts as often as once a week with treasury secretary janet yellen who also attended tuesday s meeting along with brian deese the white house national economic council director ahead of the meeting biden suggested that he and powell were aligned on addressing inflation my predecessor demeaned the fed and past presidents have sought to influence its decisions inappropriately during periods of elevated inflation biden said in an op ed posted monday by the wall street journal i won t do this i have appointed highly qualified people from both parties to lead that institution i agree with their assessment that fighting inflation is our top economic challenge right now in contrast president donald trump repeatedly attacked powell after the fed chair oversaw moderate interest rate hikes in 2018 and continued his public criticism even as powell cut rates in 2019 biden s endorsement of the fed s policies a stance echoed by congressional gop leaders gives powell important political cover for a series of sharp interest rate hikes intended to rein in higher prices yet the higher rates could cause layoffs raise the unemployment rate and even tip the economy into recession amid worries that the u s economy may repeat the high persistent inflation of the 1970s the cooperation between biden and powell represents a crucial difference from that time and could make it easier for the fed to restrain higher prices in the early 1970s president richard nixon pressured fed chair arthur burns to lower interest rates to spur the economy before nixon s 1972 reelection campaign nixon s interference is now widely seen as a key contributor to runaway inflation which remained high until the early 1980s that s why comparisons to the 1970s are wrong said sebastian mallaby a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations and author of a biography on former fed chairman alan greenspan the man who knew the president s essay was striking because he

tuesday at least temporarily the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was still chugging along near 32 000 the threshold it crossed during midday trading the follow up to a u s holiday weekend surge bitcoin has risen nearly 8 over the last nearly four days still analysts remained cautious about predicting any long term bounce to the upside amid ongoing inflationary concerns and the prospect of a recession the emerging rebound from the bottom may be self sustaining at first as many market participants believe that the crypto market has corrected enough to become attractive for long term buying fxpro senior market analyst alex kuptsikevich wrote however fundamentals such as halving soft monetary policy or accelerated adoption are needed for growth to continue bitcoin was

plans to begin reopening its economy and u s president joe biden met with fed chair jerome powell and u s treasury secretary janet yellen to discuss ways to combat inflation in an appearance on coindesk tv s first mover program tuesday opimas ceo and founder octavio marenzi noted that possible federal reserve flexibility about a rate hike much later in the year after it raises rates at its next two meetings had given crypto markets breathing room to say maybe they re going to go back to printing more money more rapidly that s helping crypto in the very very short term but i think we re likely to be disappointed in that in the long term markets s p 500 4 132 0 6 djia 32 990 0 6 nasdaq 12 081 0 4 gold 1 838 0 7 insights tether s various banking relationships don t matter until we know the whole picture the financial times has a story this week about some of tether s 73 billion in reserves being stored at a relatively obscure bahamas bank called capital union the bank has around 1 billion in assets so only a small portion of tether s reserves could be stored there historically tether has been something of a banking vagabond it initially opened accounts in taiwan and this is the likely subject of a u s department of justice probe and when corresponding banking access was cut off tether moved on to montreal and puerto rico none of this really matters according to tether which has declined to fully disclose its banking relationships because tether can process redemptions conversion of its usdt stablecoin to fiat u s dollars upon request tether maintains strong banking relationships with more than seven eight banks across the world this would be as far as the disclosures will go indeed in the aftermath of the collapse of terra s ust stablecoin tether has processed 10 billion in stablecoin redemptions but the market would disagree in the weeks since terra s ust first started showing signs of trouble tether has had to fight to maintain its 1 1 peg with the dollar circle s usdc hasn t had the same problem in fact its stablecoin has been pushed above the peg as a result of inbound capital tether s desire to keep the nature of its banking relationships and reserves secret has already cost it 18 5 million which is what it paid out in a settlement with the office of the new york attorney general perhaps tether believed that if it were totally honest and disclosed its relationships and the nature of its holdings backing its dollar peg the resulting market chaos would cost it more than 18 5 million the articles of faith around tether involve the ability for it to process redemptions and so far that has held and succeeded in times of crisis so no need to list out its banking partners and cause unnecessary trouble the question is will this rationale hold and will tether s peg be maintained through this coming bear market technician s take bitcoin relief bounce faces resistance at 33k 35k bitcoin btc broke above a short term downtrend over the weekend and reclaimed the 30 000 price level the cryptocurrency is experiencing a relief bounce after several weeks of oversold readings on the charts still resistance at 33 000 and 35 000 could stall the upswing in price the relative strength index rsi on the daily chart has risen from oversold levels over the past two weeks which supported the buildup in price momentum the 14 day rsi is currently neutral and will need to remain above 50 in order to sustain the relief bounce on the weekly chart the rsi is the most oversold since march 2020 which preceded a crypto rally this time however the significant loss of long term momentum suggests upside could be limited for now price action could stabilize above the 27 000 30 000 support zone which could delay additional breakdowns on

shifts in the next year from current levels of 500 000 to something closer to 150 000 it will be a sign that we are successfully moving into the next phase of recovery as this kind of job growth is consistent with a low unemployment rate and a healthy economy things should also look different from the decades before the pandemic when too often we had low growth low wage gains and an economy that

purchases from russia that will force the eu to buy more oil from elsewhere and it drove oil prices to 115 a barrel tuesday this was only the fourth meeting between the president and the federal reserve chair though powell breakfasts as often as once a week with treasury secretary janet yellen who also attended tuesday s meeting along with brian deese the white house national economic council director ahead of the meeting biden suggested that he and powell were aligned on addressing inflation my predecessor demeaned the fed and past presidents have sought to influence its decisions inappropriately during periods of elevated inflation biden said in an op ed posted monday by the wall street journal i won t do this i have appointed highly qualified people from both parties to lead that institution i agree with their assessment that fighting inflation is our top economic challenge right now in contrast president donald trump repeatedly attacked powell after the fed chair oversaw moderate interest rate hikes in 2018 and continued his public criticism even as powell cut rates in 2019 biden s endorsement of the fed s policies a stance echoed by congressional gop leaders gives powell important political cover for a series of sharp interest rate hikes intended to rein in higher prices yet the higher rates could cause layoffs raise the unemployment rate and even tip the economy into recession amid worries that the u s economy may repeat the high persistent inflation of the 1970s the cooperation between biden and powell represents a crucial difference from that time and could make it easier for the fed to restrain higher prices in the early 1970s president richard nixon pressured fed chair arthur burns to lower interest rates to spur the economy before nixon s 1972 reelection campaign nixon s interference is now widely seen as a key contributor to runaway inflation which remained high until the early 1980s that s why comparisons to the 1970s are wrong said sebastian mallaby a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations and author of a biography on former fed chairman alan greenspan the man who knew the president s essay was striking because he explicitly backed the fed biden faces an increasingly global challenge as energy and food costs have jumped after russian president vladimir putin ordered the invasion of ukraine in february simultaneously china imposed lockdowns tied to coronavirus outbreaks that further strained supply chains this has left the european union nursing record inflation and the risks of a recession while u s consumers are increasingly disgruntled by gas prices averaging a nominal record of 4 62 a gallon powell has pledged to keep ratcheting up the fed s key short term interest rate to cool the economy until inflation is coming down in a clear and convincing way but those rate hikes have spurred fears that the fed in its drive to slow borrowing and spending may push the economy into recession that concern has caused sharp drops in stock prices in the past two months though markets rallied last week

biologics license application bla for remestemcel l in the treatment of children with steroid refractory graft versus host disease sr agvhd to the united states food and drug administration fda mesoblast believes that the proposed potency assay measuring remestemcel l s in vitro anti inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity helps establish a clear understanding of remestemcel l s mechanism of action in sr agvhd and demonstrates relevance to the in vivo clinical effect of the product in the 54 patient phase 3 trial in children with sr agvhd an investigator initiated controlled study in children with sr agvhd stratified by baseline levels of inflammatory biomarkers published late 2021 in the peer reviewed journal bone marrow transplantation 3 showed that remestemcel l provided a significant benefit in terms of both response and survival in children with the highest levels of inflammation and at greatest risk of death compared to best available therapy showed that remestemcel l provided a significant benefit in terms of both response and survival in children with the highest levels of inflammation and at greatest risk of death compared to best available therapy the study

washington following mass shootings in new york and texas the u s house judiciary committee is holding an emergency meeting on thursday to mark up gun control legislation though it s likely doomed the package includes eight gun related bills known as the protecting our kids act and they are expected to pass the democratic controlled house but the legislation has little chance of making it through the evenly divided senate where 60 votes would be required for any bill to advance assuming every democrat was in favor they would need 10 republicans to join the house package would raise the age of purchasing semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21 create new requirements for storing guns in a home with children prevent gun trafficking require all firearms to be traceable and close the loophole on bump stocks among other things the meeting was scheduled by committee chairman jerry nadler a new york democrat after a white supremacist killed 10 black people at a supermarket in a predominantly black neighborhood in buffalo new york on may 14 ten days later an elementary school in uvalde texas was attacked by an 18 year old man armed with a rifle and 19 children and two teachers were killed meanwhile with both the house and senate in recess this week a small bipartisan group of senators is also holding virtual talks to see if it is possible to develop any legislation on guns last week hours after the uvalde slaughter senate minority leader mitch mcconnell a kentucky republican did not commit to working on any gun control legislation with democrats however a few senate republicans seemed open to the idea of red flag laws which allow the courts or law enforcement to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is distressed over the memorial day weekend sen chris murphy a connecticut democrat who s worked for years to attempt to pass gun reform laws tweeted that he s been talking with senators of both parties about putting together a bipartisan gun violence bill senator schumer has given us just over a week to find a compromise he wrote this time failure cannot be an option senate majority leader chuck schumer a new york democrat said that if republicans do not work with democrats to come to an agreement the senate will still hold a vote on gun control legislation even if it fails when the chamber returns from recess after the uvalde massacre the nation s second deadliest mass school shooting since sandy hook elementary a decade ago schumer took a procedural step to begin debate on two background check bills with the possibility of calling for votes on them the house passed bills are h r 8 which establishes new background check requirements for firearm transfers between private parties and h r 1446 which increases the amount of time that a federal firearms licensee must wait to receive a completed background check prior to transferring a firearm to an unlicensed person on sunday president joe biden visited uvalde and called on congress to stand up against the gun lobby and send a bill to his desk gun rights groups such as the national rifle association and gun owners of america spent a record of nearly 16 million in lobbying in 2021 campaign finance records show i will meet with congress on guns i promise you biden told reporters tuesday the senate judiciary committee is set to hold a hearing on gun violence june 15

a sprawling gun show billed as 14 acres of guns gear was the main attraction at the the national rifle association s annual convention in houston this past weekend and even in the aftermath of the carnage in nearby uvalde where 19 children and two adults were massacred by a teenager with an assault weapon nra members poured in by the thousands to gawk at the gun industry s latest sexiest deadliest wares in addition to the expected panoply of pistols revolvers shotguns and ar 15s the showroom featured one booth with a machine that lets you mill your own untraceable gun out of a block of aluminum more from rolling stone advertisement advertisement the ghost gunner is a computer operated tabletop boring and machining device capable of producing complete mil spec and unregistered ar 15 receiver in the privacy of your own home a receiver is the regulated part of the modular ar 15 the part that normally requires a serial number and can t be bought at a gun shop without passing a background check and this machine while ostensibly aimed at the diy enthusiast could also enable a criminal prohibited from buying a gun to produce their own military grade weapon the ghost gunner is just one extreme example of dozens of vendors at the nra s big show who catered to the dangerous fringes of the gun buying public their products and paraphernalia were positioned to appeal to patriot members of militia movements and even violent extremists like the boogaloo bois who seek to provoke a new civil war to walk the showroom floor in houston is to experience a world of gun commerce without guardrails there are responsible sellers here of course looking to connect with responsible buyers who may want a new rifle for hunting or a handgun to ward off home invaders but in this crowded marketplace other vendors push the envelope in search of profits making grotesque appeals to unwell people in ways that seem destined to amplify the nation s crisis of deadly gun violence gone are the days when gunsellers pretended to be selling benign modern sporting rifles at the nra show many brands were trading on dark imagery of societal collapse pitching military grade hardware to civilians on the theory that they might find themselves in war zone of a future failed state black rain ordnance whose post apocalyptic logo is the biohazard symbol was selling an ar painted with the texas flag and militia friendly branding calling the rifle the bro patriot the ejection port dust flap is printed with the words let it rain the booth for kalashnikov usa with the prepper friendly tagline be ready stay ready featured semiautomatic shotgun called the kaos nemesis arms a kentucky based gun maker named after the greek goddess of retribution marketed what it dubs the true survival rifle for big boys advertisement advertisement several vendors even appealed to the unique aesthetic of the boogaloo movement a loose collection of meme driven violent extremists who are prepping for an impending civil war they dress in loud hawaiian print shirts and show up at public events armed to the teeth ready for the outbreak of a conflict they call the boogaloo or the big luau an ar seller called dark storm industries marketed its ar platform guns with the poster of a menacing rifle toting man wearing a tropical button up shirt stag arms was more explicit marketing an ar 15 rifle painted in a hawaiian floral camo it calls the aloha nearby a clothing vendor was selling red and yellow hawaiian shirts with images of ar 15s mixed into the floral print there s a certain honesty to these marketing campaigns the weapons they re selling are derived from military guns designed to empower relatively unskilled marksmen kill lots of people as efficiently as possible the real world use case for these guns isn t hunting it s warfare in flag waving speeches the weekend seeking to deflect public rage from the gun industry nra executives held up the rank and file members of the association as decent and honorable men and women first responders former military even educators who simply want to preserve a human right to self defense but down on the show room products catered to the darkest reaches the armed american id one t shirt featured a cartoon of a horny looking 50 caliber round holding up a sign that read i wanna be inside you advertisement advertisement houston s george r brown convention center is a glass faced postmodern colossus built to accentuate its exposed steel beams and air ducts which are painted in bold patriotic reds whites and blues the three story convention center stretches five full city blocks and the main showroom on the first floor occupies at least four the gun show is the focal point of the annual meeting and underscores the extent to which the nra now stands as a front group for the firearms industry the nra had pitched its annual meeting to firearms companies by insisting nra members are your best customers can you afford not to be here in 2022 and it touted the audience of wealthy avid gun buyers it could bring to its booths houston in the muggy heat of the park across the street from the convention center i met a 52 year old veteran named todd brannon wearing an army logo shirt with flag print sleeves brannon sported a salt and pepper beard and baseball cap and he was sitting in a lawn chair taking a cigarette break but the former tank platoon leader wasn t here to attend the convention rather to protest it he held a sign reading veterans for sane gun laws brannon was outraged that the nra carried on with is convention despite the bloodshed in uvalde and he drove down to houston in the hopes that nra members might see someone over here that looks like them and stop and think that what s happened in our country isn t acceptable advertisement advertisement instead of the madness of attempting to fortify schools brannon argues and forcing kids to go through these drills and imagine a world where they re gonna get shot in their classroom the country should be working to ban assault weapons which he insists are designed for soldiers to kill other soldiers there s no reason for a civilian to have a weapon like that brannon recognizes that america s gun culture has become seductive and says there s a segment of the population that s conflating patriotism with the gun but he argues this fetishisizing culture around firearms should be embarrassing to those caught up in it if you love guns and want to play with big guns then join the fucking army he says that s it enlist the scene on the showroom proves brannon s point but while there s endless fetishization of everything from ar 15s and kalashnikovs to sleek black glocks and candy colored pistols there s not an iota of embarrassment not from the nra members strolling the floor with blissed out smiles on their faces not from the houston cops i saw in full uniform holding up short barrelled shotguns pistols and even a metal bat covered with spikes and not from the vendors hawking chick fil a sandwiches or cell service from patriot mobile america s only christian conservative wireless provider the showroom had the same energy as the floor of a las vegas casino except instead of the sound of slot machines the air is filled with the noise of men and women clicking the triggers of deadly weapons the convention featured real guns but the firearms were all subtly disabled to be incapable of live fire i was told by several vendors that they couldn t sell me a gun directly but could have one shipped to a licensed dealer near me advertisement advertisement i ve covered guns in america consistently since the newtown massacre i ve shot a daniel defense assault rifle at a gun range and i ve spent hours at my local cabelas getting pointers on different models i ve written a cultural history of the ar 15 favored by the nation s mass shooters from newtown to parkland to uvalde but nothing prepared me for the orgy of assault weapons on display at this gun show convention vendors hawk more than just guns including knives axes body armor gun silencers conceal carry purses holsters that clip to a bra and apparel with slogans like ammosexual and the pew pew life yet one could not walk more than 100 feet before being confronted with a new display wall of assault rifles mostly ar platform tricked out in every color and configuration imaginable one of the salient features of most ar rifles is that they re long bulky intimidating it s a small boon for public safety because they draw a lot of attention but an alarming number of vendors also touted the portability of their assault weapons a company called tx tactical showed me a double foldar ar 15 pistol it features both a barrel and stock that can fold up over the ar body to fit into a small 10 inch tactical side pack included with purchase the company s website touts the highest level of concealability possible allowing owners to transport the platform in ways never before possible this notion of taking your ar to town was popular at the nra gun show a company called savior equipment offered a series of faux guitar cases fitted with foam inserts to transport your ar like you were on your way to band practice one model on the showroom floor also had cutouts for bottle of vodka and a couple of faux hand grenades this same company offered a tactical gun bag branded urban warfare and another called the coffin advertisement advertisement the right wing bent of members was assumed and there was no shortage of political gear for sale with let s go brandon hats t shirts and softball jerseys in abundance you could buy a silver coin minted with the 45th president s face on it from a dealer who also sold nra logo and thin blue line flag coins but at least one seller was putting trump slogans on actual gun gear selling high capacity magazines featuring the punisher skull logo and the words make america great again hearts without god there were few reminders inside the showroom hall that the weapons on display with the exception of a relatively modest selection of hunting rifles and shotguns were designed to kill other human beings however i did encounter one vendor that specialized in lightweight bulletproof material including flexible car seat covers and window curtains he also displayed a line of bulletproof skateboards for kids and even bulletproof school dropoff signs for the owner the shooting in uvalde presents a business opportunity as politicians rush to harden classrooms as a strategy to deter future shooters schools are going to buying he predicts there s going to be billions of dollars in grant money advertisement advertisement a central theme of the convention speeches in houston was that school shootings cannot be blamed on the mainstreaming of assault weapons or on lax gun laws that enable 18 year olds to buy such weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition without being flagged as a potential threat to the public instead they insisted the problem is a rising tide of evil this messaging refers to a biblical definition of that word and appeals to a hard right christian conservative crowd that is convinced mainstream american culture is literally on a path to hell in line behind me waiting for donald trump to speak on friday afternoon a loud gentleman named cecil from mississippi explained uvalde as a fall from grace we as a nation have turned our backs on god he said you can t expect his protection and a t shirt on sale in the convention showroom offered a similar explanation the problem is not guns it read it s hearts without god homes without discipline schools without prayer courts without justice inside the convention hall nra members could be overheard speaking dismissively about the pro gun control demonstrators outside mocking them as jobless pissants or idiots with nasty signs i heard one young man tell another walk by and they ll call you a murderer the second young man spoke of trolling the crowd by donning a trump t shirt for three days these protesters gathered in the sweltering heat behind police barricades across the street from the convention centers in the late afternoon they would jeer at nra members exiting the convention center and crossing to an underground parking garage they shouted slogans like you are weak men and you re not pro life or chanted shame on you and guilty guilty guilty advertisement advertisement janellys sonera a 24 year old bronx native who lives in houston held up a pink cardboard sign reading the govt should regulate guns as much as they regulate women s bodies she tells me she s protesting because it s easier for people to get guns right now than it is for them to get baby formula she wants new gun restrictions people aren t allowed to drink at 18 but they re allowed to have guns at 18 she says and it just doesn t make sense to me jack hill a 72 year old retired professor from waco texas holds aloft a sign that reads ban assault weapons now he warns that the maga movement is a cauldron of fascism and blames the nra for its stranglehold on the modern gop such that not a

a sprawling gun show billed as 14 acres of guns gear was the main attraction at the the national rifle association s annual convention in houston this past weekend and even in the aftermath of the carnage in nearby uvalde where 19 children and two adults were massacred by a teenager with an assault weapon nra members poured in by the thousands to gawk at the gun industry s latest sexiest deadliest wares in addition to the expected panoply of pistols revolvers shotguns and ar 15s the showroom featured one booth with a machine that lets you mill your own untraceable gun out of a block of aluminum the ghost gunner is a computer operated tabletop boring and machining device capable of producing complete mil spec and unregistered ar 15 receiver in the privacy of your own home a receiver is the regulated part of the modular ar 15 the part that normally requires a serial number and can t be bought at a gun shop without passing a background check and this machine while ostensibly aimed at the diy enthusiast could also enable a criminal prohibited from buying a gun to produce their own military grade weapon the ghost gunner is just one extreme example of dozens of vendors at the nra s big show who catered to the dangerous fringes of the gun buying public their products and paraphernalia were positioned to appeal to patriot members of militia movements and even violent extremists like the boogaloo bois who seek to provoke a new civil war to walk the showroom floor in houston is to experience a world of gun commerce without guardrails there are responsible sellers here of course looking to connect with responsible buyers who may want a new rifle for hunting or a handgun to ward off home invaders but in this crowded marketplace other vendors push the envelope in search of profits making grotesque appeals to unwell people in ways that seem destined to amplify the nation s crisis of deadly gun violence editor s picks gone are the days when gunsellers pretended to be selling benign modern sporting rifles at the nra show many brands were trading on dark imagery of societal collapse pitching military grade hardware to civilians on the theory that they might find themselves in war zone of a future failed state black rain ordnance whose post apocalyptic logo is the biohazard symbol was selling an ar painted with the texas flag and militia friendly branding calling the rifle the bro patriot the ejection port dust flap is printed with the words let it rain the booth for kalashnikov usa with the prepper friendly tagline be ready stay ready featured semiautomatic shotgun called the kaos nemesis arms a kentucky based gun maker named after the greek goddess of retribution marketed what it dubs the true survival rifle for big boys several vendors even appealed to the unique aesthetic of the boogaloo movement a loose collection of meme driven violent extremists who are prepping for an impending civil war they dress in loud hawaiian print shirts and show up at public events armed to the teeth ready for the outbreak of a conflict they call the boogaloo or the big luau an ar seller called dark storm industries marketed its ar platform guns with the poster of a menacing rifle toting man wearing a tropical button up shirt stag arms was more explicit marketing an ar 15 rifle painted in a hawaiian floral camo it calls the aloha nearby a clothing vendor was selling red and yellow hawaiian shirts with images of ar 15s mixed into the floral print there s a certain honesty to these marketing campaigns the weapons they re selling are derived from military guns designed to empower relatively unskilled marksmen kill lots of people as efficiently as possible the real world use case for these guns isn t hunting it s warfare in flag waving speeches the weekend seeking to deflect public rage from the gun industry nra executives held up the rank and file members of the association as decent and honorable men and women first responders former military even educators who simply want to preserve a human right to self defense but down on the show room products catered to the darkest reaches the armed american id one t shirt featured a cartoon of a horny looking 50 caliber round holding up a sign that read i wanna be inside you houston s george r brown convention center is a glass faced postmodern colossus built to accentuate its exposed steel beams and air ducts which are painted in bold patriotic reds whites and blues the three story convention center stretches five full city blocks and the main showroom on the first floor occupies at least four related the gun show is the focal point of the annual meeting and underscores the extent to which the nra now stands as a front group for the firearms industry the nra had pitched its annual meeting to firearms companies by insisting nra members are your best customers can you afford not to be here in 2022 and it touted the audience of wealthy avid gun buyers it could bring to its booths houston in the muggy heat of the park across the street from the convention center i met a 52 year old veteran named todd brannon wearing an army logo shirt with flag print sleeves brannon sported a salt and pepper beard and baseball cap and he was sitting in a lawn chair taking a cigarette break but the former tank platoon leader wasn t here to attend the convention rather to protest it he held a sign reading veterans for sane gun laws brannon was outraged that the nra carried on with is convention despite the bloodshed in uvalde and he drove down to houston in the hopes that nra members might see someone over here that looks like them and stop and think that what s happened in our country isn t acceptable instead of the madness of attempting to fortify schools brannon argues and forcing kids to go through these drills and imagine a world where they re gonna get shot in their classroom the country should be working to ban assault weapons which he insists are designed for soldiers to kill other soldiers there s no reason for a civilian to have a weapon like that brannon recognizes that america s gun culture has become seductive and says there s a segment of the population that s conflating patriotism with the gun but he argues this fetishisizing culture around firearms should be embarrassing to those caught up in it if you love guns and want to play with big guns then join the fucking army he says that s it enlist the scene on the showroom proves brannon s point but while there s endless fetishization of everything from ar 15s and kalashnikovs to sleek black glocks and candy colored pistols there s not an iota of embarrassment not from the nra members strolling the floor with blissed out smiles on their faces not from the houston cops i saw in full uniform holding up short barrelled shotguns pistols and even a metal bat covered with spikes and not from the vendors hawking chick fil a sandwiches or cell service from patriot mobile america s only christian conservative wireless provider the showroom had the same energy as the floor of a las vegas casino except instead of the sound of slot machines the air is filled with the noise of men and women clicking the triggers of deadly weapons the convention featured real guns but the firearms were all subtly disabled to be incapable of live fire i was told by several vendors that they couldn t sell me a gun directly but could have one shipped to a licensed dealer near me i ve covered guns in america consistently since the newtown massacre i ve shot a daniel defense assault rifle at a gun range and i ve spent hours at my local cabelas getting pointers on different models i ve written a cultural history of the ar 15 favored by the nation s mass shooters from newtown to parkland to uvalde but nothing prepared me for the orgy of assault weapons on display at this gun show convention vendors hawk more than just guns including knives axes body armor gun silencers conceal carry purses holsters that clip to a bra and apparel with slogans like ammosexual and the pew pew life yet one could not walk more than 100 feet before being confronted with a new display wall of assault rifles mostly ar platform tricked out in every color and configuration imaginable one of the salient features of most ar rifles is that they re long bulky intimidating it s a small boon for public safety because they draw a lot of attention but an alarming number of vendors also touted the portability of their assault weapons a company called tx tactical showed me a double foldar ar 15 pistol it features both a barrel and stock that can fold up over the ar body to fit into a small 10 inch tactical side pack included with purchase the company s website touts the highest level of concealability possible allowing owners to transport the platform in ways never before possible this notion of taking your ar to town was popular at the nra gun show a company called savior equipment offered a series of faux guitar cases fitted with foam inserts to transport your ar like you were on your way to band practice one model on the showroom floor also had cutouts for bottle of vodka and a couple of faux hand grenades this same company offered a tactical gun bag branded urban warfare and another called the coffin the right wing bent of members was assumed and there was no shortage of political gear for sale with let s go brandon hats t shirts and softball jerseys in abundance you could buy a silver coin minted with the 45th president s face on it from a dealer who also sold nra logo and thin blue line flag coins but at least one seller was putting trump slogans on actual gun gear selling high capacity magazines featuring the punisher skull logo and the words make america great again hearts without god there were few reminders inside the showroom hall that the weapons on display with the exception of a relatively modest selection of hunting rifles and shotguns were designed to kill other human beings however i did encounter one vendor that specialized in lightweight bulletproof material including flexible car seat covers and window curtains he also displayed a line of bulletproof skateboards for kids and even bulletproof school dropoff signs for the owner the shooting in uvalde presents a business opportunity as politicians rush to harden classrooms as a strategy to deter future shooters schools are going to buying he predicts there s going to be billions of dollars in grant money a central theme of the convention speeches in houston was that school shootings cannot be blamed on the mainstreaming of assault weapons or on lax gun laws that enable 18 year olds to buy such weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition without being flagged as a potential threat to the public instead they insisted the problem is a rising tide of evil this messaging refers to a biblical definition of that word and appeals to a hard right christian conservative crowd that is convinced mainstream american culture is literally on a path to hell in line behind me waiting for donald trump to speak on friday afternoon a loud gentleman named cecil from mississippi explained uvalde as a fall from grace we as a nation have turned our backs on god he said you can t expect his protection and a t shirt on sale in the convention showroom offered a similar explanation the problem is not guns it read it s hearts without god homes without discipline schools without prayer courts without justice inside the convention hall nra members could be overheard speaking dismissively about the pro gun control demonstrators outside mocking them as jobless pissants or idiots with nasty signs i heard one young man tell another walk by and they ll call you a murderer the second young man spoke of trolling the crowd by donning a trump t shirt for three days these protesters gathered in the sweltering heat behind police barricades across the street from the convention centers in the late afternoon they would jeer at nra members exiting the convention center and crossing to an underground parking garage they shouted slogans like you are weak men and you re not pro life or chanted shame on you and guilty guilty guilty janellys sonera a 24 year old bronx native who lives in houston held up a pink cardboard sign reading the govt should regulate guns as much as they regulate women s bodies she tells me she s protesting because it s easier for people to get guns right now than it is for them to get baby formula she wants new gun restrictions people aren t allowed to drink at 18 but they re allowed to have guns at 18 she says and it just doesn t make sense to me jack hill a 72 year old retired professor from waco texas holds aloft a sign that reads ban assault weapons now he warns that the maga movement is a cauldron of fascism and blames the nra for its stranglehold on the modern gop such

u s consumer confidence eased modestly in may as persistently high inflation and rising interest rates force americans to become more cautious about buying big ticket items including motor vehicles and houses which could curtail economic growth the survey from the conference board on tuesday also showed consumers perceptions of the labor market softening a bit this month though the drop in confidence was small it suggested that the federal reserve s aggressive monetary policy actions to slow demand were starting to have an impact we can never underestimate the u s consumer said jennifer lee a senior economist at bmo capital markets in toronto but plans to pull back on purchases and become a little more cautious is something that the federal reserve would welcome as it aims to cool demand the conference board s consumer confidence index slipped to a reading of 106 4 this month data for april was revised higher to show the index at 108 6 instead of the previously reported reading of 107 3 the index remains above its pandemic lows it has fared much better than the university of michigan s survey where the consumer sentiment index is at an 11 year low the conference board survey puts more emphasis on the labor market the survey s so called labor market differential derived from data on respondents views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get fell to 39 3 this month from a reading of 44 7 in april that was the first time in a year that this measure which correlates to the unemployment rate from the labor department was below 40 about 12 5 of consumers viewed jobs as hard to get up from 10 1 in april on face value it suggests that the jobless probably ticked up from a two year low of 3 6 in april despite consumers somewhat unfavorable perceptions the labor market is tightening with the conference board noting that they do expect labor market conditions to remain relatively strong which should continue to support confidence in the short run there were a record 11 5 million job openings on the last day of march and an all time high 4 5 million workers resigned stocks on wall street were lower the dollar was steady against a basket of currencies u s treasury prices fell inflation peaked consumers inflation expectations over the next 12 months dipped to 7 4 from 7 5 in april that fits in with economists views that inflation has likely peaked the fed has increased its policy interest rate by 75 basis points since march the u s central bank is expected to hike the overnight rate by half a percentage point at each of its next meetings in june and in july with prices still high and borrowing costs rising consumers are reassessing their spending plans the share of consumers planning to buy a motor vehicle over the next six months dipped fewer consumers intended to buy major household appliances like refrigerators washing machines dryers and television sets but the buying plans remained at levels sufficient to keep consumer spending growing and the overall economy expanding rising interest rates and the accompanying tightening in financial conditions have left americans worried about an imminent recession economists say the hand wringing about an economic downturn was exaggerated noting the record high job openings and resignations recessions are ultimately a loss of faith said bernard yaros an economist at moody s analytics in west chester pennsylvania yet consumers have no fear when it comes to job security people are quitting their jobs at a prodigious rate knowing they will easily find another job given the record number of open job positions consumers this month also showed less inclination to buy a house as rising mortgage rates and record house prices eroded affordability a separate report on tuesday showed the s p corelogic case shiller 20 metropolitan area home price index surged a record 21 2 on a year on year basis in march after increasing 20 3 in february tight inventory especially of previously owned houses is driving house prices big price gains were recorded in a number of cities including tampa phoenix and miami strong house price inflation was reinforced by another report from the federal housing finance agency showing home prices increased 19 in the 12 months through march after rising 19 3 in february price gains were across the board with notable increases in the south atlantic east south central west south central mountain and pacific regions with demand slowing house price inflation will cool down reports this month showed continued declines in sales of new and previously owned home in april applications for loans to purchase a home have also been dropping house price gains will be far more modest from here said matthew pointon senior property economist at capital economics in new york we expect annual growth to slow to zero by mid 2023 source reuters reporting by lucia mutikani editing by andrea ricci
