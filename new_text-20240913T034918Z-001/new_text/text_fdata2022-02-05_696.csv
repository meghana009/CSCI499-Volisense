by myra macdonald fredrik dahl iran appears to have resumed converting small amounts of its higher grade enriched uranium into reactor fuel diplomats say a process which if expanded could buy time for negotiations between washington and tehran on its disputed nuclear programme the possibility of iran converting enriched uranium into fuel slowing a growth in stockpiles of material that could be used to make weapons is one of the few ways in which the nuclear dispute could avoid hitting a crisis by the summer tehran could otherwise have amassed sufficient stock by june to hit a red line set by israel after which it has indicated it could attack to prevent iran acquiring enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon yet few expect progress in talks until after the iranian presidential election in june a formula for a potentially explosive clash of timetables diplomats accredited to the international atomic energy agency iaea in vienna told reuters that iran had apparently resumed converting into fuel small amounts of higher grade enriched uranium thereby reducing the amount potentially available for nuclear weapons though they had few details and one told reuters that very very little had been done so far a fuller picture is unlikely until a new iaea report on iran s nuclear activity due by late february but the question is crucial in determining the size of its stockpiles and how close these are to israel s red line we will all be doing the mathematics soon said one diplomat in september israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel would not let iran acquire enough material for a bomb enriching uranium raises the less than one percent of fissile isotope u 235 found in mined metal to higher concentrations about 4 percent for reactor fuel up to 90 percent for a bomb while scientists differ about how much uranium is needed to have the ability quickly to make a bomb analysts say the israeli figure is believed to be 240 kg of uranium enriched to 20 percent at that concentration the material is nine tenths of the way to the weapons grade of about 90 percent since most of the unwanted isotopes have been separated out by then israeli officials in private widely use the 240kg figure said shashank joshi a research fellow at britain s royal united services institute rusi the figure is so specific and so widely used that they must understand the implications of drawing this red line that iran is free to produce anything up to that amount but that producing any more would force israel to choose between humiliation or war iran averted a potential crisis last year by converting around 100 kg of its 20 percent enriched uranium into fuel prompting some analysts to believe it was deliberately keeping below the threshold for potential weapons grade material set by israel while still advancing its nuclear technology it is not believed to have enriched uranium beyond 20 percent iran a signatory to the non proliferation treaty denies seeking nuclear weapons saying its aim is electric power and some higher grade enriched uranium for medical purposes it says non signatory israel assumed to have nuclear arms is a threat last year s fuel conversion only slowed iran s accumulation of 20 percent enriched uranium and was stopped as it continues to produce fresh supplies diplomats believe it is adding 14 to 15 kg a month stockpiles are rising quickly and they calculate iran will hit the israeli red line by may or june unless it again expands fuel conversions or slows its rate of enrichment it is here that the complex calculations of nuclear experts and international diplomacy collide the iranian nuclear programme is controlled by supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who last week publicly rebuffed us overtures for direct talks while he is not facing voters himself he is seen as unlikely to want to make any concessions until he has a firmer grip on the warring factions vying for power beneath him after the presidential election in june i think until we get a clearer sense of how that plays out that the iranians are going to be basically in a holding pattern said shannon kile a nuclear proliferation expert at the stockholm international peace research institute sipri president mahmoud ahmadinejad said yesterday iran would not negotiate under pressure but would talk if others stopped pointing the gun at odds with khamenei ahmadinejad will step down in june but appears to manoeuvring to maintain influence at the same time there appears to be a growing recognition among world powers that using economic sanctions to force tehran to curb its nuclear programme are unlikely to succeed without a broader political dialogue between the united states and iran to ease acrimony dating back to the 1979 iranian revolution us vice president joe biden repeated an offer for direct talks at a conference in munich early this month negotiations with tehran are currently run jointly by the five permanent members of the security council plus germany known as the p5 1 these are expected to make at best limited progress in a meeting with iran due in kazakhstan on february 26 it has been obvious for years that iran would only move on this issue in the context of a direct dialogue with the us said one former senior diplomat who has negotiated with iran before that it will continue to be a managed exercise in futility on the part of iran waiting for this to happen while mastering the technology in the process taking the two together the shifting diplomatic approach and advancing iranian engineering there would be a short window of time after june for any us iran talks to produce results after that the progress of iran s technology could hit new western red lines including reaching a perceived breakout capacity where it could move from the ability to make a weapon to actually building a bomb fast enough to avoid detection how then is israel s red line to be postponed enough to allow time for diplomacy in the second half of the year iran has shown no sign of slowing down the rate at which it enriches uranium to 20 percent in a plant at fordow diplomats say though perhaps significantly it has not so far put into operation some new machinery two cascades of inter connected centrifuges which could have rapidly expanded that programme based on data reported by the iaea the un nuclear agency iran will hit netanyahu s red line in may or june unless it converts more of its stockpiles into fuel or slows enrichment an alternative scenario would be for israel to blur the definition of its red line given enough reassurance that its key ally the united states would be ready to stop iran gaining nuclear weapons through diplomatic or military means having lost seats in a parliamentary election last month at which many voters indicated they did not fully share his anxiety about iran netanyahu may also be ready to bide his time with us president barack obama due to visit israel in march on a trip netanyahu says will focus on iran syria and the palestinians there are tentative signs israel might give some space to the united states to pursue its diplomacy though not necessarily on the issue of highly enriched uranium stockpiles it is notable that recently there have been no new assassinations of iranian scientists no prominent covert action or explosions and broad israeli restraint on statements of military intent said joshi at rusi in london referring to a widely assumed covert campaign against iran s nuclear programme they are conceding us leadership on this issue whether by choice or american design former israeli army intelligence chief amos yadlin said it was in israel s interest that washington or the p5 1 reach an agreement with iran writing in a report by the institute for national security studies in tel aviv he said such a solution is preferable to a strategy with two exclusive alternatives of an iranian bomb or the bombing of iran

crs examines systemic risk reforms in financial regulation in a new report the congressional research service crs analyzed the 2007 market crash and the 2020 pandemic crash the steps that congress took after each of these crises and the authorities that the regulators relied upon to reduce systemic risk and avert market crashes the authors describe various post dodd frank measures and the extent to which they have been implemented and whether or to what extent they succeeded for example the crs provides a description of the activities of fsoc the various recommentations that it has made and where fsoc was successful or not in obtaining the implementation of those recommendations crs asserts that financial stability related reforms enacted after the crises were successful in preventing the failure of large financial firms which would have otherwise required bailouts the authors contend that the responses were less successful overall in creating a more resilient financial system that would withstand sudden shocks without resorting to large scale government intervention crs explained that sectors that saw substantial reforms such as banks and derivatives proved to be resilient during the onset of the pandemic while other reformed areas such as money market funds repo markets and other short term borrowing markets broke down and relied on federal emergency programs further crs found that the restorative programs resulted in financial stability and set off a large increase in asset values after the spring of 2020 crs concluded that this outcome raises questions about whether government intervention was a success or was unnecessary since markets may have stabilized without assistance crs concluded that the covid 19 pandemic gave us a real life test of the systemic risk reforms and demonstrated that financial regulators are facing several challenges which stem from political restraints limits on regulatory powers and innovation in financial markets while this report is well written it reflects a political bias towards over reliance on regulatory authorities in times of financial crises with regard to the designation by fsoc of firms as being systemically significant the authors complain that firms were de designated after reducing their systemic significance as if downsizing of the relevant firms were somehow an evasion of the regulation or as if fsoc ought to have continued to regulate the firms even after they stopped being significant likewise the authors suggest that there should be an agency to approve new financial products as there is to approve new pharmaceuticals page 42 this may seem a clever analogy but it is not really one that works further the authors bemoan the fact that the regulators are slow to adopt new regulations as in the area of digital assets however they say nothing of the fact that the regulators are also slow to modify their regulations to permit new product innovations as in the area of digital assets the report tends overmuch to advocacy though an interesting read one may reasonably disagree with many of the implications said steven loftchie fincen extends comment deadline for anpr on real estate transactions fincen extended the comment period for a proposed rulemaking concerning potential bank secrecy act information collection and reporting requirements on certain persons participating in transactions involving non financed purchases of real estate as previously covered the advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr addresses the systemic money laundering vulnerabilities presented by the u s real estate sector specifically the ability of illicit actors to launder criminal proceeds through the purchase of real estate comments are now due by february 21 2022 finra to remove trade reporting query transaction fee for non retail participants finra proposed removing the 0 50 fee applicable to transaction queries performed by non retail participants that use the finra nasdaq trade reporting facility carteret and the finra nasdaq trade reporting facility chicago the proposal would amend finra rule 7620a finra nasdaq trade reporting facility reporting fees to remove the fee applicable to finra nasdaq trf transaction queries performed through weblink workstation and workx finra filed the proposed rule change for immediate effectiveness and established an operative date of february 1 2022 primary sources

the surprisingly strong january jobs report could force the federal reserve to kick off its interest rate hikes next month with the steepest increase in two decades traders are now pricing in over a 36 chance of a hefty half point rate jump when policymakers meet next month instead of a more modest quarter point increase it would mark the first time since 2000 that the u s central bank raised the federal fund rate by 50 basis points the fed has not raised rates since december 2018 january jobs report shows surprisingly strong gain of 467 000 despite omicron a strong jobs report along with elevated inflationary economic data that we ve seen recently could boost expectations that we ll see a 50 basis point rate increase at the march meeting said brian price head of investment management for commonwealth financial network i still believe that 25 basis points is the base case at this point but 50 is not off the table either the more aggressive outlook comes after the labor department said in its monthly employment report friday that payrolls in january rose by 467 000 easily topping the 150 000 jobs gained forecast by refinitiv economists the unemployment rate which is calculated based on a separate survey ticked up slightly to 4 the increase in unemployment is due to the labor force participation rate climbing to 62 2 the highest level since the pandemic began in february 2020 the hiring jump comes despite a record breaking number of covid 19 infections that most economists warned would hinder job growth the strong jobs report is good news for the economy and american workers said chris zaccarelli chief investment officer for independent advisor alliance unfortunately for the stock market it should add to concerns that the federal reserve is going to be forced to raise rates more quickly and to a higher level as wage growth jumped up to 0 7 on a month over month basis for months the fed has been wrestling with its dual mandate of stable prices and full employment but the nation s jobless rate is currently at 4 down from a pandemic high of 14 7 while consumer prices surged 7 from a year ago that marked the fastest pace for inflation since 1982 as consumer demand confronts a shortage of goods caused by congested ports and other pandemic induced disruptions in the supply chain the fed s next meeting is scheduled for march 15 16 after that it has six more meetings in 2022 in may june july september november and december some economists believe the fed waited too long to confront the burst in inflation while others have expressed concerns that moving too quickly to stabilize prices risks slowing hiring and potentially leaving many workers particularly lower income americans without a job hiking interest rates tends to create higher rates on consumers and business loans which slows the economy by forcing employers to cut back on spending get fox business on the go by clicking here fed chairman jerome powell has left open the possibility of a rate hike at every meeting this year and has refused to rule out a more aggressive half percentage point rate hike but he said it s important to be humble and nimble we re going to be led by the incoming data and the evolving outlook powell told reporters during the fed s january meeting

washington reuters the u s economy created far more jobs than expected in january but despite the disruption to consumer facing businesses from a surge in covid 19 cases pointing to underlying strength that should sustain the expansion as the federal reserve starts to raise interest rates the labor department s closely watched employment report on friday also showed a whopping 709 000 more jobs were added in november and december than previously estimated wage gains accelerated last month and the labor pool expanded the upbeat report ended days of anxiety among economists and white house officials who had frantically tried to prepare the nation for a disappointing payrolls number this is a strong jobs report said chris low chief economist at fhn financial in new york the odds of quelling inflation without a recession look better today than yesterday nonfarm payrolls increased by 467 000 jobs last month the survey of establishments showed economists polled by reuters had forecast 150 000 jobs would be added in january estimates ranged from a decrease of 400 000 to a gain of 385 000 jobs employment is 2 9 million jobs below its pre pandemic peak part of the broad increase in payrolls likely reflected low layoffs after the holiday hiring season with 10 9 million job openings at the end of december though the drop in actual employment in january was in line with prior years there were large differences at the industry level the government also reported that 374 000 more jobs were created in the 12 months through march 2021 than previously reported january capped president joe biden s first year in office which saw 6 6 million jobs added despite the strong economy biden s popularity is declining amid soaring inflation we still have a lot of work to do said biden at the white house making sure every american has a job it s a great start but it s not the finish the labor market resilience could alter expectations that economic growth would slow significantly in the first quarter after consumer spending exited 2021 with a whimper the economy grew at a 6 9 annualized rate in the fourth quarter growth estimates for the first quarter are below a 2 pace strong employment gains accompanied by the biggest annual increase in wages since may 2020 pave the way for the u s central bank to raise interest rates in march by at least 25 basis points to tame high inflation economists expect as many as seven rate hikes this year the report is unequivocally good for the economy but not for markets as the strength in the numbers presents another data point which supports more aggressively hawkish fed action said cliff hodge chief investment officer at cornerstone wealth in charlotte north carolina stocks on wall street were higher the dollar was steady versus a basket of currencies u s treasury prices fell graphic jobs by industry labor pool expands economists had anticipated a weak jobs report as the government surveyed businesses for payrolls in mid january when omicron infections were peaking the labor department said a record 3 616 million people who had a job were absent during the survey week because of illness workers who are out sick or in quarantine and do not get paid during the payrolls survey period are counted as unemployed in the establishment survey even if they still have a job lower paid hourly workers in industries like healthcare as well as leisure and hospitality who typically do not have paid sick leave bore the brunt of the winter covid 19 wave according to the latest government data paid sick leave was available to 79 of civilian workers in march 2021 the leisure and hospitality industry added 151 000 jobs in january healthcare employment increased by 18 000 there were gains in retail professional and business services employment as well as transportation and warehousing and wholesale trade manufacturing payrolls rose by 13 000 but construction employment fell 5 000 likely because of freezing temperatures government payrolls increased by 23 000 jobs employment could increase further as coronavirus infections continue to subside first time applications for unemployment benefits

assumptions affecting such forward looking statements non gaap financial measures management believes that certain non gaap financial measures may be useful in certain instances to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods within this release reference is made to adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda adjusted ebitda is a metric used by management to evaluate segment performance and frequently used by the financial community which provides insight into an organization s operating trends and facilitates comparisons between peer companies since interest taxes depreciation and amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies adjusted ebitda also is one of the measures used for determining compliance with the company s debt covenants adjusted ebitda excludes certain items that are unusual in nature or not comparable from period to period spectrum brands provides this information to investors to assist in comparisons of past present and future operating results and to assist in highlighting the results of on going operations while spectrum brands management believes that non gaap measurements are useful supplemental information such adjusted results are not intended to replace the company s gaap financial results and should be read in conjunction with those gaap results the combined sales and ebitda for the global combined appliances platform consist of 1 the company s hpc segment with net sales of 1 261 3 million and adjusted ebitda of 79 1 million for the last twelve month ltm period ended january 2 2022 and 2 the tristar business with net sales of 546 4 million and an assessed adjusted ebitda of 62 9 million for their fiscal year ended december 31 2021 reconciliations of all spectrum non gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures for the consolidated group and its segments including the hpc segment are included in the company s 2021 annual report included in form 10 k filed with the sec and subsequent quarterly reports on form 10 q available at the investor relation section at www spectrumbrands com the following is a reconciliation of the adjusted net income from continuing operations to adjusted ebitda for the hpc segment for the ltm period ended january 2 2022 in millions except fiscal year ended september 30 2021 plus three month period ended january 2 2022 less three month period ended january 3 2021 ltm period ended january 2 2022 net

to income tax expense interest expense and share based compensation are not reflected in the reconciliation of non gaap measures for the hpc segment but such adjustments would not impact the adjusted ebitda figure as presented the operating results of the tristar business consist of unaudited financial information provided by tristar products inc for the fiscal year ended december 31 2021 including the operating results attributable to the combined businesses of the home appliances and cookware categories plus an allocation of certain corporate costs from tristar products inc that

how aggressively will central banks raise rates it s been an incredible couple of weeks in the markets one in which we ve seen another hawkish move from multiple central banks big swings in stocks on the back of earnings and tensions around ukraine intensify the result has been very volatile markets and while the coming week looks a little lighter on event risk there s little reason to expect that the markets will suddenly settle down just because central banks including the fed ecb and boe have already laid the groundwork for a more aggressive tightening this year many questions remain unanswered and huge uncertainty around the inflation outlook remains traders will be paying very close attention to incoming data and comments from policymakers to better understand whether markets are positioned too aggressively or still not enough russia has obviously been in the headlines for many weeks now as troops have built up on the ukrainian border and the west has made accusations of a possible impending invasion while this will remain at the forefront of investors minds next week the central bank will also be meeting later in the week and is expected to raise interest rates again

us traders were stunned after the january nonfarm payroll report showed hiring accelerated employers added 467 000 jobs last month almost doubling the highest economist estimate the december reading was also massively revised higher which means the omicron wave did not deliver a temporary disruption to the labor market recovery average hourly earnings continued to surge and that will feed into the inflation theme and drive expectations that the fed will become even more hawkish the upcoming inflation data is all that matters and could lead to markets fully pricing in a half point rate hike for the fed at the march policy meeting the january inflation report is expected to be red hot as the omicron wave intensified supply constraints and consumer demand remained strong wall street expects the january inflation rate to rise between 7 0 and 7 6 from a year earlier fed speak will include speeches from michelle bowman and loretta mester on wednesday fed s bowman has not had any comments on monetary policy since october so investors will pay close attention to see if she still resides with the hawks fed s mester has already supported a march liftoff and also a shrinking of the balance sheet as fast as possible without roiling markets eu after this week s handbrake turn from the ecb focus next week will be on commentary coming from policymakers in regards to how soon we can expect an end of net asset purchases and more importantly what that means for interest rates this year markets are pricing in around 40 50 basis points of hikes this year after christine lagarde s appearance following the meeting and there s plenty of room for more if other central banks are anything to go by german inflation on friday will also be closely monitored uk we have to wait until the end of the week for the bulk of the data from the uk with gdp for q4 headlining the releases but this will come second next week to appearances from boe policymakers with huw pill speaking on wednesday and governor andrew bailey on thursday the bank is clearly split on the pace of tightening if the vote this week 5 4 is anything to go by although their views appear more aligned than the mpcs is with the markets which are pricing in four more hikes this year despite bailey s comments in the press conference after the decision boris johnson is hanging on by a thread as key aides continue to abandon him and more backbenchers push for a vote of no confidence the police investigation could be the final nail in the coffin for the prime minister russia inflation is expected to have risen to 8 8 in january up from 8 4 in december and more than double its 4 target this has happened even as the cbr has raised rates aggressively over the last year from 4 25 last february to 8 5

of falsifying the data to appease president erdogan with some claiming real inflation is much higher erdogan sacked the head of the institute days before the release which has only further fueled claims that the data is unreliable this begs the question if 48 7 is the falsified number how high is the actual rate new treasury and finance minister nureddin nebati claimed this week that he doesn t think inflation will hit 50 this year and will peak in april adding he hopes he s not wrong when below 50 is the best possible and potentially unreliable scenario you know there s a problem he also

intermediaries established in 1993 we have offices in bermuda australia ireland singapore switzerland the u k and the u s to best serve our clients in the places they do business we have operating subsidiaries branches joint ventures managed funds and underwriting platforms around the world our operating subsidiaries include renaissance reinsurance renaissance reinsurance u s renaissancere specialty u s rreag renaissance reinsurance of europe and our lloyd s syndicate syndicate 1458 we write property and casualty and specialty reinsurance through our wholly owned operating subsidiaries joint ventures managed funds and syndicate 1458 and certain insurance products primarily through syndicate 1458 and renaissancere specialty u s syndicate 1458 provides us with access to lloyd s extensive distribution network and worldwide licenses and also writes business through delegated authority arrangements we also underwrite reinsurance on behalf of joint ventures including davinci top layer re upsilon rfo and vermeer in addition through medici we invest in various insurance based investment instruments that have returns primarily tied to property catastrophe risk our mission is to match desirable well structured risks with efficient sources of capital to achieve our vision of being the best underwriter we believe that this will allow us to produce superior returns for our shareholders over the long term and to protect communities and enable prosperity we seek to accomplish these goals by being a trusted long term partner to our customers for assessing and managing risk delivering responsive and innovative solutions leveraging our core capabilities of risk assessment and information management investing in these core capabilities in order to serve our customers across market cycles and keeping our promises our strategy focuses on superior risk selection superior customer relationships and superior capital management we provide value to our customers and joint venture and managed fund partners in the form of financial security innovative products and responsive service we are known as a leader in paying valid claims promptly we principally measure our financial success through long term growth in tangible book value per common share plus the change in accumulated dividends we believe this metric is the most appropriate measure of our financial performance and in respect of which we believe we have delivered superior performance over time the principal drivers of our profit are underwriting income investment income and fee income generated by our third party capital management business our core products include property casualty and specialty reinsurance and certain insurance products principally distributed through intermediaries with whom we have cultivated strong long term relationships we believe we have been one of the world s leading providers of catastrophe reinsurance since our founding in recent years through the strategic execution of several initiatives including organic growth and acquisitions we have expanded and diversified our casualty and specialty platform and products and believe we are a leader in certain casualty and specialty lines of business our current business strategy focuses predominantly on writing reinsurance although as we grow our casualty and specialty and other property lines of business we are increasingly writing excess and surplus lines insurance through delegated authority arrangements we also pursue a number of other opportunities such as creating and managing our joint ventures and managed funds executing customized reinsurance transactions to assume or cede risk and managing certain strategic investments directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe reinsurance from time to time we consider diversification into new ventures either through organic growth the formation of new joint ventures or managed funds or the acquisition of or the investment in other companies or books of business of other companies we have determined our business consists of the following reportable segments 1 property which is comprised of catastrophe and other property re insurance written on behalf of our operating subsidiaries joint ventures and managed funds and 2 casualty and specialty which is comprised of casualty and specialty re insurance written on behalf of our operating subsidiaries joint ventures and managed funds the underwriting results of our operating subsidiaries and underwriting platforms are included in our property and casualty and specialty segment results as appropriate a meaningful portion of the reinsurance and insurance we write provides protection from damages relating to natural and man made catastrophes our results depend to a large extent on the frequency and severity of these catastrophic events and the coverages we offer to customers that are affected by these events 55 we are exposed to significant losses from these catastrophic events and other exposures we cover which primarily impact our property segment in both the property catastrophe and other property lines of business accordingly we expect a significant degree of volatility in our financial results and our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year based on the level of insured catastrophic losses occurring around the world our casualty and specialty business which represents approximately half of our gross premiums written annually is an efficient use of capital that is generally less correlated with our property business it allows us to bring additional capacity to our clients across a wider range of product offerings while continuing to be good stewards of our shareholders capital we continually explore appropriate and efficient ways to address the risk needs of our clients and the impact of various regulatory and legislative changes on our operations we have created and manage multiple capital vehicles across several jurisdictions and may create additional risk bearing vehicles or enter into additional jurisdictions in the future in addition our differentiated strategy and capabilities position us to pursue bespoke or large solutions for clients which may be non recurring this and other factors including the timing of contract inception could result in significant volatility of premiums in both our property and casualty and specialty segments as our product and geographical diversity increases we may be exposed to new risks uncertainties and sources of volatility our revenues are principally derived from three sources 1 net premiums earned from the reinsurance and insurance policies we sell 2 net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains from the investment of our capital funds and the investment of the cash we receive on the policies which we sell and 3 fees received from our joint ventures and managed funds our expenses primarily consist of 1 net claims and claim expenses incurred on the policies of reinsurance and insurance we sell 2 acquisition costs which typically represent a percentage of the premiums we write 3 operating expenses which primarily consist of personnel expenses rent and other operating expenses 4 corporate expenses which include certain executive legal and consulting expenses costs for research and development transaction and integration related expenses and other miscellaneous costs including those associated with operating as a publicly traded company 5 redeemable noncontrolling interests which represent the interests of third parties with respect to the net income of davincire medici and vermeer and 6 interest and dividends related to our debt and preference shares we are also subject to taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we operate since the majority of our income is currently earned in bermuda which does not have a corporate income tax the tax impact to our operations has historically been minimal in the future our net tax exposure may increase as our operations expand geographically or as a result of adverse tax developments the underwriting results of an insurance or reinsurance company are discussed frequently by reference to its net claims and claim expense ratio underwriting expense ratio and combined ratio the net claims and claim expense ratio is calculated by dividing net claims and claim expenses incurred by net premiums earned the underwriting expense ratio is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses acquisition expenses and operational expenses by net premiums earned the combined ratio is the sum of the net claims and claim expense ratio and the underwriting expense ratio a combined ratio below 100 indicates profitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income a combined ratio over 100 indicates unprofitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income we also discuss our net claims and claim expense ratio on a current accident year basis and a prior accident years basis the current accident year net claims and claim expense ratio is calculated by taking current accident year net claims and claim expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned the prior accident years net claims and claim expense ratio is calculated by taking prior accident years net claims and claim expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned effects of inflation general economic inflation has increased and there is a risk of inflation remaining elevated for an extended period which could cause claims and claim expenses to increase impact the performance of our investment portfolio or have other adverse effects this risk may be exacerbated by the steps taken by governments and central banks throughout the world in responding to the covid 19 pandemic the actual effects of the current and potential future increase in inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until among other items claims are ultimately settled the onset duration and severity of an inflationary period cannot be estimated with precision we consider the anticipated effects of inflation on us in our 56 catastrophe loss models and on our investment portfolio our estimates of the potential effects of inflation are also considered in pricing and in estimating reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses the potential exists after a catastrophe loss for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy covid 19 pandemic due to the ongoing and rapidly evolving nature of the covid 19 pandemic we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the covid 19 pandemic on our business operations and financial condition including our potential loss exposures it is not yet possible to give an estimate of all of the company s potential reinsurance insurance or investment exposures or any other effects that the covid 19 pandemic may have on our results of operations or financial condition we continue to evaluate industry trends and information received from or reported by clients brokers industry actuaries regulators courts and others and expect historically significant industry losses to emerge over time as the full impact of the pandemic and its effects on the global economy are realized selected consolidated financial data the following tables set forth our selected consolidated financial data and other financial information at the end of and for each of the years in the five year period ended december 31 2021 the results of tmr are included in our consolidated financial data from march 22 2019 the

is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves claims and claim expense reserves represent estimates including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for unpaid claims and claim expenses arising from the insurance and reinsurance contracts we sell we establish our claims and claim expense reserves by taking case reserves adding estimates for ibnr and if deemed necessary adding costs for additional case reserves which represent our estimates for claims related to specific contracts which we believe may not be

assesses the reasonableness and adequacy of the reserving estimates included in our audited financial statements in accordance with fasb asc topic business combinations we allocated the total

855 our reserving methodology for each line of business uses a loss reserving process that calculates a point estimate for our ultimate settlement and administration costs for claims and claim expenses we do not calculate a range of estimates and do not discount any of our reserves for claims and claim expenses we use this point estimate along with paid claims and case reserves to record our best estimate of additional case reserves and ibnr in our consolidated financial statements under gaap we are not permitted to establish estimates for catastrophe claims and claim expense reserves until an event occurs that gives rise to a loss reserving for our claims involves other uncertainties such as the dependence on information from ceding companies the time lag inherent in reporting information from the primary insurer to us or to our ceding companies and different reserving practices among ceding companies the information received from ceding companies is typically in the form of bordereaux broker notifications of loss and or discussions with ceding companies or their brokers this information may be received on a monthly quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes paid claims and estimates of case reserves we may also receive an estimate or provision for ibnr from certain ceding companies this information is often updated and 60 adjusted from time to time during the loss settlement period as new data or facts in respect of initial claims client accounts industry or event trends may be reported or emerge in addition to changes in applicable statutory and case laws our estimates of large losses are based on factors including currently available information derived from claims information from certain customers and brokers industry assessments of losses proprietary models historical reinsurance and insurance loss experience and statistics management s experience and judgment to assist the establishment of appropriate claims and claim expense reserves and the terms and conditions of our contracts the uncertainty of our estimates for large losses is also impacted by the preliminary nature of the information available the magnitude and relative infrequency of the loss the expected duration of the respective claims development period inadequacies in the data provided to the relevant date by industry participants the potential for further reporting lags or insufficiencies and in certain cases the form of the claims and legal issues under the relevant terms of insurance and reinsurance contracts in addition a significant portion of the net claims and claim expenses associated with certain large losses can be concentrated with a few large clients and therefore the loss estimates for these losses may vary significantly based on the claims experience of those clients the contingent nature of business interruption and other exposures will also impact losses in a meaningful way which we believe may give rise to significant complexity in respect of claims handling claims adjustment and other coverage issues over time given the magnitude of certain losses there can be meaningful uncertainty regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and accordingly several of the key assumptions underlying our loss estimates loss reserve estimation in respect of our retrocessional contracts poses further challenges compared to directly assumed reinsurance in addition our actual net losses may increase if our reinsurers or other obligors fail to meet their obligations because of the inherent uncertainties discussed above we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates and we have generally experienced favorable development on prior accident years net claims and claim expenses in the last several years however there is no assurance that this favorable development on prior accident years net claims and claim expenses will occur in future periods our reserving techniques assumptions and processes differ among our property and casualty and specialty segments refer to note 8 reserve for claims and claim expenses in our notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the risks we insure and reinsure the reserving techniques assumptions and processes we follow to estimate our claims and claim expense reserves prior year development of the reserve for claims and claim expenses analysis of our incurred and paid claims development and claims duration information for each of our property and casualty and specialty segments property segment actual results vs initial estimates as discussed above the key assumption in estimating reserves for our property segment is our estimate of incurred claims and claim expenses the table below shows our initial estimates of incurred claims and claim expenses for each accident year and how these initial estimates have developed over time the initial estimate of accident year incurred claims and claim expenses represents our estimate of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for claims incurred in our property segment occurring during a particular accident year and as reported as of december 31 of that year the re estimated incurred claims and claim expenses as of december 31 of subsequent years represent our revised estimates as reported as of those dates our most recent estimates as reported at december 31 2021 differ from our initial accident year estimates and demonstrate that our most recent estimate of incurred claims and claim expenses are reasonably likely to vary from our initial estimate perhaps significantly changes in this estimate will be recorded in the period in which they occur in accident years where our current estimates are lower than our initial estimates we have experienced favorable development in comparison for accident years where our current estimates are higher than our original estimates we have experienced adverse development the table is presented on a net basis and therefore includes the benefit of reinsurance recoverable in addition we have included historical incurred claims and claim expenses development information related to platinum and tmr in the table below for incurred accident year claims and claim expenses denominated in currencies other than usd we have used the current year end 61 balance sheet foreign exchange rate for all periods provided thereby eliminating the effects of changes in foreign currency translation rates from the incurred accident year claims

derived from claims information from customers and brokers industry assessments of losses proprietary models historical reinsurance and insurance loss experience and statistics management s experience and judgment to assist the establishment of appropriate claims and claim expense reserves and the terms and conditions of our contracts as described above given the complexity in reserving for claims and claims expenses associated with property losses and catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance contracts in particular which make up a significant proportion of our property segment we have experienced development both favorable and unfavorable in any given accident year for example net claims and claim expenses associated with the 2017 accident year have experienced favorable development this is largely driven by reductions in estimated net ultimate claims and claim expenses associated with the 2017 large loss events in comparison net claims and claim expenses associated with 2020 accident year have experienced adverse development the adverse development was driven by an increase in expected net claims and claim expenses as new and additional claims information was received associated with the 2020 weather related large loss events in accident years with a low level of insured catastrophe losses our other property lines of business contribute a greater proportion of our overall incurred claims and claim expenses within our property segment compared to years with a high level of insured catastrophe losses we expect that certain of our other property lines of business will tend to generate less volatility in future calendar years and as such we would expect to see a slower more stable increase or decrease in estimated incurred net claims and claim expenses over time in such business certain of our other property contracts are also exposed to catastrophe events resulting in increased volatility of incurred claims and claim expenses driven by the occurrence of catastrophe events in addition volatility in the initial estimate associated with large catastrophe losses and the speed at which we settle claims can vary significantly based on the type of event we also anticipate that losses from the covid 19 pandemic will be highly complex and uncertain given the unprecedented situation and will take longer to develop given the nature of the losses thus potentially adding volatility to our incurred net claims and claim expenses sensitivity analysis the table below shows the impact on our reserve for claims and claim expenses net income loss and shareholders equity as of and for the year ended december 31 2021 of a reasonable range of possible outcomes associated with our estimates of gross ultimate losses for claims and claim expenses incurred within our property segment the reasonable range of possible outcomes is based on a distribution of 62 outcomes of our ultimate incurred claims and claim expenses from large losses in addition we adjust the loss ratios and development curves in our other property lines of business in a similar fashion to the sensitivity analysis performed for our casualty and specialty segment discussed in greater detail below in general our reserve for claims and claim expenses for more recent losses are subject to greater uncertainty and therefore greater variability and are likely to experience material changes from one period to the next this is due to uncertainty with respect to the size of the industry losses which contracts have been exposed to the loss and the magnitude of claims incurred by our clients as our claims age more information becomes available and we believe our estimates become more certain although there is no assurance this trend will continue in the future as a result the sensitivity analysis below is based on the age of each accident year our current estimated incurred claims and claim expenses for the losses occurring in each accident year and a reasonable range of possible outcomes of our current estimates of claims and claim expenses by accident year the impact on net income loss and shareholders equity assumes no increase or decrease in

to date and our future expectations while we believe these are a reasonable range of possible outcomes we do not believe the above sensitivity analysis should be considered an actuarial reserve range in addition the sensitivity analysis only reflects a reasonable range of possible outcomes in our underlying assumptions it is possible that our estimated incurred claims and claim expenses could be significantly higher or lower than the sensitivity analysis described above for example we could be liable for events for which we have not estimated claims and claim expenses or for exposures we do not currently believe are covered under our policies these changes could result in significantly larger changes to our estimated incurred claims and claim expenses net income and shareholders equity than those noted above and could be recorded across multiple periods we also caution that the above sensitivity analysis is not used by management in developing our reserve estimates and is also not used by management in managing the business casualty and specialty segment actual results vs initial estimates as discussed above the key assumption in estimating reserves for our casualty and specialty segment is our estimate of incurred claims and claim expenses standard actuarial techniques are used to calculate the ultimate claims and claim expenses the key assumptions in the determination of ultimate claims and claim expenses include the estimated incurred claims and claim expenses ratio and the estimated loss reporting patterns the table below shows our initial estimates of incurred claims and claim expenses for each accident year and how these initial estimates have developed over time the initial estimate of accident year incurred claims and claim expenses represents our estimate of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for claims incurred in our casualty and specialty segment occurring during a particular accident year and as reported as of

total 10 535 353 as each underwriting year has developed our estimated expected incurred claims and claim expenses net of reinsurance have changed as an example our re estimated incurred claims and claim expenses decreased for the 2014 accident year from the initial estimates this decrease was principally driven by actual reported and paid net claims and claim expenses associated with the 2014 accident year being lower than expected which has resulted in a reduction in our expected ultimate claims and claim expense ratio for this accident year in comparison the 2018 accident year has developed adversely compared to our initial estimates of incurred claims and claim expenses and our current estimates are higher than our initial estimates the increase in incurred claims and claim expenses for the 2018 accident year is due to reported losses generally coming in higher than expected on attritional net claims and claim expenses the reserving methodology for our casualty and specialty segment is weighted more heavily to our initial estimate in the early periods immediately following the contracts inception through the use of the expected loss ratio method the expected loss ratio method estimates the incurred losses by multiplying the initial expected loss ratio by the earned premium under the expected loss ratio method no reliance is placed on the development of claims and claim expenses the determination of when reported losses are sufficient and credible to warrant selection of an ultimate loss ratio different from the initial expected loss ratio also requires judgment we generally make adjustments for reported loss experience indicating unfavorable variances from the initial expected loss ratio sooner than reported loss experience indicating favorable variances as reporting of losses in excess of expectations tends to have greater credibility than an absence of or lower than expected level of reported losses over time as a greater number of claims are reported and the credibility of reported losses improves actuarial estimates of ibnr are typically based on the bornhuetter ferguson actuarial method the bornhuetter ferguson method places weight on claims and claim expenses development experience if there is adverse development of prior accident years claims and claim expenses we generally select the bornhuetter ferguson method to ensure the claim experience is considered in the determination of our estimated claims and claim expenses with the associated business if we believe we lack the claims experience in the early stages of development of a line of business we may not select the bornhuetter ferguson method until such time as we believe there is 64 greater credibility in the level of reported losses as development experience for claims and claim expenses on prior accident years becomes credible the bornhuetter ferguson method is generally selected which places greater weight on this reported experience as it develops the bornhuetter ferguson method estimates our expected ultimate claims and claim expenses by applying our initial estimated loss ratio to our undeveloped premium and adding the reported losses to the estimate the impact of these methodologies can be observed in the table above for example the 2014 accident year ultimate loss remained relatively consistent for the first two years of development i e the years ended december 31 2015 and 2016 before experiencing favorable development in years three and four i e the years ended december 31 2017 and 2018 reflecting the timing of our adoption of the bornhuetter ferguson method as the reported experience became more credible sensitivity analysis the table below shows the impact on our casualty and specialty segment

addition we believe that the adjustments we made to speed up or slow down our estimated loss reporting patterns represent a reasonable range of possible outcomes while we believe these are a reasonable range of possible outcomes we do not believe the above sensitivity analysis should be considered an actuarial reserve range in addition the sensitivity analysis only reflects a reasonable range of possible outcomes in our underlying assumptions it is possible that our initial estimated claims and claim expense ratios and loss reporting patterns could be significantly different from the sensitivity analysis described above for example we could be liable for events that we have not estimated reserves for or for exposures we do not currently believe are covered under our contracts these changes could result in significantly larger changes to reserves for claims and claim expenses net income 65 and shareholders equity than those noted above and could be recorded across multiple periods we also caution that the above sensitivity analysis is not used by management in developing our reserve estimates and is also not used by management in managing the business premiums and related expenses premiums are recognized as income net of any applicable reinsurance or retrocessional coverage purchased over the terms of the related contracts and policies premiums written are based on contract and policy terms and include estimates based on information received from both insureds and ceding companies unearned premiums represents the portion of premiums written that relate to the unexpired terms of contracts and policies in force amounts are computed by pro rata methods based on statistical data or reports received from ceding companies reinstatement premiums are estimated after the occurrence of a loss and are recorded in accordance with the contract terms based upon paid losses as well as reported and estimated reserves reinstatement premiums are earned when written due to the nature of reinsurance ceding companies routinely report and remit premiums to us subsequent to the contract coverage period consequently premiums written and receivable include amounts reported by the ceding companies supplemented by our estimates of premiums that are written but not reported the estimation of written premiums may be affected by early cancellation election of contract provisions for cut off and return of unearned premiums or other contract disruptions the time lag involved in the process of reporting premiums is shorter than the lag in reporting losses in addition to estimating premiums written we estimate the earned portion of premiums written which is subject to judgment and uncertainty any adjustments to written and earned premiums and the related losses and acquisition expenses are accounted for as changes in estimates and are reflected in the results of operations in the period in which they are made lines of business that are similar in both the nature of their business and estimation process may be grouped for purposes of estimating premiums premiums are estimated based on ceding company estimates and our own judgment after considering factors such as 1 the ceding company s historical premium versus projected premium 2 the ceding company s history of providing accurate estimates 3 anticipated changes in the marketplace and the ceding company s competitive position therein 4 reported premiums to date and 5 the anticipated impact of proposed underwriting changes estimates of premiums written and earned are based on the selected ultimate premium estimate the terms and conditions of the reinsurance contracts and the remaining exposure from the underlying policies we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimates in light of the actual premium reported by the ceding companies information obtained during audits and other information received from ceding companies we estimate our provision for current expected credit losses by applying specific percentages against each premiums receivable based on the counterparty s credit ratings the percentages applied are based on information received from both insureds and ceding companies and are then adjusted by us based on industry knowledge and our judgment and estimates we then evaluate the overall adequacy of the provision for current expected credit losses based on other qualitative and judgmental factors at december 31 2021 the company s premiums receivable balance was 3 8 billion 2020 2 9 billion of the company s premiums receivable balance as of december 31 2021 the majority are receivables from highly rated counterparties at december 31 2021 the company held a provision for current expected credit losses on its premiums receivable of 2 8 million 2020 6 0 million reinsurance recoverable we enter into retrocessional reinsurance agreements in order to help reduce our exposure to large losses and to help manage our risk portfolio amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims and claim expense reserves associated with the related assumed reinsurance for multi year retrospectively rated contracts we accrue amounts either assets or liabilities that are due to or from our retrocessionaires based on estimated contract experience if we determine that adjustments to earlier estimates are appropriate such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are determined the estimate of reinsurance recoverable can be more subjective than estimating the underlying claims and claim expense reserves as discussed under the heading claims and claim expense reserves above in particular reinsurance recoverable may be affected by deemed inuring reinsurance industry losses 66 reported by various statistical reporting services and other factors reinsurance recoverable on dual trigger reinsurance contracts require us to estimate our ultimate losses applicable to these contracts as well as estimate the ultimate amount of insured industry losses that will be reported by the applicable statistical reporting agency as per the contract terms in addition the level of our additional case reserves and ibnr reserves has a significant impact on reinsurance recoverable these factors can impact the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoverable to be recorded the majority of the balance we have accrued as recoverable will not be due for collection until some point in the future the amounts recoverable that will ultimately be collected are subject to uncertainty due to the ultimate ability and willingness of reinsurers to pay our claims at a future point in time for reasons including insolvency or elective run off contractual dispute and various other reasons in addition because the majority of the balances recoverable will not be collected for some time economic conditions as well as the financial and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may change and these changes may affect the reinsurer s willingness and ability to meet their contractual obligations to us to reflect these uncertainties we estimate and record a provision for current expected credit losses for potential uncollectible reinsurance recoverable which reduces reinsurance recoverable and net income we estimate our provision for current expected credit losses by applying specific percentages against each reinsurance recoverable based on our counterparty s credit rating the percentages applied are based on historical industry default statistics developed by major rating agencies and are then adjusted by us based on industry knowledge and our judgment and estimates we then evaluate the overall adequacy of the provision for current expected credit losses based on other qualitative and judgmental factors at december 31 2021 our reinsurance recoverable balance was 4 3 billion 2020 2 9 billion of this amount 46 9 is fully collateralized by our reinsurers 52 1 is recoverable from reinsurers rated a or higher by major rating agencies and 1 0 is recoverable from reinsurers rated lower than a by major rating agencies 2020 45 2 53 4 and 1 4 respectively the reinsurers with the three largest balances accounted for 19 9 8 4 and 4 3 respectively of our reinsurance recoverable balance at december 31 2021 2020 15 3 10 8 and 6 7 respectively the provision for current expected credit losses recorded against reinsurance recoverable was 8 3 million at december 31 2021 2020 6 3 million the three largest company specific components of the provision for current expected credit losses represented 18 0 13 9 and 11 2 respectively of our total provision for current expected credit losses at december 31 2021 2020 13 2 13 0 and 6 7 respectively fair value measurements and impairments fair value the use of fair value to measure certain assets and liabilities with resulting unrealized gains or losses is pervasive within our consolidated financial statements fair value is defined under accounting guidance currently applicable to us to be the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between open market participants at the measurement date we recognize the change in unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in fair value in our consolidated statements of operations fasb asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures prescribes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to the respective valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable level 3 in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and we consider factors specific to the asset or liability in order to determine if a market is active or inactive for a security we consider a number of factors including but not limited to the volume of trading activity for the security in question the price of the 67 security compared to its par value for fixed maturity investments and other factors that may be indicative of market activity at december 31 2021 we classified 169 3 million and 10 8 million of our assets and liabilities respectively at fair value on a recurring basis using level 3 inputs this represented 0 5 and 0 0 of our total assets and liabilities respectively level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable these measurements are made under circumstances in which there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability we use valuation models or other pricing techniques that require a variety of inputs including contractual terms market prices and rates yield curves credit curves measures of volatility prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs some of which may be unobservable to value these level 3 assets and liabilities refer to note 6 fair value measurements in our notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about fair value measurements impairments the amount and timing of asset impairment is subject to significant estimation techniques and is a critical accounting estimate for us the significant impairment reviews we complete are for our goodwill and other intangible assets and equity method investments as described in more detail below goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets acquired are initially recorded at fair value subsequent to initial recognition finite lived other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life subject to impairment and goodwill and indefinite lived other intangible assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value subject to impairment if goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired they are written down to their estimated fair values with a corresponding expense reflected in our consolidated statements of operations in accordance with fasb asc topic business combinations we allocated the total consideration paid for tmr among acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their fair values we recognized identifiable finite lived intangible assets of 11 2 million which will be amortized over a weighted average period of 10 5 years identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets of 6 8 million and certain other adjustments to the fair values of the assets acquired liabilities assumed and shareholders equity of tmr at march 22 2019 based on foreign exchange rates on march 22 2019 in addition we recognized goodwill of 13 1 million based on foreign exchange rates on march 22 2019 attributable to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of tmr goodwill resulting from the acquisition of tmr will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually as outlined below more frequently if certain indicators are present goodwill is assigned to the applicable reporting unit of the acquired entities giving rise to the goodwill and other intangible assets we assess goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable for purposes of the annual impairment evaluation we assess qualitative factors to determine if events or circumstances exist that would lead us to conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then we do not perform a quantitative evaluation should we determine that a quantitative analysis is required we will first determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare that with the carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount then goodwill is not considered impaired and no further analysis is required if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we then proceed to determine the amount of the impairment charge if any there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculation principally we identify the reporting unit or business entity that the goodwill or other intangible asset is attributed to and review historical and forecasted operating and financial performance and other underlying factors affecting such analysis including market conditions other assumptions used could produce significantly different results which may result in a change in the value of goodwill or our other intangible assets and a related charge in our consolidated statements of operations an impairment charge could be recognized in the event of a significant decline in the implied fair value of those operations 68 where the goodwill or other intangible assets are applicable in the event we determine that the value of goodwill has become impaired an accounting charge will be taken in the fiscal quarter in which such determination is made which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment charge is recorded as a result of the company s impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 the company determined that there was no impairment during 2021 and therefore the company recorded no intangible asset impairment charge during the year ended december 31 2021 refer to note 4 goodwill and other intangible assets in our notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to the impairment as at december 31 2021 excluding the amounts recorded in investments in other ventures under the equity method as noted below our consolidated balance sheets include 210 9 million of goodwill 2020 211 0 million and 32 6 million of other intangible assets 2020 38 6 million impairment charges related to these balances were nil during the year ended december 31 2021 2020 6 8 million 2019 nil in the future it is possible we will hold more goodwill and intangible assets which would increase the degree of judgment and uncertainty embedded in our financial statements and potentially increase the volatility of our reported results deferred acquisition costs and value of business acquired voba was initially recorded to reflect the establishment of the value of business acquired asset in connection with the acquisition of tmr which represents the estimated present value of the expected underwriting profit within the unearned premiums liability net of reinsurance less costs to service the related policies and a risk premium voba is derived using among other things estimated loss ratios by line of business to calculate the underwriting profit weighted average cost of capital risk premium and expected payout patterns the adjustment for voba will be amortized to acquisition expenses over approximately two years as the contracts for business in force as of the acquisition date expire investments in other ventures under equity method investments in which we have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are classified as investments in other ventures under equity method and are accounted for under the equity method of accounting under this method we record our proportionate share of income or loss from such investments in our results for the period any decline in the value of investments in other ventures under equity method including goodwill and other intangible assets arising upon acquisition of the investee considered by management to be other than temporary is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which it is determined as of december 31 2021 we had 98 1 million 2020 98 4 million in investments in other ventures under equity method on our consolidated balance sheets including 9 9 million of goodwill and 8 7 million of other intangible assets 2020 10 6 million and 12 4 million the carrying value of our investments in other ventures under equity method individually or in the aggregate may and likely will differ from the realized value we may ultimately attain perhaps significantly so in determining whether an equity method investment is impaired we take into consideration a variety of factors including the operating and financial performance of the investee the investee s future business plans and projections recent transactions and market valuations of publicly traded companies where available discussions with the investee s management and our intent and ability to hold the investment until it recovers in value accordingly we make assumptions and estimates in assessing whether an impairment has occurred and if in the future our assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of these investments change this could result in a material decrease in the carrying value of these investments this would cause us to write down the carrying value of these investments and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period the impairment charge is taken we do not have any current plans to dispose of these investments and cannot assure you we will consummate future transactions in which we realize the value at which these holdings are reflected in our financial statements we have not recorded any other than temporary impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our investments in other ventures under the equity method in any of the years ended december 31 2021 2020 or 2019 see note 4 goodwill and other intangible assets in our notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 69 income taxes income taxes have been provided in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc topic income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities such temporary differences are primarily due to net operating loss carryforwards and gaap versus tax basis accounting differences relating to unearned premiums reserves for claims and claim expenses deferred finance charges deferred underwriting results accrued expenses investments deferred acquisition expenses intangible assets amortization and depreciation and voba the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period in which the change in tax rates is enacted a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets is recorded if it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefits related to deferred tax assets will not be realized at december 31 2021 our net deferred tax asset prior to our valuation allowance and valuation allowance were 192 4 million 2020 138 0 million and 131 5 million 2020 88 7 million respectively see note 15 taxation in our notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information at each balance sheet date we assess the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces the net deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance assessment is performed separately in each taxable jurisdiction based on all available information including projections of future gaap taxable income from each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction the valuation allowance relates to a substantial portion of our net deferred tax assets in most jurisdictions in which we do business it excludes bermuda and our u s operations that existed prior to the acquisition of tmr which only have a small valuation allowance against finite lived tax carryforwards we have unrecognized tax benefits of nil as of december 31 2021 2020 nil interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits would be recognized in income tax expense at december

related large losses ceded premiums written in our property segment increased 185 2 million to 961 9 million in 2020 compared to 776 7 million in 2019 the increase in ceded premiums written was

overtime funding for farm workers covid relief more money for broadband access and workforce training and self service gasoline are among pending items example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video salem ore oregon s 35 day legislative session is underway and lawmakers have a long list of issues to tackle including ongoing covid financial relief criminal justice reform and expanding broadband access when the short sessions were approved in 2010 they were intended to be a contrast to the longer 160 day sessions and focus on resolving budgetary issues and fixing already passed legislation the scope has since expanded considerably with the democratic controlled chambers using the shorter sessions to address major policy issues republicans have complained about this shift calling it government overreach this session an influx of federal dollars and high state revenue forecasts mean lawmakers have a larger pool of money to spend than in most years democrats are looking to steer upwards of 1 5 billion toward key priorities new state leadership the session began with significant change on tuesday as the state house of representatives elected a new speaker rep dan rayfield a corvallis democrat this marks the first time the speaker has been from outside portland in nearly a decade rayfield is replacing tina kotek d portland who stepped down recently to focus on her bid for governor democrats picked rayfield over rep janelle bynum d happy valley who would have been the first black woman in the role although bynum lost the democratic nomination for the post a month ago rep jack zika r redmond put her forward as a potential speaker tuesday and she received four votes republicans nominated their caucus leader rep vikki breese iverson r prineville who received 18 votes rayfield won the position with 32 votes this is just one of many sweeping leadership changes in salem as new house majority and minority leaders were also installed senator peter courtney who has served the last 20 years as senate president has also announced this will be his last session i believe that we are all here because we want to do good for oregon rayfield said on the house floor tuesday it is important to me that we give the measure of grace that comes with recognizing that in all of us protesters rally at capitol also on the opening day of the session approximately 100 protesters rallied outside the building against mask mandates and covid vaccine requirements the event was largely peaceful though a handful of unmasked protesters eventually pushed their way into the capitol later that day these protests came as republicans proposed bills to ban vaccine passports terminate the existing covid state of emergency and limit the governor s executive powers these bills are unlikely to pass with a democratic majority in power but they do hold symbolic significance republicans are trying to make executive power a chief issue in the upcoming gubernatorial race according to kgw political analyst len bergstein a place where the republicans want to make their case bernstein said they want to start the debate right now and try to rile up the base of their party about executive power since they probably guess they re not going to be the chief executive but they want to make sure that their voters take a shot at this overtime pay voting rights in the past couple of years tactics from republicans such as walkouts or requiring full bill readings have halted sessions altogether this year both parties have said they want to avoid these interruptions but some potentially controversial bills are on the table democrats are continuing their push for overtime pay for agricultural workers this bill comes amidst a heightened focus on essential workers during the pandemic and after the 2021 extreme summer heat wave that killed dozens of oregonians unlike other hourly workers the fair labor standard act exempts agricultural workers from receiving time and a half for over forty hours of work per week democrats aim to offset the economic burden on employers by gradually implementing the policy and granting tax credits but farm owners oppose this bill saying the additional costs could harm their businesses breese iverson the house minority leader has referred to this bill as the elephant in the room this session another point of controversy could be the continuing effort to restore voting rights for adults in custody if this bill passes oregon would join maine and vermont as the only states to allow these adults to vote this bill which faces gop opposition comes as lawmakers nationwide are aiming to restrict voting rights it s also a part of the democrats larger push for criminal justice reform in the wake of george floyd s murder broadband access self service gas some efforts do have the potential to bring unity across the aisle in salem this includes a proposal from the governor to invest 200 million to grow the state s workforce in the health care manufacturing and construction sectors funds would go towards community college and apprenticeship programs and cover the costs of tuition transportation childcare and more for especially hard hit oregonians governor kate brown said this initiative will prioritize populations disproportionately impacted by the pandemic and existing workplace disparities this includes people of color people with low incomes and those living in rural communities among others even today in the middle of oregon s strong economic recovery the doors of opportunity remain closed for too many families brown said in her final state of the state address thursday but the truth is here in lies an opportunity to connect oregon s people to oregon s jobs brown is also calling for a 100 million investment in child care aid and 400 million for affordable housing another bill that could bring together lawmakers from across the aisle is a policy to expand the state s broadband access an issue highlighted throughout the pandemic as many struggled to learn or work from home in rural communities across the state an estimated 200 million in federal funds would go towards expanding this access and another bipartisan push may finally give oregonians the option to pump their own gas if passed gas stations would still be required to staff half the pumps other topics this session with proposed legislation include emergency heat wave relief fuel disaster prevention payments to essential workers limits on firing superintendents police practices when stopping drivers crackdowns on illegal cannabis and state gaming laws there are currently over 260 bills and only a handful are likely to reach the finish line lawmakers are currently holding public hearings and will start moving bills to the floor the week of february 7 any bill that doesn t have a work session scheduled by feb 7 is dead as is any bill not passed out of its chamber of origin by feb 14 this doesn t apply to bills in several committees such as the revenue and rules committees where lawmakers may send bills to extend their life or use as bargaining chips later in the session

s policy mckesson and kraska were both instrumental in forming breonna s law in memory of breonna taylor a black woman who was shot and killed by louisville kentucky police in march of 2020 the city released officer body camera footage of locke s killing thursday showing him sleeping on a couch in an apartment inside the bolero flats building in downtown minneapolis the video then shows locke being startled awake as officers executed a no knock warrant at the unit before being shot and killed law enforcement sources however told kare 11 investigative reporter a j lagoe the warrant that resulted in locke s death was not supposed to be a no knock warrant when minneapolis police were asked to assist st paul police with executing the warrant the mpd insisted the warrant be changed to be executed without knocking first in a statement friday a spokesperson from the st paul police department said it s common practice to ask other agencies help serve a warrant outside the sppd s jurisdiction after the warrants in this case were signed by a hennepin county judge the saint paul police department asked the minneapolis police department to carry out three of them at an apartment complex in downtown minneapolis the apartment complex management team complied with the court orders and provided access to the mpd officers the statement said it went on each agency has its own protocols and policies for serving search warrants the agency responsible for serving the warrant determines what tactics that will be used the department said the warrants which have not been made public will be kept under seal until the court directs otherwise what is a no knock warrant in the state of minnesota a no knock search warrant is defined as a search warrant authorizing peace officers to enter certain premises without first knocking and announcing the officer s presence or purpose prior to entering the premises minnesota statutes might also refer to them as dynamic entry warrants or unannounced entry warrants in the case of amir locke body worn camera video released by the mpd showed officers executing a no knock warrant the morning of feb 2 in the video an officer is seen opening the apartment door with a key before the mpd swat team crosses the threshold into the unit while officers yell police search warrant multiple times the officers do not knock or announced their presence before entering the unit no knock warrants in minneapolis in november 2020 frey and then minneapolis police chief medaria arradondo announced a new policy regarding no knock warrants requiring all mpd officers to announce themselves and their purpose before entering a residence there would be exceptions for some circumstances they said such as hostage situations frey s statement friday echoed some of the language from 2020 s policy change the only permissible way for mpd officers to execute a warrant is the knock and announce approach which includes knocking announcing waiting a reasonable amount of time and only then entering to execute a no knock warrant under the moratorium there must be an imminent threat of harm to an individual or the public and then the warrant must be approved by the chief the 2020 policy was born following the murder of george floyd who was killed by former minneapolis police officer derek chauvin two months after the death of breonna taylor after floyd s murder taylor s name was also chanted nationwide during protests against police killings of black people the 2020 policy change referred to two types of warrants entry with announcement and warrants that involve unannounced entry often referred to as no knock warrants the new policy was implemented in an effort to limit how officers can execute the latter type saying officers have to announce themselves as police and say they have a search warrant prior to entering a residence these announcements should include the officer s authority and what the officer wants the subject to do it also specifies that officers should be mindful of any known or reasonably suspected barriers that might keep people from cooperating like language barriers mental and emotional capacity and deafness according to the policy the swat team would be tasked with handing such warrants the policy included any search warrant entry made by mpd officers including when working with other agencies what now minnesota attorney general keith ellison has agreed to join forces with hennepin county attorney mike freeman to assist the bca in its investigation into locke s death following floyd s death ellison s office successfully convinced a jury to convict derek chauvin of murder landing him in prison for more than 22 years i promise the locke family and all minnesotans that we will work with the hennepin county attorney s office to conduct a fair and thorough review of the bca investigation and that we will be guided by the values of accountability and transparency ellison said in a social media post co attorney for the locke family tony romanucci asserted in a press conference in the days following locke s shooting that the minneapolis swat team errored in their execution saying officers didn t announce themselves or the serving of a warrant until they were already over the threshold of the front door he called it an absolutely disgusting violation of civil rights romanucci said there was just one way this interaction would end amir was doomed to die he had no chance romanucci insisted watch more local news

don t miss out on the headlines from music followed categories will be added to my news spotify s ceo has defended the company s multimillion dollar deal with joe rogan revealing the controversial podcaster is vital to the streaming service spotify boss daniel ek addressed the ongoing saga in a 15 minute speech to employees yesterday with the company finding itself stuck between its us100 million flagship talent and a popular backlash over covid 19 misinformation on his shows in 2020 spotify acquired rogan s podcast the joe rogan experience in a landmark deal the show is now spotify s most popular podcast with an estimated 11 million listeners per episode mr ek told employees that while he didn t agree with everything rogan said the company did not have editorial control over his podcast daniel ek ceo of spotify doubled down on the company s defence of joe rogan picture don emmert afp even though jre is an exclusive it is licensed content it is important to note that we do not have creative control over joe rogan s content we don t approve his guests in advance and just like any other creator we get his content when he publishes and then we review it and if it violates our policies we take the appropriate enforcement actions he said according to a transcript of the company town hall published by the verge there are many things that joe rogan says that i strongly disagree with and find very offensive however mr ek noted that if spotify wanted a chance at achieving its bold ambitions then they would have to put up with content that many of us may not be proud to be associated with not anything goes but there will be opinions ideas and beliefs that we disagree with strongly and even makes us angry or sad he said shares in the company were down 17 per cent thursday in new york as tech stocks dropped across the board these shares have been on the slide since november but have been badly hit by news that its subscriber growth is slowing spotify bought the joe rogan experience podcast in a deal reportedly worth more than us100 million picture cindy ord getty images according to the verge a number of employees pushed back on the company s position during a question and answer session they questioned whether spotify s recent actions had done enough to address the concerns of the scientific community and whether the platform s rules were stringent enough spotify recently announced it would be adding a content advisory to any podcast episode that includes a discussion about covid mr ek responded by repeating his earlier comments saying exclusivity does not equal endorsement the real thing here is to try to go for an even broader set of exclusives that represent even more voices he said joe rogan misinformation saga explained rogan has faced ongoing criticisms of his podcast after repeatedly using the platform to cast doubt on the safety and effectiveness of the covid vaccines and air misinformation about the virus the backlash really ramped up after he interviewed us cardiologist peter mccullough and vaccine scientist dr robert malone both guests are known for their controversial covid 19 beliefs and spent hours talking about everything from the efficacy of vaccines to conspiracy theories on how the pandemic really how the pandemic began and other potential treatments for covid being suppressed rogan was widely condemned for airing dangerous misinformation prompting music legend neil young to demand spotify remove rogan s podcast from the platform i am doing this because spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them he said specifically citing rogan s podcast neil young demanded spotify remove his music from the platform over claims the platform was helping to spread vaccine disinformation via joe rogan picture alice chiche and carmen mandato afp young gave spotify an ultimatum either get rid of rogan or he will pull his music from the platform spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform though the company presently has no misinformation policy he said they can have rogan or young not both it took spotify just 48 hours to make its decision confirming it would be removing young s music from the platform since then multiple other artists including joni mitchell graham nash and india arie have joined the boycott calling for their music to be removed from the platform rogan responded to the controversy in a nine minute video on monday with the 54 year old admitting he absolutely gets things wrong he also promised viewers he would endeavour to find a counter guest shortly after controversial topics were discussed on his podcast he insisted his only goal was to interview interesting people on topics of the hour and claimed much of how he was being perceived came from people forming opinions before actually viewing the podcasts in full i wanted to make this view because i think there is a lot of people who have a distorted perception of what i do maybe based on sound bites or headlines of disparaging articles originally published as spotify boss doubles down on defence of joe rogan despite backlash from employees

bloomberg wall street strategists had two wildly different pictures of the u s job market to weigh against each other this week one from the adp research institute showed the number of jobs tumbled in january the other from the u s labor department that payrolls grew at a surprisingly rapid pace adp s report on wednesday showed that companies cut more than 300 000 jobs during the first month of the year while the government s figures friday showed businesses added nearly 450 000 new positions but that gap of more than 700 000 may not seem so stark when more numbers flow in according to adp chief economist nela richardson one source of the discrepancy she said the adjustments that the labor department makes to factor out seasonal changes in employment an effort to make the monthly figures better depict the baseline trend of the economy adp also counts the number of people on active payrolls whether they get a paycheck or not she said another difference from the government so those differences are small in normal times and they re a bit bigger in abnormal times like we are in now she said on bloomberg s quicktake stock streaming program on friday over the course of several months not necessarily one month estimates you do see a greater alignment but the near term gulf underscored the heightened significance wall street is putting on economic indicators as it tries to gauge how aggressively the federal reserve will raise interest rates this year to keep the economy from overheating some analysts economists and white house officials expected friday s labor department figures to echo the weakness reported by adp anticipating that the coronavirus surge would dampen employment growth at the start of the year at td securities for instance economists predicted downside risk to their estimate of 200 000 jobs lost some estimates called for u s payrolls to decline by as much as 400 000 as a result the unexpected strength in january with a broad based gain of 467 000 in total nonfarm payrolls which also includes government employment caught markets by surprise sending bond yields surging and causing traders to ratchet up wagers that the fed will raise interest rates by as much as half a percentage point in march it also showed a 709 000 upward revision to the prior two months richardson said that upward revision brought the labor department s december estimate closer to adp s which was far stronger than the government s initial figures that story is still being written frankly she said if you looked at the revisions from november to december in december we looked off too it turns out we re not as off as was originally reported because those numbers were revised up by so much in december read more crazy mess of jobs data has economists getting it wrong again the big story this month was the revisions said richardson we thought it was going to be about worker absenteeism taking time off for sick leave because of omicron no it s about the revisions and they were revised up substantially in november and december she added that friday s figure shows the strength continued even as omicron surged so it gives us some reflection on the pattern of job gains not over the course of 2021 but heading into a new year 2022 bloomberg l p

beware the fed s tightening of monetary policy could lift real interest rates for gold this poses a risk of prices wildly rolling down the first fomc meeting in 2022 is behind us what can we expect from the us central bank this year and how will it affect the price of gold well this year s episode of fed street will be sponsored by the letter t which stands for tightening it will consist of three elements first quantitative easing tapering the asset purchases are going to end by early march to be clear during tapering the fed is still buying securities so it remains accommodative but less and less tapering has been very gradual and well telegraphed to the markets so it s probably already priced in gold thus the infamous taper tantrum shouldn t replay second quantitative tightening soon after the end of asset purchases the fed will begin shrinking its mammoth balance sheet as the chart below shows it has more than doubled since the start of the pandemic reaching about 9 trillion or about 36 of the country s gdp it s so gigantic that even powell admitted during his january press conference that the balance sheet is substantially larger than it needs to be captain obvious attacked again in contrast to tapering which just reduces additions to the fed s holdings quantitative tightening will shrink the balance sheet how much it s hard to say last time during qt from 2017 to 2019 the fed started unloading 10 billion in assets per month gradually lifting the cap to 50 billion given that inflation is now much higher and the fed has greater confidence in the economic recovery the scale of reduction would probably be higher the qt will create upward pressure on interest rates which could be negative for the gold market however qt will be a very gradual and orderly process instead of selling assets directly the us central bank will stop reinvestment of proceeds as securities runoff as we can read in principles for reducing the size of the federal reserve s balance sheet the committee intends to reduce the federal reserve s securities holdings over time in a predictable manner primarily by adjusting the amounts reinvested of principal payments received from securities held in the system open market account what s more the previous case of qt wasn t detrimental to gold as the chart below shows the price of gold started to rally in late 2018 and especially later in mid 2019 third the hiking cycle in march the fed is going to start increasing the federal funds rate according to the financial markets the us central bank will enact five interest rate hikes this year raising the federal funds rate to the range of 1 25 1 50 now there are two narratives about american monetary policy in 2022 according to the first we are witnessing a hawkish revolution within the fed as it would shift its monetary stance in a relatively short time the central bank will double tighten i e it will shrink its balance sheet at the same time as hiking rates and it will do it in a much more aggressive way than after the great recession such decisive moves will significantly raise the bond yields which will hit gold prices however in this scenario the fed s aggressive actions will eventually lead to the inversion of the yield curve and later to recession which should support the precious metals market on the other hand some analysts point out that central bankers are all talk and given their dovish bias act less aggressively than they promise chickening out in the face of the first stock market turbulence they also claim that all the fed s actions won t be enough to combat inflation and that monetary conditions will remain relatively loose for example stephen roach argues that the fed is so far behind that it can t even see the curve indeed the real federal funds rate is deeply negative around 7 as the chart below shows and even if inflation moderates to 3 5 while the fed conducts four hikes it will remain well below zero about 2 providing some support for gold prices which narrative is correct well there are grains of truth in both of them however i would like to remind you that what really matters for the markets is the change or direction not the level of a variable hence the fact that real interest rates are to stay extremely low doesn t guarantee that gold prices won t decline in a response to the hiking cycle actually as the chart above shows the upward reversal in the real interest rates usually plunges gold prices given that real rates are at a record low a normalization is still ahead of us hence unless inflation continues to rise bond yields are likely to move up while gold to move down want free follow ups to the above article and details not available to 99 investors sign up to our free newsletter today

listen to this article listen to this article oklahoma city legislators seeking to curb foreign ownership of oklahoma farmland may face a complicated battle this session as their sense of patriotism may present a challenge to key aspects of the state s economy state sen warren hamilton r mccurtain has filed senate bill 1469 intended to clarify existing state law that prohibits foreign entities from purchasing land in oklahoma while oklahoma law already prevents foreign land ownership it doesn t prevent these folks from creating businesses to purchase property hamilton said in a statement announcing the bill senate bill 1469 will put an end to this workaround of current state statute foreign investment in farmland has been a growing trend nationwide for the last several years but oklahoma is one of the handful of states where the growth has been most pronounced according to federal data oklahoma saw one of the largest increases in foreign held agricultural acres in 2020 adding nearly 383 600 acres for a total of 1 5 million acres owned by foreign entities in 2008 just 0 3 of oklahoma s farmland was foreign owned in 2019 an estimated 2 94 of the state s farmland was foreign owned according to federal data compiled by investigatetv which acknowledged that much of the federal data on foreign ownership is incomplete meaning the total percentage could be higher according to u s department of agriculture reports oklahoma is one of 14 states across the nation with more than 1 million foreign owned acres of land oklahoma is also one of 14 states that currently restricts or prohibits foreign ownership of u s private agricultural lands the oklahoma constitution stipulates that non u s citizens cannot acquire or own land in oklahoma land acquired through inheritance or in order to collect a debt must be divested within five to seven years however an exception is made for real estate necessary for carrying out business for a corporation lawfully formed in the state in statute the word foreign also applies to u s corporations formed in other states as well as to international entities sb 1469 would clarify that no alien or any person who is not a citizen of the united states shall acquire title to or own land in this state either directly or indirectly through a business entity or trust except as hereinafter provided the measure would make an exception for an alien who is or shall become a bona fide resident of the state of oklahoma or any lawfully recognized business entity the majority of the voting stock or equivalent controlling equity interest of which is owned by one or more resident aliens this is america hamilton said in order to own a piece of it you should be an american to allow any foreign entity to own a piece of america is treasonous such foolishness may be allowed in places like california but it should never happen here in oklahoma i m confident my colleagues will see the urgent need to close the loophole in current state statute and put an end to foreign land ownership in our state in his statement announcing the bill hamilton pointed to the state s burgeoning medical marijuana industry as the vehicle foreign interests are using to purchase oklahoma land as oklahoma s marijuana industry continues to grow we ve seen an increasing number of foreign interests come into our state and purchase our farmland for astronomical amounts of money in order to set up grows and other related businesses hamilton said but purchase of oklahoma land long precedes the state s vote to legalize medical marijuana in 2018 international and domestic investors alike have been snatching up farmland for more than a decade farmland has historically proven to be a low volatility asset that delivers strong returns on investment and investors have increasingly turned their attention to the sector since the 2008 recession between 1992 and 2020 the average annual return from farmland was 10 9 compared to 7 87 for the stock market and 6 for gold microsoft founder bill gates is currently estimated to own about 242 000 acres of farmland in 19 states countries such as china have invested in u s farmland often citing food security interests by 2020 chinese nationals had acquired almost 192 000 acres of u s agricultural land worth almost 2 billion an almost tenfold increase over the preceding decade chinese owned entities may also acquire farmland by purchasing agricultural companies in the u s as when hong kong based shuanghui acquired smithfield foods then the world s largest pork producer and processor with facilities in guymon oklahoma as well as in several other states back in 2013 the hong kong company made the acquisition amidst a series of food safety mishaps in china according to usda data oklahoma saw one of the largest increases in foreign held agricultural acres in 2020 adding nearly 383 600 acres for a total of 1 5 million acres owned by foreign entities in 2019 more than 40 of the 3 4 million acres acquired by foreign investors in the u s was located in texas oklahoma and colorado canadian investors bought the most land 29 though the netherlands italy germany and the united kingdom also purchased land in the u s nationwide the report estimates that 37 6 million acres or about 2 9 of the nation s total farm ranch and forest land were under foreign ownership in 2020 the latest year for which data was available according to data from the usda maine has the most land owned by foreign entities at 3 1 million acres followed by texas alabama washington and michigan canada is the biggest foreign owner of u s agricultural and timber land with 4 7 million acres in the united states legislation also has been introduced into congress that would restrict non american citizens from

listen to this article listen to this article washington ap in a surprising burst of hiring america s employers added 467 000 jobs in january in a sign of the economy s resilience even in the face of a wave of omicron infections last month the government s report friday also drastically revised up its estimate of job gains for november and december by a combined 709 000 it also said the unemployment rate ticked up from 3 9 to a still low 4 mainly because more people began looking for work and not all of them found jobs right away the strong hiring growth for january which defied expectations for only a slight gain demonstrates the eagerness of many employers to hire even as the pandemic raged businesses appear to have seen the omicron wave as having at most a temporary impact on the economy and remain confident about longer term growth employers have assumed that omicron would be painful but short term so they haven t changed their hiring plans said mathieu stevenson the ceo of snagajob a job listings site focused on hourly workers demand from employers is as strong as ever at the same time the magnitude of the job growth points to an economy in which high levels of hiring and spending combined with supply shortages are accelerating inflation wiping out pay raises and intensifying pressure on households those factors will likely give the federal reserve leeway to raise interest rates perhaps even faster than it had planned to cool inflation the fed has already indicated that it will begin raising rates in march and it could do so again at its next meeting in may stock futures dipped immediately on the expectation that the fed could speed up its efforts to tighten credit which would potentially weaken the economy before partly recovering by mid morning daniel zhao senior economist at the employment website glassdoor said the healthy hiring not only for january but also for november and december is a sign that last month s gains weren t merely a blip this is an actual trend and job growth was faster than we realized zhao said a greater proportion of americans are also now working or looking for work the report showed a trend that makes it easier for companies to find workers it may suggest that concerns about long term labor shortages have been overblown at least in some industries there are workers out there it s just taking time to integrate them back into the labor force zhao said the overall outlook for the job market remains bright with openings near a record high the pace of layoffs down and the unemployment rate having already reached a healthy level the nation gained more jobs last year adjusted for the size of the workforce than in any year since 1978 the unemployment rate fell by nearly 3 percentage points from 6 7 to 3 9 the sharpest yearly decline on records much of that improvement represented a rebound from record job losses in 2020 that were driven by the pandemic recession yet the economy s strong growth and hiring gains were accompanied by the highest inflation in four decades magnified by brisk consumer spending on furniture electronics appliances and other goods and vast infusions of federal aid that has now largely expired snarled supply chains hampered the availability of many goods especially new and used vehicles forcing prices up sharply prices of food energy and housing soared too high inflation has wiped out many americans pay gains omicron infections are likely slowing the economy in the january march quarter particularly compared with the rapid expansion in the final three months of 2021 when it grew at a robust 6 9 annual rate some analysts have forecast that growth will weaken to an annual rate as low as 1 in the first three months of this year one reason for the slowdown americans cut their spending in january as the spread of the coronavirus discouraged some people from eating out traveling and going to movies and other entertainment venues yet as omicron fades there are signs that consumers are poised to spend again auto sales jumped in january after several months of declines carmakers have managed to slowly ramp up production and americans incomes rose at a solid pace last month providing fuel for future spending

don t miss out on the headlines from music followed categories will be added to my news spotify s ceo has defended the company s multimillion dollar deal with joe rogan revealing the controversial podcaster is vital to the streaming service spotify boss daniel ek addressed the ongoing saga in a 15 minute speech to employees yesterday with the company finding itself stuck between its us100 million flagship talent and a popular backlash over covid 19 misinformation on his shows in 2020 spotify acquired rogan s podcast the joe rogan experience in a landmark deal the show is now spotify s most popular podcast with an estimated 11 million listeners per episode mr ek told employees that while he didn t agree with everything rogan said the company did not have editorial control over his podcast daniel ek ceo of spotify doubled down on the company s defence of joe rogan picture don emmert afp even though jre is an exclusive it is licensed content it is important to note that we do not have creative control over joe rogan s content we don t approve his guests in advance and just like any other creator we get his content when he publishes and then we review it and if it violates our policies we take the appropriate enforcement actions he said according to a transcript of the company town hall published by the verge there are many things that joe rogan says that i strongly disagree with and find very offensive however mr ek noted that if spotify wanted a chance at achieving its bold ambitions then they would have to put up with content that many of us may not be proud to be associated with not anything goes but there will be opinions ideas and beliefs that we disagree with strongly and even makes us angry or sad he said shares in the company were down 17 per cent thursday in new york as tech stocks dropped across the board these shares have been on the slide since november but have been badly hit by news that its subscriber growth is slowing spotify bought the joe rogan experience podcast in a deal reportedly worth more than us100 million picture cindy ord getty images according to the verge a number of employees pushed back on the company s position during a question and answer session they questioned whether spotify s recent actions had done enough to address the concerns of the scientific community and whether the platform s rules were stringent enough spotify recently announced it would be adding a content advisory to any podcast episode that includes a discussion about covid mr ek responded by repeating his earlier comments saying exclusivity does not equal endorsement the real thing here is to try to go for an even broader set of exclusives that represent even more voices he said joe rogan misinformation saga explained rogan has faced ongoing criticisms of his podcast after repeatedly using the platform to cast doubt on the safety and effectiveness of the covid vaccines and air misinformation about the virus the backlash really ramped up after he interviewed us cardiologist peter mccullough and vaccine scientist dr robert malone both guests are known for their controversial covid 19 beliefs and spent hours talking about everything from the efficacy of vaccines to conspiracy theories on how the pandemic really how the pandemic began and other potential treatments for covid being suppressed rogan was widely condemned for airing dangerous misinformation prompting music legend neil young to demand spotify remove rogan s podcast from the platform i am doing this because spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them he said specifically citing rogan s podcast neil young demanded spotify remove his music from the platform over claims the platform was helping to spread vaccine disinformation via joe rogan picture alice chiche and carmen mandato afp young gave spotify an ultimatum either get rid of rogan or he will pull his music from the platform spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform though the company presently has no misinformation policy he said they can have rogan or young not both it took spotify just 48 hours to make its decision confirming it would be removing young s music from the platform since then multiple other artists including joni mitchell graham nash and india arie have joined the boycott calling for their music to be removed from the platform rogan responded to the controversy in a nine minute video on monday with the 54 year old admitting he absolutely gets things wrong he also promised viewers he would endeavour to find a counter guest shortly after controversial topics were discussed on his podcast he insisted his only goal was to interview interesting people on topics of the hour and claimed much of how he was being perceived came from people forming opinions before actually viewing the podcasts in full i wanted to make this view because i think there is a lot of people who have a distorted perception of what i do maybe based on sound bites or headlines of disparaging articles originally published as spotify boss doubles down on defence of joe rogan despite backlash from employees
the skidding us dollar will be looking to the january inflation readings out of the united states to reverse its decline as financial markets enter a somewhat quieter week uk gdp growth numbers will be the other highlight as the pound s rally lost steam after the bank of england sent some mixed signals on the economy the kiwi might find some love should the rbnz s own survey show inflation expectations are creeping higher in new zealand however with earnings releases also slowing down markets might nevertheless struggle to find fresh direction in the coming days waiting for inflation to peak it will likely be another grim picture on the inflation front next week as the us consumer price index is expected to edge up to yet another multi decade high on thursday the 12 month rate in cpi is forecast to have risen by 7 2 in january climbing 0 2 percentage points from the prior month there might be some relief from the month on month rate which is expected to have risen at the slowest pace in four months by 0 4 however the core rate will likely raise eyebrows as it s set to jump from 5 5 to 5 9 year on year the next few months will be crucial in determining whether inflation has started to peak so investors will be scouring over the details of the report to find any signs that price pressures in the cpi components most affected by the pandemic and the related supply disruptions are starting to ease weaker than expected readings in either the headline or core rates would raise hopes that inflation is plateauing this would be good news for shares on wall street but not so much for the dollar as treasury yields could tumble if investors begin to price out some of the more excessive rate hikes bets for the fed the dollar index slid sharply from the 18 month high it hit only a week ago after fed policymakers calmed fears that a 50 basis points rate hike was on the menu in march however should the inflation numbers surprise on the upside again that would add wind to the dollar s sails in other data out of the us the university of michigan s preliminary consumer sentiment gauge will be watched on friday energised euro might shine even in quiet week the euro shot higher after the european central bank signalled it may have to pull back the pandemic era stimulus at a much faster pace than currently indicated opening the door to a rate increase in 2022 amid the worsening threat of higher inflation eurozone government bond yields surged in the aftermath of the meeting as the prospect of a rate hike later this year draws closer the euro will likely have to rely on this rally enduring in the coming days if it is to stretch its gains as there s not a lot on the european calendar of interest apart from some german stats german industrial output for december is out on monday and will be followed by trade figures on wednesday and the final january cpi print on friday germany s recovery has stumbled lately and is now lagging those of some other eurozone countries so any positive surprises could assist the euro s latest upwards march outside of the euro area sweden s riksbank meets on thursday and might follow in the ecb s footsteps in sounding more hawkish pound turns to gdp data after boe confuses markets the bank of england maintained its advantage over other major central banks in being the least behind the curve on inflation by hiking rates for the second meeting in a row in february however despite the overall hawkish backdrop of the meeting governor andrew bailey pointed out some downside risks to their upwardly revised inflation forecasts casting uncertainty over the rate outlook even as he flagged more rate hikes in upcoming meetings so although sterling remains well supported after the boe meeting it may need a fresh upside driver to sustain its rebound against the greenback it s doubtful if next week s quarterly gdp publication can act as that driver data on friday will likely reveal that the uk economy recouped all its lost output from the pandemic in the three months to december gdp is projected to have expanded by 1 1 quarter on quarter the same pace as in q3 separate numbers for december will be available too including for industrial production and the trade balance these could attract more attention if they show a bigger than anticipated impact from the omicron wave on the economy with the bank of england decision out of the way the degree to which growth faltered in december and january and how quickly it picks up going forward will probably be of more significance for traders hence reaction to the data might be limited even if there s an impressive beat in the headline gdp figure kiwi looks to rbnz survey as bounceback gathers steam the reserve bank of new zealand doesn t meet until february 23 but markets might get a clue as to what to expect from its quarterly survey on inflation expectations on friday the rbnz s measures of price expectations has been a good guide on the central bank s next move in the past and could be again if expectations for one and two year inflation jump sharply like they did in the previous two surveys a rate hike is almost certain at the february meeting but policymakers might have trouble with the very steep rate hike path futures markets have priced in if inflation expectations climb further that would create less room for disappointment and support the new zealand dollar s grind higher in neighbouring australia the aussie dollar will likely be taking its cues from the broader market risk tone as the only major release is the final retail sales estimate for december as well as for the whole december quarter a further improvement in risk sentiment next week could inflict more damage on the japanese yen which is paring some of its january gains however household spending numbers for japan on tuesday and corporate goods prices on thursday are unlikely to provide much of a boost

this call we hope to complete our call within one hour at this time i ll turn the call over to ric campo ric campo chairman and chief executive officer good morning the opening ceremony for the 2022 winter olympics are today and as you could tell from our on hold music and slide show team camden has embraced the olympic spirit the olympic theme set me down memory lane and into camden s archive for the video i m going to show you today during the 2012 summer olympics the u s women s swim team made a video using a very popular song titled call me maybe at camden we are proud to be a friendly and welcoming workplace one unique way we showed this is by greeting teammates with a hug instead of a handshake camden employees probably give and receive more hugs per day than any other workplace in america so if you combine our hugging culture with the olympic spirit a call me maybe video becomes a hug me maybe video and following the 2012 olympics this happened at our corporate office one of the many adjustments in camden s world caused by social distancing during the pandemic was replacing actual hugs with virtual hubs since camden is a fully vaccinated workplace we have recently seen an uptick in breakthrough cases of actual hugging in our workplace we all look forward to the day when all virtual hubs at camden will become actual hubs 2021 turned out to be a remarkable year and we clearly exceeded our original guidance that we provided at this time last year our 2021 budget call for ffo of 5 per share with same property revenues up slightly and net operating income down approximately 1 as reported last night we closed 2021 with ffo of 5 39 per share and same property growth of 4 3 and 4 8 for revenues and net operating income respectively we expect 2022 to be our best year on record for earnings and same property growth the midpoint of our 2022 guidance calls for ffo per share of 6 24 with same property revenue growth of 8 75 and net operating income growth of 12 our geographically and product diverse portfolio in the sunbelt markets continue to outperform i want to thank each of our camden team members for their hard work and commitment to our values and for improving the lives of our team members and our customers one experience at a time 2021 was a great year but the best is yet to come thank you and i will now turn the call over to keith oden keith oden executive vice chairman and president thanks ric we have a tradition of assigning letter grades to forecast conditions in our markets at the beginning of every year i ll start with a review of the supply and demand conditions we expect to encounter in camden s markets during 2022 and ranked the markets in the order of best to worst for the first time in 10 years camden s overall portfolio earned an a with a stable outlook and no market received a grade below a in addition we are now providing this report card to you as part of our earnings call slide deck which is showing now and will be posted on our website after today s call we anticipate overall same property revenue growth this year in the range of 7 75 to 9 5 for our entire portfolio with most of our markets falling within that range the outliers on the positive side would be phoenix and our florida markets which should produce double digit revenue growth than houston and d c which will likely lag the overall portfolio average but still show significant improvement versus 2021 our outlook for supply and demand in 2022 is based on multiple third party economic forecasts that generally reflects strong job growth in camden s markets coupled with a steady amount of new supply estimates range from 1 million to 1 2 million new jobs created in our 15 major markets in 2022 along with 150 000 to 200 000 new completions so our outlook reflects somewhere around the midpoint of both projections it is likely no surprise that for 2022 our top ranking once again goes to phoenix which has averaged 7 revenue growth over the past three years and has an expected revenue growth well above 10 this year we give this market an a rating with a stable outlook supply and demand metrics for 2022 look well balanced with estimates calling for 80 000 new jobs in phoenix and 18 000 new units coming online this year up next are our three florida markets southeast florida tampa and orlando each also earned a ratings with stable outlooks these three markets should achieve revenue growth of over 10 in 2022 and are projected to have strong job growth to offset new supply coming online current estimates for job growth were approximately 50 000 in both southeast florida and tampa and 60 000 in orlando completions are expected to be 10 000 6 000 and 9 000 units respectively our next 8 markets all earned an a rating with a stable outlook and should produce revenue growth generally within our guidance range of 3 75 to 9 75 in 2022 atlanta austin and raleigh should achieve revenue growth toward the high end of our guidance range in 2022 in atlanta job growth is expected to be 90 000 with around 10 000 new apartment completions in austin projections call for 50 000 additional jobs with completions of roughly 18 000 units and in raleigh the jobs to completions ratio should be five times with 35 000 new jobs versus 7 000 new apartment completions san diego inland empire and charlotte are next falling around the middle of the pack in camden s portfolio for the san diego inland empire market we expect to see over 100 000 new jobs in 2022 and with new supply around 8 000 units charlotte should also deliver 8 000 units with 40 000 new jobs created providing a good balance of supply and demand in that market nashville is camden s newest market as we acquired two communities there last summer while nashville will not be included in our 2022 same property pool we would rate the city as an a with a stable outlook there has been a significant amount of construction in nashville and that will continue in 2022 with approximately 10 000 new units expected to deliver this year however demand for apartment homes has remained strong in nashville with positive end migration trends and projections for over 40 000 new jobs dallas and denver are both solid markets and we expect market conditions to be favorable again in 2022 supply demand ratios in dallas and denver remained steady with 95 000 and 55 000 new jobs anticipated respectively during 2022 with supply at 15 000 and 10 000 new units respectively scheduled for delivery this year l a orange county in houston are the last two markets earning an a rating but both have improving outlooks our portfolio in la county saw higher delinquencies and bad debt in 2021 than our other markets but we are hopeful that conditions will improve in 2022 as covid restrictions begin to ease and regulatory issues around evictions are reduced l a orange county faces healthy operating conditions with favorable supply and demand metrics job growth should be around 150 000 with completions of 16 000 expected in 2022 in houston conditions began to improve in 2021 and after the market has struggled with many new lease ups giving high levels of concessions new supply is expected to ease in 2022 to around 17 000 units and job growth should remain strong with around 75 000 new jobs expected our final market is d c metro which we gave an a but with an improving outlook supply remains steady with over 13 000 new units coming on this year but job growth should be healthy as well with 80 000 new jobs expected similar to l a orange county washington d c has been a challenging market given the covid environment and the many restrictions that were put in place as a result of the pandemic while we are optimistic that 2022 will reflect an improved operating environment there we have budgeted low to mid single digit revenue growth for d c metro this year now a few details on our fourth quarter 21 operating results in january 2022 trends same property revenue growth was 8 5 for the fourth quarter and 4 3 for full year 2021 our top performers for the fourth quarter all had over 10 revenue growth and included tampa phoenix southern california raleigh and southeast florida rental rates for the fourth quarter had signed new leases up 16 7 renewals up 14 1 and a blended rate of 15 5 our preliminary january results indicate similar trends with blended growth of over 15 on signed leases february and march renewal offers were sent out with an average increase in the mid 14 range occupancy averaged 97 1 during the fourth quarter and compared to 97 3 last quarter and 95 5 in the fourth quarter of 20 january 2022 occupancy has averaged 97 2 compared to 95 7 in january of last year and is slightly up from our fourth quarter 21 levels annual net turnover for 2021 was in line with 2020 at 41 and move outs to home purchases were 15 8 for the quarter and 16 4 for the full year of 2021 relatively in line with our reported 15 8 for full year 2020 i ll now turn the call over to alex jessett camden s chief financial officer alex jessett chief financial officer thanks keith before i move on to our financial results and guidance a brief update on our recent real estate activities during the fourth quarter of 2021 we purchased camden greenville a recently constructed 558 unit mid rise community in dallas and we purchased five acres of land in denver and two acres of land in nashville for future development purposes for the full year of 2021 we have completed acquisitions of four communities with 1 684 apartment homes for a total cost of approximately 633 million ahead of our original 2021 acquisition guidance of 450 million and we acquired four undeveloped land parcels for a total cost of approximately 72 million additionally during the quarter we disposed of two operating communities in houston and one operating community in laurel maryland for total proceeds of approximately 260 million these three dispositions were on average 21 years old with average monthly rents of 1 350 per door and annual capex of approximately 2 300 per door using actual capex these dispositions were completed at a 3 9 affo yield generating a 10 5 unleveraged irr over a 20 year hold period based on a broker cap rate which assumes 350 per door in capex and a 3 management fee on trailing 12 month noi the cap rate would have been 4 3 and finally during the quarter we stabilized ahead of schedule camden north end two a 343 unit 79 million new development in phoenix generating an approximate 8 75 yield and we completed construction on camden hillcrest an 89 million new development in san diego on the financing side during the quarter we issued approximately 180 million of shares under our existing atm program moving on to financial results last night we reported funds from operations for the fourth quarter of 2021 of 160 2 million or 1 51 per share exceeding the midpoint of our prior guidance range by 0 02 per share this outperformance resulted primarily from higher levels of occupancy and rental rates at our non same store acquisition and development communities and lower taxes and utilities at our same store communities for 2021 we delivered full year same store revenue growth of 4 3 expense growth of 3 5 and noi growth of 4 8 as compared to our original 2021 same store guidance of 0 75 for revenue 3 5 for expenses and negative 0 85 for noi you can refer to page 27 of our fourth quarter supplemental package for details on the key assumptions driving our 2022 financial outlook we expect our 2022 ffo per share to be in the range of 6 09 to 6 39 and with a midpoint of 6 24 representing an 0 85 per share increase from our 2021 results this increase is anticipated to result primarily from an approximate 0 79 per share increase in ffo related to the performance of our same store portfolio at the midpoint we are expecting same store net operating income growth of 12 driven by revenue growth of 8 75 and expense growth of 3 each 1 increase in same store noi is approximately 0 065 per share in ffo an approximate 0 35 per share increase in ffo related to the growth in operating income from our non same store joint venture and retail communities resulting primarily from higher rental rates lower bad debt and the incremental contribution of our four acquisitions completed in 2021 and our nine development communities in lease up during either 2021 and or 2022 and an approximate 0 07 per share increase in ffo due to an assumed 600 million of pro forma acquisitions spread throughout the year at an initial yield of 3 5 this 1 21 cumulative increase in anticipated ffo per share is partially offset by an approximate 0 11 per share decrease in ffo from our completed 2021 dispositions an approximate 0 04 per share decrease in ffo from an assumed 250 million of pro forma dispositions anticipated to primarily occur late 2022 an approximate 0 03 per share decrease in ffo resulting primarily from the combination of lower interest income from lower cash balances higher franchise and margin taxes and higher corporate depreciation and amortization our combined general and administrative property management and fee and asset management expenses are anticipated to be effectively flat year over year and an approximate 0 18 per share decrease in ffo due to the additional shares outstanding for full year 2022 following our 2021 atm activity our revenue growth midpoint of 8 75 is based upon an anticipated 11 average increase in new leases and a 7 average increase in renewals we are also anticipating that occupancy will moderate slightly to 96 5 page 27 of our supplemental package also details other assumptions for 2022 including the plan for 400 million to 600 million of on balance sheet development starts spread throughout the year with approximately 315 million of annual development spend we expect ffo per share for the first quarter of 2022 to be within the range of 1 45 to 1 49 the midpoint of 1 47 represents a 0 04 per share decrease from the fourth quarter of 2021 which is primarily the result of an approximate 0 02 per share decrease in ffo resulting from our fourth quarter 2021 dispositions an approximate 0 01 per share decrease in sequential same store net operating income resulting primarily from the reset of our annual property tax accrual on january 1 of each year and other expense increases primarily attributable to typical seasonal trends including the timing of on site salary increases and an approximate 0 01 per share decrease in ffo due to the additional shares outstanding from our fourth quarter 2021 atm activity our balance sheet remains strong with net debt to ebitda at 3 8 times and a total fixed charge coverage ratio at 6 4 times as of today we have approximately 1 4 billion of liquidity comprised of approximately 500 million in cash and cash equivalents and no amounts outstanding under our 900 million unsecured credit facility at quarter end we had 199 million left to spend over the next two years under our existing development pipeline and we have no scheduled debt maturities until late 2022 our current excess cash is invested with various banks earning approximately 15 basis points at this time we ll open the call up to questions questions answers operator our first question comes from haendel st juste with mizuho please go ahead haendel st juste mizuho securities analyst hey good morning appreciate all the market color and all the detail i had a question more so on the i guess we re starting to see a bit of a divergence here in the new lease rates and renewals the new lease rates continue to accelerate renewals slowing a bit how do we think about that relationship near term i expect new lease rates to come under more pressure as we face tougher comps but i guess i m curious also which markets are you seeing the best and weakest pricing power on renewals what s causing the drag ric campo chairman and chief executive officer yes so hand the gap between new leases and renewal rates is something that moves around quite a bit primarily because of what we do on renewal rates from time to time depending on what s going on in our market or a submarket we might put in place renewal caps and which is not something we would ever do on new lease rates not in this environment so it s going to move around a little bit depending on kind of what it s literally our pricing team looking at the trends day to day and making recommendations i think in the first quarter we had a couple of markets that we had renewal caps in place but i mean you re talking about renewal caps on what might have done as much as a 20 plus percent renewal rates being capped at 18 and that would have been in someplace like tampa st petersburg but it s not unusual for that to move around i would expect to see that over the course of the year you probably will see a narrowing in that but i think our guidance as alex pointed out has new leases at 11 over the course of the year and renewals at 7 so not too far off of where we are right now but it s clearly it s absolutely part of the art and science of revenue management and it s just our revenue team looking at current trends and making recommendations haendel st juste mizuho securities analyst got it got it so no particular market of note on the renewal side that you re seeing a more meaningful difference in a form ric campo chairman and chief executive officer no and i would say when we talk about less strength i mean i think that s the overriding message of this entire of all the data sets that we sent out last night i mean you re talking about pretty unprecedented levels of both new lease and renewal rates across all of our markets and we had 12 of our 14 markets with double digit noi growth in the fourth quarter and that trend has continued over in the first quarter so somebody always has to be at the bottom and right now washington d c is at the bottom and some of that is just the drag from the d c metro properties where we are really precluded from finding a market clearing rate for the communities the apartments that we have there but overall these are i think the lowest grade that we gave was an a and that was washington d c and so this is the first time we ve ever had that happen in our portfolio obviously a lot of strength out there haendel st juste mizuho securities analyst yes yes very well noted actually your comments lead me to my second question which is i guess your longer term views on your houston and d c portfolio exposures here both markets haven t exactly been the strongest of late although they re they re improving at least the outlook for this year i guess i m curious on your exposure to your two largest markets you re increasing exposure to other smaller sunbelt markets you ve sold a few assets in houston in this past quarter so i guess how do we think about your exposure there over the next few years are these markets become source of the funds for your expansion into some of these other smaller higher growth sunbelt markets ric campo chairman and chief executive officer well haendel that s exactly what our strategy has been we talked about it on the call last time which was we were going to use this environment to sell down houston and d c and then expand our portfolio and to increase the exposure in some of the markets that we re underweighted in ultimately that s our strategy it s going to take us a few years to get there but it makes a lot of sense i mean clearly geographic diversification and primarily being in the sunbelt has definitely helped us a lot and i think ultimately as we do that sort of portfolio redistribution over the next couple of years it will help us do more geographically if you look at the last cycle in terms of how much we bought and sold i mean we really transformed the portfolio from 2010 through about the fourth to the pandemic and we sold on average 26 year old assets and redistributed that cash flow sold out in las vegas so we did a lot of portfolio management then when the numbers that was really if you look at how many sales we did relative to our total asset base in 2010 we redistributed 44 of our noi around the country as a result of those transactions where we sold assets nearly 3 billion that bought properties and then we also developed properties and so we ll continue that i think this environment gives us the opportunity to do it on a very very low spread basis where we re not giving up a lot of cash flow given the amazing market that people want to buy those are properties they sort of that s kind of the hottest spot in the market right now even though all it s very cost for sure haendel st juste mizuho securities analyst got it that s helpful is there any pricing difference or noticing any significant demand difference in selling say houston assets versus d c given some of the challenges you noted earlier ric campo chairman and chief executive officer early on there was sort of a pricing differential in houston relative to other markets and it needs to be a bit but that has vanished because from wallet capital when you look at what s happened i mean in 2021 there was roughly 300 almost 350 billion in multifamily transactions and just to put it in perspective the gateway markets the sales were up 8 from the prior year and in non gateway markets you re up 96 so all the non gateway markets is where the capital went so for us when we started talking i think last year when we talked about the selling down and redistributing these assets talked about perhaps having the 100 to 125 basis point nerve cap rate and that s narrowed to under 50 the massive bid for those properties and there is no discount today in houston or in d c and i think the other part of that equation is when you think about houston houston added 154 000 jobs this year it s going to add 75 000 jobs next year 2022 is the year where energy companies are actually hiring and that has to do with 90 oil some people are thinking that oil is going to go to over 100 but so the bottom line is that while houston has not added all of its jobs back from the pre pandemic level and all of the other cities in texas have houston has gas in its tank and it is our lower the houston and d c while there s lower growth cities today they still have the ability to they have gas in their tank because they haven t been able to we haven t pushed them as far as other cities and then d c as keith mentioned in our district in the district we have some really significant assets we cannot raise renewal rates so you just have to renew it at the original number and we have the market there and that s what s driving sort of dc to be at the bottom of our growth but even when you look at houston number we re in a normal year i d be cheering houston but the problem is you ve got the markets like tampa and phoenix are just out of control good and so the slowness of houston makes you feel like it s a dragon because i mean it is on a fundamental basis but it s still really good well above trend for houston and i think we have the benefit of more growth there when other markets perhaps start slowing in the future haendel st juste mizuho securities analyst great that s fantastic color appreciate the time and insights thank you operator our next question comes from derek johnston with deutsche bank please go ahead derek johnston deutsche bank analyst hi everybody thank you can you touch on the 2022 expense environment kind of baked into guidance really in regards to taxes and payroll pressures it generally seems to be a favorable setup but any additional color on possible tax rate increases or expectations given that the expenses seem to remain largely in check ric campo chairman and chief executive officer yeah absolutely so we are anticipating that property taxes are going to be up about 3 3 in 2022 a large component of that is some significant property tax refunds that we ve already settled the cases and so it s just a matter of receiving the check to give you an idea our total property tax refunds in 2021 was about 2 2 million and we re expecting about 3 1 million of refunds in 2022 so that s one of the primary drivers of the property tax number being relatively mild at 3 3 the other thing i ll point out is that rates in texas so both houston austin and dallas rates came in much lower than we had originally expected for 2021 and i think that bodes very very well for 2022 if you think about the sort of the rest of our expense categories we continue to do a really good job of controlling and being more efficient with our marketing spend a lot of that is driven by the technological advancements that i ve talked about in prior quarters and we re seeing the same thing on the salary side if you think about the technological advancements that we ve talked about including the installation of smart access for all entranceways which not only improves the customer experience it also provides efficiencies for our maintenance teams and then most importantly facilitates self guided tours and then we re also improving our sales process through our funnel implementation which is our sophisticated customer relationship management tool and then also marketing and automation platform when you put all of that in place and then we re also working on ai that all helps to sort of counter some of the inflationary expense controls in 2022 and beyond so that s really the primary driver and that s why we feel pretty good about the 3 number derek johnston deutsche bank analyst no that s very helpful so yes this quarter and last year the land acquisitions certainly show a commitment to develop even a mid rise n construction material labor costs so are rising rents encouraging enough to further ramp development now i mean what yields would you expect on any new starts or what yields would you need to make a project to go especially when you look at apartment cap rates for acquisitions especially the new stuff you like are so tight down in the mid to high threes what development yield kind of makes a project to go and what s the minimum or what s the tipping point ric campo chairman and chief executive officer development deals are what we look at is our unlevered irr over a seven year period and when you look at so you can talk about it from that perspective and clearly the good news is that rental rates have risen faster than construction costs at least in the cycle which is pretty amazing just to give you some data points the 600 plus if you take the 600 million we have under construction plus the 200 million that we ve already finalized we have cap rates our initial yields on stabilization have actually gone up because of the rising interest rates or the rise in rental rates to roughly 6 sort of going to yield when we look at our pipeline that we have which is roughly another 1 billion 1 5 billion something like that most of the sort of average that we re looking at those are going to be in the fives low fives probably and we haven t really updated the numbers on both cost for the rents in those pro formas so when you look at cap rates in the low threes and existing yields in the five clearly a development is a preferred option when you think about risk reward and the returns that we re making we have pressed our development of people to try to expand the pipeline and if you look this year we re in a our midpoint of 0 5 billion to starts which will take our pipeline back up to a little over 1 billion or at least our construction progress up to 1 billion it s a really good business right now and one of the challenges obviously is the forward looking start numbers and those are also peaking so we re long term holders obviously so we can work through those cycles and i think hard if you ask me could we double our pipeline and go from 1 billion to 2 billion really hard to do and just to give you timing and just what it takes to get a development done but we re we usually do 300 million a year and we ll do 500 million this year and hopefully maybe something like that next year so at the margins we re comfortable in that 1 billion 1 2 billion 1 3 billion range derek johnston deutsche bank analyst thank you operator our next question comes from nick joseph with citi please go ahead nick joseph citi analyst thanks what s the current loss to lease for the portfolio and then for the increase assumed on new leases how does that look in the first half of the year versus your expectations in the back half of the year alex jessett chief financial officer yeah so if you look at current loss to lease and there s as we ve talked about in the past because of dynamic pricing there s lots of different ways you can sort of slice this number if you look at all of the new leases that we signed in december and you compare those to the effective leases in place that would put loss to lease sort of in the 10 to 11 range right now so that s sort of where we are if you think about the way we are anticipating 2022 to sort of roll out we re anticipating continued very strong numbers and obviously in the first quarter and then second quarter and third quarter we get into sort of our peak periods but we are expecting seasonality to start kicking in toward the latter part of the third quarter and the fourth quarter so you d start to see a lot of that coming back down nick joseph citi analyst thanks and then just on rental assistance i think you had 5 3 million in the third quarter what was that number in the fourth quarter and then what is assumed in 2022 guidance alex jessett chief financial officer yes absolutely so the 5 3 million in the third quarter that was a total on a same store basis for the third quarter it was 4 2 million that did increase to 5 1 million in the fourth quarter of 21 so that gave us for a same store basis about 12 5 million for 2021 and what we ve got in our assumptions today is that we re going to recognize about half of that amount in 2022 nick joseph citi analyst thank you very much operator our next question comes from brad heffern with rbc please go ahead brad heffern rbc capital markets analyst hey everyone alex just as a follow on to that last question about new lease growth you have the 15 plus number in january and it seems like you can probably sustain double digits through the second quarter before the comps get really tough but just to hit the averages that you talk about it seems like it will be some sort of low mid single digit number in the second half of the year to hit the averages so is that the right way to think about it and is that kind of what we should think about as your expectation for market rent growth from where we are right now ric campo chairman and chief executive officer yes absolutely i think that s probably a pretty good way of thinking about it if you sort of look at december of 2021 to december 2022 and what do we think market rent growth is going to be over that period we think it s sort of in the call it the 4 to 5 range and then you ve obviously got the loss to lease that we re going to be able to recognize partially throughout the rest of the year brad heffern rbc capital markets analyst ok got it and then on the balance sheet obviously this quarter you ticked below the bottom end of your typical four to five times range i m curious for funding needs beyond the dispositions in 22 should we expect that those will come from debt or do you have a desire to keep the balance sheet maybe cleaner than it would normally be just given the place in the cycle ric campo chairman and chief executive officer well we ve always have a stated view that we should have our debt to ebitda in the 4 to 5 range we re obviously below that as a result of the equity issuance but we also have a net acquisitions or net net investment when we take acquisitions minus dispositions plus development spend so we we ll be executing all that and we ll get that to ebitda back into the middle part of the equation but today it s an interesting time when you look at the ability to put permanent capital on the books with and then deploy that capital into what s a very frothy acquisition market but i ve never seen our affo yield under 3 on our stock price generally in my business career so i think we have a green light to use every source of capital and we will continue to be in that band and when it s opportunistic for us to issue equity we will when it s opportunistic to issue debt we will but we ll stay in that band in general brad heffern rbc capital markets analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from neil malkin with capital one securities please go ahead neil malkin capital one securities analyst hey thanks good morning everyone first question a little bit bigger picture so you guys have a unique insight into sort of the divergence between sunbelt and coastal to some extent you have the dc and then obviously southern california and i m wondering i ve heard kind of mixed things between people have elevated coastal exposure kind of being incrementally positive and seeing people return to the office or whenever that happens maybe in 2025 expecting solid growth and sort of almost like a return to normal in a california market kind of like a pre covid type of thing but at the same time you re seeing amazing historic levels of in migration to your sunbelt markets and just very strong growth as evidenced by where you are relative to recover rent levels so i m just wondering if you can kind of give your view on over the next call it three years what you see in terms of job growth population growth migration in the sunbelt versus kind of what you re seeing in california and if you just think california may be a little bit impaired just given this significant outflow of businesses and people ric campo chairman and chief executive officer yes so we do have a little bit of a unique perspective because we ve operated in coal in the sunbelt markets for many years now and i think i mean our general ben that the patterns of migration from coastal markets in particular california the northeast into the sunbelt markets that was already in place pre covid thoroughly accelerated during tobi and but our view is that when to when it all settles back down to a more normal pattern you re still going to be left with the normal with the pre covid trends of migration to the sunbelt or hold for reasons that really don t have anything to do with covenant experience although that clearly was an accelerator but interestingly enough in california for 2022 based on our game plan california is really not going to be a drag on the portfolio in 2022 so the job growth that s happening in l a county versus the number of new starts there put that particular market in a really good place clearly the difference in and you still have we still have some kind of fighting the regulatory construct in california but we do anticipate that that will improve in 2022 so i think we are going to get some relief in d c our issue in d c relative to the balance of the portfolio as rick mentioned is more a dc proper experience for us the metro there are a couple of outliers in the d c metro suburban markets where there s still some regulatory constructs in place but they re minor in the overall scheme of things so i think that both of those markets post covid post regulatory constructs are still going to be going through the reset in rents that the rest of america has already a lot of america is already in the midst of i don t think they re going to get passed over in the sense of that we re going to come out of this and look back two years from now and there was a reset that didn t include the last 10 up in both california and d c in the d c metro market it s just going to come in a different timing and as rick mentioned mean it kind of bodes well for us as we roll through 2022 to have two of our larger markets and then i throw houston in that basket as well because we clearly haven t gotten we re not going to get the reset all at the same time as we got in our other markets in houston so three of our largest markets that are kind of going through the reset in a different phase than the others but in our view fundamentally hasn t changed about the investment thesis for why we re in california and why we re where we are in california which is primarily southern which is exclusively southern california and the d c metro market i think is due for a nice recovery post covid neil malkin capital one securities analyst i appreciate the color and then maybe just again on just thinking about the acquisition side i mean obviously putting a lot of capital to work and that s great i m just curious to see if your underwriting standards have changed your unlevered irr targets have changed i understand that your cost of capital is at historic levels but it s just buying at a three cap and you re kind of uncertain about what the terminal or exit cap rate would be and so just when you re having those internal discussions i mean has anything changed or have you gotten more bullish on your like sort of year one through three rent growth assumptions that make you comfortable going in at a low to mid three cap and yes so if you could just maybe expound upon that and if you d use debt more so to get an even higher positive leverage this year ric campo chairman and chief executive officer well i think the clearly our cost of capital has gone down and we do adjust our current rates based on our cost of capital and it s just a simple model right it s equity your equity cost plus your debt cost and the weighted average cost of capital and you compare that to your unlevered irr so a couple of points one being the edge cap rate and that s always a very tricky number right which is what do you use and that can be all of the math we generally try to move that up from our initial acquisition number by 25 things like that but that s obviously a crapshoot what our cap rates and price is going to be in seven years right so which is our model period in terms of going in yields though when we underwriting today i mean if you go in and we buy a property today in phoenix for example or only using an example where we actually bought one like in nashville so in our original national underwriting in the two properties we bought last year we had moderate growth and we bought those in may right so we didn t have this big wave that sort of happened and we know it s good markets and we knew that rents were starting to move up but we didn t think we didn t realize they re going to move up as part fast as they did so all of our acquisitions last year are outperforming by a substantial margin of what we thought that we may be doing we put in moderate growth through 2021 and forward and today our underwriting is a little different because it just depends on where the rent role is but we definitely are increasing rents at a faster pace in the first 12 months of the acquisition today and then we start backing off of that in 2023 and we see we probably we have better than average growth in 2022 for obvious reasons better average growth in 2023 and then we start moderating it to long term historical numbers and we use somewhere around 3 3 5 depending on where it is and after that the numbers were the numbers generally still work pretty well even when you re going at these low numbers because a low cap rate is because of the outsized growth in to get in 2022 and 2023 so we re comfortable that we re making good spreads over our long term weighted average cost of capital and not underwriting so much that we have to have prices go up or cash flows go up dramatically to make those numbers work neil malkin capital one securities analyst ok great thank you guys and nice quarter ric campo chairman and chief executive officer thanks operator our next question comes from alexander goldfarb with piper sandler please go ahead brad heffern rbc capital markets analyst hey good morning down there so a few questions here first looking at this year and the rent growth how much of the rent growth are you getting this year from the burn off of free rent from last year i m guessing probably very few of your markets really had material free rent but maybe d c or southern cal just sort of curious how much of this year s rent growth is coming from just the expiration of free rent in last year s numbers ric campo chairman and chief executive officer so we don t offer concessions and so that s not a factor for us brad heffern rbc capital markets analyst ok ok so then i think it was to handheld s question or nick s question the 4 to 5 market rent growth that you re expecting that s on top of the mark to market so basically it s all face value on face value rent ric campo chairman and chief executive officer correct brad heffern rbc capital markets analyst ok cool second question is on markets you guys just entered nashville but two other markets that would seem to jump out and be natural would be salt lake and san antonio so as you guys look on recycling capital from houston and from d c how what s the appetite for entering additional new markets ric campo chairman and chief executive officer well we clearly like the markets we re in otherwise we d be there i think today entering a new market when we entered nashville we did in a pretty big way and we did it early on a relative basis the big run up in pricing a run up in rents and that was good those markets are interesting markets long term san antonio has always been kind of an unusual market we were close to it in texas we see it and we generally have kind of not done to san antonio because of the depth of the employment market there at t moved there at headquarters they have a couple of really good things going on but we just kind of stayed out of san antonio because we didn t like the patient the job market there on an ongoing basis hultlake we ve looked out we looked at other markets but smaller markets like voice and charleston and we just think that our markets today are we ve got enough to say grace over and we have enough under representative markets where we don t really need to get into other markets that being said we did enter nashville and there s clearly we follow these markets and try to decide whether we re going to allocate capital there but we have enough places to allocate capital without going to new markets right now brad heffern rbc capital markets analyst ok thank you operator our next question comes from john kim with bmo capital markets please go ahead john kim bmo capital markets analyst good morning i wanted to follow up on your update of loss to lease which alex mentioned is 10 to 11 now versus 16 just a few months ago but it s only 20 to 25 of your leases rolled in the fourth quarter and all of those went directly to market which i think are pretty aggressive assumptions shouldn t that figure be at least 12 maybe as high as 12 8 versus the 10 to 11 alex jessett chief financial officer yes and that s why i was trying to make a differentiation between if you think about the dynamic pricing right so our pricing is changing every single day and if you take a sort of a snapshot at the end of the quarter right and you say this is our asking price as compared to our effective rents and you re going to come up with a different number what i was telling you is that if you actually look at the leases that we signed during the month of december and you compare those to the effective rents that s where you re going to come up with sort of this 10 to 11 level so it s two different ways of looking at it if you just look at it based upon the pure ask rents yes there s going to be about a 13 number right but as we know with dynamic pricing there is a typical or there is a tendency whereas pricing is sort of ticking along and then it will drop and then we sign a good amount of our leases at that little drop and then it ll go back up to look at loss to lease i think that the sort of 10 to 11 is probably a better way to look at it in an environment like this in a typical environment where you re sort of talking about a 3 to 4 loss of lease is not as dramatic but clearly when we re here with unprecedented new lease and renewal increases i think it s important that you look at it both ways john kim bmo capital markets analyst ok i get that but at the same time the market rents for your markets probably didn t see that much seasonality i m guessing so i would have thought that would have been a further support from that number being higher alex jessett chief financial officer we certainly did see some seasonality and you can see that if you look at the effective versus the sign so we did see some seasonality particularly in the month of december but yes so that s the math and that s how our numbers are working out ric campo chairman and chief executive officer the seasonality we had this year was interesting because usually you re dropping rents pretty dramatically from the third second quarter third quarter or what happened here is we had a slight decrease in the slight negative second derivative but still a very robust number that you if you go back probably years you wouldn t see the number they the amount of rental increases that we re getting in that fourth quarter and just wouldn t see it like that because the seasonality this year was where it was like a really slow and not dramatic at all in any major market which is usually is usually not the case what s happened is you just had more people coming into the market and more demand in the market which kept occupancy is high and where we didn t have to drop rents or lower renewals during this period dramatically to keep market share and keep occupancy up and that s just the equation where you just have a whole lot more demand for multifamily than you have supply and it just it created a very very very light seasonality but generally not like we normally have john kim bmo capital markets analyst right ok and rick you mentioned what development expectations are in irrs on development starts you had one development at 85 stabilized yields coming in this period what should we be modeling for the existing pipeline just given how much rents have come up in the last 12 months ric campo chairman and chief executive officer well the existing pipeline without remodeling it was sort of in the mid fives but it s probably going to be better than that it s just one of those things where we haven t really remodeled all of our pipeline development deals at this point with new rents but also we haven t remodeled them with new cost either so we ll do i think the development yields will be higher than we would have all projected but it s hard to tell right now and especially when you re talking about initial occupancies and we re looking at a pipeline report right now and our initial occupancies on our pipeline are in the second quarter first quarter through the third quarter of two so for us to kind of try to model that today and we re just not going to do that yet so the bottom line is that the it looks like this development pipeline will be a pretty robust and good pipeline john kim bmo capital markets analyst and was that the pipeline of communities that we haven t started if you think about the ones that we have started we re looking at yields north of 6 there on average so that eight quarters that was truly a one off or could there be others north of 7 alex jessett chief financial officer we believe we have ric campo chairman and chief executive officer that hit over 7 in phoenix but most of them are in the sixes mid sixes to high fives some of the ones for example that were when you think about real urban properties or california properties those were in the those generally tend to be in the when we underwrote them originally in the low fives five ish and definitely we re going to be better than that on those but getting the outliers like the ag and the seven hard to do that in this environment but given where cap rates are if you think about you re producing at 6 or 6 5 and you have a three and a quarter cap rate i mean you talked about some creation of value there it s pretty amazing the development margins are probably at the highest level i ve ever seen him and i said that probably in 2010 and 11 but these are higher today is cap rate is compressed so much john kim bmo capital markets analyst thank you operator our next question comes from austin wurschmidt with keybanc please go ahead austin wurschmidt keybanc capital markets analyst hey guys thank you for the time here just curious what the rates are on your renewal leases that are going out into february and march alex jessett chief financial officer mid 14s austin wurschmidt keybanc capital markets analyst mid 14s great thank you and then when you you talked about some of the technological advancements and the savings that you re getting in your operating expenses can you give us a sense what the total amount or breakdown of that is that you have left to capture over the next few years alex jessett chief financial officer yes i would tell you that we re really on the forefront of this and ultimately we expect the efficiencies to continue through 2022 and really take hold in 2023 and beyond it s obviously the trend that we re all moving toward is self guided tours and as i said when we rolled out our smart access solution which is what you must have in order to effectively do self guided tours i think i think that s going to be a big driver as we go forward especially if we can start adding wayfinding which is going to be the sort of the next thing that we re all working toward and then i think our virtual leasing agent which we re in the process of building out right now i think is going to create some real significant efficiencies as we go forward so really excited about where we are today but even more excited about where we re going to be as i said the latter part of 2022 into 2023 and beyond austin wurschmidt keybanc capital markets analyst could you quantify how big that savings potential is or noi creation however you guys are looking at it to give us a sense of how that could play out in the years to come alex jessett chief financial officer stay tuned and we will continue to as we flesh this out give you guys better information around the actual dollar amount but i will tell you i think we re all very well aware that we are operating in a very inflationary time frame right now and we re coming out with expense growth of 3 so you can start to see that we re already capturing quite a bit austin wurschmidt keybanc capital markets analyst all right got it thanks alex ric campo chairman and chief executive officer we ll give more clarity on that in the next quarter call operator our next question comes from joshua dennerlein with bank of america please go ahead joshua dennerlein bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah hey guys i guess i mean could you walk us through the assumptions that get us to the low end of your guidance i guess i was particularly focused on kind of the rate assumptions you re assuming to get there alex jessett chief financial officer yes here s what i would tell you is probably a little bit different if i think about the factors that could cause us to be below the midpoint one of the big ones is bad debt and is wrap right we talked about that we had 12 million or 12 5 million in 2021 and then we re anticipating about half of that in 2022 obviously that s a very variable item right and that s something that we re very focused on the other thing i ll tell you is that we took our occupancy down to 96 5 from 96 9 in 2021 and so we ll watch that very closely and then really the third factor is is how does the third and fourth quarter shake out i mean there are certainly obviously we feel very very very good about our business but there are things out there that we re all watching which are more on the macro side and we ll have to see how that affects the third and fourth quarters ric campo chairman and chief executive officer i would add one to that which is we still do have the regulatory impediments in california and then d c proper and a little bit in suburban d c markets where we ve made some real a reasonable estimates of when things return to normal and by that that means can you evict people who haven t paid rent for two and a half years can you are there rental controls in place or renewal caps in place and we do believe that we re heading toward improvements and some of these things that are going to be taken off the table as far as impediments to running our business but it doesn t take what does it take in today s environment for policymakers who have been kind of behind the curve on adapting to the pandemic is an endemic versus you get the first hint of the new variant and it just seems like all bets are off and they retreat to the lowest common denominator of start talking about lockdowns again so i would just add that to alex s list of kind of what s out there that could be different and create headwinds for where we are in our portfolio joshua dennerlein bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it one follow up to that on the occupancy that moderation you re factoring in what s driving that that just conservatism and what you kind of normally see when occupancy is this high or is there something more specific that you re seeing ric campo chairman and chief executive officer well we don t normally see occupancy in this eye so i ll point that out in the first we re on record levels of occupancy and obviously that s one of the things that we re watching closely and we are looking at our yield management software to make sure that that as occupancy gets to these type of levels that we are pushing rents and the natural effect of that is that you would expect to see occupancy sort of curtail a little bit keith oden executive vice chairman and president we ve been doing this for and 96 5 doesn t feel conservative to me ric campo chairman and chief executive officer it s an interesting thing because when you think about the demand it has come people came out of the woodwork right and i think what they did is when you think about this is that pandemic there were like 1 million millennials that we re missing from the market a lot of those folks are still living at home or there are room make scenarios and form households but then if you think about what happened then with pandemics so everybody caught it up you have more people that were potted up during the pandemic and then once it started releasing those folks had jobs number one number two they probably have got razors because of the issues that are facing employers today and they got checks from the government that matches stimulus checks so when you think about it you had by the end of last year i think there were 2 7 trillion of excess savings now we have about 2 trillion of excess savings so if you were potted up and you have weariness from covid and being around the people that ve been around for so long you go out and form a household and run an apartment because you ve got plenty of money in your pocket you ve got a job and life is good and all of a sudden this massive demand came out as a result of opening up and especially in our markets now you didn t have that happen in california or new york as fast as it did in texas and florida but i think it just had a lot of people who didn t have funds precoded but have them now because of the late tightness of the labor force and the massive government stimulus joshua dennerlein bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thank you ric campo chairman and chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from john pawlowski with green street please go ahead john pawlowski green street advisors analyst hey thanks for keeping the call going keith can you give me a few details on how the team sets the boundaries of the bands for the letter grades and the outlook because there s pretty big disparities between job and completion ratio if you take a look at atlanta nine jobs per unit deliver you take a look at austin sub three through the same grade and the same outlook so any additional commentary would be great keith oden executive vice chairman and president yes the primary driver john is first of all we re only looking at one year out we re looking for the forecast year and if i were given three year letter grades they would probably move around somewhat but the primary driver is just looking at revenue growth that s in our forecast model and so if you have to grade on a curve which don t do and i didn t do it as a 22 year old graduate assistant teaching cost accounting at the university of texas so i m not going to change now i don t grab the curve and when the lowest revenue growth in your entire portfolio for the year forecast is dc for a change which in any year in any given year you would say that s clearly an a because it s a plus at worse but certainly and then you go up from there to houston at 6 5 and while it sort of tails in comparison to our portfoliowide average again 6 5 for houston that s a solid a in my book and always will be so it s not you re right the disparity on the there s quite a bit of disparity on the ratio for the year but honestly that tends to not that ratio tends to not swing things around in the forecast period because all that stuff gets delivered over 12 months and there s submarket where is it being built and all those things and our bottom up budget process assumes that we know exactly what s going to be delivered in our submarkets we take that into consideration as we do our revenue growth forecast so i still look at them and say every student in this class is an a student this year john pawlowski green street advisors analyst ok that helps one final one for me do you see around 4 revenue growth could you give us a sense of what it would have been had to regulation curves being gone on january 1 i m just trying to understand the kind of structural earnings power of d c right now keith oden executive vice chairman and president so the if you look at i m going to use the forward looking construct as a model kind of what the past year was and in the past year we think in d c our overall it affected our overall results portfoliowide of about 40 basis points i mean it s not a huge thing and going forward we do expect that we will see some relief in 2022 in d c proper and probably in the suburban markets as well we ve kind of got that our thinking process is maybe somewhere around midyear you get the beginnings of a return to normal but that s again like i said that s crystal balling to a certain extent and there s always the possibility that you get some new stealth variant that people get freaked out about and retreat to their the old habits but yes it s not a huge deal in our portfolio it wasn t last year and wouldn t be in a reasonable scenario in 2022 john pawlowski green street advisors analyst ok thank you for your time keith oden executive vice chairman and president yep operator our next question comes from chandni luthra with goldman sachs please go ahead chandni luthra goldman sachs analyst hi good afternoon and thank you for keeping this call going so most of my questions have been answered but your peer yesterday talked about seeing or expecting to see more opportunities for acquiring stabilized properties potentially later in this year what are your thoughts around that are you seeing similar situations developing and how will you approach will you be aggressive if the opportunity presents just trying to gauge how would you approach that ric campo chairman and chief executive officer sure well i don t think that based on what we re seeing through the at least year progresses the way we think it will i don t think there ll be i think you re going to have a competitive acquisition market i don t think that s going to change i guess it sort of depends on what the fed does right if fed gets ahead of itself and all of a sudden people are starting to forecast an economic slowdown because they are moving too fast and people worry about recession and rates go up really fast and you start worrying about that underlying economic activity maybe you ll have some softness in acquisitions but right now if they moderate interest rates and interest rates start going up i don t there s still a wall of capital and there s still great supply and demand dynamics and when you think about pricing of real estate or any sort about it it s really about liquidity and there s massive liquidity still in the market and the fed is not just riding the liquidity day one and then the second biggest issue is supply and demand when you think about pricing and so liquidity is not going away and supply and demand is great and so then you start thinking about inflation issues and then ultimately interest rates and so i think i don t see an opportunity for rising cap rates or better pricing for multifamily assets this year we will get our fair share and there s a 300 billion of transactions we can eke out a few in our little corner of the world so i think that we ll still be able to buy properties but i think it s going to be a blood test for sure chandni luthra goldman sachs analyst understood and migration has sort of been a tremendous tailwind for the sunbelt obviously through 2020 and then 2021 was perhaps just as robust as we think about 2022 do you see any signs of reversal yet i mean i understand that two years is a long time in line and habit and things become permanent from temporary but any signs that as we are in the endemic stages of this virus perhaps those who moved from the coastal regions are now maybe thinking about moving back ric campo chairman and chief executive officer it s interesting if you look at from 2017 to 2020 florida the two largest markets that had in migration domestically were florida and texas and on the florida had 100 000 more people go to florida versus the average for 17 through 20 same thing in texas we had a little less 75 000 people came in from domestic migration and the two states lost the most were in new york and california so this out migration of those high cost highly regulated markets has been going on for keith mentioned earlier and what happened during the pandemic is people moved because the other markets were open right i mean you could go to a restaurant in texas or in florida and and so that when you think about that part of the equation i don t think you re going to have most economists don t think you re going to have ok we re going to run back to california or new york because we move because they re down buying houses and reach and apartments and they don t really need to be in a specific place to their job yet because of the office situation so i think we probably don t have the big peak or the big spike if we are out of the but it just will continue in its normal pattern which is people want to be in a place with less regulation and lower housing prices and good weather and that s what s been driving the sunbelt for the last 20 years and clearly the i agree with keith when he made the comment that california and new york are not going away i mean there s still big large economies and people love to live there and they ll still live there but at the margins you re going to have the cost forces people out the businesses move and so that s going to i think that s going to keep happening but that doesn t mean that they re not going to do well long term because they have plenty of other in migration from immigrants and from and just natural birth that actually losing population generally alex jessett chief financial officer in our portfolio in the fourth quarter of 21 20 4 of all of our new leases in our sunbelt were from people outside of the sunbelt and that is a 430 basis point increase year over year so to rick s point we re clearly seeing it in our portfolio and we re seeing it continuing to accelerate chandni luthra goldman sachs analyst that s remarkable thank you for that color operator our next question comes from anthony powell with barclays please go ahead anthony powell barclays analyst hi good afternoon a question on i guess housing affordability in your markets how do you see the rise in rates impacting the rent versus buying i guess calculation in your markets and we re seeing a lot of capital flow into rent to own i guess start ups and schemes in a lot of your markets how do you expect that development to maybe impact that decision over the long run ric campo chairman and chief executive officer affordability still remains really good in our portfolio they re just even with rents going up as much as they are you have to look at it on a relative basis if you average it over a three year period since we didn t raise rents and rental went up four percent ish in 2021 for the whole year you re talking about a 4 5 5 rental increase over a three year period with these big rent increases right so it s not like people are going up from that is just higher and higher and higher and they re having problems paying plus wages have gone up so our markets still are very affordable when you look at actual rents relative to incomes the other piece is the piece of the equation on single family rentals so single family rentals are i think it s a really interesting market and clearly the public companies have proven that that single family rental is a real thing and they figured out how to run it which is really good you think about if somebody goes when someone moves to a single family rental the average square footage is 2 000 square feet compared to a 950 square foot average apartment that camden has they tend to be more suburban rather than urban they tend to be so most people when you think about buying a house or leasing a house they re doing it for not capital money reasons they re doing it for social reasons they need more space they have kids or they have they just need more space and so with that said we ve never had a when you say we in the houston suburb than it is in the recore which it is i mean if you are leasing in downtown houston or midtown you can go out 30 miles out of downtown and buy a house and have an occupancy cost that s lower than your rent substantially and but people don t do that because they want to be in the urban core and they re not married they have average don t have kids and so you have it s really not because i can go rent a house or buy a house that s not the and the money side of it whether it s affordable or not is really not a drive for people to go do that what drives in social position they re older than can new north space that kind of thing so that really has occurred our market obviously because we re we still have more demand than we have supply and our occupancies 90 in houston here 96 and to change yet you can go out and buy a house in the summer for a lot less than you can pay for rent merger anthony powell barclays analyst got it so it sounds like you re not looking to get into the adjacent space sfr yourself over time you re pretty content with a focus on multifamily is that fair ric campo chairman and chief executive officer well i think it s an interesting space and we ve looked at it a lot and it is to me there s it s just another niche right and the question of whether we would get into a big we tested things like for example we tested independent living and we decided once we did a couple of independent living deals that the cycle in the market was very different than our normal than just a market rate apartment project so we decided that we wouldn t expand that and we re going to dabble in single family hilton and see how we like it we think it s an interesting model because it s really just another segment is as long as it we can operate efficiently the way we operate our apartments then it might be a nice growth area over some period of time anthony powell barclays analyst got it great thank you ric campo chairman and chief executive officer sure i think if there aren t any more questions in the queue i think we are that was the last one great well we appreciate your time and we ll see some of you in south florida and so take care and we ll talk to you next time thanks keith oden executive vice chairman and president take care bye bye alex jessett chief financial officer bye ric campo chairman and chief executive officer bye operator

let s start by talking about wealth the rich have in fact gotten considerably richer over the past two years so actually have most americans but the gains have been especially big at the top underlying these gains have been rising asset prices faster growth at the top probably reflects especially large gains in the stock market stocks are held disproportionately by the wealthy while much middle class wealth is in housing but here s the thing about asset prices while they re driven in part by the income people receive from the assets they own dividends rent and so on they re also affected by the returns investors expect on alternatives as i tried to explain in a newsletter a few months ago a lot of the rise in asset prices actually reflects bad news a decline in the expected rate of return on new investments and if say the value of your stocks has gone up because of low interest rates but the dividends you receive have stagnated or gone down have you really come out ahead it s not that easy of a question to answer advertisement so what has been happening to the income of the very wealthy it s up but not nearly as much as their wealth and in fact their gains have lagged behind those of the bottom half of the population why have lower income americans seen relatively large income gains from a low base we re still an incredibly unequal society part of the answer is government aid during the pandemic the spikes in income when stimulus checks went out and from other programs like the expanded child tax credit which i still hope can be brought back made a big difference but that s not the whole story lately we ve been experiencing a tight labour market which has led to rising wages with wages increasing much faster for lower paid workers yes inflation has eroded these gains in real terms although gains for workers at the bottom appear to have outpaced price increases the point for now however is that a tight labour market seems to be reducing pay inequality advertisement so the simple story that the pandemic has been great for the wealthy and bad for the working class doesn t hold up there are of course other ways in which the pandemic has had a hugely unequal impact the past two years have been very different for those americans mostly highly educated and well paid who could work from home than for those who couldn t but that s another story is there a policy moral in all this it s pretty much a given that the federal reserve will be raising interest rates in the months ahead in an effort to cool inflation and it will be right to do so some people will however also be cheering on interest hikes because they tend to reduce stock prices which makes the wealthy less wealthy and this they imagine reduces economic inequality well that s a bad take confusing wealth and income inequality and if you care about the incomes of working class americans you should want the fed to be cautious about rate hikes lest they hurt the job market full employment it turns out is a very good thing for less well paid workers and we don t want to endanger that good thing merely because we d like to reduce the paper wealth of billionaires

to deploying capital by enhancing returns to shareholders reducing financial leverage and by investing in the growth of our businesses we currently plan to return a total of 11 billion of capital to shareholders between 2021 and the end of 2023 this includes 4 3 billion returned during 2021 through share repurchases and dividends as part of this plan the board has authorized 1 5 billion of share repurchases and a 4 increase in our quarterly dividend beginning in the first quarter this represents our 14th consecutive annual dividend increase we also reduced debt by 1 3 billion in 2021 in addition to the acquisitions i previously mentioned we also made investments in our businesses to drive long term growth and to meet the evolving needs of our customers in pgim for example we have significantly strengthened our suite of environmental social and governance bond funds to better serve sustainability focused investors meanwhile in our insurance businesses we market sensitive and have higher growth potential such as our flexguard and variable life products with a focus on improved customer experience and driving greater operational efficiency one example as i mentioned earlier is our use of artificial intelligence we use ai to quickly and accurately assess risk in our life insurance businesses and to expedite the application and underwriting process the application of innovative technology generated significant efficiencies for our global businesses during 2021 while delivering a dramatically better experience for our customers we will continue to expand the use of ai and other emerging technologies across the firm our capital deployment strategy is supported by a rock solid balance sheet which includes 3 6 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the fourth quarter and a capital position that continues to support our aa financial strength rating turning to slide 6 our ongoing efforts to transform the company in 2021 go hand in hand with prudential s long standing commitment to sustainability this commitment is reflected in several significant enhancements to our environmental social and governance framework last year we committed to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 across our primary global home office operations with an interim goal of becoming carbon neutral in these facilities by 2040 we are also reviewing our general account investment holdings and have restricted new direct investments in companies that derive 25 or more of their revenues from thermal coal on the social front the prudential foundation surpassed 1 billion in grants to partners primarily focused on eliminating barriers to financial and social mobility around the world this achievement follows another milestone that we reached in 2020 when our impact investment portfolio exceeded 1 billion we also continue to advance our nine commitments to racial equity through investments in funding for organizations committed to diversity equity and inclusion and through internal measures including diversity training and our commitment to equitable compensation for our employees our governance actions reflected a shared commitment to diversity and inclusion beginning at the top with over 80 of our independent board directors being diverse it also includes the steps we are taking to improve diverse representation throughout prudential and to provide greater transparency around the composition of our u s workforce in 2021 we enhanced our diversity disclosures by publishing eeo 1 data and the results of our pay equity analysis for our u s employees we also expanded our policy of tying compensation plans for senior executives to the achievement of workforce diversity goals as i noted earlier we believe our sustainability commitments and transformation to become a higher growth less market sensitive and more nimble business are closely connected together they help us fulfill our purpose of making lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world by expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security for customers and clients around the globe before turning it over to rob i d like to thank all of our employees for their unwavering dedication to the customers and communities we serve particularly in light of the continued challenges created by the pandemic i am proud of the progress we made and the momentum we built in 2021 and look forward to making an even more meaningful difference in the lives of all our stakeholders in 2022 and beyond thank you for your time this morning and with that i ll turn it over to rob rob falzon vice chairman thanks charlie i ll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our pgim u s and international businesses i ll begin on slide 7 with our financial results for 2021 pre tax adjusted operating income was 7 3 billion or 14 58 a share on an after tax basis results for the year included a benefit from the outperformance of variable investment income that exceeded target returns by about 1 6 billion reflecting market performance strategy and manager selection in the fourth quarter pre tax adjusted operating income was 1 6 billion or 3 18 a share on an after tax basis while gaap net income was 3 13 per share of note our gaap net income includes realized investment gains and favorable market experience updates that were offset by a goodwill impairment that resulted in a charge of 837 million net of tax this charge reflects two main drivers of a reduction in the estimated fair value of assurance first we acquired capabilities to increase access to more customers and we have experienced good revenue growth however this growth has been slower than expected and we are now assuming it will take longer to monetize into earnings and cash flow and second we have seen a significant decline in publicly traded peer valuations which is a key input in our assessment of fair value turning to the operating results of our businesses pgim our global asset manager had record asset management fees driven by record account values of over 1 5 trillion relative to the year ago quarter earnings reflected the elevated level of other related revenues last year as well as higher expenses supporting business growth in the current period results of our u s businesses increased 13 from the year ago quarter and reflected higher net investment spread including a greater benefit from variable investment income higher fee income primarily driven by equity market appreciation partially offset by higher expenses driven by a legal reserve and less favorable underwriting experience due to covid 19 related mortality earnings in our international businesses increased 5 reflecting continued business growth lower expenses and higher net investment spread turning to slide 8 pgim continues to demonstrate the strength of its diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income alternatives real estate and equities as a top 10 global investment manager pgim s investment performance remains attractive with more than 95 of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last three five and 10 year periods this performance has contributed to third party net flows of 11 billion for the year with positive flows across u s and non u s based clients in both public and private strategies as the investment engine of prudential success and growth of pgim and of our u s and international insurance businesses are mutually enhancing pgim s asset origination capabilities investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital provide a competitive advantage by helping our businesses to bring enhanced solutions innovation and more value to our customers and our businesses in turn provide a source of growth for pgim through affiliated flows and unique access to insurance liabilities that complement its successful third party track record of growth pgim s sixth consecutive quarter of record asset management fees reflect strong business fundamentals and record assets under management we continue to expand our global equity franchise to grow our alternatives and private credit business which has assets in excess of 240 billion across private credit and real estate equity and debt and benefits from our global scale and market leading positions notably pgim s private businesses deployed nearly 50 billion of gross capital up 33 from last year now turning to slide 9 our u s businesses produced diversified earnings from fees net investment spread and underwriting income and also benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses we continue to shift our business mix toward higher growth and less interest rate sensitive products and businesses to transform our capabilities and cost structure and to expand our addressable markets our product pivots have worked well demonstrated by continued strong sales of our buffered annuities which were nearly 6 billion for the year representing 87 of total individual annuity sales these sales reflect customer demand for investment solutions that offer the potential for appreciation from equity markets combined with downside protection we have also exercised discipline through frequent pricing actions and our sales benefit from having a strong and trusted brand and a highly effective distribution team our individual life sales also reflect our earlier product pivot strategy with variable products representing 71 of sales for the year our retirement business has market leading capabilities which drove robust international reinsurance and funded pension risk transfer sales including a 5 billion transaction which was the fourth largest in the history of the market during 2021 and reflected strong persistency and revenue growth in 2021 across all segments with respect to assurance our digitally enabled distribution platform total revenues for the year were up 43 from last year turning to slide 10 our international businesses include our japanese life insurance companies where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses focused on high growth emerging markets we remain encouraged by the resiliency of our unique distribution capabilities which have maintained the stability of our sales and our in force business despite the pandemic in japan we are focused on providing high quality service growing our world class sales force and expanding our geographic coverage and product offerings our needs based approach and mortality protection focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs in emerging markets we are focused on creating a carefully selected portfolio of businesses and regions where customers needs are growing where there are compelling opportunities to build market leading businesses and partnerships and where prudential the prudential enterprise can add value as we look ahead we re well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security we plan to continue to invest in growth businesses and markets to deliver industry leading customer experiences and create the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers and with that i will now hand it over to ken ken tanji chief financial officer thanks rob i ll begin on slide 11 which provides insight into earnings for the first quarter of 2022 relative to our fourth quarter results pre tax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was 1 6 billion and resulted in earnings per share of 3 18 on an after tax basis to get a sense for all our first quarter results might develop we suggest adjustments for the following items first variable investment income outperformed expectations in the fourth quarter by 440 million next we adjust underwriting experience by a net 90 million this adjustment includes a placeholder for covid 19 s claims experience in the first quarter of 195 million assuming 75 000 covid 19 related fatalities in the u s while we have provided this placeholder for covid related claims experience the actual impact will depend on a variety of factors such as infection and fatality rates geographic and demographic mix and the effectiveness of vaccines third we expect seasonal expenses and other items will be lower in the first quarter by 105 million fourth we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by about 10 million reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio and last we expect the first quarter effective tax rate to normalize these items combined get us to a baseline of 2 73 per share for the first quarter i ll note that if you exclude items specific to the first quarter earnings per share would be 3 17 the key takeaway is that the underlying earnings power per share continues to improve and has increased 9 over the last year driven by business growth the benefits of our cost savings program capital management and market appreciation while we have provided these items to consider please note there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter as we look forward we have also included seasonal and other considerations for 2022 in the appendix turning to slide 12 we continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding our capital position continues to support a aa financial strength rating and we have substantial sources of funding our cash and liquid assets were 3 6 billion and within our 3 billion to 5 billion liquidity target range and other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses and contingent capital facilities turning to slide 13 and in summary we are executing on our plans to reposition our businesses and we are on track to achieve our targeted cost savings and with the support of our rock solid balance sheet we are thoughtfully deploying capital now i ll turn it to the operator for your questions questions answers operator thank you our first question today is coming from ryan krueger from kbw your line is now live ryan krueger kbw analyst hi good morning the recent acquisitions that you ve talked about have not utilized a material amount of capital i guess given the amount of capital that you are freeing up from the full service retirement and variable annuity block sales would you consider deals that were a bit larger in size if they re available and they need the opportunities you re looking for charlie lowrey chairman and chief executive officer hey ryan this is charlie i ll answer that question and let me offer a couple of comments first one of the major tenets of our strategy is to be prudent stewards of capital and we re doing that by balancing three factors one is investment in our existing businesses to achieve business growth the second is programmatic m a and the third is returning capital to shareholders but with regards specifically to your question in terms of acquisitions what we can say is they re going to be consistent with our stated strategy of growing pgim and emerging markets by which we can expand and extend our capabilities or our distribution or increase the scale of our existing businesses and to your point we ll be looking at a variety of opportunities in different sizes but what we can also say is that regardless of size we will evaluate the strategic and financial merits of each transaction with the obvious observation that the larger the transaction the more financially compelling that transaction needs to be and as we ve said we will have a programmatic approach right as demonstrated by the three acquisitions we did last year and as we ve actually done for a couple of decades in both areas where you ve seen us make numerous acquisitions in both emerging markets and asset management at various scales ryan krueger kbw analyst thanks and then from a divestiture standpoint are you still looking to do more whether it be in u s individual life or more in variable annuity charlie lowrey chairman and chief executive officer yeah sure ryan it s charlie again i ll take that so first of all we re focused on closing the existing transaction that you referred to and that we ve signed and just as an update we re on track to close both those transactions in the first half of 2022 but we continuously see opportunities within the businesses and the existing blocks that we have to optimize capital and reduce market sensitivity while improving the consistency and the predictability of our financial results with the goal of creating additional value for shareholders but as we ve said in the past we ll continue to be thoughtful as we progress toward the goal of becoming a more nimble less market sensitive and a higher growth company so we ll continue to look for opportunities as they arise and execute accordingly andy sullivan ryan it s andy let great progress on derisking in our annuities business and as we ve talked about before that s a two step process to derisk the legacy step one is all about runoff and we are very much on track we re seeing the expected runoff we saw a 3 8 billion in runoff in the quarter and we saw over 18 billion in runoff in the year so runoff is a significant contributor to derisking as charlie said step two was about doing the derisking transaction and obviously we re very pleased with the palac sale and that represents about 20 of our legacy account values so as charlie said we re going to continue to explore how to further derisk the remaining legacy but we are very focused right now on closing the fortitude re deal in a high quality manner ryan krueger kbw analyst ok operator your next question is coming from elyse greenspan from wells fargo your line is now live elyse greenspan wells fargo securities analyst thanks good morning my first question is on the write down that you guys took within assurance iq can you just give us a sense of the contributions you mentioned lower earnings and cash flows as well as public peer valuations can you give us a sense of the contributions of each when you came up with the goodwill write down that you took in the quarter ken tanji chief financial officer yeah it was elyse it s ken it is a good combination of both so we each quarter we assess the conditions and the fair value of the business we ve been doing that since we ve acquired it we incorporated the recent experience from the medicare annual enrollment and we looked at the updated values for multiples of peers and so that all went in and so it was both a combination of our updating for recent experience as well as the recent multiples in the market for peers elyse greenspan wells fargo securities analyst ok thanks and then maybe a follow up on the capital side so you guys mentioned that the palac and full service retirement transactions are on track for a half year 1 close at some point if m a transactions either don t materialize or don t materialize to a higher magnitude would you guys consider raising the repurchase authorization for 2022 above the 1 5 billion charlie lowrey chairman and chief executive officer so elyse this is charlie i think what we ve said and what we ll continue to say is again we re going to be prudent stewards of capital and to the extent that we can t find opportunities to execute on our strategy we ll consider returning capital and if you saw what we did last year we actually increased the share buybacks by 1 billion in two 500 million segments we ve done it in the past and we will continue to be prudent stewards of capital as we go forward and consider all our opportunities elyse greenspan wells fargo securities analyst ok thank you operator next question is coming from erik bass from autonomous research your line is now live erik bass autonomous research analyst hi thank you can you talk about flow trends at pgim in the new business pipeline heading into 2022 and are you seeing much shift in demand for fixed income given the rise in interest rates andy sullivan eric it s andy i ll take your question as we ve discussed in the past obviously pgim flows will vary quarter to quarter and in the fourth quarter we experienced overall flat flows as you saw our retail outflows were 3 6 billion market volatility really led to client rotation out of our sub advised equities and out of our core and core plus fixed income into shorter duration strategies that was counteracted by very strong inflows on the institutional side and in particular in fixed income as many pension plans allocations rotate in this type of an environment i would say it s important to note if you look at our fixed income business overall across both institutional and retail overall we had positive flows in the quarter despite facing the rising rate environment that is a real testament to the diversification of our distribution and of our portfolio as we ve always said we think it s very important to look at the long term track record when it comes to flows we have done 60 billion in flows over the last five years and we did 11 billion in 2021 specific to your question around the retail side and what we are seeing from a fixed income perspective we have seen 27 billion in retail flows over the last five years and our retail assets under management have doubled in that timeframe really driven by the positive flows that we see the alpha performance that we ve seen and end markets so we ve been very successful there flows are an outcome of having outstanding capabilities exceptional investment performance and great distribution and we feel very strongly we have all of those and we ll be a net winner over time and we ve proven our ability to succeed across all different market conditions erik bass autonomous research analyst thank you and then can you provide some more color on your group results this quarter both for group life and disability andy sullivan sure eric it s andy i ll keep going and i m going to split this out between group life and group disability i ll start on the group life side as we ve all seen delta and now omicron are having a big impact on the country u s deaths were higher than 3q so we saw 126 000 u s deaths in 4q versus 94 000 in 3q as a top three life carrier we have a big broad book of business there s two effects really on the life side that i would note the first very similar to third quarter and that s we have a high concentration of large retail and healthcare employer accounts if you think about it those are employers that have a high number of frontline workers that are out and about and exposed on a daily basis and also many of those workers are in low vaccination geographies the second effect we saw is while in this quarter we did see a slight shift to older age we re still seeing significant increase in incidence rates in the under 55 population and that population tends to have larger dollar amount policies if i shift over to the disability side i d start by saying most of our impact in the quarter in the business was on the life side but we are seeing some impacts on the disability side as well i would frame this it s what we expected to see and what we prepared for for the disability business our ratio benefit ratio was 87 3 that was 320 bps better than a year ago there s really two effects on the std assets side of the business we are seeing increased volumes if you think about the impact that omicron has had as an example and the isolation rules that drives the std in absence but that s a fee based business so the effect we re seeing there really is enhanced expense showing up in the admin ratio we staffed up to make sure that we re there for our customers because that s job 1 on the ltd side much like third quarter we continue to see about a 10 increase in incidents and about a 10 increase in severity but again it s what we expected and it is what we prepared for from a claims management perspective so we re just proud to be able to deliver on our promises to our customers and as the pandemic subsides or as it flows into being more of an endemic we know that our benefit ratios will come back into the normal range erik bass autonomous research analyst thank you appreciate the color operator your next question is coming from andrew kligerman from credit suisse your line is now live andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst hey thanks a lot want to kind of shift back to m a as i think about the prudential over the last two decades the company has done a lot of excellent m as but the assurance iq which with this write down today kind of puts a little bit of a shade on it and charlie you ve talked about programmatic m a being prudent so what i d like to know is how does the assurance iq acquisition how does that i think you think about acquisitions going forward particularly in terms of accretion dilution charlie lowrey chairman and chief executive officer sure it s charlie so let me take that andrew let me take a step back and explain exactly why we did the assurance transaction and the function it plays within our business mix assurance is a young and innovative company that it is completely aligned with our purpose and our strategy it s helping us expand our addressable market which is something we want to do and increase access to more customers especially a customer base that s traditionally been underserved by our industry and that s absolutely aligned with our purpose secondly it s a digitally based platform frankly in which we were underinvested and is a new space for us but one that we wanted very much to be in and third from a strategic perspective it s helping us to reduce market sensitivity by increasing our mix of fee based earnings which is entirely consistent with what we talked about of becoming a more nimble less market sensitive and higher growth company now as we look forward as i mentioned earlier in the call that the acquisitions we ll be making they are going to be in pgim and emerging markets and they ll be focused on will be focused on acquiring more mature businesses again by which we can expand and extend our capabilities or our distribution or our scale over time and this is absolutely in our wheelhouse right this is what we ve been doing for decades in both emerging markets and asset management and have made i won t say hundreds but tens of successful acquisitions over that time period so we feel very good about the strategic merits of the assurance deal and the role it plays within our company andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst and any comment on accretion dilution you might add to that charlie lowrey chairman and chief executive officer sure let me talk about the metrics that we use for a moment so when we think about acquisitions from both we think about them both from a strategic and a financial perspective and strategic perspective we look to add capabilities as i said such as product or distribution or increasing scale in a market or country and from a financial standpoint we look at a variety of metrics when assessing potential acquisitions such as earnings contribution and growth etc now obviously the larger the transaction the more compelling the financial aspects of the transaction has to be but importantly i think our focus is on becoming a higher growth again less margin sensitive and more nimble business and we re going to continue to be extremely thoughtful and disciplined goal of creating value for all our stakeholders andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst ok got it and just real quickly on the expenses it looks great that you re targeting 750 million in savings by 23 and that s i think you ve completed 635 so far per the slides and that s up from an initial 500 do you think beyond that you could do more in expense saves ken tanji chief financial officer andrew it s ken we ve made excellent progress both in terms of not just gaining efficiencies and lowering costs but also building capabilities and as we have done that on an accelerated basis relative to our initial targets we remain certainly focused again both on building capabilities but also gaining efficiency to drive growth going forward we re very much on track to achieve 750 million by 2023 and at this point we ve really institutionalized both capabilities but also a mindset across the company of continuous improvement and we re getting good payback on our initiative costs so we expect to maintain a budget for that and also maintain this discipline going forward right now we re focused on achieving that 750 million by 2023 and that s our main objective andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst thank you operator our next question today is coming from tom gallagher from evercore your line is now live tom gallagher evercore isi analyst good morning just a question on sort of sources and uses of capital how should we think about the 4 5 billion of proceeds plus coming from the deals how much of that do you think is free and clear for you to use how much do you think you might need to use to bolster capital levels if any of it is i ask only because just looking at the holdco levels i guess you re getting closer to the low end of the target now i m wondering if you want to bolster that back up to the top end and also maybe any comments you have at any subsidiary levels that you d like to strengthen capital if at all or you find across the board there and any debt reduction ken tanji chief financial officer yeah hey tom it s ken i ll take that you should think of that 4 billion of or more proceeds coming in from our two transactions as free and clear and readily deployable it will quickly move to the holding company upon the close of the transaction and just in general we ve had a very consistent approach to capital management our businesses are generating free cash flow and also last year we reduced debt so that we thought it was a good time to reduce debt and so we certainly have debt capacity as well and now we also have the 4 billion of proceeds coming in so we feel really good about our capital position and our liquidity and our flexibility and including being well positioned to meet our objective of returning 11 billion to shareholders over the three year period 2021 to 2023 tom gallagher evercore isi analyst got you thanks ken and then my follow up is just i was looking at your supplement and saw that you had operating debt of 5 6 billion that was issued out of the holding company now i guess i ve always typically thought about operating debt getting issued out of the operating subs not out of the holding company because it s kind of higher rated entity but can you talk a little bit about what is that exactly the operating debt that s issued out of the holding company ken tanji chief financial officer yes so we consider operating debt to be funding that fund sort of a specific asset or structure that where the cash flows from that asset or structure will pay off the debt and some examples would be within our pgim business we do co and seed investments that are funded both with capital to support the risk of those investments but also operating debt and we find that efficient to do that from the holding company our pgim business also has an agency mortgage business where we fund loans from time to time again where those loans would support that operating debt so those are two examples but again it s where specific assets or structures will support that debt tom gallagher evercore isi analyst got you thanks operator next question is coming from john barnidge from piper sandler your line is now live john barnidge piper sandler analyst thank you very much my first question is there any way to bifurcate vii between marks and realized gains ken tanji chief financial officer yeah we do look at that and you should think of it as variable investment income is both balanced between cash coming from distributions as well as appreciation in the mark to market usually it s pretty balanced last year a little bit more appreciation than cash just given the move in the market john barnidge piper sandler analyst great and my follow up given the focus on large and jumbo within group how much of the contracts there have seen pricing increases since covid emerged andy sullivan so it s john andy i ll take your question so i don t have the exact percentage at my fingertips but i ll make some high level commentary so as i think you re very aware those contracts renew anywhere from every two years to say every five years and it s very much based on the size of the business with the smaller cases renewing more frequently every two years and large national accounts renewing approximately every five years 80 of our group insurance block of business is national accounts so our renewal cycle they would tend to be more toward the longer end of that spectrum from a pricing perspective now that we re entering the third year of the pandemic and it s probable at least that this will go from pandemic to endemic we very much felt that we needed to take our covid experience from the last 24 months and to put it into our new business and renewal business pricing and we have done that on both the life and disability side so that business will reprice over the next few years john barnidge piper sandler analyst thank you best of luck operator thank you our next question is coming from tracy benguigui from barclays your line is now live tracy benguigui barclays analyst thank you i wanted to circle back to your comment about completing a 5 billion prt deal the fourth largest in market history so i recall andy in a group meeting you mentioned that more competitors have entered the space something like 15 to 20 and probably six or seven of those are consistently trying to do these over 1 billion transaction so i m just wondering if pricing is getting too frothy for these mega deals and have your view of irr change due to competition andy sullivan yes tracy so it s andy thank you for your question so yes we did two transactions in the fourth quarter for 210 million and as you noted that was on the heels of a very successful transaction in 3q which ended up being the largest transaction of the year and we were one of the top writers of the year i guess i d make two comments one the market outlook here for the size of the market remains very strong the funding levels are at the strongest they ve been in 10 years funded status at the end of november was at 98 so we believe that the market is going to stay large and as a pioneer and a leader in the space to your point despite it becoming more competitive there are more competitors we are still seeing that we by being disciplined with underwriting and pricing we could pick our spots and we could pick our spots and given the size of the market we ll win our fair share and we ll be able to continue to grow that business thanks to our brand and our capabilities tracy benguigui barclays analyst that s very helpful and here s like i guess a bigger picture question on wage inflation i guess on one hand that could maybe boost sales but on the other hand there are these talent shortages so i m wondering how that may also impact expenses if you could provide some color rob falzon vice chairman tracy it s rob i ll take a first stab at that and andy if you want to jump in please feel free to do so i guess tracy i d start by bringing it up a level which is the most significant impact of inflation would be on rates and that would be if inflation actually leads to higher rates that s a good thing for the industry and for us included as a part of that with respect to operating costs your specific question one i would note that our ongoing efficiency initiatives will help to mitigate any impact that we would have on increases that come through secondly we are quite comfortable that we have sufficient pricing power in most in our most material products and markets that if the that to the extent there s a residual impact we ll be able to incorporate that into pricing and i d add that while inflation is a macro factor that we re very much looking at how it influences the upcoming year there are a number of other things happening from a macro standpoint beyond inflation and we believe that there will be drivers actually to tailwinds that will get created for our businesses things like higher rates and an improving outlook for covid andy i don t know if you want to add anything more specific on a business level basis andy sullivan maybe the only thing i would add is tracy both our u s insurance and retirement businesses and our pgim business we re big we re broad we re well diversified and there are plenty of spots in our business system where this environment is very good and i just mentioned we are one of the largest real estate investors in the world no 3 by assets under management and obviously an inflationary environment could be very helpful for that business tracy benguigui barclays analyst thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from humphrey lee from dowling and partners your line is now live humphrey lee dowling and partners analyst good morning and thank you for taking my question i just have a question related to group disability in the slide deck you talked about you looking to diversify your group insurance portfolio and looking to expand into group disability and voluntary product can you just talk about how you are planning to do that especially with some of the industry disability results recently seeing some pressure how do you balance growing market share at the same time achieving adequate pricing andy sullivan sure humphrey it s andy so let me first bring it up a level to talk about how do we think about this strategically so as we ve talked about expanding our addressable market and bringing more solutions to more people we continue to believe that the workplace is a great place to grow because of the reach and access that it gives us we ve been executing on a strategy in our group business very consistently over the last five years to grow and in particular to grow in certain spots to grow in middle market so smaller cases to grow our disability block and to grow our voluntary capabilities in block so that we diversify the business further and that makes a lot of sense because a lot of clients in the group space bundle as i said earlier the majority of our business at group insurance is large national account and the majority is life so we feel we have a lot of room to grow and in essence we re going to stay the course on our value prop we ve invested quite significantly in strengthening our overall value prop both our financial wellness capabilities but also our core fundamental capabilities in both life and disability your question about how do you do it in an environment like we re in it s all about discipline right it s about being disciplined in pricing and underwriting and making sure that you especially on the disability side that you maintain strong disability claims expertise and staffing so that you could properly manage the business in an environment where we re seeing increased incidence and severity humphrey lee dowling and partners analyst so my follow up to that is in kind of your strategic review you talked about m a area would be asset management and emerging markets but given your interest now in expanding disability and voluntary benefits in the work site is now group insurance be in other area of potential m a or are you still sticking to kind of asset management in emerging markets charlie lowrey chairman and chief executive officer so humphrey this is charlie for now our concentration is going to be on asset management and emerging markets those are two areas where we think we have we can benefit significantly from the increase in capabilities and scale in the markets in which we already are doing business and so that s going to be our focus in the certainly in the near to medium term got it thank you operator thank you our next question today is coming from suneet kamath from jefferies your line is now live suneet kamath jefferies analyst great thanks charlie a year ago we talked about wanting to increase the earnings contribution from growth businesses from i think the math was 18 to over 30 and i m just wondering is that still on the table because it would seem that that might be difficult without m a but i was just wanting to get your thoughts on whether you can get there organically charlie lowrey chairman and chief executive officer sure that remains our goal in two to three years but as you point out we ll be doing it through a combination of a couple of things one is or three things really one is organic growth so we will be continuing to invest in our businesses one is to get there and the third is really the dispositions of either lower growth or market sensitive businesses and you ve seen us begin to execute on that with the two transactions that we re going to close this year and that s all within again the context of being prudent stewards of capital of investing in our business having programmatic m a and returning capital to shareholders so the short answer of your question is yes that still remains our goal and we ll do it through a combination of factors suneet kamath jefferies analyst and is it fair to say that the m a piece might need to be the biggest of the 3 or do you think it s sort of evenly distributed across the 3 charlie lowrey chairman and chief executive officer it s hard to say whether what the percentages will be it will depend on the opportunities we see both organically and inorganically and the dispositions that we make so it s sort of a multivariable equation if you will but we re looking to balance that equation and do it thoughtfully and prudently suneet kamath jefferies analyst got it makes sense and then i just wanted to ask about international sales if we focus on japan and gibraltar it looks like sales have kind of been flattish just wondering if or is the reason sort of the covid impacts and lack of face to face or do you have to do some more work in terms of the product set that you guys are offering both in gibraltar and the life planner model scott sleyster head of international businesses suneet this is scott let me give a little more context on why the sales are down and then i can talk about what we re doing first of all our bank channel is subject to a higher level of variability and given when there are shifts in the competitive market and given both covid related headwinds but also higher u s dollar interest rates the regional banks have shifted to easier to sell investment products as you know we maintain a strong pricing discipline on deposit products and we ve always concentrated our efforts on selling recurring premium death protection products in that channel there was a second factor during the fourth quarter where we re making some product shelf adjustments in our life consultant channel and we re in the process of updating our u s dollar annuity offerings and we expect the majority of the new products to be in place by the end of the first quarter so i think that explains why we were down the actions that we re taking in the bank channel look we intend to maintain our discipline but we do think the market will evolve over time especially as covid restrictions are relaxed additionally in japan we continue to go front and center with our death protection products but increasingly we ve been adding to our product line with more retirement wealth transfer and health products and we believe given those product line increases coupled with really high quality distribution there in life planners and life consultants we ll be able to counteract this we re actually pretty optimistic about going forward there suneet kamath jefferies analyst ok thanks operator thank you next question is coming from alex scott from goldman sachs your line is now live alex scott goldman sachs analyst yeah i guess for my first one i just had a follow up on international when i think through sales and persistency it seems for at least the near term i think premium growth will kind of continue to be the same or if not a little lower than you ve had and when i look at earnings over the last few years it seems like g a expenses declining has allowed for you guys to defend earnings in a pretty strong way and i just wanted to probe there a little bit and understand what have you been doing to take expenses out and is that something you can continue to do to help earnings in international scott sleyster head of international businesses yes there s a couple of different comments i ll give there first of all just like the u s transformation the international business japan and others have been looking for ways to be more efficient and to use automation and other activities to control costs also in some of our emerging markets we re experiencing faster growth so we re starting to see some scale benefits and then finally we ve done a good job of cost control at the corporate center level that being said i think our opportunities to grow earnings internationally are much more driven by the revenue actions that i alluded to in the product actions and the distribution force actions that are taking place in both lp and lc so we re always going to be disciplined on the expense front but i think it s more of the product and the emerging market growth areas that we think will be more important going forward lastly i would say of course covid has made it more challenging to recruit life planners and life consultants and we do expect that to ease as the pandemic eases or turns into an endemic alex scott goldman sachs analyst got it and then maybe for a follow up there was a long term care insurance underwriter that had a pretty sizable gross charge associated with reimbursement policies and the impacts of inflation and i just wanted to find out from you all what do you feel like your exposure is to that and will that have any impact on your stat filings and the required reserves and is there any material impact to cash flow we should consider ken tanji chief financial officer no the short answer is no we do factor in inflation into our assumptions and we re well positioned for an elevated level of inflation in the near term and we continue to see claims experience consistent with our assumptions and actually a little bit more favorable alex scott goldman sachs analyst thanks operator our next question is coming from mike zaremski from wolfe research your line is now live mike zaremski wolfe research analyst ok great just one question and a follow up on the pension marketplace comments you mentioned that funding levels at their highest levels looks like since the great financial crisis but not above 100 yet just curious is there kind of like a magic number given there s costs associated with it pension funding levels let s say we had a good market in macro market in 22 if they got to like 103 105 or is there a magic number that would kind of cause sales to an uplift andy sullivan mike it s andy i ll take your question and the answer is we don t believe so at 98 plan sponsors are very willing to lean in and to transact i think plan sponsors when they re in this range and they see the volatility in the marketplace it really drives the desire to transact and to derisk their pension plans so there s no magic number having said that we think at these levels we re going to continue to see robust markets mike zaremski wolfe research analyst thank you operator thank you we ve reached end of our question and answer session i d like to turn the floor back over to mr lowrey for any further or closing comments charlie lowrey chairman and chief executive officer

lawmakers to propose improvements on rules governing congressional stock trading insider has learned the work is still in early stages but senate democratic leadership has taken an interest in the issue amid growing bipartisan pressure and they hope to vote on a bill this year if members can agree on what reforms to advance four democratic aides familiar with the deliberations told insider a fifth person familiar with the evolving situation confirmed the deliberations senate majority leader chuck schumer of new york has asked various members to form a working group so the caucus can coalesce around different proposals said an outside source who asked not to be named in order to speak candidly in a call friday democratic leadership staff told legislative directors for democratic senators about their aspirations for bringing a congressional stock trading ban bill to the floor of the us senate democratic aides confirmed advertisement it has been a growing crescendo for the last couple of weeks said one democratic aide who is not authorized to speak on the record the movement in the upper chamber comes after insider released conflicted congress a five month investigation which found that dozens of lawmakers and at least 182 senior congressional staffers had failed to comply with the reporting requirements of the 2012 stop trading on congressional knowledge act or stock act insider also identified numerous conflicts of interest issues as well as discord between lawmakers personal stock trades and their public responsibilities such as members who craft anti tobacco policy but invest in tobacco giants and others who receive plaudits from environmental groups for crafting policy aimed at combating the climate crisis yet invest in fossil fuel companies the senate democratic working group includes members who have been working on this issue for years as well as some newcomers who have recently introduced bills to restrict or ban stock trading including freshmen democratic sens jon ossoff of georgia and mark kelly of arizona advertisement others on the working group include democratic sens jeff merkley of oregon sherrod brown of ohio elizabeth warren of massachusetts and gary peters of michigan warren a well known progressive and 2020 presidential candidate first introduced a sweeping ethics reform bill called the anti corruption and public integrity act in 2018 peters chairs the homeland security and governmental affairs committee which had purview over the 2012 stock act one democratic aide said that democrats are hoping that the group will be able to work in a way that can gain bipartisan support that the party wants to go beyond making it a political issue and try to actually pass a bill advertisement several republicans have supported stricter limits on stock trading they are saying they are for it the person said then the hope is that it could create the wedge that is necessary to get something passed leadership absolutely wants to pass something on this there is a small universe of issues that is bipartisan right now house majority leader steny hoyer a democrat of maryland bill clark cq roll call growing momentum the push also comes after house republicans told several news outlets they plan to run 2022 midterm campaigns with promises to deliver on their own forthcoming proposal to restrict or ban members of congress from trading individual stocks a senate vote on the matter during an election year would help democrats show they re ready to legislate on an issue that has the support of the vast majority of voters according to several recent polls advertisement members of both parties have called for reforms in recent weeks introducing or re introducing several similar bills it s not clear whether a specific senate bill will get a vote one possibility is the ban congressional stock trading act from ossoff and kelly which has slightly more senate cosponsors than democratic sen jeff merkley of oregon s ban conflicted trading act ossoff and kelly s legislation would require all members of congress their spouses and dependent children to place their stock portfolios into a blind trust a financial vehicle that s independently managed by a trustee and approved by ethics committees in the house or senate republican sens josh hawley of missouri and ben sasse of nebraska have also introduced their own bills to ban lawmakers from trading stocks advertisement on the house side speaker nancy pelosi initially declared her opposition to banning members of congress and their spouses from trading stocks telling insider at a december press conference that we are a free market economy and members of congress should be able to participate in that she has since softened her position signaling she won t stop a ban if it s supported by her caucus while directing the house committee on administration to consider higher penalties for stock act violations schumer himself was largely silent on the matter during the first weeks of 2022 dodging a question when insider asked him about a congressional stock trade ban in january he noted that he doesn t personally own stocks other

democratic congressional candidates with white house press secretary jen psaki saying it s up to congress to decide what to do
susan tompor detroit free press their checks to the u s treasury were cashed nearly a year ago but taxpayers say they re now receiving letters from the internal revenue service asking them to immediately file their 2020 federal income tax returns yes copies of their 2020 returns yes the same paper returns they filed last spring please file today the letter begins send your signed return to the address shown above we ll assign the credit to the tax you owe and refund any over payment if you owe no other taxes or obligations some readers who contacted me wondered whether if this could be some sort of scam it wasn t a text message it wasn t an email it was a letter said anne hovell 72 who recently received the irs letter dated jan 24 according to the letter sent to the couple in gibraltar the credit on their account is 1 056 the irs letter warns that there can be more problems ahead if we don t hear from you if you don t file your return or contact us the form letter says you may lose this credit the internal revenue code sets strict time limits for refunding or transferring credits can you finally stop working this year with stock market taking a hit can you still afford to retire in 2022 rough stretch over for now stocks surge to salvage a volatile week on wall street hovell who keeps track of transactions in her checking account knows the money cleared a year ago and she recognized that the amount listed as a credit is what she paid in taxes if a check doesn t clear i follow up she said it did clear hovell who retired as a consultant for a tech company knows that scammers often use email or texts but she wondered if somehow the scammers were getting even more sophisticated and created actual letters to demand copies of tax returns the notion of a scam seemed to make even more sense than thinking that the irs could be sending letters to people who already paid their taxes and filed their returns why would the irs need another return if the federal government cashed their checks she and others wondered doesn t that mean the irs received their return in the mail since the return and check were mailed together why wouldn t the irs already have their tax returns it s a good question and frankly one that could leave you in shock when you re thinking about all the work that goes into filing your tax return in the first place it s very unsettling to get an irs notice when you think you did everything by the book filed the return on time sent the money that was due the less scary part here of course is that the irs wasn t trying to collect money from the couple the letters that readers sent to me are marked notice cp80 and the letters i saw were sent out of kansas city missouri the letter goes on to say if you have already filed this return please send a newly signed copy to the address shown above be sure to attach copies of all schedules and other documents you included with the original return unprocessed returns built up the pandemic has flipped a lot of things in life upside down the tax system has undergone sizable challenges since the two year long pandemic began in early 2020 as of dec 4 2021 the irs said it had a backlog of 6 7 million unprocessed individual returns and 2 6 million unprocessed amended individual returns mark luscombe principal analyst for wolters kluwer tax accounting said the irs is still processing millions of 2020 returns and these notices go out automatically when the irs believes it has not received a return while it might seem on the surface that delays have gone on so long that the irs is unable to find many of the paper returns many experts say that s not likely to be the case at all a glut of automated notices might have been sent to many people who likely should not have received them edward karl vice president of tax policy and advocacy for the american institute of cpas said the cp80 notice has an important place in the process the notice would normally be sent when a tax return for a given year wasn t received even though the filer might have paid a good deal of money already into the system such as through estimated taxes someone might have forgotten to file a return when they have a credit to their account money that could be owed to them in a refund when there s been a troubling event such as a trauma a divorce a death or natural disaster the cp80 notice lets the taxpayer know that when a return hasn t been filed and they can file one in time to claim any refund money owed in most cases an original return claiming a refund must be filed within three years of its due date for the irs to issue a refund the only issue is we re not in normal times karl said the irs like the rest of the country has faced more than its fair share of challenges since the covid 19 pandemic hit to stem outbreaks of the virus the irs had to shut down its centers earlier in the pandemic and irs employees had to be protected but piles of unprocessed returns built up they have such a backlog of processing karl said the pandemic has put them in a deep hole the irs backs off but not soon enough for some the notices sent out in january though seem to be adding to the paperwork on thursday the irs announced that it would suspend notices in situations where we have credited taxpayers for payments but have no record of the tax return being filed the idea behind stopping the notices is to avoid even more confusion the irs noted in its statement in many situations the tax return may be part of our current paper tax inventory and simply hasn t been processed stopping these letters which could have otherwise been sent to thousands of taxpayers will help avoid confusion unfortunately many taxpayers opened their mail already and read the notices before the irs announced that it was halting some of these mailings diana vollmayer of rochester hills said she and her husband already mailed the copy of their 2020 return certified with return receipt we are keeping records of all transactions she said noting that she too was told via her notice of a credit to the couple s account they made estimated tax payments but had filed their 2020 return by paper last spring and paid the rest of the money that they owed when they filed the return she said her friend received one of these letters too but hired a cpa to review her 2020 taxes and handle the situation for her the irs didn t offer a clear detail of what notices it is suspending in its statement as it doesn t even mention cp80 in its statement in an email response to the free press the irs said it has suspended issuing the cp80 and cp080 unfiled tax return credit on account notices the irs said the cp80 is a notice letter that informs a taxpayer that the agency has credited payments and or other credits to their tax account for a certain tax period but the agency hasn t received their tax return the irs has not disclosed how many of the notices went out this month but confirmed that the letters aren t a scam if a taxpayer has received a notice for a 2020 return they should not refile according to luis garcia a spokesperson for the irs in detroit for taxpayers who timely filed their 2019 tax return including extensions and have received a notice they should refile their return garcia said taxpayers also can establish and log into their tax account online at irs gov to view their tax status and any correspondence the irs has sent karl maintains that taxpayers who received a notice now regarding a 2020 return would not have to send a copy of the return if they already filed a 2020 return and know that their payment went through if you didn t file a return obviously you could have money that you might be owed based on the notice and would want to file to claim a refund if you received a notice regarding a 2019 return karl said you would need to send in another signed copy the aicpa is part of a group of stakeholders called the tax professionals united for taxpayer relief coalition which is seeking more relief for taxpayers in light of the pandemic related challenges the coalition s recommendations submitted to the irs include discontinuing automated compliance actions until the irs is prepared to devote the necessary resources for a timely resolution similar recommendation also included in the 2021 national taxpayer advocate report the automated system makes more sense in more normal times when the backlog isn t so great but bulk batches of notices now pose a great risk of alerting many taxpayers to problems that aren t real on their end according to professionals they re going to be wrong in many instances because of the backlog karl said he said the news thursday was welcome but more needed to be done the group also wants to see among other changes the irs providing taxpayers with targeted relief from the underpayment and the late payment penalty for the 2020 and 2021 tax year the irs maintains that making significant operational changes to our systems including stopping certain notices from being printed and mailed may require programming and other operational changes with an outdated technological ecosystem these are changes that cannot be made as efficiently as they should be and that is part of the reason why investing in irs it modernization is so important getting one of these letters of course raises other questions such as why would the irs have cashed the check if the return that was filed wasn t processed karl noted that cashing the check when it s its received is part of the normal process it s not a cause for alarm it s prudent karl said the u s treasury uses this money to cover a wide range of government expenditures you make your check payable to the united states treasury and include a payment voucher called form 1099 v that goes with the paper check the irs notes when we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment the returns are separated from the check and then returns are processed further down the line after the check has been cashed normally we re not thinking about the ins and outs of how the irs handles all that paperwork but again not much has been normal for the past two years contact susan tompor stompor freepress com follow her on twitter tompor

by focusing on a handful of our smell receptor types a team of scientists has demonstrated how some people are more sensitive to some smells than others and they have answered why we all perceive things on the attractive repugnant scale differently and how this has changed as we have evolved historically speaking the new research pushes along the understanding of how in human and primate evolution smell came to be replaced by sight over the last few million years something that hasn t occurred in other species for example dogs for which the sense of smell is still of paramount importance thinking about stinking scientifically the new study was published by lead author dr sijia wang of the chinese academy of sciences and dr joel mainland of the monell chemical senses center in the journal plos genetics with assistance from unilever researchers the new study asked 1 000 han chinese people to rate the intensity and pleasantness of 10 odors on a 100 point scale the experiment revealed two specific odor receptors one linked with our perceptions of body odor and another one associated with musky scents even the smell of your own parents can be offensive satjawat adobe stock the smell of body odor is caused by about 120 chemical scents but mainly galaxolide a synthetic musky and 3m2h that carries the often offensive whiff the research was able to identify the odor receptors involved in the detection of this scent in humans for the very first time also identified were receptors linked to our perception of cis 3 hexen 1 ol that to some smells like freshly cut grass and to androstenone a steroid hormone that is either odorless or smells like urine or sandalwood depending on the genes of the smeller probing the secrets of olfactory evolution having isolated these receptors the scientists analyzed the whole genome of each of the 1000 participants in the trial the study cemented previously identified perception associations including intensity and genetic variants for specific odor receptors for three out of four of the scents including androstenone according to the paper the findings made in china were supported by researchers in the us 364 participants from new york city the majority of whom were caucasian were exposed to six of the odor types at various concentrations dr joel mainland co author of the research from the university of pennsylvania and the monell chemical senses centre said an unusual finding was made many of the participants with two copies of a particular genetic variant for one odor receptor were unable to smell musky galaxolide this means only a single receptor was involved in the scent s detection and generally more than one receptor plays the same role the future of smelling dr mainland said scientists are still surprisingly ignorant about what all the olfactory receptors do and how they interact with each other to encode olfactory percepts the smell of freshly cut wild spring flowers could be called an olfactory stimulation the team also performed analysis of 29 mutations linked to the perception of specific odors this study suggested genetic variants that occurred more recently in the evolutionary history of humans and other primates are found in odor receptors that appear to be less sensitive dr mainland stressed that other receptors or processing mechanisms may have compensated for a reduced sense of smell while it s been suspected for a long time now we know for sure that some people are more sensitive to certain smells than others affecting what each of us perceive as attractive or repulsive this study will not only penetrate deep into the mysteries of human and primate evolution but dr mainland said the new findings could have practical applications in the development of personal hygiene products he suggested that deodorant manufacturers could for example home in on certain hormones and block the perception of bad smells top image woman enjoying the scent of a flower source syda productions adobe stock by ashley cowie
with more than 100 000 russian troops encircling ukraine and europe potentially on the brink of the biggest conflict since the war the only question that matters is one that nobody seems able to answer what is vladimir putin s plan western opinion has coalesced around four broad possibilities an all out russian invasion of the ex soviet republic a more limited incursion in the eastern donbas region an unconventional hybrid attack or a russian military retreat but what if the current situation the build up of troops the alarm in western capitals the confusion the divisions the panic the fear is itself the kremlin s endgame what if this is not the prelude to war but the war itself if so then moscow could be forgiven for concluding that it is a war it is winning although the russian troop movements near ukraine s eastern border did not begin until last spring this moment has been decades in the making stemming as it does from putin s colonial revisionism and in particular his long held grievance about nato s expansion into what he regards as russia s sphere of influence but the timing of his move reflects putin s assessment of the relative strengths of each side in his eyes the us and europe are vulnerable and distracted while russia at least on his watch has never been better positioned to absorb the costs that confrontation could bring botched exit an unpopular joe biden damaged by his botched exit from afghanistan is facing legislative logjam emmanuel macron is running for re election boris johnson is a laughing stock angela merkel is gone and her successor olaf scholz is finding his feet turkey is preoccupied with syria meanwhile the transatlantic relationship is still in recovery mode after the damage it suffered during the trump presidency and the eu and nato are riven by disputes over the rule of law afghanistan brexit and indeed how to deal with a more assertive moscow the russian economy which is about the size of italy s is a minnow compared to that of the us or the european big powers but putin has for years been working to make it sanctions proof by easing its dependence on the dollar reorienting trade and replacing western imports he has made russia better able to withstand the pressure of western sanctions those reinforced economic defences have been matched by investment in military ones an overhaul of strategy equipment and personnel has resulted in a modernised force that bears little comparison to the run down husk of the immediate post soviet years read more approval ratings the timing for putin may also be driven by domestic considerations he faces re election in 2024 and while the systematic dismantling of russian democracy over the past two decades means there is no chance of him losing it cannot have escaped his attention that his approval ratings are a lot lower than they used to be as fiona hill a russia expert at the brookings institution in washington recalled this week the last time putin s approval fell significantly was before the illegal annexation of crimea an act that proved hugely popular in russia and drove his popularity to new heights if putin s aim is to force nato out of eastern europe he clearly will not succeed but that is almost certainly not his short term goal nor can he realistically expect the west to bow to the maximalist demands he has set out including an end to further nato expansion and the removal of us nuclear weapons from europe each of which was duly rejected by washington last week but look at what he has already achieved without firing a single bullet russia has succeeded in extracting a commitment to talks about the future of european security something it has sought since the fall of the soviet union but which the us and europe have always seen as their own business that is far from a guarantee that what russia calls a new european security order will follow but making itself part of the discussion is an important tactical gain for moscow woefully unprepared seen from the kremlin the use of the troop build up near ukraine has succeeded in exposing divisions within nato while showing that europe s failure to diversify its energy supplies and to invest in defence has left it woefully unprepared for major conflict perhaps the most obvious positive effect of its current threats from putin s point of view has been to make russia a force to be reckoned with that has been one of the driving forces of putinism for 20 years invading ukraine would be hugely costly for russia it would suffer heavy battlefield losses its economy would take a heavy hit and the political and strategic consequences would be unpredictable putin has never gambled that big but why wage war when the threat of it can bring you so far

don t miss out on the headlines from music followed categories will be added to my news spotify s ceo has defended the company s multimillion dollar deal with joe rogan revealing the controversial podcaster is vital to the streaming service spotify boss daniel ek addressed the ongoing saga in a 15 minute speech to employees yesterday with the company finding itself stuck between its us100 million flagship talent and a popular backlash over covid 19 misinformation on his shows in 2020 spotify acquired rogan s podcast the joe rogan experience in a landmark deal the show is now spotify s most popular podcast with an estimated 11 million listeners per episode mr ek told employees that while he didn t agree with everything rogan said the company did not have editorial control over his podcast daniel ek ceo of spotify doubled down on the company s defence of joe rogan picture don emmert afp even though jre is an exclusive it is licensed content it is important to note that we do not have creative control over joe rogan s content we don t approve his guests in advance and just like any other creator we get his content when he publishes and then we review it and if it violates our policies we take the appropriate enforcement actions he said according to a transcript of the company town hall published by the verge there are many things that joe rogan says that i strongly disagree with and find very offensive however mr ek noted that if spotify wanted a chance at achieving its bold ambitions then they would have to put up with content that many of us may not be proud to be associated with not anything goes but there will be opinions ideas and beliefs that we disagree with strongly and even makes us angry or sad he said shares in the company were down 17 per cent thursday in new york as tech stocks dropped across the board these shares have been on the slide since november but have been badly hit by news that its subscriber growth is slowing spotify bought the joe rogan experience podcast in a deal reportedly worth more than us100 million picture cindy ord getty images according to the verge a number of employees pushed back on the company s position during a question and answer session they questioned whether spotify s recent actions had done enough to address the concerns of the scientific community and whether the platform s rules were stringent enough spotify recently announced it would be adding a content advisory to any podcast episode that includes a discussion about covid mr ek responded by repeating his earlier comments saying exclusivity does not equal endorsement the real thing here is to try to go for an even broader set of exclusives that represent even more voices he said joe rogan misinformation saga explained rogan has faced ongoing criticisms of his podcast after repeatedly using the platform to cast doubt on the safety and effectiveness of the covid vaccines and air misinformation about the virus the backlash really ramped up after he interviewed us cardiologist peter mccullough and vaccine scientist dr robert malone both guests are known for their controversial covid 19 beliefs and spent hours talking about everything from the efficacy of vaccines to conspiracy theories on how the pandemic really how the pandemic began and other potential treatments for covid being suppressed rogan was widely condemned for airing dangerous misinformation prompting music legend neil young to demand spotify remove rogan s podcast from the platform i am doing this because spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them he said specifically citing rogan s podcast neil young demanded spotify remove his music from the platform over claims the platform was helping to spread vaccine disinformation via joe rogan picture alice chiche and carmen mandato afp young gave spotify an ultimatum either get rid of rogan or he will pull his music from the platform spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform though the company presently has no misinformation policy he said they can have rogan or young not both it took spotify just 48 hours to make its decision confirming it would be removing young s music from the platform since then multiple other artists including joni mitchell graham nash and india arie have joined the boycott calling for their music to be removed from the platform rogan responded to the controversy in a nine minute video on monday with the 54 year old admitting he absolutely gets things wrong he also promised viewers he would endeavour to find a counter guest shortly after controversial topics were discussed on his podcast he insisted his only goal was to interview interesting people on topics of the hour and claimed much of how he was being perceived came from people forming opinions before actually viewing the podcasts in full i wanted to make this view because i think there is a lot of people who have a distorted perception of what i do maybe based on sound bites or headlines of disparaging articles originally published as spotify boss doubles down on defence of joe rogan despite backlash from employees
