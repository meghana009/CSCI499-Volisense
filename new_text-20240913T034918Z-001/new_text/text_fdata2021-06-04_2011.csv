accounting principles in the united states of america gaap idt also disclosed for 3q21 2q21 and 3q20 adjusted ebitda non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per diluted share all of which are non gaap measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companyâ s performance financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap idtâ s measure of adjusted ebitda consists of revenue less direct cost of revenues and selling general and administrative expense another way of calculating adjusted ebitda is to start with income loss from operations add depreciation and amortization severance expense and other operating expense and deduct other operating gains idtâ s measure of non gaap net income starts with net income loss in accordance with gaap and adds severance expense stock based compensation and other operating expense and deducts the release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and other operating gains idtâ s measure of non gaap earnings per diluted share is calculated by dividing non gaap net income by the diluted weighted average shares these additions and subtractions are non cash and or non routine items in the relevant fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 periods management believes that idtâ s adjusted ebitda non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per diluted share are measures which provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses and non routine gains and losses that may not be indicative of idtâ s or the relevant segmentâ s core operating results management uses adjusted ebitda among other measures as a relevant indicator of core operational strengths in its financial and operational decision making in addition management uses adjusted ebitda non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per diluted share to evaluate operating performance in relation to idtâ s competitors disclosure of these financial measures may be useful to investors in evaluating performance and allows for greater transparency to the underlying supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making in addition idt has historically reported similar financial measures and believes such measures are commonly used by readers of financial information in assessing performance therefore the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in financial reporting management refers to adjusted ebitda as well as the gaap measures income loss from operations and net income loss on a segment and or consolidated level to facilitate internal and external comparisons to the segmentsâ and idtâ s historical operating results in making operating decisions for budget and planning purposes and to form the basis upon which management is compensated while depreciation and amortization are considered operating costs under gaap these expenses primarily represent the non cash current period allocation of costs associated with long lived assets acquired or capitalized in prior periods idtâ s adjusted ebitda which is exclusive of depreciation and amortization is a useful indicator of its current performance severance expense is excluded from the calculation of adjusted ebitda non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per diluted share severance expense is reflective of decisions made by management in each period regarding the aspects of idtâ s and its segmentsâ businesses to be focused on in light of changing market realities and other factors while there may be similar charges in other periods the nature and magnitude of these charges can fluctuate markedly and do not reflect the performance of idtâ s core and continuing operations other operating gain expense net which is a component of income loss from operations is excluded from the calculation of adjusted ebitda non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per diluted share other operating gain expense net includes a gain from the sale of idtâ s rights under a class action lawsuit expense for the indemnification of a net2phone cable telephony customer related to patent infringement claims brought against the customer legal fees net of insurance claims related to straight path communications inc â s stockholdersâ putative class action and derivative complaint and expense for other legal matters from time to time idt may have gains or incur costs related to non routine legal and tax matters however these various items generally do not occur each quarter idt believes the gain and losses from these non routine matters are not components of idtâ s or the relevant segmentâ s core operating results the other calculation of adjusted ebitda consists of revenue less direct cost of revenues and selling general and administrative expense as the other excluded items are not reflected in this calculation they are excluded automatically and there is no need to make additional adjustments this calculation results in the same adjusted ebitda amount and its utility and significance is as explained above stock based compensation recognized by idt and other companies may not be comparable because of the variety of types of awards as well as the various valuation methodologies and subjective assumptions that are permitted under gaap stock based compensation is excluded from idtâ s calculation of non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per diluted share because management believes this allows investors to make more meaningful comparisons of the operating results per share of idtâ s core business with the results of other companies however stock based compensation will continue to be a significant expense for idt for the foreseeable future and an important part of employeesâ compensation that impacts their performance in 3q21 due to continued and projected profitability idt was able to release a portion of its valuation allowance that was recorded against its deferred tax assets this income tax benefit is excluded from idtâ s non gaap net income and non gaap eps because it only indirectly related to the current results of idtâ s core operations adjusted ebitda non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per diluted share should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to income loss from operations cash flow from operating activities net income loss basic and diluted earnings per share or other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap in addition idtâ s measurements of adjusted ebitda non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per diluted share may not be comparable to

biden is proposing a 15 minimum tax on corporations as part of a possible compromise to get his infrastructure bill passed president joe biden is trying to break a logjam with republicans on how to pay for infrastructure improvements proposing a 15 minimum tax on corporations and the possibility of revenues from increased irs enforcement as a possible compromise the offer was made wednesday to republican sen shelley moore capito of west virginia as part of the bipartisan negotiations and did not reflect a change in biden s overall vision for funding infrastructure white house press secretary jen psaki said that biden examined all the tax overhauls from his campaign and administration to look for potential common ground with republicans and that imposing a minimum corporate tax seemed like a possible option he looked to see what could be a path forward with his republican colleagues on this specific negotiation psaki told reporters at a thursday briefing this is a component of what he s proposed for a pay for that he s lifting up as a question as to whether they could agree to that biden has proposed increasing the corporate tax rate to 28 from 21 to help fund his plans for roads bridges electric vehicles and broadband internet and that remains one of his preferred approaches but the rate hike is a nonstarter with republicans because it would undo the 2017 tax cuts signed into law by president donald trump by floating an alternative there is no minimum corporate tax now on profits biden was trying to give republicans a way to back infrastructure without violating their own red line of keeping corporate tax rates at their current level the washington post first reported the offer on thursday senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said he spoke with capito after the session and is still hoping to reach a deal with the administration but he prefers the gop approach that is eyeing a scaled down package paid for by tapping unspent covid 19 relief funds rather than taxes let s reach an agreement on infrastructure that s smaller but still significant and fully paid for he said in paducah kentucky the president is essentially staking out the principle that profitable corporations should pay income taxes many companies can avoid taxes or minimize their bills through a series of credits deductions and other ways of structuring their income and expenses the president has insisted that the middle class should not bear the cost of greater infrastructure spending yet a chasm exists in negotiations because republicans say that corporate tax increases will hinder economic growth the idea of imposing a minimum corporate tax is not new for biden who proposed the policy during the presidential campaign last year and that could turn off some republicans the center right tax foundation estimated that a minimum tax would subtract 0 21 from long run u s gross domestic product he s been pushing it since the primaries over a year ago said george callas managing director of government affairs for the law firm steptoe and a former tax counsel to house republicans callas said that the minimum tax would mostly hit firms such as electric utilities and telecoms that make substantial capital investments as well as companies that rely on paying their employees with stock at the same time both democrats and republicans have eyed revenues that could come from stepped up irs enforcement of unpaid taxes house speaker nancy pelosi d calif has suggested it could amount to some 1 trillion but others say the estimate is far lower biden is seeking roughly 1 trillion in infrastructure spending down from an initial pitch of 2 3 trillion republicans so far have countered with only 257 billion in additional spending on infrastructure as part of a 928 billion package the gop s new spending on infrastructure would be a fraction of what the president says is necessary to compete globally and boost economic growth talks over biden s top legislative priority have been moving slowly a daunting undertaking given the massive infrastructure investment and time for a deal is running out the administration has set a monday deadline to see clear direction and signs of progress biden and capito are set to meet again on friday

sir on a recent two hour train journey to london some 30 per cent of people in the carriage were not wearing a mask overwhelmingly they were young people who would not have been vaccinated and would be excellent transmitters of the indian variant no challenge was offered by the train manager despite the law and penalties on mask wearing being clear and advertised at stations this was the same on the return journey it is right that people have a choice on vaccination or indeed mask wearing however the more who refuse the higher the transmission and case rate the greater the chance of vaccine defeating variants these would cause direct and indirect threats to health and derail efforts for people and business to regain normality the law on mask wearing should be enforced health and social care workers should be told no jab no job the cost for us all at this juncture is just too great sir john oldham glossop derbyshire sir people participate experts advise government decides the prime minister should remember this and hold his nerve john moseley monmouth sir would it not be a good idea to vaccinate all university students before they disperse around the country christine howard jones salisbury wiltshire charity done right sir like many of your readers i was horrified to read of the stratospheric scale of charity chiefs salaries i note that the salvation army s chief executive receives 15 000 a year and his officers 12 000 although not a salvationist nor even an anglican i am proud to support financially an organisation that goes to wherever the need is greatest and the latest news makes me prouder still stephen pound london w7 sir your report on charity pay abuses highlights the fact that we all pay for them one person s charitable relief is another s tax hike since the national revenue is reduced by donations and has to be made up through general taxation while tax relief is fully justified to encourage giving it invites the question of why relief should be given on the substantial investment income of large charities all of which are protected by common services such as the police and armed forces should they not contribute to the common weal through a small tax on their huge ungifted untaxed reserves lord vinson con london sw1 sir most of the charity coverage has focused on the feelings of donors volunteers have had few mentions having worked as a volunteer for several charities over the years i know that we put in long unpaid and often unsocial hours doing the actual work as well as fundraising on top of this we have to comply with all the directives issued by head office which entails associated paperwork the employment of paid staff has to be justified we moan about it but seldom quit because we actually believe that what we are doing is important perhaps charities should only employ those who have already shown their dedication by volunteering susan wood braye alderney anne boleyn s time sir miranda kaufmann urges us to watch channel 5 s anne boleyn with the rich history of the era s black figures in mind fair enough but i did wonder how the queen had a pendulum clock in her chamber when they were not invented until 1657 charles penfold ulverston cumbria sex does exist sir your leading article captured a number of strands of opposition to where stonewall has led government departments and other public bodies readers who have not followed the growth of stonewall s influence may be shocked by its consequences this year we saw the office of national statistics defeated in the high court when it attempted to abandon accepted ways to determine one s sex in the census in favour of effectively allowing people to self identify had the ons prevailed we would have had no sound statistical basis for planning services such as those for health where many conditions are related to biological sex there are numerous cases of public organisations misinterpreting equalities legislation and protecting gender identity rather than sex as the law requires people with male bodies including those who have committed sexual offences are being allowed to self identify as women and are being housed in women s prisons the telegraph is right to approve of the government s reported plans to stop stonewall s toxic politics being spread throughout the public sector it must be explained that this is not an illiberal act and is not an attack on lgbt people s legitimate rights many of us who were involved in campaigning against section 28 legislation in the 1980s which was widely seen as an attack on gay people now urge mps to look carefully at what the government is doing and not fall into the trap of thinking that this is a repeat of those times we welcome the sensible approach liz truss has taken to stop the destruction of rights based on sex and same sex tim barnsley london sw16 casting the first stone sir while no one will condone the reported words of the england cricketer ollie robinson they were written nine years ago when he was still a teenager he appears ashamed and embarrassed is there no possibility that someone could change are we all to be judged by our words and actions when we were much younger and more foolish how many of those condemning him today have never committed an indiscretion forgiveness is a quality that occurs only in human beings let s have an end to any witch hunt accept his apology and move on rev alan wright barton upon humber lincolnshire national trust prices sir if accessibility is the aim of the national trust s leadership harry mount features

bale risk sir liam moore letters june 2 correctly points out that boris johnson s wedding party bales were much more likely to have been made of straw rather than hay however hay bales can be equally supportive for heavier posteriors if when baled the density setting on the baler had been adjusted up while hay bales tend to be more comfortable to sit on there is a much greater risk of sitting on a

as compared to placebo hr 0 54 p 0 0164 as previously announced the trial will continue to evaluate os a key secondary endpoint with the results of keynote 564 pembrolizumab is the first immunotherapy to show a clinical benefit in the adjuvant setting in kidney cancer said dr toni k choueiri director of the lank center for genitourinary oncology dana farber cancer institute and professor of medicine at harvard medical school it took several decades to achieve this milestone we hope to build on this important research and provide new treatment options to kidney cancer patients as nearly half of early stage renal cell carcinoma patients experience disease recurrence after surgery we are particularly encouraged to see that keytruda demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the risk of recurrence or death by 32 compared with placebo in this study said dr scot ebbinghaus vice president clinical research merck research laboratories these data highlight the opportunity for keytruda to become a new standard of care for patients with early stage renal cell carcinoma and we look forward to working closely with regulatory authorities to make this treatment option available to patients the late breaking results will be presented in the plenary session of the 2021 american society of clinical oncology asco annual meeting abstract lba5 on sunday june 6 2021 as announced data spanning more than 20 types of cancer will be presented from merck s oncology research program at asco a compendium of presentations and posters of merck led studies will be posted by merck on

1970 for his philosophy of extreme egocentricity and was disbarred for a year in new jersey in 1971 for talking publicly about a case but publicity was part of his strategy fishman said enjoying the public eye became a tool for him fishman said he was one of the first lawyers to go outside the courtroom and talk in front of a bunch of microphones all the news about a case was from the prosecution

going to be important and what was not i thought he had an amazing grasp of what was going to be the most important parts of the case and that turned out to be true one of the most memorable moments of the trial came when bailey aggressively cross examined los angeles police detective mark fuhrman in an attempt to portray him as a racist whose goal was to frame simpson it was classic bailey

opinion president biden s budget deficits threaten to ignite the kind of inflation that followed the vietnam war and fed chairman jerome powell is happy to enable it the president inherited most pieces for a robust economic recovery thanks to 4 trillion in covid 19 relief measures enacted through december the gap between aggregate demand and potential gdp in february was 380 billion only missing were additional assistance for the unemployed that would also modestly boost demand and a green light to take off masks for americans to rev up their mighty economic engine mr biden capitalized on operation warp speed by supporting local public health agencies in distributing vaccines but ignored warnings about overheating the economy the american rescue plan sent state governments small businesses and most anyone else that looked like a prospective democratic voter 1 9 trillion in additional stimulus five times the output gap armed with a buildup in savings from gorging on netflix and banking stimulus checks americans are now spending more than global factories can provide bottlenecks abound on everything from copper to computer chips and potato chips and prices are jumping mr powell keeps telling us inflation expectations in financial markets are not rocketing but that only indicates he s persuaded bond buyers not consumers who are bidding up prices for homes and everyday items suppose mr biden stuck 100 vouchers printed by mr powell for takeout food under the windshield wipers of every car parked at rehoboth beach every week for the next several years do you suppose the price of hamburgers and pizza at the seaside resort would rocket that s exactly what the president would do but on a much grander scale with his 6 trillion 2022 budget mr powell like an overindulgent parent is enabling him by keeping interest rates at depression levels and printing money to purchase about 1 4 trillion in government and mortgage backed securities this year is it any wonder that prices for homes are jumping out of sight and beyond the reach of many first time buyers and especially working class americans minorities and single mothers mr biden is proposing the biggest budget deficits since world war ii even though the u s economy by this summer will have made up all the lost growth imposed by the covid 19 recession we have had two significant bouts with inflation since world war ii the jolt caused by the korean war proved temporary as budget restraint resumed with the end of the conflict the great inflation ignited by the combination of the vietnam war and great society spending during the johnson administration and accelerated by the oil crises of the 1970s during those years fed chairmen arthur burns and william miller made policy that was grounded in overestimates of potential gdp and employment and the output gap and skepticism about the potency of monetary policy to curb inflation gradually inflation rose with some ups and downs and ratcheted to double digits from 1979 to 1981 even with millions of workers still displaced by covid 19 the economy is again bumping up against capacity limits and skilled labor shortages meanwhile changes in what americans buy how they shop and hybrid work patterns have made many jobs in service activities and much commercial real estate in big cities obsolete now mr biden is proposing a federal budget with deficits exceeding 1 3 trillion a year indefinitely a responsible budget would instead more narrowly focus on shoring up infrastructure boosting technology industries that indirectly create demand for frontline service workers and assisting displaced workers to quickly retrain to meet the shortage of workers with digital skills levi strauss is retraining retail employees with an intensive two month program in statistics coding neural networks and other machine learning techniques mr biden needs to leverage such private sector efforts with support and relocation assistance for low income workers displaced by the pandemic however such approaches are not fashionable with a woke administration that wants to reorder american society with a 6 trillion federal budget that significantly exaggerates the social justice and inequality crisis mr powell should stop enabling reckless federal spending by ending rock bottom interest rates and phasing out the monetization of new federal debt with purchases of treasuries and mortgage backed securities but that would put mr powell out of step with his masters at the treasury and national economic council who likely hold the strings on whether mr biden nominates him for a second term we need better economics at the fed but most of all we need more backbone not a lawyer arguing the president s case for big deficits peter morici pmorici1 is an economist and emeritus business professor at the university of maryland and a national columnist
dive brief senate finance committee chair ron wyden d ore launched an investigation into the global tax practices of abbvie asserting that the pharmaceutical company used the 2017 changes in federal taxation and overseas havens to reduce its tax rate from 20 in 2016 to a 9 5 average from 2018 to 2020 the committee probe will focus on how the 2017 law passed with overwhelming republican support allowed abbvie to further abuse tax havens and avoid paying taxes on u s prescription drug sales instead of using the massive tax cuts given to abbvie by the 2017 tax law to reduce drug prices for american families abbvie has instead chosen to provide a 10 billion windfall to investors by substantially increasing the amount of money it spent buying back its own stock wyden said in a june 2 letter to abbvie ceo richard gonzalez dive insight the trump administration s tax changes cut the total tax bill for abbvie and other large u s pharmaceutical companies during the past four years by more than 6 billion according to an analysis by biopharma dive president joe biden supported by democratic lawmakers wants to reverse parts of the 2017 law and increase the tax obligations of pharmaceutical and other companies higher revenue would help fund ambitious federal programs proposed by biden including 2 trillion in infrastructure spending known as the american jobs plan the biden administration is moving across a broad front it has proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28 from 21 and the minimum tax on the foreign profits of u s companies to 21 from 10 5 the administration intends to strengthen enforcement and increase corporate and individual tax revenue by 700 billion over the next decade in part by increasing the budget for the irs by 80 billion during the same period according to a u s treasury department plan treasury secretary janet yellen aims to discourage the use of foreign tax havens by securing a global minimum corporate tax rate of at least 15 yellen has pledged to work with other countries to end the pressures of tax competition and corporate tax base erosion she plans to call for an agreement on a minimum tax rate at a two day summit of the group of seven finance ministers in london beginning tomorrow a minimum rate would ensure the global economy thrives based on a more level playing field in the taxation of multinational corporations and spurs innovation growth and prosperity yellen said in an april 5 speech wyden said abbvie has been able to successfully exploit the incentives to offshore profit included in the 2017 tax law despite the united states market being the source of most of abbvie s revenues and richest price premiums it appears that the company has consistently reported net losses in the united states while reporting substantial foreign profits he added abbvie did not respond to phone and email requests for comment the treasury department citing data from the joint committee on taxation noted in 2018 the effective tax rate on profits of u s multinationals was just 7 8 compared with an average of 8 7 and 18 1 among the european union and the top 10 u s trading partners respectively the u s collects less in corporate taxes as a share of gross domestic product gdp than most other advanced economies in the organization for economic co operation and development according to the treasury since the approval of a tax cut package in december 2017 corporate tax revenues have fallen to 1 of gdp from 2

fans of esg who might have enjoyed the impressive triple digit gains of select strategies last year could be experiencing a bit of a hangover in 2021 if they didn t navigate through another trend value overtaking growth stocks looking at 10 of the best performing environmental social and governance funds last year as tracked by morningstar it would be easy to assume the esg space had suddenly lost its mojo consider for example the 234 gain last year by invesco solar etf tan which is down 23 so far this year other hot funds last year included the firsttrust nasdaq clean entergy etf qcln which gained 184 last year and is down 10 2 this year and the ishares global clean energy etf iclin gained 141 last year only to fall more than 19 this year the s p 500 index by comparison gained 16 3 in 2020 and is up 12 so far this year todd rosenbluth director of mutual fund and etf research at cfra attributes the stunning turnaround for certain esg strategies more to the trend toward value than anything else and adds that it is a reminder that all esg strategies are not created equal in essence the esg funds that topped the charts in 2020 were narrowly focused bets many of which enjoyed a boost from limited exposure to traditional fossil fuels which suffered last year clean energy investments declined in value in recent months as investors rotated toward more value oriented securities and away from long term growth ones on expectations of higher interest rates rosenbluth said while the long term trend toward clean energy remains there s been higher than expected volatility in recent months meanwhile investors who moved out of or avoided the more concentrated esg exposures have enjoyed a less exhilarating but much smoother ride with broader esg exposure for example the ishares msci kld 400 social etf dsi gained a respectable 20 9 last year and is up 13 5 this year which combine to beat the s p 500 by 6 1 percentage points other examples of quieter but still impressive broad esg exposure include flexshares stoxx esg impact etf esgv which gained 20 8 last year and is up 12 5 this year and ishares esg aware msci usa etf esgu which gained 22 5 last year and is up 12 3 this year tom roseen head of research services at refinitiv lipper said some of the more popular asset classes last year have been hit by the rising threat of concerns over inflation and rising interest rates down the road after the strong runup in alternative energy funds which gained 91 61 in 2020 investors took some of their hard won profits off the table as they began to worry about how higher interest rates and supply related inflationary pressures were going to impact the economy and lower returns for renewable energy projects he said meanwhile since the start of the year the average alternative energy fund has lost 3 65 which includes 2020 s leader in this space the previously mentioned invesco solar etf if nothing else the starkly contrasting performance within the esg space is a reminder that diversification usually makes sense esg investors are investing for conscience and to make a commitment and many esg investments have a premium for that privilege said leon labrecque chief growth officer at sequoia financial group if solar was more efficient and economically viable than oil it would outperform oil he added esg investors should acknowledge that they are removing some components of returns from their investments my wife and i have half our donor advised funds in esg and half in regular indexes so we feel good about making money and feel good about our investments as well if defense stocks pay for good things i m ok with that
investing in real estate is a great way to build passive income and improve your assets however real estate investment also requires more start up cash than other forms of investing while you may only need a few dollars to buy stocks or invest in a mutual fund saving up for a down payment can set you back thousands of dollars there are ways for anyone with a little bit of money and a lot of ingenuity to become a real estate investor start with the home you re in you already have at least one home that you live in besides being a place where you live it can be the seed for your growing real estate business you can rent out a portion of your home in a strategy called house hacking use only part of your home while renting out your spare bedroom or spare floor this will allow you to recoup your housing costs and create a seed fund for future investments even if you do not have an extra bedroom some people rent out garages basements and even plots of land for camper parking if the idea of sharing your home with a stranger permanently does not appeal to you then you can try short term rentals such as airbnb rent out a spare bedroom couch or even the whole apartment to people while you re away on vacation flip properties it will cost less money to buy properties that are in worse shape and then fix them than it would be to buy a brand new home there are even tax incentives in place to make it even more worth your while to flip properties the irs has a significant tax exemption that allows you to exclude up to 250 000 or 500 000 if you are filing jointly of the profits from selling your home if you were the primary resident for at least two years this makes a fixer upper even more worth it you can also accumulate properties in need of renovation and then rent them out instead of selling them this increases your income sources renovating houses can seem daunting particularly to people with little experience in this realm however there are plenty of resources and incentives to help you go down this route don t work alone if you know that you cannot come up with enough money for a down payment by yourself you can work with others to begin investing form a partnership or invest in a real estate investment trust you can also break into the business by helping other sellers get your real estate license and become a broker or work as a finder who connects sellers with great deals for a commission it may take longer to save up the funds you need but you will also learn more about the business in the process real estate investing is a great way to make money and should be accessible to everyone you can get involved in several ways even if you don t have vast reserves of cash on hand related images courtesy of depositphotos

career halted when he was disbarred in two states has died a former colleague said thursday he was 87 the death was confirmed thursday by peter horstmann who worked with bailey as an associate in the same law office for seven years in a legal career that lasted more than four decades bailey was seen as arrogant egocentric and contemptuous of authority but he was also acknowledged as bold brilliant meticulous and tireless in the defense of his clients the legal profession is a business with a tremendous collection of egos bailey said an in interview with u s news and world report in september 1981 few people who are not strong egotistically gravitate to it some of bailey s other high profile clients included dr samuel sheppard accused of killing his wife and capt ernest medina charged in connection with the my lai massacre during the vietnam war i have never known a greater intellect than that possessed by f lee bailey said j albert johnson bailey s longtime legal partner and childhood friend bailey an avid pilot best selling author and television show host was a member of the legal dream team that defended simpson the former star nfl running back and actor acquitted on charges that he killed his wife nicole brown simpson and her friend ron goldman in 1995 bailey was the most valuable member of the team simpson said in a 1996 story in the boston globe magazine he was able to simplify everything and identify what the most vital parts of the case were simpson said lee laid down what the case s strategy was what was going to be important and what was not i thought he had an amazing grasp of what was going to be the most important parts of the case and that turned out to be true i lost a great one f lee bailey you will be missed pic twitter com 6s8ji3oqvb o j simpson therealoj32 june 3 2021 one of the most memorable moments of the trial came when bailey aggressively cross examined los angeles police detective mark fuhrman in an attempt to portray him as a racist whose goal was to frame simpson it was classic bailey fuhrman denied using racial epithets but the defense later turned up recordings of fuhrman making racist slurs even though fuhrman remained cool under pressure and some legal experts called the confrontation a draw bailey recalling the exchange months later said that was the day fuhrman dug his own grave bailey earned acquittals for many of his clients but he also lost cases most notably hearst s hearst a publishing heiress was kidnapped by the symbionese liberation army terrorist group on feb 4 1974 and participated in armed robberies with the group at trial bailey claimed she was coerced into participating because she feared for her life she still was convicted hearst called bailey an ineffective counsel who reduced the trial to a mockery a farce and a sham in a declaration she signed with a motion to reduce her sentence hearst accused him of sacrificing her defense in an effort to get a book deal about the case she was released in january 1979 after president jimmy carter commuted her sentence bailey made his name as the attorney for sheppard an ohio osteopath convicted in 1954 of murdering his wife sheppard spent more than a decade behind bars before the u s supreme court ruled in a landmark 1966 decision that massive pervasive prejudicial publicity had violated his rights bailey helped win an acquittal at a second trial bailey also defended albert desalvo the man who claimed responsibility for the boston strangler murders between 1962 and 1964 desalvo confessed to the slayings but was never tried or convicted and later recanted despite doubts thrown on desalvo s claim bailey always maintained that desalvo was the strangler throughout his career bailey antagonized authorities with his sometimes abrasive style and his quest for publicity he was censured by a massachusetts judge in 1970 for his philosophy of extreme egocentricity and was disbarred for a year in new jersey in 1971 for talking publicly about a case bailey was disbarred in florida in 2001 and the next year in massachusetts for the way he handled millions of dollars in stock owned by a convicted drug smuggler in 1994 he spent almost six weeks in federal prison charged with contempt of court in 1996 after refusing to turn over the stock the experience left him embittered he eventually won the right to practice law in maine in 2013 francis lee bailey was born in the boston suburb of waltham the son of a newspaper advertising man and a schoolteacher he enrolled at harvard university in 1950 but left at the end of his sophomore year to train to become a marine pilot he retained a lifelong love of flying and even owned his own aviation company while in the military bailey volunteered for the legal staff at the cherry point marine corps air station in north carolina and soon found himself the legal officer for more than 2 000 men bailey earned a law degree from boston university in 1960 where he had a 90 5 average but he graduated without honors because he refused to join the law review he said the university waived the requirement for an undergraduate degree because of his military legal experience
this article is more than 2 years old getty are the best things in life actually free it depends how we handle the hidden costs free coffee is good at home i drink one mega cup per day at fixed income conferences i typically scale that complimentary consumption up to double digits per day hey they re just hotel cups free breakfast is usually better than just free caffeine and open bar of course reigns supreme for your income strategist no doubt these freebies are baked into ticket costs but i will gladly accept the bacon and beer challenge to get my money s worth when readers write in to ask my thoughts on risk free yields on certain bonds it s time for us to talk no bond is perfect and inflation insurance like it or not always comes with a hidden cost us treasuries played the risk free role from 1980 to 2020 so well that investors in them began to take this income buffet for granted yields went down for 40 years so bond prices which move inversely to yields went up anyone who bought treasuries during this epic bond epoch got some price upside with their payouts but rates can only fall for so long by the end of last year they had hit their lower bound at least for now bond bulls who recently bought the popular ishares 20 year treasury bond etf tlt probably didn t think their four decade win streak would end at year 41 but tlt owners are down nearly 12 on the year wondering why they risked so much on a pathetic 1 payer treasury inflation protected securities tips are the risk free choice for 2021 i m hearing votes from many thoughtful readers writing in with questions like what are brett s thoughts on conservative inflation protected investments like tips there are some tips funds yielding 3 5 to 4 risk free there are those words risk free again like an open bar binge gone too far they can get us into trouble if we are not careful tips have certainly been better than treasuries over the last twelve months let s put the trendy ishares tips bond etf tip up against its traditional sibling we can see that tip has certainly done its job paid its yield plus some price appreciation however let s not mistake a timely trade for an eternal truth tip and similar funds have the same loss potential as fixed rate treasuries the trick to buying inflation protected bonds is when inflation expectations but not necessarily rates are beginning to rise in other words we should use them to buy the inflation rumor and sell the news that said tip itself yields just 1 3 typical lame etf as usual we can double our inflation protected dividends by considering closed end funds cefs the western asset inflation linked income fund wia is the cef play here wia yields 2 8 plus it trades at a 6 discount to its net asset value nav tip on the other hand trades at par so we get a bigger yield with wia plus we get to buy it for 94 cents on the dollar but aren t these dividends still sounding a bit sad it s like finding out that heineken is the import beer at the open bar after all if we re playing higher rates then let s play them and we ve been on the beat since the start of the year in our kickoff column for 2021 you and i said that small banks were the place to be in fact we told the world they were our favorite dividend stocks for 2021 the spread between the long and short end of the interest rate curve is ballooning to something from nothing bank profits directly benefit it is a huge windfall because their borrowing costs tied to short term rates are staying low while their lending profits tied to long term rates pop we like small banks better than big banks because the smaller firms actually know their customers and their balance sheets are much easier for us to read synovus financial snv the stock we profiled in that column has made the tip etf look childish it s up another 53 this year after a torrid close to 2020 i ve been hearing from contrarian income report subscribers who are up a cool 180 on our snv position they are concerned well relatively speaking that snv s yield is now too low should profits be booked and placed elsewhere to which i will continue to paraphrase the western philosopher indiana jones maybe but not today our cir portfolio is dedicated to 6 7 and 8 yields when we bought snv it qualified with a sky high 6 6 yield now that was not a risk free purchase by any means other investors worried that snv s loan portfolio was toxic we understood the concern but disagreed and our contrarian view was richly rewarded a huge part of our success was letting this winner run we could have sold snv when its current yield dropped below 6 or 5 or 4 heck the stock pays new money just 2 8 today but our original money still earns 6 6 our yield on cost which is what we care about and we re not going to argue with serious price appreciation we bought right let s not overthink it just continue to sit tight tips might be overthinking it here sure i can t get in my car with sirius xm always turned to bloomberg radio without hearing about inflation it s a popular idea at the moment but so was crypto last month and these digital coins are down 50 since then we don t let the emotion of the moment dictate our

technology finally found some buyers 1 6 but perhaps prematurely as the nasdaq is down 1 overnight remaining sectors were largely wallflowers so while this rally might be technical it s not market wide which feeds more into a momentum play on that note a 0 7 pop in the us dollar index overnight has weighed heavily on metals prices with gold hardest hit albeit iron ore is up again and the oils have been unaffected this might be an excuse for the asx200 to pull back a bit today a friday with the s p500 down 0 4 but the futures are up 2 points this morning we have seen a full one cent plunge in the aussie over 24 hours thanks for the wake up on a stronger greenback weaker metal prices and maybe the slight miss on april s trade surplus announced yesterday this is a positive offset to commodity weakness and a boon to offshore earners watch healthcare today it might be back in favour the gift that keeps on giving having placed us 230m in new capital on tuesday night amc entertainment following the stock s doubling in price on wednesday night has announced further capital raising this time of close to us 600m the stock is becoming so diluted amc should move into homeopathy but this time finally shareholders understood the meaning and the stock plunged 40 but then it rebounded back to square then it fell 18 the good news is that unlike january this recent meme frenzy has been well contained to a handful of stocks and has not notably impacted the wider market a few shorters have been burned again and a few kiddies will be five minute millionaires but that s about it what it has done however is completely stuff up popular market indicators such as daily share market volumes amc has not been flying around in thin air this week s daily volumes have been massive so much so that cnbc has been temporarily forced to not bother with its usual daily up down volume count as it is just too distorted but it s not the kiddies buying the shares they re buying short term call options mostly well out of the money which requires the market maker sellers of those options to buy stock as a hedge anyone who understands options will appreciate the gamma nightmare these market makers have been facing and why the buying has been feeding on itself the volume of call buying has ruined another popular market indicator the put call ratio and will also be responsible for making the vix another popular indicator more elevated than it otherwise would be but enough about amc wall street did actually move last night maybe there was a little bit of meme influence in an early 260 point loss for the dow but that was recovered fairly swiftly before flatlining to the close the mega cap tech names were being exited again with tesla down 5 on lower chinese sales to reinstate the sell growth theme after a bit of a reprieve recently the selling may simply be an act of caution ahead of tonight s may jobs numbers as we saw in april the us jobs number can come in anywhere april s number was miles below forecasts which dampened inflation fears at least for a while if may s number were to come in hot the reverse would be true which would be bad for growth stocks we can but wait and see in somewhat of a primer weekly new jobless claims fell to below 400 000 last week for the first time since march last year and while the adp private sector reading is never a

a former colleague said thursday he was 87 the death was confirmed thursday by peter horstmann who worked with bailey as an associate in the same law office for seven years in a legal career that lasted more than four decades bailey was seen as arrogant egocentric and contemptuous of authority but he was also acknowledged as bold brilliant meticulous and tireless in the defense of his clients the legal profession is a business with a tremendous collection of egos bailey said an in interview with u s news and world report in september 1981 few people who are not strong egotistically gravitate to it some of bailey s other high profile clients included dr samuel sheppard accused of killing his wife and capt ernest medina charged in connection with the my lai massacre during the vietnam war i have never known a greater intellect than that possessed by f lee bailey said j albert johnson bailey s longtime legal partner and childhood friend bailey an avid pilot best selling author and television show host was a member of the legal dream team that defended simpson the former star nfl running back and actor acquitted on charges that he killed his wife nicole brown simpson and her friend ron goldman in 1995 bailey was the most valuable member of the team simpson said in a 1996 story in the boston globe magazine he was able to simplify everything and identify what the most vital parts of the case were simpson said lee laid down what the case s strategy was what was going to be important and what was not i thought he had an amazing grasp of what was going to be the most important parts of the case and that turned out to be true one of the most memorable moments of the trial came when bailey aggressively cross examined los angeles police detective mark fuhrman in an attempt to portray him as a racist whose goal was to frame simpson it was classic bailey fuhrman denied using racial epithets but the defense later turned up recordings of fuhrman making racist slurs even though fuhrman remained cool under pressure and some legal experts called the confrontation a draw bailey recalling the exchange months later said that was the day fuhrman dug his own grave bailey earned acquittals for many of his clients but he also lost cases most notably hearst s hearst a publishing heiress was kidnapped by the symbionese liberation army terrorist group on feb 4 1974 and participated in armed robberies with the group at trial bailey claimed she was coerced into participating because she feared for her life she still was convicted hearst called bailey an ineffective counsel who reduced the trial to a mockery a farce and a sham in a declaration she signed with a motion to reduce her sentence hearst accused him of sacrificing her defense in an effort to get a book deal about the case she was released in january 1979 after president jimmy carter commuted her sentence bailey made his name as the attorney for sheppard an ohio osteopath convicted in 1954 of murdering his wife sheppard spent more than a decade behind bars before the u s supreme court ruled in a landmark 1966 decision that massive pervasive prejudicial publicity had violated his rights bailey helped win an acquittal at a second trial bailey also defended albert desalvo the man who claimed responsibility for the boston strangler murders between 1962 and 1964 desalvo confessed to the slayings but was never tried or convicted and later recanted despite doubts thrown on desalvo s claim bailey always maintained that desalvo was the strangler throughout his career bailey antagonized authorities with his sometimes abrasive style and his quest for publicity he was censured by a massachusetts judge in 1970 for his philosophy of extreme egocentricity and was disbarred for a year in new jersey in 1971 for talking publicly about a case bailey was disbarred in florida in 2001 and the next year in massachusetts for the way he handled millions of dollars in stock owned by a convicted drug smuggler in 1994 he spent almost six weeks in federal prison charged with contempt of court in 1996 after refusing to turn over the stock the experience left him embittered he eventually won the right to practice law in maine in 2013 francis lee bailey was born in the boston suburb of waltham the son of a newspaper advertising man and a schoolteacher he enrolled at harvard university in 1950

david hall founder of velodyne lidar reiterates call for chairman brad culkin and ceo anand gopalan to step down tweet david hall the beneficial owner of approximately 52 2 of the outstanding common stock of velodyne lidar inc nasdaq vldr velodyne lidar or the company today issued the following open letter to the company s board of directors the board june 3 2021 velodyne lidar inc 5521 hellyer avenue san jose california 95138 attn the board of directors dear members of the board of directors as i have made clear in recent months i firmly believe that you have collectively fostered an anti stockholder culture i chose to resign from the board earlier this year because i had numerous concerns about the strategic direction and current leadership of velodyne lidar today i am writing to you to urge that the following board members step down chairman brad culkin chief executive officer anand gopalan director michael dee and director christopher thomas i believe that each of these individuals has breached stockholders confidence and destroyed significant value in the company in my view the only way to turn around velodyne lidar is to purge the board of its seemingly self interested and underqualified members the board should know it is not lost on stockholders that the company s stock price has plummeted almost 50 since i was unjustifiably stripped of my role as chairman in february pushing aligned and experienced directors off the board has clearly been a recipe for disaster at this point the company s failed directors should do the right thing and resign since being installed on the board via a merger with graf industrial a special purpose acquisition company spac it has become apparent that mr culkin dr gopalan and the aforementioned direcors have not been acting in the best interest of stockholders from my vantage point perhaps the greatest offense has been that this board has allowed dr gopalan s actions to go unchecked as chief executive officer while he has manipulated the truth to customers and investors alike recently dr gopalan attempted to re write history in a september 2020 investor presentation jointly hosted by graf industrial and velodyne lidar management teams when he stated it gives me great pleasure to have the opportunity to tell you about this really exciting story that i ve been part of for 4 5 years starting from a couple of guys in the founder s boat yard and building this incredible technology that s changing society and changing the world in so many different ways 1 the reality is that velodyne lidar did not begin with two guys in a boat yard but was founded in 1983 and took decades to achieve such high growth and significant technological advancement in 2016 the year dr gopalan first joined the company velodyne lidar was profitable earning its highest revenue to date and producing and shipping all lidar products from a 60 000 sq ft building in morgan hill ca news alert with over 100 engineers in stark contrast since dr gopalan has emerged as ceo the company s revenue has steadily declined dr gopalan was one of 50 engineers who contributed to important projects and was not central to solving the main challenge facing velodyne lidar achieving technical cost effective solutions to product delivery i believe the company would be stronger if dr gopalan left and was replaced by a capable successor in addition i am calling on mr culkin to step down because i believe that he has also taken several liberties with the truth and has acted as a rubberstamp on dr gopalan s actions including by approving a robust metric free chief executive officer compensation package i fear that if messrs culkin gopalan and their fellow spac appointed directors are left at the helm significant value destruction will only compound for stockholders velodyne lidar s customers employees and stockholders deserve a better board rather than one that lacks a firm grasp of the truth and a coherent strategic plan i intend to continue to speak my mind and to take other actions to return strategic product development and shareholder value to velodyne lidar sincerely david hall founder of velodyne lidar inc ____________________________ 1 view source version on businesswire com

has died a former colleague said thursday he was 87 the death was confirmed thursday by peter horstmann who worked with bailey as an associate in the same law office for seven years in a legal career that lasted more than four decades bailey was seen as arrogant egocentric and contemptuous of authority but he was also acknowledged as bold brilliant meticulous and tireless in the defense of his clients the legal profession is a business with a tremendous collection of egos bailey said an in interview with u s news and world report in september 1981 few people who are not strong egotistically gravitate to it some of bailey s other high profile clients included dr samuel sheppard accused of killing his wife and captain ernest medina charged in connection with the my lai massacre during the

acquitted on charges that he killed his wife nicole brown simpson and her friend ron goldman in 1995 bailey was the most valuable member of the team simpson said in a 1996 story in the boston globe magazine he was able to simplify everything and identify what the most vital parts of the case were simpson said lee laid down what the case s strategy was what was going to be important and what was not i thought he had an amazing grasp of what was going to be the most important parts of the case and that turned out to be true file o j simpson reacts as he is found not guilty in the death of his ex wife nicole brown simpson and her friend ron goldman in los angeles defense attorneys f lee bailey left and johnnie l cochran jr stand with him one of the most memorable moments of the trial came when bailey aggressively cross examined los angeles police detective mark fuhrman in an attempt to portray him as a racist whose goal was to frame simpson it was classic bailey fuhrman denied using racial epithets but the defense later turned up recordings of fuhrman making racist slurs bailey earned acquittals for many of his clients but he also lost cases most notably hearst s ineffective counsel hearst a publishing heiress was kidnapped by the symbionese liberation army terrorist group on february 4 1974 and participated in armed robberies with the group at trial bailey claimed she was coerced into participating because she feared for her life she still was convicted hearst called bailey an ineffective counsel hearst accused him of sacrificing her defense in an effort to get a book deal about the case she was released in january 1979 after president jimmy carter commuted her sentence file f lee bailey defense lawyer for capt ernest l medina puffs out his cheeks as he talks with reporters at end of court session at fort mcpherson ga sept 15 1971 bailey made his name as the attorney for sheppard an ohio osteopath convicted in 1954 of murdering his wife sheppard spent more than a decade behind bars before the u s supreme court ruled in a landmark 1966 decision that massive pervasive prejudicial publicity had violated his rights bailey helped win an acquittal at a second trial bailey also defended albert desalvo the man who claimed responsibility for the boston strangler killings between 1962 and 1964 desalvo confessed to the slayings but was never tried or convicted and later recanted despite doubts thrown on desalvo s claim bailey always maintained that desalvo was the strangler throughout his career bailey antagonized authorities with his sometimes abrasive style and his quest for publicity he was censured by a massachusetts judge in 1970 for his philosophy of extreme egocentricity and was disbarred for a year in new jersey in 1971 for talking publicly about a case bailey was disbarred in florida in 2001 and the next year in massachusetts for the way he handled millions of dollars in stock owned by a convicted drug smuggler in 1994 he spent almost six weeks in federal prison charged with contempt of court in 1996 after refusing to turn over the stock the experience left him embittered he eventually won the right to practice law in maine in 2013

at the cherry point marine corps air station in north carolina and soon found himself the legal officer for more than 2 000 men bailey earned a law degree from boston university in 1960 where he had a 90 5 average but he graduated without honors because he refused to join the law review he said the university waived the requirement for an undergraduate degree because of his military legal

statements made by one of the prosecution s key witnesses waltham mass f lee bailey the celebrity attorney who defended o j simpson patricia hearst and the alleged boston strangler but whose legal career halted when he was disbarred in two states has died a former colleague said thursday he was 87 the death was confirmed thursday by peter horstmann who worked with bailey as an associate in the same law office for seven years in a legal career that lasted more than four decades bailey was seen as arrogant egocentric and contemptuous of authority but he was also acknowledged as bold brilliant meticulous and tireless in the defense of his clients the legal profession is a business with a tremendous collection of egos bailey said an in interview with u s news and world report in september 1981 few people who are not strong egotistically gravitate to it some of bailey s other high profile clients included dr samuel sheppard accused of killing his wife and capt ernest medina charged in connection with the my lai massacre during the vietnam war i have never known a greater intellect than that possessed by f lee bailey said j albert johnson bailey s longtime legal partner and childhood friend bailey an avid pilot best selling author and television show host was a member of the legal dream team that defended simpson the former star nfl running back and actor acquitted on charges that he killed his wife nicole brown simpson and her friend ron goldman in 1995 bailey was the most valuable member of the team simpson said in a 1996 story in the boston globe magazine he was able to simplify everything and identify what the most vital parts of the case were simpson said lee laid down what the case s strategy was what was going to be important and what was not i thought he had an amazing grasp of what was going to be the most important parts of the case and that turned out to be true i lost a great one f lee bailey you will be missed pic twitter com 6s8ji3oqvb o j simpson therealoj32 june 3 2021 one of the most memorable moments of the trial came when bailey aggressively cross examined los angeles police detective mark fuhrman in an attempt to portray him as a racist whose goal was to frame simpson it was classic bailey fuhrman denied using racial epithets but the defense later turned up recordings of fuhrman making racist slurs even though fuhrman remained cool under pressure and some legal experts called the confrontation a draw bailey recalling the exchange months later said that was the day fuhrman dug his own grave bailey earned acquittals for many of his clients but he also lost cases most notably hearst s hearst a publishing heiress was kidnapped by the symbionese liberation army terrorist group on feb 4 1974 and participated in armed robberies with the group at trial bailey claimed she was coerced into participating because she feared for her life she still was convicted hearst called bailey an ineffective counsel who reduced the trial to a mockery a farce and a sham in a declaration she signed with a motion to reduce her sentence hearst accused him of sacrificing her defense in an effort to get a book deal about the case she was released in january 1979 after president jimmy carter commuted her sentence bailey made his name as the attorney for sheppard an ohio osteopath convicted in 1954 of murdering his wife sheppard spent more than a decade behind bars before the u s supreme court ruled in a landmark 1966 decision that massive pervasive prejudicial publicity had violated his rights bailey helped win an acquittal at a second trial bailey also defended albert desalvo the man who claimed responsibility for the boston strangler murders between 1962 and 1964 desalvo confessed to the slayings but was never tried or convicted and later recanted despite doubts thrown on desalvo s claim bailey always maintained that desalvo was the strangler throughout his career bailey antagonized authorities with his sometimes abrasive style and his quest for publicity he was censured by a massachusetts judge in 1970 for his philosophy of extreme egocentricity and was disbarred for a year in new jersey in 1971 for talking publicly about a case bailey was disbarred in florida in 2001 and the next year in massachusetts for the way he handled millions of dollars in stock owned by a convicted drug smuggler in 1994 he spent almost six weeks in federal prison charged with contempt of court in 1996 after refusing to turn over the stock the experience left him embittered he eventually won the right to practice law in maine in 2013 francis lee bailey was born in the boston suburb of waltham the son of a newspaper advertising man and a schoolteacher he enrolled at harvard university in 1950 but left at the end of his sophomore year to train to become a marine pilot he retained a lifelong love of flying and even owned his own aviation company while in the military bailey volunteered for the legal staff at the cherry point marine corps air station in north carolina and soon found himself the legal officer for more than 2 000 men bailey earned a law degree from boston university in 1960 where he had a 90 5 average but he graduated without honors because he refused to join the law review he said the university waived the requirement for an undergraduate degree because of his military legal experience

biden is proposing a 15 minimum tax on corporations as part of a possible compromise to get his infrastructure bill passed president joe biden is trying to break a logjam with republicans on how to pay for infrastructure improvements proposing a 15 minimum tax on corporations and the possibility of revenues from increased irs enforcement as a possible compromise the offer was made wednesday to republican sen shelley moore capito of west virginia as part of the bipartisan negotiations and did not reflect a change in biden s overall vision for funding infrastructure white house press secretary jen psaki said that biden examined all the tax overhauls from his campaign and administration to look for potential common ground with republicans and that imposing a minimum corporate tax seemed like a possible option he looked to see what could be a path forward with his republican colleagues on this specific negotiation psaki told reporters at a thursday briefing this is a component of what he s proposed for a pay for that he s lifting up as a question as to whether they could agree to that biden has proposed increasing the corporate tax rate to 28 from 21 to help fund his plans for roads bridges electric vehicles and broadband internet and that remains one of his preferred approaches but the rate hike is a nonstarter with republicans because it would undo the 2017 tax cuts signed into law by president donald trump by floating an alternative there is no minimum corporate tax now on profits biden was trying to give republicans a way to back infrastructure without violating their own red line of keeping corporate tax rates at their current level the washington post first reported the offer on thursday senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said he spoke with capito after the session and is still hoping to reach a deal with the administration but he prefers the gop approach that is eyeing a scaled down package paid for by tapping unspent covid 19 relief funds rather than taxes let s reach an agreement on infrastructure that s smaller but still significant and fully paid for he said in paducah kentucky the president is essentially staking out the principle that profitable corporations should pay income taxes many companies can avoid taxes or minimize their bills through a series of credits deductions and other ways of structuring their income and expenses the president has insisted that the middle class should not bear the cost of greater infrastructure spending yet a chasm exists in negotiations because republicans say that corporate tax increases will hinder economic growth the idea of imposing a minimum corporate tax is not new for biden who proposed the policy during the presidential campaign last year and that could turn off some republicans the center right tax foundation estimated that a minimum tax would subtract 0 21 from long run u s gross domestic product he s been pushing it since the primaries over a year ago said george callas managing director of government affairs for the law firm steptoe and a former tax counsel to house republicans callas said that the minimum tax would mostly hit firms such as electric utilities and telecoms that make substantial capital investments as well as companies that rely on paying their employees with stock at the same time both democrats and republicans have eyed revenues that could come from stepped up irs enforcement of unpaid taxes house speaker nancy pelosi d calif has suggested it could amount to some 1 trillion but others say the estimate is far lower biden is seeking roughly 1 trillion in infrastructure spending down from an initial pitch of 2 3 trillion republicans so far have countered with only 257 billion in additional spending on infrastructure as part of a 928 billion package the gop s new spending on infrastructure would be a fraction of what the president says is necessary to compete globally and boost economic growth talks over biden s top legislative priority have been moving slowly a daunting undertaking given the massive infrastructure investment and time for a deal is running out the administration has set a monday deadline to see clear direction and signs of progress biden and capito are set to meet again on friday

risk having to return the funds in the same case this week the treasury told the court that ohio s attempt to invalidate a federal law prohibiting states from using coronavirus aid to offset tax cuts

amc s comeback and then some its stock price surged to a record high on wednesday has been fueled by reddit s army of retail investors as well as some legitimate good news about customers returning to movie theaters but that doesn t mean that amc and the rest of the industry s inherent problems are solved shares in the company the world s largest theater chain are up more than 2 000 this year on wednesday alone amc s stock skyrocketed 120 peaking at just over 70 before sliding back after a wild up and down day of trading the stock closed thursday at 51 34 down about 20 for the day the company is taking advantage of its sky high stock price launching plans to raise gobs of money that will keep amc marquees lit for the near future amc announced thursday that it sold 11 5 million shares bringing in 587 4 million of new capital that number shows how much amc has bounced back over the last few months considering that as of december 30 2020 the market cap of the entire company was just 347 million amc seemed to acknowledge the bizarre situation by telling investors earlier on thursday that the recent volatility and our current market prices reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business and admitted that it does not know how long these dynamics will last the stock offer also came with an unusual warning under the circumstances we caution you against investing in our class a common stock unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment the company wrote in a filing on thursday so despite the eye popping movement on wall street amc still has a long way to go before it reaches any sort of hollywood happy ending a pandemic hitting an industry in transition the theater industry was hit particularly hard by the covid 19 pandemic and amc was no exception it was just a few months ago that the company said it could run out of cash by the end of 2020 the stock which is currently trading at roughly 65 a share may seem high now but just five months ago shares hit a low of 1 91 it makes sense that theater chains like amc struggled over the last year the pandemic was one of the worst possible things that could have happened to an industry that was already in transition the global health crisis caused cineplexes to shut down for months on end and delayed the release of hit movies such as marvel s black widow and the new james bond film no time to die those movies are now set to open this year and audiences are returning to theaters but that doesn t mean the problems theaters face have just disappeared in fact streaming one of the biggest challenges confronting theater operators got stronger during the pandemic services like netflix and disney grew their user bases while newcomers nbcuniversal and warnermedia cnn s parent company debuted new services with peacock and hbo max respectively if that wasn t enough with theaters out of commission studios took the unprecedented step of releasing big films directly to consumers at home trolls world tour mulan and pixar s soul were all released on digital platforms some required an extra fee and some were available directly to subscribers free of charge warner bros even went so far as to announce that all of its 2021 film slate will be released on hbo max and in theaters simultaneously a ray of hope despite theaters reopening hollywood is still moving towards a streaming focused future how movie theaters fit into that future is yet to be determined but there is hope for the bottom lines of theater chains like amc and that hope can be found at the box office rather than just on the reddit boards the summer has historically been hollywood s most crucial season as it typically brings in the biggest box office returns each year and no summer is more vital than this one with vaccinations ramping up big movies returning to theaters and covid restrictions loosening hollywood studios were hopeful that this summer would help them better understand the overall health of the movie theater industry so far so good paramount s a quiet place part ii a horror film starring emily blunt just had the biggest debut of the pandemic so far notching 48 3 million for its three day opening in north america over memorial day weekend sure it s only one weekend but there s plenty of films this summer that can keep the momentum going potential blockbusters including marvel s black widow universal s next fast furious movie f9 and warner bros in the heights are on the docket over the next few months these films come with big buzz that could bring some much needed foot traffic to theaters following the surge on wall street adam aron amc s ceo seemed bullish about the future of his company saying tuesday that with our increased liquidity an increasingly vaccinated population and the imminent release of blockbuster new movie titles it is time for amc to go on the offense again whether amc and the rest of the industry stays on offense only time will tell
biden is proposing a 15 minimum tax on corporations as part of a possible compromise to get his infrastructure bill passed president joe biden is trying to break a logjam with republicans on how to pay for infrastructure improvements proposing a 15 minimum tax on corporations and the possibility of revenues from increased irs enforcement as a possible compromise the offer was made wednesday to republican sen shelley moore capito of west virginia as part of the bipartisan negotiations and did not reflect a change in biden s overall vision for funding infrastructure white house press secretary jen psaki said that biden examined all the tax overhauls from his campaign and administration to look for potential common ground with republicans and that imposing a minimum corporate tax seemed like a possible option he looked to see what could be a path forward with his republican colleagues on this specific negotiation psaki told reporters at a thursday briefing this is a component of what he s proposed for a pay for that he s lifting up as a question as to whether they could agree to that biden has proposed increasing the corporate tax rate to 28 from 21 to help fund his plans for roads bridges electric vehicles and broadband internet and that remains one of his preferred approaches but the rate hike is a nonstarter with republicans because it would undo the 2017 tax cuts signed into law by president donald trump by floating an alternative there is no minimum corporate tax now on profits biden was trying to give republicans a way to back infrastructure without violating their own red line of keeping corporate tax rates at their current level the washington post first reported the offer on thursday senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said he spoke with capito after the session and is still hoping to reach a deal with the administration but he prefers the gop approach that is eyeing a scaled down package paid for by tapping unspent covid 19 relief funds rather than taxes let s reach an agreement on infrastructure that s smaller but still significant and fully paid for he said in paducah kentucky the president is essentially staking out the principle that profitable corporations should pay income taxes many companies can avoid taxes or minimize their bills through a series of credits deductions and other ways of structuring their income and expenses the president has insisted that the middle class should not bear the cost of greater infrastructure spending yet a chasm exists in negotiations because republicans say that corporate tax increases will hinder economic growth the idea of imposing a minimum corporate tax is not new for biden who proposed the policy during the presidential campaign last year and that could turn off some republicans the center right tax foundation estimated that a minimum tax would subtract 0 21 from long run u s gross domestic product he s been pushing it since the primaries over a year ago said george callas managing director of government affairs for the law firm steptoe and a former tax counsel to house republicans callas said that the minimum tax would mostly hit firms such as electric utilities and telecoms that make substantial capital investments as well as companies that rely on paying their employees with stock at the same time both democrats and republicans have eyed revenues that could come from stepped up irs enforcement of unpaid taxes house speaker nancy pelosi d calif has suggested it could amount to some 1 trillion but others say the estimate is far lower biden is seeking roughly 1 trillion in infrastructure spending down from an initial pitch of 2 3 trillion republicans so far have countered with only 257 billion in additional spending on infrastructure as part of a 928 billion package the gop s new spending on infrastructure would be a fraction of what the president says is necessary to compete globally and boost economic growth talks over biden s top legislative priority have been moving slowly a daunting undertaking given the massive infrastructure investment and time for a deal is running out the administration has set a monday deadline to see clear direction and signs of progress biden and capito are set to meet again on friday

now that we re all unmasking and the economy seems set to roar into the 2020s what will we remember about how disastrously how malignantly the trump administration behaved as the pandemic took hold and will anyone be held to account for it the instinct to forget pandemics as i ve pointed out when it came to the 1918 spanish flu has historically been strong indeed in these years the urge to forget official malfeasance and move on has it turns out been at least as strong washington s failure to investigate and bring to account those who led the nation and ultimately the world into the folly of the iraq war may be the most egregious recent example of this in the end that s why i wrote my new book virus to memorialize a clear and accessible historical record of the deliberate and deadly decision making that swept us all into a kind of hell i had the urge to try to stop what happened to us from being instantly buried in the next round of daily reporting or as appears likely now relegated to the occasional voluminous government or foundation report on how to do things better in the early months of 2020 as rumors of distant death morphed into announcements of an imminent pandemic followed by a patchwork of state and local lockdowns most americans were too stunned by daily events to absorb the bigger picture memories of those days still click by like surreal snapshots prepper shopping toilet paper hoarders forklifts moving bodies into refrigerated trucks and a capricious leader on tv night after endless night talking about quack cures his own ratings and how he liked the numbers low meanwhile he left desperate states to compete with each other for badly needed protective gear what looked like chaos or ad hoc decision making by an improbably elected fraudster president was in fact deeply rooted in ideology specifically in the belief that the job of the government was neither to exercise leadership nor activate government agencies to assist the american people it was to promote private industry and its profits as the solution to anything and everything pandemic that ideology led to profiteering politicized science and mass death now as the pandemic wanes at least for the time being though not necessarily for the unvaccinated in this country it deserves an investigation somewhere between almost 600 000 and more than 900 000 americans have died so far from covid 19 a significant number of those deaths unnecessary as even the former administration s medical expert dr deborah birx has said the virus arrived in america after the trump administration steered by right wing heritage foundation policy wonks and their donor class comrades had already laid waste to key agencies like health and human services hhs and the centers for disease control their instant response to the pandemic was to similarly sideline government emergency management experts put inexperienced 20 something volunteers in charge of finding and distributing protective gear and circulate lists of possible suppliers one of whom typically enough a silicon valley entrepreneur with no medical contracting experience snagged a cool 86 million contract from the state of new york for ventilators he would never deliver while most of the country hunkered down in a state of stunned paralysis a faction of trumpworld recognized the pandemic not for what it took away human lives and livelihoods but for what it offered the chaos of the moment allowed them to road test their dream system to prove once and for all that the forces of supply and demand the instinct to make a buck could do a better job managing a natural disaster than the government of the united states and its bureaucrats is any of this likely to be investigated will anyone be held accountable for what appears to have been a response deliberately mismanaged by religious zealots and crony capitalists crews equally cynical about expertise science and the government s ability to prevent or ameliorate disaster what we don t know about the trump pandemic disaster here as a start is a rundown of where inquiries into that disaster now stand buried in the alphabet soup of the coronavirus aid relief and economic security or cares act is the pandemic response accountability committee prac established in march 2020 to keep track of the federal money by now 5 5 trillion that was to be spent on the pandemic it s a consortium of agency inspector generals headed by michael horowitz a career department of justice lawyer his name will be familiar to anyone who followed the trump russia investigations he produced a report in 2019 that to the dismay of trump s supporters failed to conclude that the fbi had begun investigating connections between vladimir putin s russia and the trump campaign without legal cause and as a political dirty trick prac is authorized to conduct oversight of pandemic related emergency spending of any sort its inspector generals have already issued nearly 200 pandemic related oversight reports and charged 474 people with trying to steal more than 569 million details in its quarterly reports are available online while prac has been genuinely nonpartisan in its acts its focus so far has been on the small fry of the pandemic era not the truly big fish in its most recent semi annual report for example it makes clear that 55 of its charges had to do with fraud in the paycheck protection program and 40 were related to fraudulent unemployment assistance claims among the bigger prac successes charging a texas man in a 24 million covid relief fraudulent loan scheme last october and seven men in another fraud scheme in which they used their ill gotten pandemic gains to buy among other things a porsche and a lamborghini the cares act also authorized the government accountability office gao to monitor the federal response to the pandemic its most recent semi annual report included 16 recommendations in selected public health areas like testing vaccines and therapeutics only one of which has so far been implemented a source at the gao told me that a report on some contracting irregularities can be expected this summer so far such government self assessments have shown little appetite for dealing with the true cronyism profiteering and disastrous politicization of the federal pandemic response by trump s minions among the schemes begging for a deeper look is operation airbridge led by the president s son in law jared kushner it was an attempt to use federal funds to underwrite the air shipping costs of private companies in an effort to speed the delivery of the kinds of personal protective equipment that were in such short supply last spring that unorthodox effort included large no bid contracts granted to a small group of private health care companies without restrictions on pricing or even on where the desperately needed products were to be delivered in the spring of 2020 as hospital workers began popping up on social media and network news programs clad only in garbage bags and makeshift or reused face masks sometimes in tears and pleading for help the white house maintained its focus on private enterprise as the way out of the disaster the administration called for volunteers to staff what would become another public private bonanza the white house covid 19 supply chain task force also helmed by trump family fixer jared kushner we don t know what if anything kushner s group actually accomplished the audacity of the former administration s disregard for federal rules and regulations coupled with the scale of the no bid contracts they issued certainly attracted political pushback at the time democrats and civil society groups in washington filed requests for more information about how such contracts had eluded federal guidelines and where the supplies actually went it s possible however that we may never know ventilating money in april 2020 a group of democratic senators led by elizabeth warren citing the administration s secrecy opened an investigation into the operation they sent a letter to the six operation airbridge beneficiary health care giants cardinal health concordance henry schein mckesson medline and owens minor requesting explanations for reports of political favoritism cronyism and price gouging in the ongoing supply effort taxpayers have shelled out tens of millions of dollars on this secretive project and they deserve to know whether it actually helped get critical supplies to the areas most in need warren said that june three of the six suppliers did in the end give the senators copies of memorandums of agreement moas indicating that they had complete discretion about how to distribute supplies across hotspot counties and that nothing in the moas appears to prevent a supplier from sending all of its supplies designated for hotspots to just a single customer in one of the hotspots the government hadn t in fact put any kind of conditions on the cost for that protective equipment and the trump justice department would insist that it was none of its business how suppliers arrived at the prices they charged for it using taxpayer funds to grease private enrichment was of course a trump family tradition going back to the eisenhower years when donald s father fred fleeced the government of millions of dollars in loans aimed at housing world war ii veterans hauled down to capitol hill to explain himself the new york builder was unrepentant arguing that a loophole in the law allowed for his private gain and under such circumstances only a fool would have left all that money on the table what from the outside came to look like white house inspired chaos of which operation airbridge was just one example should in fact be seen as a deliberate effort to disengage the federal government and leave the blame and the logistics problems to covid afflicted states at the time mostly run by democrats on march 24 2020 for instance new york governor andrew cuomo begged the federal government to help get more ventilators for what was clearly going to be a surge of coronavirus patients new york city s health care system was already overwhelmed by then at the time hooking patients up to ventilators seemed like the best way to go though doctors later realized that for many patients the tricky disease could be foiled earlier with anticlotting and steroid medication how can you have new yorkers possibly dying because they can t get a ventilator asked cuomo three days later trump tweeted general motors must start making ventilators now ford get going on ventilators fast yaron oren pines an electrical engineer for tech firms like google tweeted back at the president we can supply icu ventilators invasive and non invasive within days he turned up on a list vetted by kushner s team of volunteers and at their recommendation officials in new york closed a deal with him the only problem oren pines had no ventilators and had never been in the medical supply business when he failed to deliver on the 86 million deal wells fargo froze his account and new york canceled the order demanding the money back though by summer 2020 it had yet to collect a final 10 million the great forgetting in addition to making various large or politically well connected health care companies far wealthier the administration also lavished staggering billions on a small group of big pharma firms for operation warp speed the project it backed to develop vaccines and medicines to treat covid 19 those contracts too were written outside normal government channels and the companies themselves were chosen by a panel of industry insiders without any oversight many of them stood to and did profit from the soaring stock prices of those firms when the news about clinical trial successes was released in november 2020 to launch an investigation into that situation senator warren teamed up with representative katie porter d ca to request copies of all federal contracts for covid 19 therapeutics and vaccines the american people they stated deserve to know that the federal government is using their tax dollars to develop covid 19 medical products at the best possible price for the public not to line the pockets of wealthy companies by cutting corners in consumer protection pricing and quality warren raised questions about a department of health and human services deal with gilead sciences for the pandemic therapeutic remdesivir part of the cocktail of drugs administered to donald trump and other republican insiders like chris christie and rudy giuliani when they got covid hhs had indeed acquired a large supply of remdesivir at an exorbitant cost to american taxpayers and gilead itself would charge american hospitals 3 200 per treatment for it 860 more than its price in other developed countries in addition to warren who sent a letter to the administration requesting information on hhs s pricing negotiations with gilead for the drug other people also stood up whistleblower dr rick bright former director of the biomedical advanced research and development agency barda for instance filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that dr robert kadlec a trump hhs political appointee had engaged in multiple schemes to funnel contracts to politically connected companies and that this had begun even before the pandemic was even a reality according to bright kadlec then pushed him out of the government despite the fact that federal law officially protects whistleblowers in his complaint among other things bright alleged that in 2017 a kadlec friend and big pharma consultant pressured the agency to maintain a contract with a company owned by a friend of jared kushner s even after an independent review determined it should be cancelled bright testified before congress and the fate of his whistleblower suit remains to be litigated as for the rest of the inquiries so far money and power appear to have eluded the investigators it s unclear whether senator warren s and representative porter s requests met with any response from the former administration or even whether they ve continued their inquiry into big pharma and no bid contracting they have made no further announcements and neither office replied to requests for updates you won t be surprised to learn i m sure that the name jared kushner is so far not to be found in gao or prac reports the best chance for public accountability if not legal liability might be the house of representatives especially its select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis launched in april 2020 the trump administration blew off its subpoenas for former hhs secretary alex azar and then cdc director robert redfield to testify in december 2020 and blocked documents and witnesses related to politicized data testing and supply shortages among other areas of inquiry but the subcommittee did manage to expose emails from trump political appointees revealing efforts to skew cdc data it is also investigating some whopping no bid or sole contractor deals that the former administration cut with preferred businesses one was a 354 million four year contract awarded on a non competitive basis to phlow which was incorporated in january 2020 to manufacture generic medicines to fight covid it s the largest contract ever awarded by barda and includes a 10 year option worth 812 million and the house has continued to seek transparency according to a brookings house oversight tracker as of march 2021 30 of congressional oversight letters and 40 of its hearings were related to the federal government s pandemic response but there are signs that the biden administration while more cooperative is not eager to force agencies to comply with requests the previous administration ignored my sense is that the emergency created by the insurrection at the capitol last january and the desperate need of the new biden administration to have palpable policy achievements in order to do well in election 2022 has taken the steam out of any inclination to dig deeper into the profiteering cronyism political scheming and chaos with which the trump administration met the covid 19 virus it went far deeper than an article like this can possibly indicate leaving so many hundreds of thousands of potentially unnecessary deaths in its wake think of it as a memory hole still brimming with schemes and money copyright 2021 nina burleigh follow tomdispatch on
