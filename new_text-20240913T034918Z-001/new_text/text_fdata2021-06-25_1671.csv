social media posts have claimed the spike protein the body creates after receiving an mrna vaccine kills cells experts say there is no evidence of that throughout the rollout of the covid 19 vaccines in the united states there have been people questioning the safety of the vaccines recently posts on social media have suggested the spike protein created in people s bodies after receiving the pfizer and moderna mrna covid 19 vaccines is cytotoxic meaning the protein kills cells in the body after the mrna vaccines are administered the spike protein causes the immune system to create antibodies to defend itself against covid 19 a video posted june 13 on youtube with the headline spike protein is very dangerous it s cytotoxic has more than 1 8 million views a day later an instagram post that links to the youtube video said the fda was alerted months ago that the spike protein in the covid vaccines are cytotoxic on june 20 one of the people in the youtube video questioned the safety of the covid 19 vaccines on twitter by saying the spike protein in sars cov 2 the virus that causes covid 19 is cytotoxic that post has been retweeted more than 4 000 times the question is the spike protein in the covid 19 vaccines cytotoxic the sources dr carolyn machamer cell biology professor at johns hopkins school of medicine dr monica gandhi infectious disease physician and professor of medicine at university of california san francisco dr benhur lee microbiology professor at icahn school of medicine at mount sinai the answer no there is no evidence the spike protein in the covid 19 vaccines is cytotoxic experts say the spike protein created by the human body after mrna vaccination is different than the sars cov 2 spike protein what we found the bottom line is the vaccine spike isn t toxic said dr carolyn machamer a cell biology professor at johns hopkins school of medicine in a tweet shared thousands of times dr robert malone who identifies himself as the inventor of mrna vaccines wrote the sars cov 2 spike protein is cytotoxic that is a fact who says so multiple peer reviewed references the salk institute it is the responsibility of the vaccine developers to demonstrate that their expressed version is not toxic show us dr benhur lee a professor of microbiology at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai said the potential cytotoxicity of sars cov 2 has no bearing on the safety of the mrna vaccines the sound bite sars cov 2 spike protein is toxic is not technically wrong also not news at per se but that has nothing to do with overall established safety of sars cov 2 vaccines especially the mrna vaccines lee said that s in part because according to machamer the spike protein in sars cov 2 is different than the spike protein created after the administration of the mrna vaccines the vaccine at least the moderna and the pfizer vaccines the mrna vaccines they supply the information to make spike but it s not exactly the spike that s in the virus she said there are changes that were made on purpose that would prevent the spike protein from being able to undergo binding to the receptor and fusion machamer explained and so all this business about toxicity that has been shown for the real spike protein the one that doesn t have that block is totally irrelevant for the vaccine the mrna vaccines essentially give instructions to the immune system on how to defend itself against the virus that causes covid 19 according to dr monica gandhi an infectious disease physician and professor of medicine at the university of california san francisco once the immune cells get the message they make the spike protein at that point the immune system responds by creating antibodies which fight off the covid 19 virus in the case of infection all it does is allow you as a human host to raise an immune response against something that you don t like which is a spike protein that looks different from your body gandhi said and then you have that nice healthy immune response so that if you ever see the virus you will fight that virus the mrna then disappears and doesn t stay in the body gandhi said more than 300 million doses of the mrna covid 19 vaccines have been administered in the u s and gandhi says there s no evidence the spike protein created in the human body after mrna vaccination is cytotoxic definitely no evidence in the human body even in cells that the spike protein itself hurts normal healthy cells she said not cytotoxic
washington reuters president joe biden and top white house officials hailed a bipartisan preliminary infrastructure agreement as proof that washington and even american democracy itself could deliver tangible results despite huge partisan divides but securing the deal which delivers a fraction of the investment he initially proposed required the democratic president to make big sacrifices and its passage through congress was thrown in doubt later thursday after senate minority leader mitch mcconnell criticized a two track plan to pass a second spending bill later the bipartisan framework is valued at 1 2 trillion over eight years 579 billion of which is new spending biden insists he will continue to fight for his priorities including what he calls human infrastructure and more funding for environmental programs in the separate democrats only bill and insisted he would not sign one package without the other here s how the compromise infrastructure bill agreed by the senators thursday compares to what was initially proposed transportation infrastructure the compromise hammered out by the g 21 group of republican and democratic senators includes 312 billion in new funding for roads bridges public transit and electric vehicle infrastructure roughly half the 621 billion that biden sought in the american jobs plan proposal he unveiled in march one area that saw a big drop from the original plan was public transit now slated to see a 49 billion bump in funding compared to the 85 billion initially proposed passenger and freight rail a huge personal priority for biden who has logged more than one million miles on amtrak is slated to receive 66 billion in additional funding down from the 80 billion earmarked in the initial proposal the biggest drop came for electric vehicle technology where biden had proposed investing 174 billion but the new plan calls for just 15 billion after rebates were eliminated broadband biden has made increasing internet access for all americans a top priority especially given the huge gaps exposed during the pandemic when many low income americans and those in rural areas had trouble working and learning from home the compromise proposal calls for increased spending of 65 billion on broadband infrastructure down from the 100 billion initially proposed by the president environmental remediation biden had vowed to replace 100 of the nation s lead pipes and service lines and his aides say that will still happen but the overall amount earmarked for environmental remediation dropped to 21 billion from 111 billion in the initial proposal left on the cutting room floor are billions that biden had hoped to invest in modernizing america s drinking water wastewater and stormwater systems human infrastructure missing completely from the proposal is 400 billion in funding for medicaid to fund home care for the elderly and disabled and some 200 billion to create free universal pre kindergarten and expand other childcare services affordable housing biden s initial proposal also included 213 billion to produce preserve and retrofit more than 2 million affordable places to live he will have to fight to get that money included in the democrats only budget package pay fors one of the starkest differences is who will pay for it all while biden pledged to increase corporate income taxes to fund infrastructure republicans drew a line in the sand the new deal pulls together a patchwork of increased irs enforcement selling off petroleum reserves redirected funds from unused unemployment insurance benefits and municipal bonds among other things reporting by andrea shalal and heather timmons editing by richard pullin

charlottesville va june 22 2021 globe newswire adial pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq adil adilw a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies for the treatment and prevention of addiction and related disorders today announced plans to enter the genetic testing market after it received a notice of allowance from the u s patent and trademark office related to use of the company s genetic diagnostic panel in combination with the company s lead product ad04 for the treatment of alcohol use disorder aud the patent covered by the notice of allowance also pertains to the company s use of its genetic diagnostic panel in combination with ad04 for the treatment of opioid use disorder oud this new patent related to the use of our genetic diagnostic panel in combination with ad04 for the treatment of aud and oud is a major milestone as we believe genetic evaluation of patients can be used to identify individuals that may benefit from ad04 we have been utilizing the genetic panel covered by this patent in our ongoing onward phase 3 trial and given this patent allowance we anticipate that genetic diagnostics are expected to be an important segment of our commercial strategy going forward said william stilley chief executive officer of adial pharmaceuticals our view that aud has a solid nexus in genetics is fundamental to the premise of the successful phase 2b trial of ad04 conducted at the university of virginia and our onward phase 3 trial of ad04 currently underway in europe and it is consistent with adial s premise that the presence of certain genetics is expected to substantially influence whether an individual suffering from aud or oud would likely respond to treatment with ad04 the recently allowed patent once issued is expected to provide market exclusivity for the ad04 genetic diagnostic test creating a possibly significant profit center for the company therefore assuming approval by either the u s or european regulatory authorities adial plans to enter the genetic testing market as a stand alone commercial business line and develop and market the genetic diagnostic panel as a companion diagnostic test to ad04 for identification of the approximately one third 33 of aud patients expected to respond to treatment with ad04 the company also sees a future opportunity to commercialize a companion diagnostic test to ad04 for oud if an oud approval is also received for ad04 commenting on the potential market for adial s genetic companion diagnostic test for ad04 for the treatment of aud mr stilley stated market research conducted by adial indicates a willingness among payors to reimburse a genetic companion diagnostic test and this may allow adial to provide patients personalized precision medicine and also potentially provide dramatic cost savings to payors our models estimate the payback period for payors would be under 12 months at expected pricing and with 35 million people in the united states estimated to have aud we believe the total potential market for our companion diagnostic genetic test could be a multi billion dollar opportunity in the united states alone about adial pharmaceuticals inc adial pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies for the treatment and prevention of addiction and related disorders the company s lead investigational new drug product ad04 is a genetically targeted serotonin 3 receptor antagonist therapeutic agent for the treatment of alcohol use disorder aud and is currently being investigated in the company s landmark onward pivotal phase 3 clinical trial for the potential treatment of aud in subjects with certain target genotypes which are to be identified using the company s proprietary companion diagnostic genetic test a phase 2b clinical trial of ad04 for the treatment of aud showed promising results in reducing frequency of drinking quantity of drinking and heavy drinking all with statistical significance and no overt safety concerns there were no statistically significant serious adverse events reported ad04 is also believed to have the potential to treat other addictive disorders such as opioid use disorder gambling and obesity and the company develops adenosine analogs for the treatment of pain and other disorders additional information is available at www adialpharma com about the landmark onward pivotal phase 3 clinical trial the onward trial is a 24 week multicenter randomized double blind placebo controlled parallel group phase 3 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy safety and tolerability of ad04 in patients with alcohol use disorder aud and selected polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter and receptor genes patients are genetically screened prior to enrollment in the onward trial so that only genetically positive patients are enrolled the primary endpoint for analysis of efficacy is the change from baseline in the monthly number of heavy drinking days during the last 8 weeks of the 24 week treatment period onward is currently being conducted in 25 clinical sites in seven countries in scandinavia and central and eastern europe

john kennedy and yoonserk pyun usa today network florida tallahassee since anointed a favorite for the white house at february s conservative political action conference gov ron desantis has become a new florida attraction a right leaning politician on the minds of many republicans nationwide and with that attention has come money millions of dollars in campaign cash certain to prove troubling for florida democrats looking to deny desantis a second term next year by the way nikki fried announces campaign for governor in early clash of rivals desantis nikki fried spar over rule governing police funding amid praise from conservatives florida gov desantis also drawing lawsuits since that cpac event desantis has been raking in campaign contributions raising a remarkable 28 7 million with almost half of the cash coming from donors outside florida a usa today network florida analysis shows the dollar balance underscores the governor s rising national profile within a republican party base drawn to his pushing a crackdown on protesters involved in violent demonstrations and a defense of law enforcement along with new limits on voting social media platforms critical race theory and transgender athletes topics that regularly fill conservative media while much of desantis agenda is being challenged as unconstitutional in federal court by civil rights organizations voting advocates and technology groups the governor has been talking up his stands frequently on fox news pulling in donors far from florida we were just blown away at how good he was said karin krogius 62 a real estate investor who attended a desantis fund raiser earlier this month in california s orange county among several southern california cash calls he held she donated 1 500 at the event in the santa ana country club he was absolutely amazing and i m happy to support him said krogius who previously had only seen desantis on fox news i think he s what this country needs but the torrent of out of state money also is giving desantis rivals a fresh line of attack it s no surprise that nearly half of ron desantis contributions come from other states said max flugrath a spokesman for democratic agriculture commissioner nikki fried who announced this month her candidacy for governor he s been running around the country raising huge campaign cash from special interests that know he ll protect florida s corrupt system which puts their profits first that s why nikki is running to break the system and build a new florida that listens to people he added joshua karp an advisor to the campaign of democratic u s rep charlie crist the former republican governor who announced in may that he is challenging desantis also pointed to the governor s signing of a host of conservative measures he called for from the gop led legislature his agenda is cut and pasted from fox news chyrons karp said it has nothing to do with what regular floridians are looking for from their government both democratic candidates are in the early stages of fund raising but desantis turned the spigot of cash onto full blast since cpac attendees in their february straw poll listed him as their top choice for the white house in 2024 if former president donald trump doesn t run again in other news desantis says red tide this year not like 2018 bloom more desantis signs legislation sought by florida jewish leaders blisters u n desantis says no messaging involved in denial of lgbtq bridge lighting request while the event s siting in orlando may have helped boost the florida governor s numbers desantis recently topped even trump for first place among white house contenders in a poll at denver s western conservative summit since cpac desantis has pulled 28 7 million into his friends of ron desantis spending committee 13 9 million or 48 of the cash from donors out of state by contrast during the same three and a half month period last year when covid 19 had largely put fund raising on hold desantis collected 449 904 for his committee with only 4 400 from non florida contributors now the money is flowing in sums large and small among his biggest out of state contributions was from boston private equity manager john w childs who gave 250 000 in may to desantis following up on 600 000 he donated in 2018 during the governor s first statewide campaign childs who lives seasonally near vero beach had charges dropped last year after being caught up in a massage parlor investigation which snared nearly 300 men including new england patriots owner robert kraft who also was cleared of solicitation of prostitution childs has retired from his company but was drawn to desantis during his gop primary campaign against favored then state agriculture commissioner adam putnam who faded once trump came out in support of his rival other big recent contributions include 250 000 from home depot co founder bernard marcus a major trump donor 100 000 from alex kleyner a real estate lender active in new york and miami and 100 000 from willis johnson a tennessee auto auction billionaire but hundreds more contributions are considered small dollar amounts helped by the influx of out of state cash desantis had more than 39 million on hand by the beginning of this month he s been consistent about some of the same values that most of us in the republican party espouse said joe namie 71 of cordova tenn who sent desantis 50 in may making the donation over his iphone namie couldn t recall specifically what prompted him to send the money after seeing desantis on tv but he thought it involved the governor s defiance of covid related closures in other states desantis is for smaller government more freedoms and for not being a victim of some of the media that wants to run this country said namie who runs his own tax services company and formerly lived in santa rosa beach in the florida panhandle he hasn t been a hypocrite yet desantis stature and visibility on conservative media is proving a money magnet similar to trump s 2018 endorsement there s no question that when you re on fox news and talking about key issues to republican voters and donors you re able to start building your file your campaign list of donors said david johnson a florida republican strategist and former executive director of the state gop it s very important to have this kind of list of people willing to invest in your candidacy for governor or beyond he added johnson said that desantis is emerging as something like the first alternate to trump for 2024 still the field of gop potential presidential contenders is large and includes former vice president mike pence former south carolina governor and united nations ambassador nikki haley south dakota gov kristi noem and former secretary of state mike pompeo but as he basks in the national attention there are risks for florida s governor desantis can easily draw heat for time spent away from florida or for swerving so far right on issues that he jeopardizes his own support within a state still considered a political toss up after all despite trump s endorsement and a fund raising advantage desantis was elected in 2018 by fewer than 34 000 votes this state is won in the center and along the margins said jose parra a senior advisor to the florida democratic party desantis has to convince the center to go with him and he could be overplaying his hands to favor his political ambitions and looking ahead to be president john kennedy is a reporter in the usa today network s florida capital bureau he can be

in our first client alert about libor s passing libor s long good bye the first alert we suggested that borrowers of u s dollars prepare themselves for the end of the london interbank offered rate usd libor by understanding the replacement rates suggested by lenders as we noted it is almost certain that the daily secured overnight financing rate sofr will have some place in the spectrum of replacement rates but there are issues to be worked on prior to adopting sofr sofr which has been recommended by the alternate reference rates committee arrc since 2017 is a rate published daily by the federal reserve bank of new york reflecting the cost of overnight borrowings secured by u s treasury securities unlike usd libor which depends on submissions by lenders as to their costs of interbank borrowing sofr is a virtually risk free rate and has impressive credibility it i has an enormous underlying transaction value averaging daily between 700 billion and 1 trillion ii has a widely diverse range of direct and indirect market participants iii is administered by the new york federal reserve bank and iv is subject to review by the new york fed oversight committee if sofr is such an impressively credentialed rate how can there be any problems understanding conversions from usd libor to sofr borrowings the answer lies in the technical differences between libor and sofr for example usd libor is a term rate payable over an interest period while sofr is a rate that may change daily and usd libor is quoted in advance at the beginning of an interest period but historically sofr has been quoted in arrears which would require interest to be determined at the end of an interest period instead of the beginning as is customary with usd libor which is quote in advance in other words in addition to the spread adjustment discussed in the first alert required to address the risk free nature of sofr as compared to usd libor some banking legerdemain is needed to make sofr work in a world built on usd libor and borrowers need to understand the effect of this sleight of hand unless they do not care about how much interest they are required to pay averaging in advance or in arrears compound or simple hybrid averaging in its guide to sofr the arrc noted that inancial products either explicitly or implicitly use some kind of average of sofr not a single day s reading of the rate in determining the floating rate payments that are to be paid or received an average of sofr will accurately reflect movements in interest rates over a given period of time and smooth out any idiosyncratic day to day fluctuations in market rates in response to concerns about the viability of sofr quoted in advance i e prior to the beginning of an accrual interest period as a replacement for usd libor on may 11 2021 the arrc released its guide to published sofr averages the guide to averages the guide to averages observes that the averages of sofr can be quoted in advance in reliance on past averaging or can be calculated on a compounded in arrears basis to take into account actual interest rates during an interest period the arrc points out in its february 2021 updated user s guide the guide to sofr that the amount of daily volatility in sofr can change over time but using an average overnight rate smooths out almost all of this type of volatility so that in fact a three month average of sofr is less volatile than three month usd libor in sum it is likely that alternatives to libor implemented by lenders will build on averaging sofr over some period of time however interest calculated on any basis can be determined in differing ways with differing impacts in advance or in arrears for decades usd libor been quoted in advance for various specified interest periods such as overnight one week one two three six or 12 month interest periods permitting both lenders and borrowers to know interest in advance of its accrual and payment and the arrc has expressed several times its goal of having a forward looking term rate based on sofr in advance in fact on may 21 2021 the arrc announced that it has selected cme group cme which has published one three and six month term sofr rates beginning in april 2021 as the administrator for a forward looking sofr term rate such a rate would closely mimic how usd libor has worked and potentially be more feasible for lenders to adopt than other types of interest rates however a robust forward looking sofr rate market has not yet fully developed according to the guide to sofr average sofr rates quoted both in advance and in arrears will reflect the moves in monetary policy that are the primary driver of money market rates although an in advance structure will involve a one period delay in the timing of when such moves are reflected in fact the arrc proposes that most business loan transactions avoid the one period delay in timing imposed by the in advance convention and has adopted the in arrears convention in its term sheets for floating rate notes and syndicated and bilateral business loan lenders could be expected to embrace this in arrears approach to quoting average sofr since quoting sofr in advance has no mechanism for predicting where interest rates will go as usd libor purported to do by contrast the arrc adopts the in advance convention for intercompany loans and consumer loan term sheets where the parties are believed to have more legitimate reasons for needing to know interest rate accruals in advance assuming that the arrc s lead is followed by most financial institutions this would mean that after the termination of usd libor most business loans will be quoted by lenders in arrears unlike usd libor this change in how interest is quoted to borrowers is likely to be resisted by borrowers because as noted above interest calculated in arrears would not be known until the end of an interest period which would not be very helpful to borrowers who have come to rely on knowing their interest rates prior to their accrual that being said depending on how repayment requirements are structured there may be little difference between in arrears and in advance structures in the long run the guide to sofr points out that any economic difference between in arrears and in advance conventions depends on whether interest rates happen to be trending up or down over a given period how frequently payments are made although in any given period borrowers and lenders may either gain or lose from one structure relative to the other any movement in rates not reflected in the current interest period in an in advance rate can be paid in the following period on average any differences will therefore tend to net out over the life of a loan if it lasts more than a few years in other words the arrc seems to tell both lenders and borrowers not to be too worried about the difference about in arrears and in advance interest calculations for anything except rather short term borrowings of course that means that both borrowers and lenders may have grounds to worry about short term borrowings but the story about how usd libor s replacement will be calculated does not end with a decision as to averaging and calculation of interest in arrears or in advance there is also a question whether interest should be calculated on a compound simple or hybrid basis compound simple or hybrid the arrc s guide to sofr observes that simple interest conventions may seem easier but that compounded interest would more accurately reflect the time value of money simple interest is the daily amount of interest accrued on a principal amount cumulatively determined at the end of an interest period compound interest is a convention whereby the interest accrued on each day during an interest period is added to principal and bears interest on succeeding days at the stated interest rate either way the arrc notes that the difference between the two concepts is typically quite small at lower interest rates and over short periods of time the guide to sofr discusses how any differences in return to a lender from an in advance approach may be minimized by a hybrid approach in an interest rollover approach payments are set in advance but any amount by which interest is less than it would have been paid in arrears is payable at the end of the next interest period in a principal adjustment approach payments would be set in advance but interest would accrue and be payable in arrears the remaining principal on the loan would vary depending on the amount of interest that is payable both of these approaches can give borrowers advance notice of payment amounts that will be due as would traditional usd libor of course neither of these hybrid approaches to in advance quotations of usd libor would necessarily work easily for a borrower with embedded operational issues or for a borrower who has attempted to fully hedge its position with a swap or cap any differences between a simple and compound interest rate can according to the arrc be accounted for by adjusting the rate or margin at the end of the day the choice between interest rate conventions to be applied is a decision between counterparties and would entail investments to update systems in order to accommodate a compounded rate as counterparties to loans of course borrowers will want to know i whether their lenders are calculating interest as simple interest on a compound basis or on a hybrid basis ii how the applicable conventions affect interest payable by the borrowers and iii whether adjustments can be made by the lenders to accommodate their borrowers where are we remaining issues as we noted above whether interest is calculated on a compound simple in arrears or in advance basis may have little effect on interest calculated over relatively short periods of time particularly if rates are low but that is not very helpful in making decisions as to longer term transactions in higher rate environments in addition there are legal issues lurking around the end of libor that are starting to come into focus all of this leaves us asking exactly where are we now in our long good bye to libor would credit sensitive rates csrs help solve the in advance in arrears simple and compounding interest issues raised above upon review of publicly available agreements the loan syndications and trading association lsta said recently it believed that the loan markets have adopted a variety of alternative responses to libor s phase out the most common structures being i sofr compounded in advance most often used in adjustable rate mortgages ii sofr simple or compound in arrears most often used in floating rate notes and interest rate derivatives iii forward looking term sofr which is trying to develop and iv adoption of csrs not sofr the problems in creating a robust sofr in advance or forward looking sofr items i and iii above and borrowers anticipated resistance to sofr in arrears item ii above mean that the first three alternative interest approaches identified by lsta may not provide a lot of hope to borrowers but the development of csrs item iv above may provide some light at the end of the libor tunnel lenders have been looking for clearer answers all over the place and perhaps csrs will help as of april 28 2021 the lsta published a form of rider for use with csrs in replacement of libor and thereafter the lsta observed that oan market participants should be able to make educated decisions using appropriate csrs as alternatives to sofr one example of a csr is the bloomberg short term bank yield index bsby in april 2021 bank of america n a announced issuance of 1 billion in six month floating rate bank notes referencing the one month tenor of the bsby saying that it adheres to the international organization of securities commissions principles for financial benchmarks and measures the average yields for u s dollar unsecured funding of global banks as such the rate should be dependable credit sensitive and reflect overnight funding costs for various interest periods in may 2021 the cme group announced the launch of interest rate futures based on bsby thus potentially paving the way for quotation of bsby in advance notwithstanding the fanfare preceding csrs there are substantial questions attending them the arrc initially selected sofr to replace libor due to the substantial credibility associated with sofr in terms of size availability and oversight while csrs may have significant market heft it is unlikely to be close to that of sofr and unless one or more csrs is are endorsed by the arrc financial institutions can be expected to be heavily swayed by the arrc s approval of sofr the arrc has not yet weighed in on csrs but andrew bailey the governor of the bank of england has said while these rates may offer convenience as a short term substitution they present a range of complex longer term risks and while they may remove the reliance on expert judgement they veneer over the fundamental challenges of thin and incomplete markets through the extrapolation of data the ability of such rates to maintain representativeness through periods of stress remains a challenge to which we have not seen adequate answers in short csrs do not seem to provide easy answers to sofr related issues the legal framework while the arrc and financial institutions move inexorably towards the death of usd libor the legal framework within which usd libor has lived has begun to adapt as well in april 2021 new york state became the first state to adopt legislation article 18 c to the general obligations law of new york addressing what are called legacy libor contracts maturing after libor terminates and lacking effective fallback provisions building on language developed by the arrc this new law says that selection of a recommended benchmark replacement constitutes a commercially reasonable replacement of libor and shall not be deemed to impair or affect the right to payment or discharge or excuse performance of a contract no one has any liability for selecting a recommended benchmark replacement or recommended conforming changes similar federal and other state legislation may not be far behind the securities industry and financial markets association has articulated support for such legislation however regardless of the time and expense incurred in connection with adoption of well thought out legislation there is no way to rule out the incurrence of costs and expenses associated with legal issues unearthed in the process of terminating libor the end there is no question that libor will end soon and there are a lot of variables potentially affecting replacement interest rates that borrowers need to understand and to which they should respond we hope that borrowers are using the time available to them to understand their particular situations to talk to their lenders and to adapt their operational systems to a new reality

bloomberg a bipartisan senate group succeeded in finding 579 billion to pay for their infrastructure framework by relying on tried and true budget maneuvers that have yet to be scrutinized by congress s official scorekeepers the spending on roads bridges public transit and other items in the deal is offset by a hodgepodge of revenue raising measures economic impact assumptions and projected savings from eliminating waste it s the result of weeks haggling over where to find hundreds of billions of dollars without reversing the 2017 tax cuts a red line for republicans or increasing levies on households making less than 400 000 a democratic priority the bipartisan deal uses budgetary maneuvers to close the gap by finding the most money from politically palatable sources that both parties can agree to including special municipal bonds selling spectrum and imposing a fee on chemical polluters this deal is the usual host of not wildly innovative plain vanilla pay fors that have been used in the past gordon gray a former senate budget committee aide said there s not a conspicuous tax increase or a conspicuous spending cut reused funding the plan relies on repurposing some funding allocated in already passed legislation as well as factoring in economic growth and associated revenue that would come about as a result of the infrastructure investment the recycled funds include unspent money for broadband and federal unemployment benefits leftover from states that ended early some 300 a week in supplemental jobless payments it all adds up to 125 billion that comes out of covid funding repurposed senator rob portman an ohio republican who was one of the leaders of the negotiations said however that money isn t free said gray now with the right leaning think tank american action forum they want to have benefits without costs but those costs happened at some point the plan also is offset by 58 billion generated by extra economic growth something known in budget circles as dynamic scoring portman called that estimate conservative though he acknowledged the congressional budget office had not completed its modeling of the dynamic impact of the spending on the economy feedback loop every economist has looked at this and said this is not spending on social programs this is spending on long term capital assets that make the economy more efficient and therefore add to the productivity of the country he said it also obviously adds jobs and there s a feedback loop there for revenue but not all economists are as optimistic as the lawmakers saying some figures could be overly rosy that could mean that members of congress may have to find more revenue or agree to deficit finance a portion of the plan if the cbo doesn t agree with their estimates there are some good policies in here i m concerned that they only cover a fraction of the cost marc goldwein senior vice president for the think tank committee for responsible federal budget said a lot of the numbers seem inflated from what i would expect for example the lawmakers are projecting that strengthening federal programs against fraud and waste will raise 72 billion according to a draft of the deal obtained by pbs that s a lot higher than previous estimates goldwein said noting that biden s budget proposal in may projected that so called integrity initiatives would raise 12 billion over five years or 45 billion over 10 tougher irs one of the thorniest issues for lawmakers was how much money could be raised from giving the internal revenue service 40 billion to ramp up audits and enforcement on wealthy taxpayers republicans had pointed to a cbo report from last year that said a 40 billion proposal would generate an additional 103 billion for a net 63 billion democrats had pushed for more the group compromised on a net 100 billion raised which was done in consultation with the cbo portman said the additional money could also help improve customer service at the irs and help the irs deal with bitcoin and digital currencies he said the deal also calls for 100 billion to come from private investment including public private partnerships that money could be used to build private highways or bridges that would also likely mean user fees or tolls for drivers using the new roadways more than half of the bill has already been written but will likely take weeks to finalize portman said 2021 bloomberg l p

you know how the old saying goes just because jimmy jumped off a cliff i ve always told my kids to follow their gut and do what s right regardless of what their friends and peers are doing that s not always on point however there are a lot of folks out there doing stuff we could all take to heart recently i read a paper titled how america invests from the investment management giant vanguard the paper looked at affluent investor households those with 500 000 of vanguard held investments outside any sort of company retirement plan so it would seem this group of roughly 800 000 investors has been doing something right after i delved into the details it was clear to me that these affluent investors made choices and took actions we could all learn from read on for six takeaways that might be helpful to you too affluent investors held roughly 20 of their stocks in companies outside the united states it can be easy to stick with what we know your portfolio may reveal a home country bias unfortunately ignoring the rest of the world can result in a lack of diversification and missed opportunities for potentially bigger returns at every age these investors were using stocks as a long term approach even those in the 55 64 age group retained a robust portfolio of stocks 65 in their portfolios clearly these folks consider stocks as a key component of their portfolios yes stocks are a long term choice and not right for every situation or goal but historically they have outpaced inflation that alone could make them an evergreen holding in yours they aren t making big bets on single companies with all the headlines regarding huge returns of one security or another it can be tempting to make a bet on a single company the data from these investors indicates they haven t succumbed to this particular temptation the average allocation to a single individual security was around 5 while these investors may not see their portfolios quadruple in the very short term they seem to be positioned for the long haul and are avoiding the specific risk associated with putting all their eggs in one company s basket they are mindful of the taxman in these investors portfolios the allocation to fixed income or bond investments within traditional iras was nearly twice that of allocation to those same income producing investments in roth iras clearly this group is cognizant that location of your investments matters the potential to grow an account tax free may have tilted their choice of assets in roth accounts they aren t day trading in recent months we all have read a lot about the uptick of day traders while that approach might work for some and certainly won t for others this group of investors is taking a more staid and proven approach over the five year period surveyed roughly 70 of these investors traded fewer than six days a year these investors are not swayed by headlines if ever there were a testing time for investors it was early last year the onset of the global pandemic turbulent markets and general uncertainty combined to make things well difficult not surprisingly the investors in this survey didn t let the noise deter them in fact the stocks in their portfolios remained stable from december 2019 to june 2020 it doesn t appear that headlines of the day were translating to potential investment missteps emotions in check check furthermore the average equity allocation remained nearly constant no i m not saying to go jump off a cliff however it appears that there are some valuable lessons to be learned from how this group of households is handling their finances how america invests december 2020
the u s federal reserve released an analysis showing that america s largest banks were cutting dividends and buying restrictions showing that lenders were able to meet nearly 500 billion in losses and still meet capital requirements twenty three banks including jpmorgan chase and goldman sachs conducted stress tests on the fed citing the financial damage of some series as a model last day scenarios these included the crash of the u s stock market a sharp decline in economic output and a significant stress on commercial real estate the results released on thursday will pave the way billions of dollars in stock purchases and dividends which bank investors are eagerly awaiting over the past year the federal reserve has undergone three stress tests with various hypothetical recessions and all have confirmed that it is in a position to help restore the banking system continuously said randal quarles vice president of fed supervision annual stress tests can cause the country s largest lenders to incur losses of 474 billion in loans and other positions and are still generated by more than a first tier of high quality working capital or more than double the cet1 capital of risk weighted assets among those based in the u s investment banking groups goldman sachs and morgan stanley suffered the highest success rates in capital testing with declines of 5 9 percent and 4 7 percentage points respectively compared to the 2 4 percentage point drop in the average of the 23 banks that conducted the tests there were u s subsidiaries of foreign banks that had significant u s operations consumer debt has accounted for a smaller share of overall losses than in previous years since most retail customers spent their last year paying off credit cards and other loans in the covid 19 pandemic but the growth in expected losses in commercial and industrial lending has more than offset this decline the losses came from nearly 160 billion in commercial real estate and corporate loans fed limited dividends and banned the purchase of shares when the pandemic broke out last year the central bank released some of these restrictions in early 2021 however they only limited the amount of money that banks could return to shareholders to accumulated earnings from the previous four quarters the fed said so before throw back these limits are also pending the results of the annual stress tests published on thursday which are a condition of the dodd frank financial regulations introduced after the crisis large banks have consolidated government revenues and large revenues generated by trade and negotiations and the level of capital growth has also increased to some extent as a result of reductions in shareholder payments the fed expects banks to wait until monday to review the results of the stress tests before announcing a plan to make new payments to shareholders according to fed officials barclays analysts estimate that the median bank of 20 major institutions will return more than 100 percent of its profits to shareholders next year and the capital will be returned to investors with 200 billion from the tests the fed will prescribe to each bank how much cet1 regulates capital to maintain more than the minimum amount through a so called stress capital buffer the cet1 ratio measured with risk weighted assets is a crucial benchmark for financial stability banks typically aim to keep capital above regulatory minimums

results conference call we re very pleased with our second quarter performance which exceeded our guidance across the board we again benefited from increased demand and investments in it and infrastructure software projects the positive momentum we carried over from q1 into q2 is a validation of our strategy and confirmation of the strategic mission critical nature of a comprehensive product portfolio with growing confidence in the strength of our business and two consecutive quarters of strong results under our belt in fiscal 2021 we are again raising full year guidance for revenue operating margin eps and cash flow i will provide a summary of the second quarter and some comments on how we re executing on our strategy followed by an in depth discussion of our results and outlook by anthony demand for our solutions was again strong in q2 we saw a continuation of improving demand in all markets in which we do business and across nearly every product line as our customers and partners continued to invest in systems built on progress technology to run their businesses as more companies shift to cloud first and mobile first strategy for their applications data and content our chef openedge sitefinity datadirect devtools and moveit products provide key technologies to address their challenges and support their efforts what more s the role of developers continues to grow in importance and complexity within the enterprise our applications development devops and data and infrastructure management products equip developers to develop deploy and manage mission critical applications through their entire life cycle we re proud to serve this critical ecosystem of over 3 million developers who rely on our products for their ongoing in terms of our top line performance in q2 openedge once again led the way as the mainstay of our revenue driven by continued strength among our many isv partners and direct sales customers our other core product saw strength as companies like news and data giant thomson reuters and global shipping company msc made meaningful additional investments in our devtools product while our revenue performance for this quarter was again driven primarily by our core products led by openedge and the ipswitch product moveit and whatsup gold our year over year top line growth was driven primarily by the continued success we re seeing with chef with the tremendous growth in devops and devsecops spaces chef landed and expanded key relationships with marquee customers new customers for our chef products include a competitive win at a major us insurer and several significant renewals and expansions with customers in financial services and manufacturing industries as well as cloud native companies such as yahoo japan rakuten fb and pinterest i m very pleased that we ve already reached the goals we set for expense synergies for chef several months ahead of the timeline we set for the integration when we announced the acquisition our progress to date validates our total growth strategy which i will discuss in detail in a moment before doing so i d like to spend a moment talking about annual recurring revenue and net dollar retention rate as you may recall we introduced arr and net dollar retention rate metric last quarter to provide investors better visibility into the recurring nature of our revenue and to provide more insight into our underlying performance arr of 437 million was up 23 year over year on a constant currency basis driven primarily by chef our net dollar retention rate exceeded 100 this quarter driven again in large part by contributions from chef as well as devtools and openedge these metrics highlight the stability and durability of our business turning to our total growth strategy we re actively evaluating dozens of opportunities in the infrastructure software space as we have discussed in other forums our deal pipeline is very strong although we recognize that the market is competitive and valuations remain high despite these headwinds we are pleased with the size sourcing and breadth of our pipeline with the activity of our corporate development team and with the activity of corporate development team we remain confident that our m a strategy is the right strategy for us i also want to mention that during q2 we took an important step toward improving our competitive positioning in m a in april we completed an offering of 360 million of senior unsecured convertible bonds which further strengthened our balance sheet and made us even more competitive and nimble in our corporate development efforts as it eliminates the uncertainty around financing i want to though that we remain committed to finding the right acquisition opportunity any targets we consider must meet our strict financial criteria and include complementary products with a substantial mix of recurring revenue and high retention rates we have demonstrated that when we deploy capital for an acquisition we maximize free cash flows optimize expenses and margins and drive solid shareholder returns in excess of our cost of capital we remain committed to this strategy because we believe it will allow us to compound shareholder returns well into the future in addition to remaining patient and disciplined with our total growth strategy we are committed to increasing shareholder value to focus capital allocation which balances m a with a shareholder friendly capital allocation strategy when we re not deploying capital for acquisitions we use our significant free cash flow to return value directly to shareholders for example we re one of the few software companies who pay the dividend we also have in place a meaningful share repurchase growth and as anthony will explain upon the execution of the convert we purchased capital calls to minimize the potential dilution to current shareholders consistent with our focus on shareholder value our esg efforts remain very important to us at progress as we recognize their growing importance to our investors we continue to monitor and evaluate new global standards for sustainability metrics measurement and reporting which enhanced our already noteworthy corporate social responsibility program in fact two weeks ago we announced the addition of our new chief inclusion and diversity officer who will lead our inclusion and diversity efforts and programs around the globe i d like to close my formal comments by acknowledging the entire progress team for their superb execution while at the same time preserving the inclusive culture and the positive environment that makes progress a great place to work and i m so proud of the recognition we have received very recently the boston business journal highlighted progress as one of the best places to work in massachusetts this came on the heels of progress being named by forbes magazine as one of america s best midsized employers and for the second time in a row chose progress as the best employer in bulgaria where more than a quarter of our employees are based we received additional awards which we ve highlighted in the investor deck on our website and we re immensely proud to have received a 2021 for our progress for tomorrow corporate social responsibility program in all it was an excellent second quarter another proof point of the success of our total growth strategy we re continuing to execute well and see strong demand across industries product segments and geographies as the world begins to move past covid 19 with that i will let anthony provide the details of our q2 financial performance as well as our outlook for q3 and the remainder of 2021 anthony anthony folger chief financial officer thanks yogesh thanks mike good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining our call q2 was indeed another strong quarter for progress our results reflect the continuation of the improving demand environment we mentioned in q1 and again in q2 we saw stronger than expected results across virtually all of our product lines total revenue for the second quarter was 129 2 million reflecting 26 growth over the year ago quarter and was 6 2 million above the high end of the guidance range we provided back in march on a year over year basis chef is the biggest contributor to our growth however many of our other product lines also contributed to growth most notably our openedge and ipswitch products moveit and whatsup gold in addition we closed the second quarter with approximately 437 million in annualized recurring revenue representing growth of 23 on a constant currency basis and 3 1 on a pro forma basis pro forma results include chef s arr in all periods our q2 growth in arr although not as significant as our q2 revenue growth was still better than expected and primarily driven by our chef openedge sitefinity and devtools products the mission critical nature of the applications we power and our consistent focus on improving the customer experience have resulted in a very stable and durable top line at the end of q2 our trailing 12 month net retention rate was slightly above 100 with improvement coming from multiple products including openedge devtools and chef turning now to expenses our total costs and operating expenses were 79 5 million for the quarter an increase of 16 6 million compared to q2 of 2020 this year over year increase is the result of two primary factors first is the addition of chef to our business which makes up more than half of the year over year increase and second are variable costs such as commissions and bonuses that are associated with our performance on the top line operating income was 49 7 million for the quarter up approximately 26 compared to the year ago quarter and our operating margin was approximately 38 compared to 39 in the year ago quarter on the bottom line our earnings per share of 0 82 for the quarter was 0 08 above the high end of our guidance range and approximately 30 above our earnings per share of 0 63 in the year ago quarter moving on to a few balance sheet and cash flow metrics i ll start with an overview of the convertible notes offering that we completed during the quarter the total offering amount including the option was 360 million the notes carry an interest rate of 1 a five year maturity and with privately negotiated capped call transactions they have an effective conversion premium of 89 88 or 100 of the closing price of our shares on april 8 the net proceeds from the offering and capped call transactions are 306 1 million we utilized 20 million of these proceeds to repurchase shares and then used 83 5 million to repay our existing revolving credit facility after the transaction closed i d also like to mention that our ending debt balance for q2 does not reflect the early adoption of asu 2020 06 the new convertible accounting debt standard because of our november 30 fiscal year end we re precluded from adopting this standard in fiscal 2021 as a result the fair value of the conversion premium on the notes will initially be classified as shareholders equity and over time will flow through our gaap p l as noncash interest expense and at the same time gradually increase the face value of the debt on our balance sheet we expect to adopt asu 2020 06 using the full retrospective method on december 1 2021 and expect the updated standard will have the effect of reducing our gaap net interest expense in our income statement and increasing the carrying value of our convertible debt on our balance sheet to the principal value any unamortized debt issuance costs adoption of the new standard in fiscal 2022 will have no impact on our reported non gaap net income or cash flow from operations we ended the quarter with cash and short term investments of 363 million and having paid down our revolving credit facility during q2 we also have approximately 100 million in untapped capacity for total liquidity in excess of 460 million dso for the quarter was 44 days an improvement of three days compared to q2 of last year adjusted free cash flow was 55 million for the quarter up 17 million or 44 from q2 of last year the increase in free cash flow was driven primarily from increased profitability and improved collections in the quarter as mentioned previously we repurchased 20 million of stock during the second quarter and at the end of q2 at 155 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization i d now like to turn to our outlook for q3 and for the full year 2021 for the third quarter of 2021 we expect revenue between 129 million and 132 million and earnings per share of between 0 81 and 0 83 for the full year 2021 we are increasing our revenue guidance to be between 529 million and 535 million the increase is largely due to q2 strength and our confidence in the remainder of the year we are raising our operating margin outlook to be approximately 39 an increase of 100 basis points from our prior guidance we are projecting adjusted free cash flow to be between 158 million and 162 million an increase of 2 million to 3 million from our prior outlook and we are increasing our guidance for earnings per share to be between 3 46 and 3 50 with the increase driven by continued top line strength and confidence in our ability to manage costs our annual eps estimate contemplate the tax rate of 20 to 21 and approximately 45 million shares outstanding with no additional share repurchases for the rest of 2021 in closing we re thrilled with our q2 results and the resurgence of our that our business has demonstrated we re well positioned for the balance of 2021 and feel we can continue to execute our total growth strategy with great results with that i d like to open the call for q a questions and answers operator we ll take our first question from ken wong with guggenheim securities please go ahead ken wong guggenheim securities analyst great thanks for taking my question and a solid quarter guys i guess the first thing i m not sure if yogesh or anthony just more sense for either of you guys but you highlighted chef tracking ahead of schedule on both growth and profitability just wondering kind of anything you ve seen in the last couple of quarters that would potentially steer you in the direction of maybe fueling a little more growth or potentially kind of digging in and extracting more leverage any color there would be great yogesh gupta chief executive officer so i ll start ken thank you i ll have anthony follow up from our perspective as we said we ve actually accomplished the expense synergies that we were targeting with the chef acquisition and we of course originally the target was that we would get to that get to those synergies by end of this fiscal year we ve gotten to them sooner from our perspective going forward ken as you know our overall business continues to be flattish that s where we characterize it and we might have some times when we do a little bit better than flat and sometimes when you do a little bit worse than flat but in general it is a flattish business i don t think that over the long haul at least at this point we see any reason to change that we are tremendously confident of the way the rest of the year is shaping up but i think that s about all i would like to say on that topic and anthony i don t know whether you have something to add anthony folger chief financial officer yes no i think that s right yogesh i think we ve kind of been on the positive side of flattish this year which we d certainly prefer to be on that side and chef has certainly been a contributor to that but as have some of our other products like openedge and some of the ipswitch products so i think we re continuing to execute our plan with chef it s a really good quality asset it s got some growth characteristics it s ahead of plan on profitability i wouldn t say that we re necessarily deviating in any way with what we had originally set out to do there ken wong guggenheim securities analyst got it okay super helpful and then perhaps just wanted to dive in a little bit on your net revenue retention seeing that coming above 100 that s quite positive a nice step up from last quarter should we think that that particular metric has a lot of volatility or just any color on what you think kind of the right range is for that number yogesh gupta chief executive officer yes it s a good question ken we ve been pretty consistently let s say in i would say 97 to 100 there hasn t been a lot of volatility maybe it s been improving a bit over the past couple of years so i think you re right the way we calculate it it is a trailing 12 month number so there won t be a lot of quarter to quarter volatility but obviously if the trend changes i think that will be apparent in the numbers but on the flip side i think from a business perspective it s been a very deliberate effort even since before i got here to invest in our technology to invest in customer experience and those types of investments are things we re going to continue to do and i think we re seeing some results from that in terms of some slightly better retention rate so i don t expect wild swings in the number and i think we feel pretty good about the investments we ve made to get the number where it is ken wong guggenheim securities analyst got it and then if i could just squeeze in one more and then i ll pass the mic to my peers here your guess just wondering as far as kind of the business or the product segment benefiting from just a return to normal on a macro basis are there any particular areas that you would say are still lagging that we could potentially see some sort of a tailwind as we look to the back half of the year yogesh gupta chief executive officer ken as we ve said right actually the last the first two quarters of this year in the first half we ve seen really outperformance across the entire product portfolio it has been a really sort of interesting to see that as businesses have gotten their head out of the challenges of trying to deal with covid 19 and we started looking forward as to how they want to invest in their longer term it project we ve seen the benefit across the board we are confident that we will continue to see that i don t think there s any particular area that is more or less obviously openedge is our biggest product so from an actual individual dollar perspective it has been the biggest contributor but overall across the board we are seeing interest and then we re seeing interest whether it is in our network management product with whatsup gold as you know one of the competitors has had some security challenges there and that has opened up the market for other products like ours and i think so so just it has been a set of tailwinds around our products as people move to the cloud as people go mobile first they re modernizing their applications and i want to reiterate anthony s point right over the last five years we have talked about the fact that we invest in r d so that our products are ready so that when our customers want to move forward we have our products are available and ready to help them move forward and that investment whether it was in openedge 12 or whether it is in the releases that we do every year with devtools or for now because we do every year with chef and all those things are really our investments in ipswitch products such as moveit and whatsup gold they re all sort of demonstrating that we have kept our product current and made it so that they truly benefit and address the challenges that our customers and users face so i think it s across the board good conditions and good demand for our products i don t think there s any specific area that i would highlight for us ken wong guggenheim securities analyst great thanks a lot guys yogesh gupta chief executive officer thank you ken operator we ll take our next question from daniel ives with wedbush please go ahead daniel ives wedbush analyst thanks and great quarter guys so can you just talk about with chef i mean what surprised you so far because obviously it seems like things coming out of the gate is really working a lot better than maybe even you thought so as you re talking to customers what you re hearing from the field i mean just give us some sort of anecdotal of what you re hearing yogesh gupta chief executive officer sure so i think a couple of really positive surprises i shouldn t say surprises but really sort of positive anecdotes that i want to highlight when one acquires a company like chef chef is an open source product there s a large community out there of open source developers that do a phenomenal job of continuing to innovate in the chef ecosystem and so one of the concerns we had was how would both the community of our customers and the community of that open source community how will they react to progress and on both those fronts we have been very pleased that those communities have embraced progress s taking over chef some of the larger customers who we ve had the pleasure of speaking with i mean they are all really really happy that chef is now backed by a publicly traded software company that we are a profitable business that they know that we invest in r d that we will continue to invest in chef and that we will continue to invest in the open source community as well and so really phenomenally positive things i mean i think by the way just i think one of the saps a very large user of chef i think they publicly put out a blog that says that there are 11 million assets in the cloud and when i say cloud i really mean plural cloud for sap they are in every cloud you can imagine including sap zone and so there are i think like five or six different clouds they re managing 11 plus million assets and they have really really been excited about the fact that that progress acquired chef so i think to me that part has been really positive and i think the open source community i think we had an open source community event just about a month ago phenomenal success the open source contributors are continuing to contribute aggressively so i think dan i m really happy both on the sort of customer facing side as well as on the product side the last part that i want to touch on is and i know that this is this quite often is ignored in the end because our people that make this happen and the team that has come over from chef and the team that we have at progress that is working with them and the combined teams the new joint chef team and progress that has done an amazingly wonderful job across the board so i think to me it s just been a very very positive experience for us and that has allowed us to do things like we said get to the synergies continue to do well on both customer retention as well as winning new customers and so on daniel ives wedbush analyst now let me ask the question does this set a pretty high bar for anthony and the m a team to make sure they continue to match success on the next one because that s what i m feeling i mean for the next one i feel like the bar is pretty high is there a little more pressure on anthony and team anthony folger chief financial officer yes the good news is dan i think we will i think that we ve got jeremy segal leading the m a group and jeremy is fantastic i think the entire team is disciplined around what the requirements are and sort of what the financial criteria are for us to close on a deal and so i think the company is aligned around it and i think we ll be patient we will find the right asset and the team has done a great job really building out the pipeline and so our ability to source the number of companies we are tracking there s just been dramatic improvement in all of that over the past 12 months so the bar is high but i think we ve certainly got the team to get over it daniel ives wedbush analyst great thanks again yogesh gupta chief executive officer thank you dan operator we ll take our next question from anja soderstrom with sidoti company please go ahead anja soderstrom sidoti company analyst hi thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on another great quarter i have a follow up on the chef success how much of that do you think is attributed to chef specific drivers rather than your playbook being more refined having done other acquisitions before chef yogesh gupta chief executive officer i think anja there are two aspects on the expense synergy side and getting to them as quickly as we did that is obviously our core competence i mean we have refined that we did ipswitch we did a really good job with that we ve continued to refine it since and we were able to do it with chef as well and get it done faster so i think that s what we bring to the table i think there s also a core competence at progress around certain interesting areas like how we do marketing and demand and so on and so forth that said i think the chef team itself is really remarkably good and strong and they have done a great job and it s in a good market i mean the devops and devsecops market is a market that is growing is a market where we see continued demand it is a market where as people move to the cloud and try to deploy their mission critical systems in the cloud they need products like chef and we have an amazing product so i think it s a combination of things anja i think we at progress can take some pride that you re bringing some things to it and i think the folks that came over from chef can take pride that they are bringing something to the table and we happen to also have an asset in a really good market so i think it s an all around being a really good asset for us anja soderstrom sidoti company analyst okay thank you and also in terms of the m a environment how has that changed over the past couple of months like with sort of a more worrying about the inflationary environment and things like that has that affected the m a pipeline at all yogesh gupta chief executive officer i m not sure i understood the last part of your question anja what part of the environment anja soderstrom sidoti company analyst no so the if there s going to be a more sustainable inflationary environment is that affecting your m a pipeline at all and how has it evolved over the last couple of months yogesh gupta chief executive officer yes so i think as we said earlier the valuations continue to be high and so what that means is that we continue to be disciplined and it s kind of an interesting thing this is one of the reasons why we feel confident about our strategy we have a strong pipeline and we have a team that is doing a great amount of deal flow and continuing to nurture and grow that pipeline and at the same time as anthony mentioned with a leadership team that is truly disciplined around making sure that we stick to our criteria and that we deliver the shareholder returns that our investors expect from us and i think that s really the key so we will continue to be patient we will look for the right asset and we will make sure that we when we find the right assets that we execute on it with the same level of rigor that we have with chef lately and ipswitch before that anja soderstrom sidoti company analyst okay thank you and then just last one is there anything you can call out in terms of the performance in terms of the different geographic regions you are serving yogesh gupta chief executive officer yes so again we saw strong performance across geographies i think if there is if you think about it the us i think is actually probably in the best shape when it comes to moving beyond covid i think europe is coming along i think parts of asia pacific are still a little bit behind in terms of timing and i think latin america is probably the slowest to recover because i mean you i m sure everyone has heard the challenges in brazil and brazil is the single largest technology market in latin america for progress so i think but overall i think if we look across the board i think we see improvements happening everywhere anja soderstrom sidoti company analyst okay thank you that was all for me yogesh gupta chief executive officer thank you anja operator we ll take our next question from mark schappel with benchmark please go ahead mark w schappel benchmark analyst hey guys yogesh gupta chief executive officer hey mark mark w schappel benchmark analyst thanks for taking my question and nice job again on the quarter yogesh starting with you with respect to the openedge strength in the quarter was it principally driven on the isv side of the business yogesh gupta chief executive officer again mark on both sides of course isvs had a continued strength as well but even the direct side of the business it s an interesting thing mark what is happening i think businesses that we are recognizing that they have a their mission critical applications sitting in on a platform that is truly a lowest cost platform the most efficient platform and a platform that we have continued to evolve and keep modern and so what we re seeing is i think to some degree i think actually covid made people look at their sort of investments and say where is it that have investments that are truly delivering great results and maybe we should do a little bit more with that so we re seeing both direct and isvs of course isvs are doing well so that s always wonderful but we re also seeing strength in direct mark w schappel benchmark analyst okay great thanks and then shifting to chef if i recall correctly when it was acquired it was a mid single digit grower and based on the good 2q results is it fair to assume that the chef continues to grow at least that rate yogesh gupta chief executive officer as you know mark go ahead anthony anthony folger chief financial officer no i was just going to say yes we don t break it out separately but i said the trend line really hasn t changed chef continues to perform well and so on a year over year basis i don t think we ve seen a change in the trend line there mark w schappel benchmark analyst okay super and then shifting gears to datadirect very little commentary about datadirect if at all in the prepared remarks any color on that business that maybe you could add so for example renewals coming in as planned yogesh gupta chief executive officer absolutely yes business is performing very much as planned as you know mark with datadirect there are the quarters are lumpy because of the fact that there are multiyear contracts with large isvs right and so in that sense this was a relatively straightforward quiet quarter it did well but nothing to sort of highlight one way or the other we by the way in q1 right we had actually won a couple of new customers on the direct side on the direct enterprise customers the datadirect which was a positive surprise and we talked about it this quarter was just a normal pretty straightforward quarter down the middle mark w schappel benchmark analyst okay great that s all from me thanks good job again yogesh gupta chief executive officer thank you again mark appreciate it operator we ll take our next question from ittai kidron with oppenheimer please go ahead ittai kidron oppenheimer analyst thanks guys great quarter very nice performance there i just had one question for you anthony on the free cash flow great quarter great performance there but your annual guidance suggests a big deceleration here in the second half of the year so help me think about the puts and takes of your annual free cash flow guide anthony folger chief financial officer yes ittai that s a great question the free cash flow in the quarter was really strong and obviously for the first half of the year we ve delivered about 102 million in free cash flow which is a heck of a lot further along than we thought we would be and a little bit of that is sort of better collection activity and i think when we look out to the back half of the year we re probably a little bit more cautious assuming that we may get back to things like travel and get back into the office a little bit so we felt comfortable taking that guide up a little bit but probably also holding a little bit back just wanting to see how much of the travel comes back and how much of the in office operating expenses come back so if it s not sort of a linear move maybe with margin or something like that i think that s really the reason why ittai kidron oppenheimer analyst got it so it sounds like you re expecting i guess margins to you actually raised your outlook on margin actually for the use of to 39 it doesn t sound like you re modeling much in your assumptions as a decline in operating margin in the second half of the year anthony folger chief financial officer yes no not from where we are now perhaps a little bit relative to where the back half of 2020 margins shook out ittai kidron oppenheimer analyst got it very good thanks anthony folger chief financial officer thank you operator ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today s question and answer session at this time i d like to turn the conference back to yogesh gupta for any additional or closing remarks yogesh gupta chief executive officer thank you thank you for joining our call today i m genuinely excited about our performance in q2 and i m pleased to share our confidence in the outlook for the rest of 2021 with you i m especially proud of the dedication of our entire organization and their continued hard work which really positions us well as we continue to execute our total growth strategy i look forward to talking to you all soon thanks again and goodbye operator duration 45 minutes call participants michael micciche vice president of investor relations yogesh gupta chief

kohl s macy s and nordstrom were all moving higher what happened shares of department store stocks including macy s m 2 54 kohl s kss 5 84 and nordstrom jwn 0 05 were all moving higher this week as a number of news items pointed to the economic reopening reaching full speed as some states removed all of their covid 19 related restrictions additionally several analyst reports showed consumer spending picking up at mall and apparel stores and the broader gains in the stock market were good news for cyclical stocks like these as well as of the market close on thursday kohl s and nordstrom were each up 11 9 through the week while macy s had tacked on 9 8 so what first off amazon prime day seemed to light a fuse under the retail sector the two day shopping extravaganza held on june 21 22 this year has become a shopping event for most major retailers they compete to after discounts knowing that consumers are lurking for deals much as they are on black friday and cyber monday data from edison trends showed that sales at amazon were up 32 from last year likely indicating a lift at other retailers as well of the retailers it tracked it found that kohl s grabbed a 0 7 share of spending on prime day not too bad considering amazon dominates the event kohl s partnership with amazon which includes accepting amazon returns and having amazon shop in stores may also give it a benefit from the e commerce giant s success on prime day prime day is an online shopping event of course but brick and mortar traffic is key for all three department store chains that s why the stocks have benefited from the reopenings last week california and new york both removed all covid 19 restrictions and several other states have taken steps to ease or lift them entirely that should be a boon to shoppers eager to hit stores again and indeed ubs said channel checks found that retail traffic was stronger than expected analyst jay sole said he expected strong results from most retailers in q2 and q3 bank of america also said in a research report on thursday that clothing stores were booming for the week ended june 19 sales were up 36 from the same week in 2019 or 13 percentage points better than the week before meanwhile sales at department stores surged 25 percentage points from the previous week for a 16 improvement from 2019 that s the highest mark for department stores since the start of the pandemic with the exception of a brief spike around the holiday season other analysts echoed those findings the economic reopening is not the only tailwind for department stores either pent up demand for clothes as americans return to work and social functions should also help drive sales at these chains since apparel is their biggest category now what while kohl s macy s and nordstrom should report strong results over the next few quarters the stocks are already trading more or less where they were before the pandemic started meaning upside potential may be limited from here kohl s and macy s are both up from the beginning of 2020 while nordstrom is down 13 after fading following its earnings report last month the companies also face other challenges the mall ecosystem may never return to its pre pandemic level as some percentage of shopping has shifted to e commerce permanently and traffic draws like movie theaters face their own challenges macy s also counts on international tourists for about 4 of its sales which will be hampered until europe and other parts of the world overcome the virus for now these companies are likely to see strong results with the reopening in full effect but the structural challenges they faced before the pandemic still remain

washington reuters president joe biden and top white house officials hailed a bipartisan preliminary infrastructure agreement as proof that washington and even american democracy itself could deliver tangible results despite huge partisan divides but securing the deal which delivers a fraction of the investment he initially proposed required the democratic president to make big sacrifices and its passage through congress was thrown in doubt later thursday after senate minority leader mitch mcconnell criticized a two track plan to pass a second spending bill later the bipartisan framework is valued at 1 2 trillion over eight years 579 billion of which is new spending biden insists he will continue to fight for his priorities including what he calls human infrastructure and more funding for environmental programs in the separate democrats only bill and insisted he would not sign one package without the other here s how the compromise infrastructure bill agreed by the senators thursday compares to what was initially proposed transportation infrastructure the compromise hammered out by the g 21 group of republican and democratic senators includes 312 billion in new funding for roads bridges public transit and electric vehicle infrastructure roughly half the 621 billion that biden sought in the american jobs plan proposal he unveiled in march one area that saw a big drop from the original plan was public transit now slated to see a 49 billion bump in funding compared to the 85 billion initially proposed passenger and freight rail a huge personal priority for biden who has logged more than one million miles on amtrak is slated to receive 66 billion in additional funding down from the 80 billion earmarked in the initial proposal the biggest drop came for electric vehicle technology where biden had proposed investing 174 billion but the new plan calls for just 15 billion after rebates were eliminated broadband biden has made increasing internet access for all americans a top priority especially given the huge gaps exposed during the pandemic when many low income americans and those in rural areas had trouble working and learning from home the compromise proposal calls for increased spending of 65 billion on broadband infrastructure down from the 100 billion initially proposed by the president environmental remediation biden had vowed to replace 100 of the nation s lead pipes and service lines and his aides say that will still happen but the overall amount earmarked for environmental remediation dropped to 21 billion from 111 billion in the initial proposal left on the cutting room floor are billions that biden had hoped to invest in modernizing america s drinking water wastewater and stormwater systems human infrastructure missing completely from the proposal is 400 billion in funding for medicaid to fund home care for the elderly and disabled and some 200 billion to create free universal pre kindergarten and expand other childcare services affordable housing biden s initial proposal also included 213 billion to produce preserve and retrofit more than 2 million affordable places to live he will have to fight to get that money included in the democrats only budget package pay fors one of the starkest differences is who will pay for it all while biden pledged to increase corporate income taxes to fund infrastructure republicans drew a line in the sand the new deal pulls together a patchwork of increased irs enforcement selling off petroleum reserves redirected funds from unused unemployment insurance benefits and municipal bonds among other things reporting by andrea shalal and heather timmons editing by richard pullin

using cheap asian electronic modules by jim rowe usb power delivery chargers left to right the comsol cowcc30wh xy pds100 belkin f7u060au this article describes some low cost modules that have appeared recently to take advantage of the dramatic growth in usb capability especially in the area of power delivery pd this assortment includes pd chargers cables and cable adaptors while a follow up article will look at trigger or decoy modules used to configure the chargers plus usb pd testers as mentioned in my recent article on the usb explosion june 2021 siliconchip com au series 367 one of the application areas of usb which has grown dramatically of late is the delivery of dc power when usb first appeared in the late 1990s it could provide just 5v of power at up to 100ma for a low power device or up to 500ma for a high power device like a usb hard disk drive but as the data transfer capabilities of usb were expanded via usb 2 0 usb 3 0 and finally usb c the power delivery capabilities were expanded as well for an in depth discussion of how usb pd works see the article on that topic starting on page 36 of this issue we ll give a quick summary here before moving on to describe the modules usb 3 0 kept the 5v supply voltage but raised the high power current level to 900ma allowing a downstream device to receive up to 4 5w rather than just 2 5w when the usb pd power delivery specification was finalised in 2012 42 silicon chip a device could receive 5v at up to 1 5a or 7 5w of power via a standard type a to type b usb cable the smaller usb c 24 pin connectors appeared in 2014 and when the usb pd specification was further revised in 2014 2016 and 2017 they increased the power delivery voltage and current levels as well now devices can request power at either 5v 9v 12v 15v or 20v and can draw up to 5a corresponding to 100w with a 20v supply and since the usb pd 3 0 revision of 2017 devices can also take advantage of the programmable power supply pps protocol which allows variation of the supply voltage in 20mv steps this expands the possible usb pd applications dramatically and that s why we re seeing so many low cost modules designed to take advantage of this increased flexibility how usb pd works as mentioned earlier this is described in detail on page 36 but there are some points that we can add here and we will also summarise the basics of usb pd negotiation fig 1 the usb pd system consists of five elements a primary dc power source a usb pd manager with a downstream facing port dfp a usb c cable a trigger circuit fitted with an upstream facing port ufp and finally the power sink the usb pd manager element could be combined with the primary dc source and the trigger circuit may also be combined with the sink australia s electronics magazine siliconchip com au essentially usb pd is made possible by some of the extra contact pins in a usb c connector specifically the cc1 a5 and cc2 b5 pins which are designated the configuration channel cc pins the notional arrangement is shown in fig 1 initially a usb pd capable power supply sets its vbus output voltage to 5v it also ties each of the cc pins of its output downstream usb c connector to a logic high level via a pull up resistor rp with the value of rp chosen according to the supply s current capacity devices designed to receive their power from the usb c connector are fitted with a pull down resistor rd connected between one of the cc pins and ground the value of rd is chosen to indicate the current level wanted by the device as a result when a cable from the device is plugged into the usb c connector the voltage drop on one of the cc lines indicates to the host that a load or sink device has been connected the orientation of the usb c plug in the connector the current available from the host supply there is then an exchange of data packets between the supply and the load sink via the cc line using dc coupled bmc biphase mark code or differential manchester encoding this allows the load device to indicate the supply voltage it wants and then the supply to change its output to the requested level if it can do so as mentioned above if the supply supports the pps protocol the voltage can be adjusted in 20mv increments this negotiation can only occur if the load device is connected to the supply via a usb c connector and matching cable it won t work if a type a using usb pd for fast charging even before the usb pd specification was released in 2012 various firms associated with the burgeoning mobile phone market worked out ways to use usb sockets for fast charging mobile phone batteries examples are qualcomm which had developed its quick charge qc protocol motorola with its turbopower protocol and huawei with its supercharge sc protocol perhaps because of the widespread application of these protocols the various revisions of usb pd gradually usb connector is used because this lacks any cc pins or cable lines the initial usb pd rev 1 specification of 2012 allowed a device connected to a host power supply via usb 2 0 3 0 type a and type b connectors to negotiate a higher voltage than 5v eg 12v or 20v using a binary fsk signal on the vbus line but this approach was deprecated when usb pd rev 2 0 was released in 2014 so most usb pd power supplies can only deliver 5v or perhaps 12v via their usb type a downstream port or ports note that the usb pd negotiation protocol allows for power to be transferred in either direction from host to device or vice versa for example a laptop or tablet pc can get its battery recharged quickly from a usb pd power pack charger by requesting that the charging be done at 9v 15v or 20v instead of 5v the xy pds100 quick charger this first module is a fast charger that can be configured to give a range embodied them as a result when the usb pd revision 3 0 was released in 2017 including pps programmable power supply it essentially incorporated just about all of the earlier fast charging protocols so that s why the specifications of most of the usb pd trigger modules and fast chargers will claim compatibility with a list of protocols such as pd 2 0 pd 3 0 qualcomm qc3 0 and qc4 huawei scp fcp apple 2 4a samsung afc mediatek pe2 0 and pe3 0 oppo s vooc and so on of output voltages and currents using the standard usb pd protocol the xy pds100 comes in an extruded aluminium case measuring 53 x 46 x 21mm it is available from several internet suppliers including banggood which at the time of writing has it for us 13 10 plus us 3 30 for shipping as shown in the photos the output end of the xy pds100 has a usb type a socket and a usb c socket plus a 3 digit 7 segment led display with 6 5mm high digits and three indicator leds one lights when the output voltage is displayed one when it s showing the current being drawn from the usb c socket and the third when showing the current drawn from the type a socket at the input end there are two sockets one is a small concentric dc socket designed to accept 12 28v dc from a mains power supply and the other a usb c socket marked input pd on the underside of the case the latter input has the legend pd recommended 87w but it seems the xy pds100 is shown at left connected to an xy wpdt trigger unit this trigger unit helps to set the provided charging profile for the input device by outputting a fixed voltage at lower right is the rear of the xypds100 both these photos are shown at approximately life size siliconchip com au australia s electronics magazine july 2021 43 take care when buying usb c cables and adaptors although you will find many low cost usb c cables from vendors on the internet you need to be careful when buying many of them for example quite a few of the low cost cables are really only suitable for providing power and battery charging not transferring data and especially not highspeed data transfer apart from the lines involved in power transfer including the configuration channel lines they might not have any of the data transfer lines except perhaps those for usb 2 0 d and d this applies particularly for cables fitted with a type a plug at one end to be simply an alternative dc input essentially what the xy pds100 does is convert a no frills power supply with an output of 12 28v dc into a smart usb pd battery charger or power source which can respond to the negotiation from a trigger unit to provide one of the standard charging voltage and current profiles so it s basically a programmable switch mode step down dc to dc converter which can provide up to 100w of power at voltages between 5v and 20v from the usb c output or up to 36w of power at voltages between 5v and 12v from the usb type a output and it even includes a three digit led readout displaying the current output voltage and current not bad for a very compact little unit that costs less than 25 because the xy pds100 is a stepdown converter it needs to have a dc input voltage at least 2v higher than the highest output voltage that could be requested so if you only want a maximum of 12v for charging via the type a output an input voltage of 14 15v would be fine but for the full range of voltages required for usb pd fast charging the input voltage will need to be at least 22 23v i was quite happy with the measured performance of the xy pds100 it seems quite compatible with the pd 3 0 protocols and also with the pps vernier adjustment protocol while the xy pds100 is a usb pd manager module needing an external dc supply the remaining devices we re going to look at combine both 44 silicon chip and a usb c plug at the other in fact the presence of a type a plug is a strong indication that a cable is not suitable for high speed data transfer and quite possibly only for power transfer and charging and the power transfer charging will only be possible at 5v since negotiation of a higher supply voltage probably won t be possible this also applies to the many nominal usb c adaptors if these have a usb type a plug or socket at one end that means they are probably only suitable for use in power transfer and charging although they might be ok for low speed and full speed usb functions forming a complete usb pd power source i had some difficulty obtaining them though i ordered a couple of interesting units from a chinese supplier but they didn t arrive and i eventually discovered that they were out of stock i had to get them from local suppliers instead which turned up in a couple of working days but they cost significantly more than the units i had ordered from china the first one is the belkin f7u060au 27w power adaptor this unit cost 39 95 from jb hi fi www jbhifi com au it measures just 51 x 60 x 31mm and weighs 50g the unit is pictured in the rightmost photo at the start of this article it has a two pin mains plug on one end and a usb c socket on the other end that s it it s just an elongated version of the familiar usb plugpack the inscription on the plug end advises that it was designed in california and assembled in china when i tried it out with a couple of different trigger units i found that although it would register as a pd 3 0 device it would only provide a choice of three output voltages 5v 9v or 12v the two lower voltage settings can provide up to 3a of current while the 12v setting can provide up to 2 25a so the power rating of 27w only applies when the unit provides 9v or 12v when it s providing 5v it is really a 15w source of course this would australia s electronics magazine data transfer via the d and d lines assuming those wires are even fitted even if a low cost cable has usb c connectors at both ends that is no guarantee that it is suitable for really high speed data transfer this makes it a bit risky buying these cables via the internet because you can t test them before you buy them in fact if you see one of these cables for less than 15 you can probably assume it s only suitable for power transfer and battery charging usb c cables capable of being used for really high speed data transfer are likely to cost significantly more than that be fine if you only wanted up to 12v and 15 27w the comsol cowcc30wh 30w wall charger this unit cost 39 88 from officeworks www officeworks com au shop it measures 44 x 64 x 40mm and weighs 80g as you can see from the leftmost photo at the start of this article it s very similar to the belkin unit with a two pin mains plug at one end and a usb c socket at the other end the inscription on its plug end simply says made in china when i checked this unit with a couple of different trigger units it only registered as a pd 2 0 device but could provide any of the full five output voltages 5v 9v 12v 15v or 20v as with the belkin unit it could provide up to 3a at 5v or 9v but at 12v it could provide up to 2 5a then at 15v it could provide up to 2a while at 20v it could provide up to 1 5a so it s only a 30w power source for three of the five selectable voltages considering that its price is virtually the same as the belkin unit the fact that it provides a choice of the full five pd voltages and with a nearly consistent power capability of 30w makes it better value for money the range of voltages and currents available from this type of charger means that it could power a wide range of devices including those you might build yourself if each of those devices contains circuitry to negotiate the current and voltage required that means you could siliconchip com au have a small selection of power supplies to power a wide range of devices so in essence these chargers could be the new multi voltage plugpack we all use in future the alogic wcg1x65 anz 65w wall charger the third usb pd wall charger i bought is the alogic wcg1x65 which again is very similar in size to the belkin and comsol units it s slightly smaller measuring 55 x 60 x 35mm and weighs close to 95g this unit also came from jb hi fi at a cost of 74 plus delivery but it is also available from techbuy www techbuy com au another local supplier for 72 70 plus delivery while it is almost twice the price of the other wall chargers it boasts over twice the power capability at 65w it comes with a 2m long usb c charging cable and a tiny 90 x 110mm fourpage quick start guide it also features a white led power indicator just below the usb c output socket when i checked this unit with the same trigger units as before it registered as a pd 3 0 device and could easily be programmed to give any of the five standard pd voltages 5v 9v 12v 15v or 20v and it can provide up to 3a at any of the four lower voltages or up to 3 25a at 20v which is pretty impressive considering its compact size and weight the makers claim that this is a result of using the latest gan charging technology presumably they are taking advantage of the ability of transistors and diodes using gallium nitride gan substrates to operate at much higher voltages and with higher efficiency so if you need a usb pd wall charger capable of supplying up to 65w of power at any of the five pd 3 0 voltage levels the alogic wcg1x65 anz would be the best choice despite its significantly higher cost note that one of the devices that i tried and failed to source from china was the bakeey hc 652ca 65w wall charger which would probably also be a good choice if and when it becomes sc available usb c breakout boards because of the possible problems associated with usb c cables you might be interested in the low cost breakout module or test board shown in the photo below it is available from internet suppliers like banggood for only us 2 10 for a single us 4 80 for a pack of five or us 9 00 for a pack of ten all plus shipping of us 3 30 in each case this module s pcb measures only 25 x 40mm and has a usb c socket mounted at the centre of one of the 40mm sides all 24 of the socket s connections are brought out to two rows of 12 solder pads at the opposite edge of the pcb with one row a1 12 on the top and the other b1 12 underneath the socket s metal frame is also brought out to a further g pad on each side of the pcb a pair of these breakout boards make it easy to test all of the lines and connections in a usb c cable i bought a pack of five but wasn t too impressed with the soldering for the 24 very closely spaced pins of the sockets one of them seemed to have a dry joint or two since it would not be easy to repair these joints manually because of the very close spacing about 0 5mm i decided that the board concerned was throw away material so be warned in the following article we ll be taking a look at some of the low cost usb pd trigger modules that can be used to set the output voltage and current of usb power supplies like the ones described here useful links usb c usb pd siliconchip com au link ab7l quick charge gallium nitride siliconchip com au the alogic wcg1x65 anz 65w wall charger shown enlarged for clarity it registers as a pd 3 0 compliant device and therefore can provide the standard voltages of 5v 9v 12v 15v 20v at 3a or 3 25a for 20v as the output power increases these chargers can become quite costly australia s electronics magazine july 2021

release and related form 8 k available on our investor relations website ir synnex com this conference call is the property of synnex corporation and may not be recorded or rebroadcasted without our permission i will now turn the call over to marshall marshall marshall witt chief financial officer thanks liz and thank you to everyone joining us for today s call before getting into the details of the quarter s performance i would like to remind everyone that the year ago quarter was the first full quarter impacted by the covid 19 pandemic given the significant negative impact that this had on our fiscal q2 2020 results the year over year comparisons that we discuss today are greater than normal in magnitude our fiscal q2 results came in well ahead of our expectations fueled by continued strong demand environment total revenue for q2 was up 31 year over year to 5 9 billion gross profit increased 20 or 55 million compared to the prior year to 329 million gross margin was 5 6 down from 6 1 in the prior year primarily due to product mix total adjusted sg a expense was 159 million or 2 7 of revenue down 14 million compared to the year ago quarter primarily due to covid related expenses in the prior year non gaap operating income was 170 million improved by 68 million or 67 versus the prior year and non gaap operating margin was 2 9 up 62 basis points year over year q2 interest expense and finance charges were approximately 23 million and the effective tax rate was 25 both in line with our expectation total non gaap income from continuing operations was 109 million up 44 million and improved by 68 over the prior year and non gaap diluted eps from continuing operations was 2 09 up from 1 26 in the prior year now turning to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 1 7 billion and debt of 1 6 billion accounts receivable totaled 2 5 billion down 12 year over year and inventories totaled 2 7 billion flat from the prior year our cash conversion cycle for the second quarter was 26 days 17 days improved from last year the decrease was driven by dso improvements and better inventory turns cash generated from operations was approximately 280 million in the quarter and including our cash and credit facilities we had approximately 3 1 billion of available liquidity we are pleased to report that our board of directors have approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0 20 per common share for the current quarter the dividend is expected to be paid on july 30 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on july 16 2021 before moving to our q3 outlook let me provide a brief update regarding our proposed merger with tech data since our announcement in march we have established the capital structure for the planned merger through a new 5 billion credit facility and are on track with the debt financing for the merger now moving to our outlook for fiscal q3 revenue is expected to be in the range of 4 95 billion to 5 45 billion this estimate does not contemplate any impact related to the customer consignment change that we have previously spoken about at this time we no longer expect the change to occur within our fiscal 2021 non gaap net income is expected to be in the range of 99 9 million to 110 4 million and non gaap diluted eps is expected to be in the range of 1 90 to 2 10 per diluted share based on weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 51 9 million our q3 non gaap net income and non gaap diluted eps guidance exclude the after tax cost of 7 million or 0 13 per share related to the amortization of intangibles and 5 3 million or 0 10 per share related to share based compensation please note that these statements of our third quarter and fiscal 2021 expectations are forward looking and that our actual results may differ materially i will now turn the call over to dennis dennis polk president and chief executive officer thank you marshall and thank you to everyone joining our call i want to start off with a special thank you along with much appreciation to our associates for delivering very strong results in q2 with our quarter starting off with the tech data merger announcement there was a potential of this news being a distraction to our daily efforts as expected though our team executed very well provided exceptional service to our customers and continued to expertly manage through the ongoing dynamics of our industry and the pandemic for q2 our results came in above our internal expectations due to continued demand for remote capability digital transformation the ongoing recovery of office and data center it purchasing and overall above market growth essentially every product category we participate in saw strength in the quarter most notably notebooks chromebooks cloud security services networking and collaboration our manufacturing business also performed very well with results above the high end of our internal forecast the demand came from across most all our customer segments with smb and public sector leading the way from a geographical perspective all regions were at expectations or better regarding our proposed merger with tech data everything is going well as marshall mentioned we are set up for an effective financing of the transaction our proxy has been filed and our shareholder meeting will be held next week and from a regulatory standpoint we have received clearance from a number of governmental authorities and expect the rest to process through normal course as would be expected the covid pandemic has led to review delays in some countries we still believe our transaction will close in the second half of 2021 reflective of the typical six to eight months announced to close time frame for a deal of this size and complexity since the announcement of the transaction we have continued to receive internal and external support for the merger the integration work we have performed since the announcement albeit limited due to regulatory rules further supports the strategic benefits of this deal that we discussed in march we look forward to sharing more when the transaction closes later this year moving to our outlook our priority remains on the health and safety of our associates as we enter the second half of calendar 2021 we are thankful for the effectiveness of the vaccines and are hopeful that all who desire one will have access as soon as possible overall we are optimistic about the it spending environment given the current strong demand the expectation of more geographies reopening and the resumption of on premise enterprise it projects we believe these factors represent potential tailwinds for our business specific to our q3 guidance we are planning for continued growth in our distribution business but have added a bit of conservatism in the forecast this quarter given the widely reported supply chain component challenges considering our current backlog still very strong we know the business is there it just remains to be seen when it will transact for our manufacturing business we use the low end of our internal range for forecasting purposes this low end for manufacturing will reflect the decline over q3 last year this is a result of the very strong prior year quarter the over forecast achievement in q2 of this year and the overall unpredictable nature of this business taking all these factors into account we believe our q3 view reflects a balanced outlook which incorporates all the various puts and takes of the current environment hopefully a conservative view and as always we ll strive to do better in closing i d like to thank our customers and vendor partners for putting their trust in us to assist in growing their businesses and as always our outstanding team of associates whose daily efforts are the reason for our success i am confident with ongoing execution we will continue to progress on our stated strategy of improving our core business driving organic growth increasing our value added services and products and successfully closing our proposed merger with tech data with that i d like to open up the call for questions questions and answers operator we request you to limit yourself to one question and one follow up first question from the line of ruplu bhattacharya of bank of america your line is open ruplu bhattacharya bofa analyst hi thank you for taking my questions my first question is on margin performance marshall can you help us bridge the operating margin between fiscal 1q and fiscal 2q sequentially looks like you had stronger than expected revenue performance i mean revenues were up 900 million plus sequentially just it looks like operating margins were down about 26 bps how much of that was fx how much of that was mix related and how much of that was covid related costs if you can just help us bridge that margin performance dennis polk president and chief executive officer sure marshall witt chief financial officer yeah most of it was just mix related in terms of the sequential relationship from q1 to q2 if you look at the underlying performance of the various sectors of our business they all did very well it was a good overall balanced contribution from all locations and as dennis said in his remarks across the spectrum of products and end markets dennis polk president and chief executive officer and ruplu i would just add we performed very well now through q1 and q2 so in q2 we had some compensation accruals we had to make to recognize that strong performance by the team ruplu bhattacharya bofa analyst okay okay thanks for the details on that maybe for my follow up can you talk a little bit about the higher consignment model transition did i hear correctly that that transition will not happen in 3q or 4q of this year and when it does happen in fiscal 22 what is the expectation for revenues per quarter impact marshall witt chief financial officer ruplu you re right for 2021 as i said in my prepared remarks we don t anticipate a transacting taking place this year as we think about next year we will have to face that when we get there as we ve said previously the overall economics on a profit dollar basis assuming ongoing growth in relationship with this customer should not change but the types of services that we provide will change ruplu bhattacharya bofa analyst okay dennis polk president and chief executive officer and just my only follow up ruplu would be we re just staying flexible and assisting our customer in their needs clearly the consignment program is taking longer to execute and when they desire to do so be it whatever time in 2021 we ll help them out at that time ruplu bhattacharya bofa analyst okay great if i can just squeeze in one more just marshall on the on your capital allocation plan i know the transaction is expected to close later this year in the meantime are you do you still have a share repurchase authorization list how much is left on that and just your thoughts on your inorganic growth versus spending on buybacks till that transaction happens marshall witt chief financial officer ruplu yeah right now as we said in our march discussion with you in regards to not only our results but the merger our overall goal right now is to ensure that we keep our leverage ratios appropriate as we enter into the transaction we do have an open repurchase program in place but we anticipate that to be more anti dilutive than it is actually going beyond that so that would be our intent heading into the merger and just in terms of the overall just allocation of dividends we re happy to announce another 0 20 this quarter that won t change as we move forward but we really are thinking about keeping the position of strength we have on a real strong current and long term capital structure really well laid out as we go into the merger ruplu bhattacharya bofa analyst okay thanks for all the details appreciate it marshall witt chief financial officer you re welcome operator next question from the line of vincent colicchio of barrington research your line is open vincent colicchio barrington research analyst yeah in your prepared remarks you talked about most some of the regulatory approvals that have occurred already does that was that most of the approvals what to what extent are approvals remaining in the balance dennis polk president and chief executive officer hi vince this is dennis yeah so we had we have about 20 regulatory approvals to work our way through and i d say at this point we re more than halfway through vincent colicchio barrington research analyst okay thanks for that clarity in terms of supply chain constraints where are the biggest constraints any color would be helpful dennis polk president and chief executive officer yeah really vince across the board yeah it s in client devices constraints networking certainly cpus even displays and some print products so there wasn t a major product category that we serve that has not been affected by supply chain challenges certainly over the last quarter but really frankly over the last 15 to 18 months vincent colicchio barrington research analyst thank you nice quarter dennis polk president and chief executive officer thank you operator next question from the line of jim suva of citigroup investment your line is open jim suva citi analyst thank you in your prepared comments you mentioned about your forecasting and being conservative on the outlook my question is regarding that conservativism is it probably accurate that your lead times and visibility for the demand side is better than expected but you re being more conservative on the ability to procure supply or are you also discounting the demand to some extent dennis polk president and chief executive officer no i d say jim thank you for the question and glad to hear you back covering our account again thank you i d say that it s really more the completion of the product and delivery is what s making us most cautious so the lead time is causing the conservative aspect in our guidance i should say i don t want our investors to oversteer too much on this conservatism that we re placing on our forecast to put a number around it it s about 150 million to 200 million that we reduced from what would be our normal forecast for the higher or elevated challenges in the supply chain that we re experiencing right now as i responded to vince a few seconds ago supply chain challenges have been going on for a good year and a half plus but it s just an elevation in the tightness if you will of slas and everything it takes to get products to our customers we decided to be a little more conservative this quarter to the tune of about 150 million to 200 million jim suva citi analyst great thank you so much for the detail and additional commentary it s greatly appreciated dennis polk president and chief executive officer thank you jim marshall witt chief financial officer thanks jim operator next question from the line of adam tindle of raymond james your line is open adam tindle raymond james analyst okay thanks good afternoon dennis i wanted to start you talked about getting internal and external feedback since announcing the transaction you ve had more time to talk to both vendor partners and to customers i m just wondering if you could double click on feedback from each of those cohorts and how should we think about potential revenue synergy and dissynergy associated with that dennis polk president and chief executive officer yeah adam thank you for the question so what i wanted to first start off with is the positive feedback is from what we classify as our four main constituents our associates our customers our vendors and our shareholders so since our announcement we have received again positive feedback and recognition from all four categories if you will specific to your question regarding our customers and our vendors so our customers are positive because they see us having a larger platform to service all their needs synnex prior to the merger more of a niche from a vendor perspective and a geography perspective but combined with tech data will be able to service customers with all product sets and all geographies so very very positive and consistent feedback from that customer set as a result from a vendor side again positive feedback from the fact that we ll have again a global platform to service vendor needs wherever they want to sell their products and as important we will be combined and able to consolidate our investments to invest where their business is going either an as a service cloud or any other next gen it product adam tindle raymond james analyst okay again i guess i just asked because when tech data acquired avnet ts one of their main competitors talked about 300 million or so of owner share shift as those customers were seeking to diversify just wondering if the investors should expect obviously long term makes a lot of sense but near term any expectations for synergies to the tune of that sort of a magnitude dennis polk president and chief executive officer adam our expectation is to grow the combined business and we know through every acquisition prior and we expect through this acquisition when we service your customer and your vendor partners well you get more business not less and that s what our expectation for this transaction adam tindle raymond james analyst got it and just as a follow up you talked about how a little bit of the integration work that you ve been able to do so far supports the strategic rationale behind this just wondering if you can also maybe double click on that comment particularly any color on from a system standpoint how you re potentially going to decide which will go on as synnex home film system versus tech data s sap more color on integration will be helpful thank you dennis polk president and chief executive officer sure adam thanks so i want to emphasize during this period there is only so much we can do but the discussions we ve been able to have again reiterate and support our thesis for this transaction again for the four constituents i talked about before we also talked about how culturally it was important for the two teams to come together that s been solidified as we ve had discussions with our coworkers at tech data going forward so very very happy about the cultural aspects that are going forward and also to your point about the benefits of the merger from potential cross sell and other aspects good ideas are coming out from those discussions as well but i have to emphasize all preliminary we need to close this transaction and get together and at that point in time i know we ll see all the benefits that we talked about back in march adam tindle raymond james analyst got it thank you very much dennis polk president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question from the line of matt sheerin of stifel your line is open matt sheerin stifel nicolas and company analyst thank you good afternoon wanted to drill down a little bit more on your commentary regarding the demand picture it sounds like it s fairly robust across the board specifically client devices and pcs could you talk about what frankly you re seeing with smb i mean is there the education market continuing to be strong do you still see legs to that pc cycle and then on the infrastructure side i know last quarter you started to see a little bit of a pickup in on prem infrastructure spending are you continuing to see that and is that factored into your guidance dennis polk president and chief executive officer hi matt thanks for the question yeah so you talked about three categories there of our business and all three are positive which is great to be experiencing right now specifically you called out smb certainly that was one of the more challenged areas of our business this time last year as a result of the pandemic and it was frankly from our perspective a slower recovery but in the past few quarters especially q2 we really saw a real strong come back for the smb environment so very encouraged by that and we re hopeful that it continues throughout the rest of the year and beyond regarding state and local and fed business and specific to your educational comment i called out in our prepared remarks public sector was very strong that includes the education part of our business and we don t see that business really changing too much in the coming months and quarters it is affected by the supply chain challenges so we have to factor that but overall our public sector business is very good and then your last point was about enterprise spending again another area that was hit very hard q2 of this year was another quarter that was better than the last quarter there is still not year over year growth across all of our enterprise products but we re starting to see growth in some of them and overall just the that sector of our business had another positive incremental growth than the prior quarters from the pandemic time matt sheerin stifel nicolas and company analyst okay great that was very helpful and then on my follow up regarding your guidance on revenue and net income backing into the gross and operating margin it looks like both will be up sequentially and back to or near the levels they were a couple of quarters ago is that a function of mix issues as well the benefit of mix or anything else going on there marshall witt chief financial officer yeah matt you re exactly right we see mix played a part in q2 and we also see mix probably benefiting some of those margin improvements heading into q3 dennis polk president and chief executive officer yeah matt i would just add we re still not at a point where everything is normal in our business and obviously normal from a pandemic standpoint but as marshall said the mix and the business is definitely on the pathway toward that and our q3 guidance is another step forward matt sheerin stifel nicolas and company analyst understood okay thanks so much operator next question from the line of ananda baruah of loop capital your line is open ananda baruah loop capital markets analyst yeah thanks a lot i appreciate it thanks guys for taking the question and congrats on the strong execution and solid results yeah i guess the first one in my queue it sounds like you guys are anticipating the it spending environment to continue to strengthen and so i guess the first question is are you seeing the component environment tighten further as well and then i have a quick follow up thanks dennis polk president and chief executive officer sure ananda this is dennis so yes we as we talked about in the prepared remarks we are encouraged by it demand overall we talk about a lot that when companies and businesses and even individuals invest in technology product they often get strong returns and we think that s only going to continue going forward as digital transformation and other investments are made by businesses so we re definitely positive about the marketplace that we re in right now specific to your question about components and are they part of the supply chain challenges and tightening that we talked about yes we definitely include components in that category ananda baruah loop capital markets analyst okay and then just the pc business in general it sounds like you guys are continuing to get really good demand and you sound sort of ongoingly optimistic about it some of the monthly data that s come out of taiwan the oem data has been choppy april to may do you see any i guess the question is are you seeing any change sort of in the cadence of demand from pcs in general that s it i appreciate it thanks dennis polk president and chief executive officer sure thank you at this point in time really nothing significant to call out from a cadence perspective we re obviously balancing our comments today against the supply chain challenge we talked about and obviously receiving product and getting to our customers so that s a factor but if you re talking about just overall demand no we feel good about overall demand right now and don t expect any change certainly in the quarter that we re guiding to today ananda baruah loop capital markets analyst that s really helpful thank you guys i appreciate it dennis polk president and chief executive officer thank you operator next question from the line of shannon cross of cross research your line is open shannon cross cross research analyst thank you very much i was curious pricing i realize you passed through pricing but i m wondering what you re seeing in terms of price increases from some of your partners and if you re seeing any hesitancy from a customer perspective due to elasticity of demand and i m thinking more on the it hardware side and then i m curious like from a component perspective just are there any timing issues we need to think about within hive that might impact you given some of the expected increases in commodity prices and then i have a follow up thank you dennis polk president and chief executive officer hi shannon this is dennis so i ll take in reverse order from a hive standpoint no do not seen any challenges necessarily from a pricing standpoint that will affect any aspect of the demand in our business for that segment of our business as far as your overall question certainly we re in an environment where pricing is increasing more than not but we have not seen any major issues as far as the continuation of our sales cycles and working with our reseller customers with their end customers such that it would hurt demand if you will in any way shannon cross cross research analyst okay and then it may be a bigger picture question i know we ve talked a lot about revenue guidance and how you re thinking about it and i know you gave us the parameters of what to think about with regard to supply chain challenges but given how much you have exceeded expectations for last few quarters maybe if you could just walk through some of the puts and takes that you re thinking about as you put together your guidance for the quarter that are beyond that i think you said 150 million 200 million on the supply chain side just so we can have an idea of things to look for that could potentially lead to upside given you mentioned conservative several times in the script thank you dennis polk president and chief executive officer thanks shannon so i ll start off with number one what you just talked about we have about 150 million to 200 million of reduction in our forecast because of our conservatism on the supply chain challenges that s number one number two we talk about the fact that for our manufacturing business internally we have a forecast that has a low and a high we always take the low end and factor that into the numbers we guide to today with you because of the fact that that business is very unpredictable we use the term lumpy hard to predict and so it always makes sense to guide to the low end and enjoying the benefit of performance above that so that s a factor that i think is important for investors to know and that s something we ve been calling out for some time now the third is just overall conservatism in our business we want to make sure we perform well and hit our metrics and so whenever we look at our numbers before we bring them to you and our investors we obviously put a little bit of a discount on that just to make sure that when we produce our numbers at the end of the quarter we meet them shannon cross cross research analyst okay thank you dennis polk president and chief executive officer thank you operator okay and at this time there are no more questions i will turn the call back to dennis polk for closing remarks dennis polk president and chief executive officer very good thank you in closing i want to thank the synnex team for their dedication and efforts we have ongoing confidence in our business and look forward to the eventual combination with tech data stay well thank you operator duration 33 minutes call participants liz morali investor relations marshall witt

results conference call we re very pleased with our second quarter performance which exceeded our guidance across the board we again benefited from increased demand and investments in it and infrastructure software projects the positive momentum we carried over from q1 into q2 is a validation of our strategy and confirmation of the strategic mission critical nature of a comprehensive product portfolio with growing confidence in the strength of our business and two consecutive quarters of strong results under our belt in fiscal 2021 we are again raising full year guidance for revenue operating margin eps and cash flow i will provide a summary of the second quarter and some comments on how we re executing on our strategy followed by an in depth discussion of our results and outlook by anthony demand for our solutions was again strong in q2 we saw a continuation of improving demand in all markets in which we do business and across nearly every product line as our customers and partners continued to invest in systems built on progress technology to run their businesses as more companies shift to cloud first and mobile first strategy for their applications data and content our chef openedge sitefinity datadirect devtools and moveit products provide key technologies to address their challenges and support their efforts what more s the role of developers continues to grow in importance and complexity within the enterprise our applications development devops and data and infrastructure management products equip developers to develop deploy and manage mission critical applications through their entire life cycle we re proud to serve this critical ecosystem of over 3 million developers who rely on our products for their ongoing in terms of our top line performance in q2 openedge once again led the way as the mainstay of our revenue driven by continued strength among our many isv partners and direct sales customers our other core product saw strength as companies like news and data giant thomson reuters and global shipping company msc made meaningful additional investments in our devtools product while our revenue performance for this quarter was again driven primarily by our core products led by openedge and the ipswitch product moveit and whatsup gold our year over year top line growth was driven primarily by the continued success we re seeing with chef with the tremendous growth in devops and devsecops spaces chef landed and expanded key relationships with marquee customers new customers for our chef products include a competitive win at a major us insurer and several significant renewals and expansions with customers in financial services and manufacturing industries as well as cloud native companies such as yahoo japan rakuten fb and pinterest i m very pleased that we ve already reached the goals we set for expense synergies for chef several months ahead of the timeline we set for the integration when we announced the acquisition our progress to date validates our total growth strategy which i will discuss in detail in a moment before doing so i d like to spend a moment talking about annual recurring revenue and net dollar retention rate as you may recall we introduced arr and net dollar retention rate metric last quarter to provide investors better visibility into the recurring nature of our revenue and to provide more insight into our underlying performance arr of 437 million was up 23 year over year on a constant currency basis driven primarily by chef our net dollar retention rate exceeded 100 this quarter driven again in large part by contributions from chef as well as devtools and openedge these metrics highlight the stability and durability of our business turning to our total growth strategy we re actively evaluating dozens of opportunities in the infrastructure software space as we have discussed in other forums our deal pipeline is very strong although we recognize that the market is competitive and valuations remain high despite these headwinds we are pleased with the size sourcing and breadth of our pipeline with the activity of our corporate development team and with the activity of corporate development team we remain confident that our m a strategy is the right strategy for us i also want to mention that during q2 we took an important step toward improving our competitive positioning in m a in april we completed an offering of 360 million of senior unsecured convertible bonds which further strengthened our balance sheet and made us even more competitive and nimble in our corporate development efforts as it eliminates the uncertainty around financing i want to though that we remain committed to finding the right acquisition opportunity any targets we consider must meet our strict financial criteria and include complementary products with a substantial mix of recurring revenue and high retention rates we have demonstrated that when we deploy capital for an acquisition we maximize free cash flows optimize expenses and margins and drive solid shareholder returns in excess of our cost of capital we remain committed to this strategy because we believe it will allow us to compound shareholder returns well into the future in addition to remaining patient and disciplined with our total growth strategy we are committed to increasing shareholder value to focus capital allocation which balances m a with a shareholder friendly capital allocation strategy when we re not deploying capital for acquisitions we use our significant free cash flow to return value directly to shareholders for example we re one of the few software companies who pay the dividend we also have in place a meaningful share repurchase growth and as anthony will explain upon the execution of the convert we purchased capital calls to minimize the potential dilution to current shareholders consistent with our focus on shareholder value our esg efforts remain very important to us at progress as we recognize their growing importance to our investors we continue to monitor and evaluate new global standards for sustainability metrics measurement and reporting which enhanced our already noteworthy corporate social responsibility program in fact two weeks ago we announced the addition of our new chief inclusion and diversity officer who will lead our inclusion and diversity efforts and programs around the globe i d like to close my formal comments by acknowledging the entire progress team for their superb execution while at the same time preserving the inclusive culture and the positive environment that makes progress a great place to work and i m so proud of the recognition we have received very recently the boston business journal highlighted progress as one of the best places to work in massachusetts this came on the heels of progress being named by forbes magazine as one of america s best midsized employers and for the second time in a row chose progress as the best employer in bulgaria where more than a quarter of our employees are based we received additional awards which we ve highlighted in the investor deck on our website and we re immensely proud to have received a 2021 for our progress for tomorrow corporate social responsibility program in all it was an excellent second quarter another proof point of the success of our total growth strategy we re continuing to execute well and see strong demand across industries product segments and geographies as the world begins to move past covid 19 with that i will let anthony provide the details of our q2 financial performance as well as our outlook for q3 and the remainder of 2021 anthony anthony folger chief financial officer thanks yogesh thanks mike good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining our call q2 was indeed another strong quarter for progress our results reflect the continuation of the improving demand environment we mentioned in q1 and again in q2 we saw stronger than expected results across virtually all of our product lines total revenue for the second quarter was 129 2 million reflecting 26 growth over the year ago quarter and was 6 2 million above the high end of the guidance range we provided back in march on a year over year basis chef is the biggest contributor to our growth however many of our other product lines also contributed to growth most notably our openedge and ipswitch products moveit and whatsup gold in addition we closed the second quarter with approximately 437 million in annualized recurring revenue representing growth of 23 on a constant currency basis and 3 1 on a pro forma basis pro forma results include chef s arr in all periods our q2 growth in arr although not as significant as our q2 revenue growth was still better than expected and primarily driven by our chef openedge sitefinity and devtools products the mission critical nature of the applications we power and our consistent focus on improving the customer experience have resulted in a very stable and durable top line at the end of q2 our trailing 12 month net retention rate was slightly above 100 with improvement coming from multiple products including openedge devtools and chef turning now to expenses our total costs and operating expenses were 79 5 million for the quarter an increase of 16 6 million compared to q2 of 2020 this year over year increase is the result of two primary factors first is the addition of chef to our business which makes up more than half of the year over year increase and second are variable costs such as commissions and bonuses that are associated with our performance on the top line operating income was 49 7 million for the quarter up approximately 26 compared to the year ago quarter and our operating margin was approximately 38 compared to 39 in the year ago quarter on the bottom line our earnings per share of 0 82 for the quarter was 0 08 above the high end of our guidance range and approximately 30 above our earnings per share of 0 63 in the year ago quarter moving on to a few balance sheet and cash flow metrics i ll start with an overview of the convertible notes offering that we completed during the quarter the total offering amount including the option was 360 million the notes carry an interest rate of 1 a five year maturity and with privately negotiated capped call transactions they have an effective conversion premium of 89 88 or 100 of the closing price of our shares on april 8 the net proceeds from the offering and capped call transactions are 306 1 million we utilized 20 million of these proceeds to repurchase shares and then used 83 5 million to repay our existing revolving credit facility after the transaction closed i d also like to mention that our ending debt balance for q2 does not reflect the early adoption of asu 2020 06 the new convertible accounting debt standard because of our november 30 fiscal year end we re precluded from adopting this standard in fiscal 2021 as a result the fair value of the conversion premium on the notes will initially be classified as shareholders equity and over time will flow through our gaap p l as noncash interest expense and at the same time gradually increase the face value of the debt on our balance sheet we expect to adopt asu 2020 06 using the full retrospective method on december 1 2021 and expect the updated standard will have the effect of reducing our gaap net interest expense in our income statement and increasing the carrying value of our convertible debt on our balance sheet to the principal value any unamortized debt issuance costs adoption of the new standard in fiscal 2022 will have no impact on our reported non gaap net income or cash flow from operations we ended the quarter with cash and short term investments of 363 million and having paid down our revolving credit facility during q2 we also have approximately 100 million in untapped capacity for total liquidity in excess of 460 million dso for the quarter was 44 days an improvement of three days compared to q2 of last year adjusted free cash flow was 55 million for the quarter up 17 million or 44 from q2 of last year the increase in free cash flow was driven primarily from increased profitability and improved collections in the quarter as mentioned previously we repurchased 20 million of stock during the second quarter and at the end of q2 at 155 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization i d now like to turn to our outlook for q3 and for the full year 2021 for the third quarter of 2021 we expect revenue between 129 million and 132 million and earnings per share of between 0 81 and 0 83 for the full year 2021 we are increasing our revenue guidance to be between 529 million and 535 million the increase is largely due to q2 strength and our confidence in the remainder of the year we are raising our operating margin outlook to be approximately 39 an increase of 100 basis points from our prior guidance we are projecting adjusted free cash flow to be between 158 million and 162 million an increase of 2 million to 3 million from our prior outlook and we are increasing our guidance for earnings per share to be between 3 46 and 3 50 with the increase driven by continued top line strength and confidence in our ability to manage costs our annual eps estimate contemplate the tax rate of 20 to 21 and approximately 45 million shares outstanding with no additional share repurchases for the rest of 2021 in closing we re thrilled with our q2 results and the resurgence of our that our business has demonstrated we re well positioned for the balance of 2021 and feel we can continue to execute our total growth strategy with great results with that i d like to open the call for q a questions and answers operator we ll take our first question from ken wong with guggenheim securities please go ahead ken wong guggenheim securities analyst great thanks for taking my question and a solid quarter guys i guess the first thing i m not sure if yogesh or anthony just more sense for either of you guys but you highlighted chef tracking ahead of schedule on both growth and profitability just wondering kind of anything you ve seen in the last couple of quarters that would potentially steer you in the direction of maybe fueling a little more growth or potentially kind of digging in and extracting more leverage any color there would be great yogesh gupta chief executive officer so i ll start ken thank you i ll have anthony follow up from our perspective as we said we ve actually accomplished the expense synergies that we were targeting with the chef acquisition and we of course originally the target was that we would get to that get to those synergies by end of this fiscal year we ve gotten to them sooner from our perspective going forward ken as you know our overall business continues to be flattish that s where we characterize it and we might have some times when we do a little bit better than flat and sometimes when you do a little bit worse than flat but in general it is a flattish business i don t think that over the long haul at least at this point we see any reason to change that we are tremendously confident of the way the rest of the year is shaping up but i think that s about all i would like to say on that topic and anthony i don t know whether you have something to add anthony folger chief financial officer yes no i think that s right yogesh i think we ve kind of been on the positive side of flattish this year which we d certainly prefer to be on that side and chef has certainly been a contributor to that but as have some of our other products like openedge and some of the ipswitch products so i think we re continuing to execute our plan with chef it s a really good quality asset it s got some growth characteristics it s ahead of plan on profitability i wouldn t say that we re necessarily deviating in any way with what we had originally set out to do there ken wong guggenheim securities analyst got it okay super helpful and then perhaps just wanted to dive in a little bit on your net revenue retention seeing that coming above 100 that s quite positive a nice step up from last quarter should we think that that particular metric has a lot of volatility or just any color on what you think kind of the right range is for that number yogesh gupta chief executive officer yes it s a good question ken we ve been pretty consistently let s say in i would say 97 to 100 there hasn t been a lot of volatility maybe it s been improving a bit over the past couple of years so i think you re right the way we calculate it it is a trailing 12 month number so there won t be a lot of quarter to quarter volatility but obviously if the trend changes i think that will be apparent in the numbers but on the flip side i think from a business perspective it s been a very deliberate effort even since before i got here to invest in our technology to invest in customer experience and those types of investments are things we re going to continue to do and i think we re seeing some results from that in terms of some slightly better retention rate so i don t expect wild swings in the number and i think we feel pretty good about the investments we ve made to get the number where it is ken wong guggenheim securities analyst got it and then if i could just squeeze in one more and then i ll pass the mic to my peers here your guess just wondering as far as kind of the business or the product segment benefiting from just a return to normal on a macro basis are there any particular areas that you would say are still lagging that we could potentially see some sort of a tailwind as we look to the back half of the year yogesh gupta chief executive officer ken as we ve said right actually the last the first two quarters of this year in the first half we ve seen really outperformance across the entire product portfolio it has been a really sort of interesting to see that as businesses have gotten their head out of the challenges of trying to deal with covid 19 and we started looking forward as to how they want to invest in their longer term it project we ve seen the benefit across the board we are confident that we will continue to see that i don t think there s any particular area that is more or less obviously openedge is our biggest product so from an actual individual dollar perspective it has been the biggest contributor but overall across the board we are seeing interest and then we re seeing interest whether it is in our network management product with whatsup gold as you know one of the competitors has had some security challenges there and that has opened up the market for other products like ours and i think so so just it has been a set of tailwinds around our products as people move to the cloud as people go mobile first they re modernizing their applications and i want to reiterate anthony s point right over the last five years we have talked about the fact that we invest in r d so that our products are ready so that when our customers want to move forward we have our products are available and ready to help them move forward and that investment whether it was in openedge 12 or whether it is in the releases that we do every year with devtools or for now because we do every year with chef and all those things are really our investments in ipswitch products such as moveit and whatsup gold they re all sort of demonstrating that we have kept our product current and made it so that they truly benefit and address the challenges that our customers and users face so i think it s across the board good conditions and good demand for our products i don t think there s any specific area that i would highlight for us ken wong guggenheim securities analyst great thanks a lot guys yogesh gupta chief executive officer thank you ken operator we ll take our next question from daniel ives with wedbush please go ahead daniel ives wedbush analyst thanks and great quarter guys so can you just talk about with chef i mean what surprised you so far because obviously it seems like things coming out of the gate is really working a lot better than maybe even you thought so as you re talking to customers what you re hearing from the field i mean just give us some sort of anecdotal of what you re hearing yogesh gupta chief executive officer sure so i think a couple of really positive surprises i shouldn t say surprises but really sort of positive anecdotes that i want to highlight when one acquires a company like chef chef is an open source product there s a large community out there of open source developers that do a phenomenal job of continuing to innovate in the chef ecosystem and so one of the concerns we had was how would both the community of our customers and the community of that open source community how will they react to progress and on both those fronts we have been very pleased that those communities have embraced progress s taking over chef some of the larger customers who we ve had the pleasure of speaking with i mean they are all really really happy that chef is now backed by a publicly traded software company that we are a profitable business that they know that we invest in r d that we will continue to invest in chef and that we will continue to invest in the open source community as well and so really phenomenally positive things i mean i think by the way just i think one of the saps a very large user of chef i think they publicly put out a blog that says that there are 11 million assets in the cloud and when i say cloud i really mean plural cloud for sap they are in every cloud you can imagine including sap zone and so there are i think like five or six different clouds they re managing 11 plus million assets and they have really really been excited about the fact that that progress acquired chef so i think to me that part has been really positive and i think the open source community i think we had an open source community event just about a month ago phenomenal success the open source contributors are continuing to contribute aggressively so i think dan i m really happy both on the sort of customer facing side as well as on the product side the last part that i want to touch on is and i know that this is this quite often is ignored in the end because our people that make this happen and the team that has come over from chef and the team that we have at progress that is working with them and the combined teams the new joint chef team and progress that has done an amazingly wonderful job across the board so i think to me it s just been a very very positive experience for us and that has allowed us to do things like we said get to the synergies continue to do well on both customer retention as well as winning new customers and so on daniel ives wedbush analyst now let me ask the question does this set a pretty high bar for anthony and the m a team to make sure they continue to match success on the next one because that s what i m feeling i mean for the next one i feel like the bar is pretty high is there a little more pressure on anthony and team anthony folger chief financial officer yes the good news is dan i think we will i think that we ve got jeremy segal leading the m a group and jeremy is fantastic i think the entire team is disciplined around what the requirements are and sort of what the financial criteria are for us to close on a deal and so i think the company is aligned around it and i think we ll be patient we will find the right asset and the team has done a great job really building out the pipeline and so our ability to source the number of companies we are tracking there s just been dramatic improvement in all of that over the past 12 months so the bar is high but i think we ve certainly got the team to get over it daniel ives wedbush analyst great thanks again yogesh gupta chief executive officer thank you dan operator we ll take our next question from anja soderstrom with sidoti company please go ahead anja soderstrom sidoti company analyst hi thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on another great quarter i have a follow up on the chef success how much of that do you think is attributed to chef specific drivers rather than your playbook being more refined having done other acquisitions before chef yogesh gupta chief executive officer i think anja there are two aspects on the expense synergy side and getting to them as quickly as we did that is obviously our core competence i mean we have refined that we did ipswitch we did a really good job with that we ve continued to refine it since and we were able to do it with chef as well and get it done faster so i think that s what we bring to the table i think there s also a core competence at progress around certain interesting areas like how we do marketing and demand and so on and so forth that said i think the chef team itself is really remarkably good and strong and they have done a great job and it s in a good market i mean the devops and devsecops market is a market that is growing is a market where we see continued demand it is a market where as people move to the cloud and try to deploy their mission critical systems in the cloud they need products like chef and we have an amazing product so i think it s a combination of things anja i think we at progress can take some pride that you re bringing some things to it and i think the folks that came over from chef can take pride that they are bringing something to the table and we happen to also have an asset in a really good market so i think it s an all around being a really good asset for us anja soderstrom sidoti company analyst okay thank you and also in terms of the m a environment how has that changed over the past couple of months like with sort of a more worrying about the inflationary environment and things like that has that affected the m a pipeline at all yogesh gupta chief executive officer i m not sure i understood the last part of your question anja what part of the environment anja soderstrom sidoti company analyst no so the if there s going to be a more sustainable inflationary environment is that affecting your m a pipeline at all and how has it evolved over the last couple of months yogesh gupta chief executive officer yes so i think as we said earlier the valuations continue to be high and so what that means is that we continue to be disciplined and it s kind of an interesting thing this is one of the reasons why we feel confident about our strategy we have a strong pipeline and we have a team that is doing a great amount of deal flow and continuing to nurture and grow that pipeline and at the same time as anthony mentioned with a leadership team that is truly disciplined around making sure that we stick to our criteria and that we deliver the shareholder returns that our investors expect from us and i think that s really the key so we will continue to be patient we will look for the right asset and we will make sure that we when we find the right assets that we execute on it with the same level of rigor that we have with chef lately and ipswitch before that anja soderstrom sidoti company analyst okay thank you and then just last one is there anything you can call out in terms of the performance in terms of the different geographic regions you are serving yogesh gupta chief executive officer yes so again we saw strong performance across geographies i think if there is if you think about it the us i think is actually probably in the best shape when it comes to moving beyond covid i think europe is coming along i think parts of asia pacific are still a little bit behind in terms of timing and i think latin america is probably the slowest to recover because i mean you i m sure everyone has heard the challenges in brazil and brazil is the single largest technology market in latin america for progress so i think but overall i think if we look across the board i think we see improvements happening everywhere anja soderstrom sidoti company analyst okay thank you that was all for me yogesh gupta chief executive officer thank you anja operator we ll take our next question from mark schappel with benchmark please go ahead mark w schappel benchmark analyst hey guys yogesh gupta chief executive officer hey mark mark w schappel benchmark analyst thanks for taking my question and nice job again on the quarter yogesh starting with you with respect to the openedge strength in the quarter was it principally driven on the isv side of the business yogesh gupta chief executive officer again mark on both sides of course isvs had a continued strength as well but even the direct side of the business it s an interesting thing mark what is happening i think businesses that we are recognizing that they have a their mission critical applications sitting in on a platform that is truly a lowest cost platform the most efficient platform and a platform that we have continued to evolve and keep modern and so what we re seeing is i think to some degree i think actually covid made people look at their sort of investments and say where is it that have investments that are truly delivering great results and maybe we should do a little bit more with that so we re seeing both direct and isvs of course isvs are doing well so that s always wonderful but we re also seeing strength in direct mark w schappel benchmark analyst okay great thanks and then shifting to chef if i recall correctly when it was acquired it was a mid single digit grower and based on the good 2q results is it fair to assume that the chef continues to grow at least that rate yogesh gupta chief executive officer as you know mark go ahead anthony anthony folger chief financial officer no i was just going to say yes we don t break it out separately but i said the trend line really hasn t changed chef continues to perform well and so on a year over year basis i don t think we ve seen a change in the trend line there mark w schappel benchmark analyst okay super and then shifting gears to datadirect very little commentary about datadirect if at all in the prepared remarks any color on that business that maybe you could add so for example renewals coming in as planned yogesh gupta chief executive officer absolutely yes business is performing very much as planned as you know mark with datadirect there are the quarters are lumpy because of the fact that there are multiyear contracts with large isvs right and so in that sense this was a relatively straightforward quiet quarter it did well but nothing to sort of highlight one way or the other we by the way in q1 right we had actually won a couple of new customers on the direct side on the direct enterprise customers the datadirect which was a positive surprise and we talked about it this quarter was just a normal pretty straightforward quarter down the middle mark w schappel benchmark analyst okay great that s all from me thanks good job again yogesh gupta chief executive officer thank you again mark appreciate it operator we ll take our next question from ittai kidron with oppenheimer please go ahead ittai kidron oppenheimer analyst thanks guys great quarter very nice performance there i just had one question for you anthony on the free cash flow great quarter great performance there but your annual guidance suggests a big deceleration here in the second half of the year so help me think about the puts and takes of your annual free cash flow guide anthony folger chief financial officer yes ittai that s a great question the free cash flow in the quarter was really strong and obviously for the first half of the year we ve delivered about 102 million in free cash flow which is a heck of a lot further along than we thought we would be and a little bit of that is sort of better collection activity and i think when we look out to the back half of the year we re probably a little bit more cautious assuming that we may get back to things like travel and get back into the office a little bit so we felt comfortable taking that guide up a little bit but probably also holding a little bit back just wanting to see how much of the travel comes back and how much of the in office operating expenses come back so if it s not sort of a linear move maybe with margin or something like that i think that s really the reason why ittai kidron oppenheimer analyst got it so it sounds like you re expecting i guess margins to you actually raised your outlook on margin actually for the use of to 39 it doesn t sound like you re modeling much in your assumptions as a decline in operating margin in the second half of the year anthony folger chief financial officer yes no not from where we are now perhaps a little bit relative to where the back half of 2020 margins shook out ittai kidron oppenheimer analyst got it very good thanks anthony folger chief financial officer thank you operator ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today s question and answer session at this time i d like to turn the conference back to yogesh gupta for any additional or closing remarks yogesh gupta chief executive officer thank you thank you for joining our call today i m genuinely excited about our performance in q2 and i m pleased to share our confidence in the outlook for the rest of 2021 with you i m especially proud of the dedication of our entire organization and their continued hard work which really positions us well as we continue to execute our total growth strategy i look forward to talking to you all soon thanks again and goodbye operator duration 45 minutes call participants michael micciche vice president of investor relations yogesh gupta chief

commerce ministry and foreign ministry said on thursday in separate remarks the us should immediately redress their actions or we will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of chinese companies and institutions said commerce ministry spokesperson gao feng the us commerce department on thursday put hoshine silicon industry shanshan co and three other chinese companies xinjiang daqo new energy co xinjiang east hope nonferrous metals co and xinjiang gcl new energy material technology co as well as the xinjiang production and construction corps on an entity list citing the baseless claim of forced labor in the region the biden administration on wednesday separately blocked imports of hoshine silicon industry us media reported despite having shown automated production of polysilicon in its xinjiang plant to western financial institutions and media outlets like bloomberg and financial times in may to debunk the forced labor allegations xinjiang daqo was named on the us entity list considering the us photovoltaic pv market only needs 10 percent of the world s polysilicon we don t believe it will create a significant impact on our businesses xinjiang daqo told the global times on thursday reaffirming the company s zero tolerance on forced labor it said it has neither sold any products directly to us companies nor purchased any us products xinjiang daqo obtained approval to get registered on the shanghai tech heavy star market on tuesday after its parent firm daqo new energy tumbled at the new york stock exchange partly because of the groundless us accusations shares of daqo new energy dropped around 4 percent to 55 7 in trading on thursday morning session us time a staff of the investor relations sector at hoshine silicon told the global times on thursday that the company is gathering information about the impact of the us ban on its downstream customers noting the company s sales proportion in the us market was small xinjiang region contributes around 45 percent of the world s supply of polysilicon as energy consumption is one of the key factors affecting polysilicon manufacturing competitive electricity prices in xinjiang north china s inner mongolia autonomous region southwest china s sichuan province northwest china s qinghai province and ningxia hui autonomous region make these regions attractive according to hangzhou based industry website pv china nengyuan com the polysilicon output in xinjiang is expected to hit 300 000 tons this year which could satisfy the solar energy demand of 60 gigawatts gw it is notable that china s domestic pv module demand will reach 60 70 gw in 2021 as the country is striving to realize its carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals unlike targeting xinjiang s cotton and tomato the us sanctions on the region s solar panel materials is not a whim as the past decade witnessed how the us solar industry went downhill while growth in china s solar energy sector forged ahead industry observers said they noted even if non xinjiang regions have the capacity to produce polysilicon the higher costs and other disruptions would appear in the global solar supply chains under the us ban for instance the old facilities and polysilicon manufacturing equipment at foreign companies including rec group oci solar power and hemlock would create increasing uncertainties to the global solar industry china became the world s largest polysilicon producer in 2020 with an output of 396 000 tons its global output share climbed to 76 percent of the world total up 8 7 percentage points according to data from the china photovoltaic industry association the latest ranking from german research firm bernreuter research said seven of the world s top 10 largest polysilicon producers are based in china and only one is american legal weapons in the face of the latest us sanctions lawyers and experts encouraged relevant chinese companies and the government to take strong countermeasures chinese companies could make their utmost effort to fight for their rights and interests as the polysilicon industry is a capital and technology intensive sector instead of a labor intensive one gao lingyun an expert at the chinese academy of social sciences in beijing told the global times on thursday without tangible evidence of forced labor found in these factories such a lie will collapse gao said guan jian a partner at beijing globe law law firm told the global times on thursday that these private chinese companies could apply for the removal from the us entity list within the us legal framework the removal of chinese smartphone maker xiaomi from the us government blacklist in may is seen as a victory by many chinese companies saying it has set an example for them of how to counter the irrational crackdown by the us government by adopting legal avenues in addition to chinese companies analysts noted that china s anti foreign sanction law which was enacted on june 10 has offered more tools to block sanctions from the us or other countries that may follow the us according to article 12 of the law any organization or individual that implements or assists in implementing the us sanctions against china can be sued by chinese companies and individuals for violating the law and will be required to cease infringement and pay compensation yang yonghong a law professor at southwest university of political science and law told the global times on thursday politicians industrial lobbyists individuals from companies as well as relatives of these people who have been involved in pushing for the us sanctions against china will be sanctioned with their entry to china denied asset frozen and businesses within china restricted yang said the us has no legal basis for taking unilateral sanctions on other countries under the excuse of human rights and in recent years the us has weaponized and politicized human rights more frequently using it to bully other countries yang said noting that the us is using human rights as an excuse to practice hegemony and most of the developing countries in the un have expressed opposition to unilateral sanctions in a meeting held at the un headquarters in new york on wednesday 184 countries voted in favor of a resolution to demand the end of the us economic blockade on cuba for the 29th year in a row yang pointed out that some special rapporteurs of the un human rights council have expressed concern on human rights made by us coercive sanctions on some countries in december 2020 alena douhan a special rapporteur on the negative impact of the unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights called on the us to remove unilateral sanctions which may inhibit the rebuilding of syria s civilian infrastructure eu market more essential although it is uncertain to what extent the new us ban would disrupt china s solar industry supply chain and chinese solar companies acquirement of the raw materials some companies have raised concerns of prospective exports to the eu market a major market for chinese solar panel makers according to the china photovoltaic industry association china exported 17 4 percent of the solar modules produced in the country to the netherlands in 2019 20 12 7 percent to japan 5 1 percent to spain 3 9 percent to india and 3 3 percent to germany the most worrisome consequence of the us ban on china s solar panels would be a follow up crackdown by the eu that may lock many chinese solar makers within the country guan warned however gao said that the eu does not have the impetus to follow suit because the europeans have already become embattled and worried about the fate of the china eu bilateral investment treaty because of the xinjiang cotton issue china could impose sanctions on representative individuals or companies in the eu if the bloc bans chinese solar panels he noted when major countries are ramping up efforts on the climate change agenda china s domestic demand for solar panels is also huge calling for unity by domestic solar companies from upstream to downstream pan cunxiang secretary general of the nonferrous metal industry association in xinjiang told the global times on thursday that the chinese solar companies should not fall into disorder following the us crackdown we should first satisfy the great domestic demand pan said web editor guo wenrui du mingming
the irs is now investigating how confidential tax return data was leaked that divulged how billionaires like elon musk and jeff bezos have paid zero federal income tax in some years the confidential

comparing how much tax they paid annually from 2014 to 2018 to how much forbes estimated their wealth had grown in that same period the report found that overall the richest 25 americans pay less in tax than the average worker does the median american household in recent years earned an average salary of about 70 000 and paid 14 percent in federal taxes per year based on data from the 25 richest americans they collectively paid a true tax rate of 3 4 percent between 2014 to 2018 on wealth growth of 401 billion warren buffett the ceo and chairman of berkshire hathaway has avoided the most tax in recent years according to the records between 2014 and 2018 buffet s wealth grew by about 24 3 billion but he reported paying 23 7 million in taxes it showed a so called true tax rate of 0 1 percent which equates to less than 10 cents for every 100 buffet added to his wealth in that period for bezos his wealth grew an estimated 99 billion and his total reported income was 4 22 billion between 2014 and 2018 in that period bezos paid 973 million in tax which equates to a 0 98 percent true tax rate in 2007 when bezos paid no income tax the amazon founder in a joint tax return with then wife mackenzie bezos reported 46 million in income which was mostly from interest and dividend payments from investments he was able to offset his earnings with losses from other investments and

2016 and 2017 records show he reported at the time an adjusted gross income of 544 million according to the irs records he had an outstanding bank of america loan of 1 2 billion icahn told propublica that his adjusted gross income is misleading because his interest on his loans is higher i didn t make money because unfortunately for me my interest was higher than my whole adjusted income he said icahn hit back at questions over whether he thought it was inappropriate he hadn t paid federal income tax some years there s a reason it s called income tax he said the reason is if if you re a poor person a rich person if you are apple if you have no income you don t pay taxes do you think a rich person should pay taxes no matter what i don t think it s germane how can you ask me that question george soros the founder of soros fund management has an estimated wealth of 8 6 billion he paid no federal income tax between 2016 and 2018 according to the records he is pictured with wife tamiko

mike gives to charity and pays in taxes amounts to approximately 75 percent of his annual income the release of a private citizen s tax returns should raise real privacy concerns regardless of political affiliation or views on tax policy in the united states no private citizen should fear the illegal release of their taxes we intend to use all legal means at our disposal to determine which individual or government entity leaked these and ensure that they are held responsible george soros the founder of soros fund management has an estimated wealth of 8 6 billion he paid no federal income tax between 2016 and 2018 according to the records between 2016 and 2018 george soros lost money on his investments therefore he did not owe federal income taxes in those years mr soros has

27 5 percent in tax meanwhile the top 001 percent of taxpayers the 1 400 people whose reported income came in at more than 69 million paid 23 percent in tax many billionaires are able to drastically reduce their federal tax bills using legal tax strategies among the ways they can reduce tax bills is via charitable donations or by avoiding wage income which can be taxed at up to 37 percent instead they can benefit from investment income which is taxed roughly at 20 percent the release of the confidential irs records comes as president joe biden is proposing tax hikes on the wealthy to finance his spending plans biden wants to hike the top tax rate to 39 6 percent for people earning 400 000 a year or more in taxable income which is less than 2 percent of us households the current top tax

a prehistoric japanese man s dying moments have been recreated in astonishingly gory detail based on the forensic evidence found on his final remains not only do those details include almost 800 tooth marks on the man s bones but he was missing a hand and a leg this was death by shark attack and it occurred 500 years before the first documented shark attack in greece making it the oldest such occurrence on record the man s broken body was discovered in the early 20th century in a jōmon culture shell mound he is now known as tsukumo 24 after the tsukumo burial ground where he was unearthed archaeologists have worked out that he was buried soon after being mauled by a shark and they ve reconstructed the blood thirsty attack in stunning detail the distribution of tsukumo no 24 s traumatic shark attack injuries the red features represent wounds from bite marks the orange represents overlapping striations and the purple indicates fracture lines journal of archaeological science reports an ancient shark attack that was fast and furious a team of oxford university led researchers have published their japan shark attack study in the journal of archaeological science reports phd student j alyssa white and professor rick schulting first encountered the shark victim while they were investigating violent trauma in the skeletal remains of hunter gatherers from the shell burial mound in the tsukumo cemetery site in okayama japan near japan s seto inland sea they came across the man s preserved body at kyoto university where he had been kept since being excavated in 1920 the team said the shark most probably took the man s right leg and left hand in the attack at least 90 tooth marksreached to the bone from the almost 800 bite marks identified on the man s skeletal remains radiocarbon dating determined the shark attacked the 1 5 meter tall 5 foot tall man somewhere between 1370 and 1010 bc during japan s fisher hunter gatherer period jōmon era this attack predates the 5th century bc greek writings and the oldest illustrations related to shark attacks so essentially tsukumo 24 is by far the oldest archaeological evidence ever found for a shark attack victim this photoshopped photo gives you the feeling of what it might be light to encounter a huge shark just below the ocean surface kletr adobe stock a baffling range of inordinate injuries the researchers found deep serrated cuts of varying sizes and shapes covering his bones furthermore they found a hand had been sheared off and a leg was missing and it wasn t at first clear to them how or why the man had suffered such extreme injuries according to an article in science direct at first the researchers said they were baffled by the man s inordinate injuries however by carefully exploring modern forensics data on shark attacks and with help from george burgess director emeritus of the florida program for shark research the team re created the pattern of tsukumo 24 s injuries by mapping them onto a 3d model of the human skeleton the resulting wound location distribution chart suggested the victim was alive at the time of the attack and that he may have lost his hand while trying to defend himself the researchers concluded that while the shark would have damaged numerous blood vessels and organs it is likely that at least his larger lower limb arteries would have been severed early in the attack this would have resulted in a relatively quick death from hypovolemic shock which means extremely fast blood loss a 3d rendering of a white shark which the shark attack study claims is one of the two most likely species involved in the prehistoric japanese shark attack the other possibility was the tiger shark artyustudio adobe stock what lay beneath how on earth did this poor fellow get so close to a killer shark in the first place and what species was this now famous man eater the sizes and distribution patterns of the tooth marks suggested it was either a tiger shark or white shark that had killed the japanese man his body was recovered so quickly from the scene that the researchers speculate he may have been attacked while fishing with companions he probably lost his hand while punching the shark s nose as it sheered his leg off like we see in shark horror films study co author mark hudson a researcher with the max planck institute in germany said it is still uncertain whether tsukumo 24 was deliberately targeting sharks or the shark that ended his life was attracted by blood or bait dr hudson explains that the discovery not only provides a new perspective on ancient japan but it is also a rare example of archaeologists being able to reconstruct a dramatic episode in the life of a prehistoric community with a certain degree of sinister dr white wrote in the paper that we are still vulnerable in the same ways as tsukumo individual no 24 was in the water but white is wrong in this sentiment we certainly are not at risk because i for one never go anywhere near the sea because of articles like this so we will be fine and idiots who persistently fish for sharks notwithstanding the plight of the creature will continue to not be fine top image it wasn t until nearly 100 years after tsukumo no 24 s excavation that a cause of death was finally assigned which was death by shark attack the jomon era japanese man is now the oldest ever known shark

the u s stock market is making it out of the coronavirus crisis and the s p 500 and nasdaq are hitting record highs now what x with the flames of covid 19 reduced to embers in the u s at least for the moment the reopening of the u s economy provides a tailwind for stocks in 2021 yet the market appears to be at a crossroads holding on to big gains from last year and early this year while facing new risks that shape the stock market forecast for the next six months since february a historic market rally has moderated as investors try to figure out what happens next with the economy s reopening an inflationary bulge possible new taxes stimulus spending and unexpected shortages of goods ranging from semiconductors to flavored syrups at starbucks sbux from a historic perspective the roughly 12 gains in the major stock indexes so far this year are nothing to complain about the average s p 500 annual return is about 10 but after a monumental rebound from the march 2020 lows the stock market went into a necessary consolidation from its march 2020 low the nasdaq soared nearly 114 to a peak on feb 16 the composite then fell into a funk pulling back as much as 13 before regaining the momentum that carried the index to record highs the past week for much of 2021 strength in value and cyclical stocks many of them battered last year in the pandemic made the s p 500 a better bet than the technology and growth heavy nasdaq but the s p 500 also slipped into a horizontal range that made it hard to make much money no matter what stocks or sectors you picked after a nearly 90 rally off the march 2020 lows it s not much of a surprise that since mid april the s p 500 index has been choppy and generally moved sideways jeff buchbinder equity strategist at lpl financial said in a may 24 report stock market forecast for next six months no one expected the nasdaq to repeat its 43 6 surge of 2020 much smaller returns follow the big market years before 2020 the nasdaq had four years of gains greater than 40 since its 1972 debut according to investor s business daily research the best year after such a surge was the 16 9 advance in 2010 when the market was still recovering from the 2008 financial crisis the worst annual performance after a 40 plus gain was in 2000 when the dot com bubble burst and the nasdaq collapsed 39 3 since 1950 the s p 500 gain in the second year of a bull market has averaged about 13 buchbinder says that allows for some upside in what remains of 2021 in bull markets that followed 30 or greater declines as the current one does the average gain in the second year has been 17 worth noting the average maximum decline in the s p 500 at any point in the second year of its bull markets was about 10 buchbinder wrote this year support at the 50 day moving average has kept s p 500 pullbacks to no worse than 6 the market s flattening wouldn t be much of a problem for growth stock investors if enough stocks were rallying from breakouts but gains have been possible only through great stock picking for many investors even a 10 portfolio return has been difficult to achieve in 2021 heavy churn in market leadership makes it harder for stocks to sustain

really clear said greg swenson senior analyst at minneapolis research firm leuthold group everyone is trying to feel things out swenson said which is why he believes the market keeps rotating the big question he adds is when the fed will start tapering its stimulus in the second half of 2021 we will continue to see fits and starts in market leadership said sean naughton senior manager of u s equities at rbc wealth management many investors remain attached to growth stocks even while other sectors outperform that muscle memory will be difficult to break he said but the fed is turning more hawkish which puts higher risk assets at a disadvantage as he looked to the 2021 stock market six months ago naughton was bullish on financials especially banks today naughton still favors financials despite easing since april the trend in 10 year yields favors the sector he adds the expanding economic recovery should also benefit the stocks we believe this will be a durable recovery he said stock market forecast for next six months financials materials in spotlight with more people back to work the labor market is improving and consumers are on stronger footing americans have some of the best debt levels in 40 years meaning they can afford to borrow more materials chemicals metals mining and the like comprise another sector that should do better in a continued cyclical recovery businesses have resumed orders and while many face higher costs high consumer cash levels should make it easier to absorb higher prices the strong rally in value and cyclical stocks gave a good start to the 2021 stock market but that surge is now in an expected pause leuthold s swenson notes still he expects cyclicals and value stocks to outperform in the stock market in the next six months with higher interest rates value stocks look attractive materials can benefit from rising commodity prices leuthold also is bullish on retail and consumer stocks as the reopening of the economy unfolds the biggest risk for the second half of 2021 is inflation swenson and some other analysts believe also a concern for the stock market in the next six months supply chain constraints if they expand to more industries or spread more than expected while there are reasons to favor some sectors over others ibd investing principles advise investors to stick with leading stocks mainly in leading industries currently oil exploration pipeline refining and other oil related groups are leading the market cybersecurity telecom aerospace shipping internet steelmakers some health care software and retail groups also are leading in finance consumer lenders and real estate investment trusts are performing well software and medicals have taken the lead since financials and industrials fell out of favor in the first half of june stock market forecast for next six months growth stocks start to outperform what should investors look for in stocks superior fundamentals define leading stocks and an earnings rebound has left many companies with sharply improved sales and profit growth technically the best stocks also distinguish themselves with sound base patterns the problem is that so many stock breakouts from proper buy points on a technical basis haven t been as productive this year as they normally would be taking profits at 10 rather than the normal 20 to 25 may be a useful strategy growth stocks however are starting to outperform the ishares russell 1000 value etf iwd this year is up about 16 beating ishares russell 1000 growth iwf up about 11 but in june the growth etf is winning up 5 1 to the value etf s 1 1 decline nvidia nvda adobe adbe and alphabet googl have already broken out and re established their leadership positions the following are other key factors in the stock market forecast for the next six months s p 500 earnings growth s p 500 earnings growth was explosive in the first quarter and analysts keep pushing up their estimates for all of 2021 analysts consensus sees 34 8 eps growth and 12 1 revenue growth for the s p 500 according to factset those would be the best results since 2010 for the second quarter of 2021 the estimated earnings growth is an outstanding 61 9 the highest since the fourth quarter of 2009 108 9 in the second half of 2021 the hot profit growth pace should moderate in the third quarter analysts estimate earnings growth of 23 and revenue growth of 12 factset says and for the fourth quarter the consensus calls for an eps gain of 17 4 and revenue increase of 8 9 while the second quarter will be the high water mark for earnings and economic growth in 2021 that won t mean the end of the growth cycle wells fargo senior global market strategist scott wren noted in a report wednesday we feel market participants are smart enough to know that comparisons against year ago numbers resulting from a very deep recession are not in any way shape or form representative of the norm going forward he said over the balance of the year and certainly for the calendar year as a whole we would still categorize growth to be robust to put it mildly the combination of bulging profit growth and moderate stock gains means the s p 500 s forward price earnings ratio is falling liz ann sonders market strategist at charles schwab noted in a midyear stock market outlook that should please value investors valuation says sonders is to a large degree a sentiment indicator or perhaps better put an indicator of sentiment there are times when investors are willing to pay high multiples for certain stocks and times when they won t is margin debt too high margin debt is another factor to consider in the stock market forecast for the next six months margin debt today has exploded to nearly 1 trillion raising concerns of an overly bubbly market schwab s outlook cited a ned davis research analysis that found the market flashes sell signals when margin debt starts descending from major peaks the s p 500 followed those periods with losses three to 18 months later nick reece of merk research believes margin debt is not yet at alarming levels the rate of change in margin debt vs the s p 500 has declined over the past few months he said in a research report in the previous two major market tops for the s p 500 2000 and 2007 margin debt rose significantly relative to the equity market it may be worth noting that margin debt didn t rise relative to the stock market coming into the 2020 covid crash and the market recovered to new all time highs quickly performance of small cap stocks vs large cap stocks small cap stocks have outperformed with the russell 2000 index up about 18 for 2021 through friday but consolidating since mid march small caps tend to do well for several years after a crisis low says nicholas colas co founder of datatrek research the russell 2000 beat the s p 500 in 2000 and 2010 it also beat the s p in 2020 and is outperforming this year but by mid march small cap stocks just got too hot too fast he says the russell 2000 outperformed the s p 500 by more than 30 basis points the russell 2000 gets part of its early cycle outperformance from lower u s corporate high yield bond spreads colas adds that s because so much of the russell is unprofitable about a third of the stocks and the cost of marginal capital therefore matters to many of the companies in the index in a scenario where 10 year treasury yields remain low the russell s outlook is weaker because of heavier exposure to banks while big tech flexes strong earnings leverage he notes ipo stocks and tech stocks 2021

social media posts have claimed the spike protein the body creates after receiving an mrna vaccine kills cells experts say there is no evidence of that throughout the rollout of the covid 19 vaccines in the united states there have been people questioning the safety of the vaccines recently posts on social media have suggested the spike protein created in people s bodies after receiving the pfizer and moderna mrna covid 19 vaccines is cytotoxic meaning the protein kills cells in the body after the mrna vaccines are administered the spike protein causes the immune system to create antibodies to defend itself against covid 19 a video posted june 13 on youtube with the headline spike protein is very dangerous it s cytotoxic has more than 1 8 million views a day later an instagram post that links to the youtube video said the fda was alerted months ago that the spike protein in the covid vaccines are cytotoxic on june 20 one of the people in the youtube video questioned the safety of the covid 19 vaccines on twitter by saying the spike protein in sars cov 2 the virus that causes covid 19 is cytotoxic that post has been retweeted more than 4 000 times the question is the spike protein in the covid 19 vaccines cytotoxic the sources dr carolyn machamer cell biology professor at johns hopkins school of medicine dr monica gandhi infectious disease physician and professor of medicine at university of california san francisco dr benhur lee microbiology professor at icahn school of medicine at mount sinai the answer no there is no evidence the spike protein in the covid 19 vaccines is cytotoxic experts say the spike protein created by the human body after mrna vaccination is different than the sars cov 2 spike protein what we found the bottom line is the vaccine spike isn t toxic said dr carolyn machamer a cell biology professor at johns hopkins school of medicine in a tweet shared thousands of times dr robert malone who identifies himself as the inventor of mrna vaccines wrote the sars cov 2 spike protein is cytotoxic that is a fact who says so multiple peer reviewed references the salk institute it is the responsibility of the vaccine developers to demonstrate that their expressed version is not toxic show us dr benhur lee a professor of microbiology at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai said the potential cytotoxicity of sars cov 2 has no bearing on the safety of the mrna vaccines the sound bite sars cov 2 spike protein is toxic is not technically wrong also not news at per se but that has nothing to do with overall established safety of sars cov 2 vaccines especially the mrna vaccines lee said that s in part because according to machamer the spike protein in sars cov 2 is different than the spike protein created after the administration of the mrna vaccines the vaccine at least the moderna and the pfizer vaccines the mrna vaccines they supply the information to make spike but it s not exactly the spike that s in the virus she said there are changes that were made on purpose that would prevent the spike protein from being able to undergo binding to the receptor and fusion machamer explained and so all this business about toxicity that has been shown for the real spike protein the one that doesn t have that block is totally irrelevant for the vaccine the mrna vaccines essentially give instructions to the immune system on how to defend itself against the virus that causes covid 19 according to dr monica gandhi an infectious disease physician and professor of medicine at the university of california san francisco once the immune cells get the message they make the spike protein at that point the immune system responds by creating antibodies which fight off the covid 19 virus in the case of infection all it does is allow you as a human host to raise an immune response against something that you don t like which is a spike protein that looks different from your body gandhi said and then you have that nice healthy immune response so that if you ever see the virus you will fight that virus the mrna then disappears and doesn t stay in the body gandhi said more than 300 million doses of the mrna covid 19 vaccines have been administered in the u s and gandhi says there s no evidence the spike protein created in the human body after mrna vaccination is cytotoxic definitely no evidence in the human body even in cells that the spike protein itself hurts normal healthy cells she said not cytotoxic
investors in enbridge tsx enb nyse enb ought to consider the company s recent legal win as a big deal when it comes to energy infrastructure stocks enbridge tsx enb nyse enb is one of the canadian giants most investors look at first after all enbridge stock is appealing for long term investors looking for historical winners these days investors in enbridge are typically more interested in this stock for its dividend than anything else of course enbridge s 6 8 yield is nothing to sneeze at however of late the company has been embroiled in some political turbulence shares have seen more volatility than they usually do and some investors may have steered clear of this stock until the dust settled while the dust hasn t settled completely it appears it s in the process of settling accordingly those who d bought this stock at the beginning of the year have seen gains of approximately 20 at the time of writing let s dive into why more gains could be on the horizon for long term investors enbridge stock moving on permit victory the calgary based company has recently been celebrating a key victory one of the company s key permits for its line 3 expansion project that was upheld by the minnesota court of appeals this legal victory paves the way for completion of this project this year the timing of this project is of key concern for investors after all the company s projections of having this project wrapped up in short order have come into question via legal challenges of late this pipeline will be carrying heavy oil from alberta to refineries in wisconsin indeed the 760 000 barrels of oil per day this pipeline can transport is meaningful for the canadian energy sector enbridge s pipeline infrastructure is important and perhaps this legal win is the first of many for enbridge bottom line enbridge is battling legal challenges on not only its line 3 but also its line 5 project accordingly it s unclear how things will proceed on line 5 legal challenges in the state of michigan appear to be stronger and more difficult to overcome however this is certainly a step in the right direction as we ve seen with recent pipeline shutdowns of late these are critical to the functioning of our economy today accordingly it appears to me that more value is likely to be placed on existing pipeline infrastructure rather than less for those looking for a safe high yield way to play this space enbridge is an excellent choice legal headwinds are likely to persist for some time with enbridge stock however i m of the view that this noise has provided a nice entry point for long term income investors

washington reuters president joe biden and top white house officials hailed a bipartisan preliminary infrastructure agreement as proof that washington and even american democracy itself could deliver tangible results despite huge partisan divides but securing the deal which delivers a fraction of the investment he initially proposed required the democratic president to make big sacrifices and its passage through congress was thrown in doubt later thursday after senate minority leader mitch mcconnell criticized a two track plan to pass a second spending bill later the bipartisan framework is valued at 1 2 trillion over eight years 579 billion of which is new spending biden insists he will continue to fight for his priorities including what he calls human infrastructure and more funding for environmental programs in the separate democrats only bill and insisted he would not sign one package without the other here s how the compromise infrastructure bill agreed by the senators thursday compares to what was initially proposed transportation infrastructure the compromise hammered out by the g 21 group of republican and democratic senators includes 312 billion in new funding for roads bridges public transit and electric vehicle infrastructure roughly half the 621 billion that biden sought in the american jobs plan proposal he unveiled in march one area that saw a big drop from the original plan was public transit now slated to see a 49 billion bump in funding compared to the 85 billion initially proposed passenger and freight rail a huge personal priority for biden who has logged more than one million miles on amtrak is slated to receive 66 billion in additional funding down from the 80 billion earmarked in the initial proposal the biggest drop came for electric vehicle technology where biden had proposed investing 174 billion but the new plan calls for just 15 billion after rebates were eliminated broadband biden has made increasing internet access for all americans a top priority especially given the huge gaps exposed during the pandemic when many low income americans and those in rural areas had trouble working and learning from home the compromise proposal calls for increased spending of 65 billion on broadband infrastructure down from the 100 billion initially proposed by the president environmental remediation biden had vowed to replace 100 of the nation s lead pipes and service lines and his aides say that will still happen but the overall amount earmarked for environmental remediation dropped to 21 billion from 111 billion in the initial proposal left on the cutting room floor are billions that biden had hoped to invest in modernizing america s drinking water wastewater and stormwater systems human infrastructure missing completely from the proposal is 400 billion in funding for medicaid to fund home care for the elderly and disabled and some 200 billion to create free universal pre kindergarten and expand other childcare services affordable housing biden s initial proposal also included 213 billion to produce preserve and retrofit more than 2 million affordable places to live he will have to fight to get that money included in the democrats only budget package pay fors one of the starkest differences is who will pay for it all while biden pledged to increase corporate income taxes to fund infrastructure republicans drew a line in the sand the new deal pulls together a patchwork of increased irs enforcement selling off petroleum reserves redirected funds from unused unemployment insurance benefits and municipal bonds among other things reporting by andrea shalal and heather timmons editing by richard pullin
the biden administration this week delivered a swift rejection of an appeal from nicolas maduro for the lifting of unilateral us sanctions and the pursuit of what venezuela s president termed a win win policy to benefit us transnational banks and oil corporations a state department spokesman told the bloomberg news agency that there would be no change in us policy as long as the maduro government continued its repression and corrupt practices and until it negotiated a deal with the us puppet and self proclaimed interim president juan guaidó to restore democracy and organize free and fair elections it is worth noting that washington has issued no such declarations demanding an end to repression and corrupt practices by the narco state headed by president ivan duque in neighboring colombia as it murders disappears and tortures protesters instead it sent its top military commander in the region us southcom chief adm craig faller to the country this week in a gesture of solidarity with bogota s murderous military apparatus the biden administration has kept in place both a state of national emergency initiated by the obama administration in 2015 branding venezuela an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the united states and the escalating regime of maximum pressure sanctions imposed by the trump administration beginning in 2017 these include a de facto blockade of venezuela s oil exports and a ban on the country s access to us financial markets the us economic and financial blockade has dramatically deepened the worst depression in venezuelan history condemning millions of working people to poverty and hunger while triggering a mass emigration of more than 5 million venezuelans abroad the country s economy is estimated to have shrunk by 80 percent since 2012 while real wages of venezuelan workers have been decimated by an inflation rate that is now averaging 25 percent a month oil production the main source of the country s income stands at 500 000 barrels a day up slightly from the low of 310 000 last year but a fraction of the 2 5 million barrels produced before the collapse of oil prices and the imposition of us sanctions the biden administration like its predecessor is intent on using hunger and disease as weapons in its campaign for regime change and the imposition of a reliable us puppet in venezuela the country with the largest oil reserves on the planet while washington routinely claims that its illegal sanctions exempt humanitarian supplies the reality is that the threat of secondary sanctions against financial institutions doing business with the venezuelan government has made it virtually impossible to finance purchases of vitally needed food and medical supplies a study done by the center for economic and policy research think tank in 2019 estimated 40 000 excess deaths as a result of the us sanctions regime a toll that has no doubt escalated sharply since then the deadly impact of washington s sanctions is now posed even more sharply by the increasing spread of the covid 19 pandemic according to government figures venezuela has suffered 265 000 covid 19 cases and over 3 000 deaths with the number of infections doubling since february and the number of deaths doubling over the past three months hospital records however indicate that the real numbers of infections and deaths are four times higher than the official figures and the growing number of covid 19 cases has brought the impoverished country s health care system to the brink of collapse we are in the peak of the second wave right now and it has been 25 percent bigger and 40 percent longer than the first wave julio castro a venezuelan doctor and expert in infectious diseases told the bmj formerly the british medical journal only 0 5 percent of venezuelans have been fully vaccinated and just 1 5 percent have received a single dose so far the venezuelan government protested earlier this month that its attempt to receive vaccines from the who affiliated covax international vaccine program had been stymied after a last installment of a 120 million payment to the agency had been blocked as a result of us sanctions the financial system that also hides behind the us lobby has the power to block resources that can be used to immunize the population of venezuela venezuela s vice president delcy rodriguez said the maduro government had attempted to induce interim president guaidó to use some of venezuela s hundreds of millions of dollars in frozen overseas assets over which he has ostensible control to buy vaccines however the puppet like his master is apparently content to exploit covid 19 deaths as one more weapon in the war for regime change having no significant base of support in venezuela and with his attempts at fomenting a military coup and organizing a mercenary invasion having ended in fiasco his options are limited the response of the venezuelan government to the country s increasingly desperate crisis has been to plead for a rapprochement with us imperialism and to accommodate its policies to the interests of both foreign capital and the national bourgeoisie this reactionary strategy found its most naked expression in an interview maduro granted earlier this month to bloomberg at the miraflores presidential palace in caracas he insisted that his aim was to regularize us venezuelan relations in order to pave the way for an influx of foreign direct investment venezuela is going become the land of opportunity he said i invite us investors don t get left behind he went on to state that foreign capital was aware of the potential for profit the financial sector the bondholders with whom we had an impeccable relationship know it is possible to invest in venezuela and have a win win the petroleum sector which has invested in venezuela and still maintains investments knows it while maduro has made various gestures of accommodation toward us imperialism releasing six citgo executives including five americans from prison to house arrest and giving the right wing opposition five seats on the national election board he acknowledged that from biden there has not been any signal nothing he went on to complain that the sanctions were irrational he told bloomberg if venezuela cannot produce petroleum and sell it cannot produce and sell its gold cannot produce its bauxite and sell it cannot produce iron etcetera and cannot earn revenue in the international market where is it going to be able to get what it needs to pay holders of venezuelan debt that paying off bondholders and foreign bankers is the driving motivation for lifting sanctions is telling in a country plagued by blackouts water shortages breakdowns of every essential service and with two thirds of the population living in poverty within venezuela the maduro government has introduced what amounts to an imf style structural adjustment program that includes slashing of state subsidies scrapping price controls eliminating import restrictions and effectively dollarizing the economy according to government documents cited by bloomberg private companies accounted for 92 percent of imports of food and raw materials in 2020 compared to just 25 percent a year earlier a graphic indication of the government ceding control to big business interests meanwhile the maduro government has pushed through a series of legislative packages designed to attract foreign direct investment and pave the way for the privatization of public enterprises up to and including the state owned oil corporation pdvsa an anti blockade law enacted last year offering tax and labor incentives to stimulate and favor the private sector has been followed by a law on foreign investments and now a law on special economic zones which is being rubber stamped by the national assembly the aim of these laws is to auction off venezuela s resources to foreign transnationals that are being invited in to exploit the country and its workforce with a host of incentives including a 10 year moratorium on taxes suspension of import export duties guaranteed repatriation of invested capital and a pledge that foreign companies will be fully compensated for any losses incurred as a result of government actions the measures are supported by maduro s two key constituencies the military command and the so called boliburguesia the layer of capitalists which has enriched itself off of speculation and corrupt ties to the state even as the rest of the population has faced immiseration these layers are anxious to solidify their control and expand their wealth through reforging ties to us imperialism social inequality has risen to unprecedented levels with the venezuelan central bank reporting that in 2017 just 18 percent of the gross domestic product went to the country s 13 million workers while fully half was directly pocketed by its capitalists this yawning divide has only widened since the result has been a growth of popular protests and class struggle which the government has met with repression and arrests the right wing evolution of the maduro government has put paid to the illusions promoted by the pseudo left in the 21st century socialism touted first by hugo chávez along with similar nationalist and anti imperialist pretensions of other representatives of the so called pink tide in latin america the bitter experience of the working class in venezuela brazil ecuador and elsewhere on the continent has demonstrated that it is impossible to combat imperialist aggression and capitalist exploitation outside of the politically independent mobilization of the working class against all sections of the bourgeoisie on the basis of a program of socialist internationalism
social media posts have claimed the spike protein the body creates after receiving an mrna vaccine kills cells experts say there is no evidence of that throughout the rollout of the covid 19 vaccines in the united states there have been people questioning the safety of the vaccines recently posts on social media have suggested the spike protein created in people s bodies after receiving the pfizer and moderna mrna covid 19 vaccines is cytotoxic meaning the protein kills cells in the body after the mrna vaccines are administered the spike protein causes the immune system to create antibodies to defend itself against covid 19 a video posted june 13 on youtube with the headline spike protein is very dangerous it s cytotoxic has more than 1 8 million views a day later an instagram post that links to the youtube video said the fda was alerted months ago that the spike protein in the covid vaccines are cytotoxic on june 20 one of the people in the youtube video questioned the safety of the covid 19 vaccines on twitter by saying the spike protein in sars cov 2 the virus that causes covid 19 is cytotoxic that post has been retweeted more than 4 000 times the question is the spike protein in the covid 19 vaccines cytotoxic the sources dr carolyn machamer cell biology professor at johns hopkins school of medicine dr monica gandhi infectious disease physician and professor of medicine at university of california san francisco dr benhur lee microbiology professor at icahn school of medicine at mount sinai the answer no there is no evidence the spike protein in the covid 19 vaccines is cytotoxic experts say the spike protein created by the human body after mrna vaccination is different than the sars cov 2 spike protein what we found the bottom line is the vaccine spike isn t toxic said dr carolyn machamer a cell biology professor at johns hopkins school of medicine in a tweet shared thousands of times dr robert malone who identifies himself as the inventor of mrna vaccines wrote the sars cov 2 spike protein is cytotoxic that is a fact who says so multiple peer reviewed references the salk institute it is the responsibility of the vaccine developers to demonstrate that their expressed version is not toxic show us dr benhur lee a professor of microbiology at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai said the potential cytotoxicity of sars cov 2 has no bearing on the safety of the mrna vaccines the sound bite sars cov 2 spike protein is toxic is not technically wrong also not news at per se but that has nothing to do with overall established safety of sars cov 2 vaccines especially the mrna vaccines lee said that s in part because according to machamer the spike protein in sars cov 2 is different than the spike protein created after the administration of the mrna vaccines the vaccine at least the moderna and the pfizer vaccines the mrna vaccines they supply the information to make spike but it s not exactly the spike that s in the virus she said there are changes that were made on purpose that would prevent the spike protein from being able to undergo binding to the receptor and fusion machamer explained and so all this business about toxicity that has been shown for the real spike protein the one that doesn t have that block is totally irrelevant for the vaccine the mrna vaccines essentially give instructions to the immune system on how to defend itself against the virus that causes covid 19 according to dr monica gandhi an infectious disease physician and professor of medicine at the university of california san francisco once the immune cells get the message they make the spike protein at that point the immune system responds by creating antibodies which fight off the covid 19 virus in the case of infection all it does is allow you as a human host to raise an immune response against something that you don t like which is a spike protein that looks different from your body gandhi said and then you have that nice healthy immune response so that if you ever see the virus you will fight that virus the mrna then disappears and doesn t stay in the body gandhi said more than 300 million doses of the mrna covid 19 vaccines have been administered in the u s and gandhi says there s no evidence the spike protein created in the human body after mrna vaccination is cytotoxic definitely no evidence in the human body even in cells that the spike protein itself hurts normal healthy cells she said not cytotoxic

washington reuters fewer americans filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week as the labor market steadily recovers from the covid 19 pandemic amid a reopening economy but a dearth of willing workers could hinder faster job growth in the near term the economy appears to be at cruising speed more than half way through the second quarter with other data on thursday showing strong growth in business spending on equipment in may while the goods trade deficit widened that was because of an increase in imports as businesses desperately try to keep up with robust demand retailers warehouses are almost bare it looks like the economy continues to astound us with the speed and strength of the recovery from what is turning out to be the quickest recession in history said chris rupkey chief economist at fwdbonds in new york initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 7 000 to a seasonally adjusted 411 000 for the week ended june 19 the labor department said data for the prior week was revised to show 6 000 more applications received than previously reported the first increase since late april was blamed by economists on volatility in the aftermath of the may 31 memorial day holiday economists polled by reuters had forecast 380 000 applications for the latest week there was a surge in claims in pennsylvania last week the state upgraded its filing system this month and the transition could have caused a backlog there were sizeable declines in california florida and illinois claims have dropped from a record 6 149 million in early april 2020 but are still above the 200 000 250 000 range that is viewed as consistent with a healthy labor market despite last week s modest decline layoffs are trending lower with companies scrambling to fill a record 9 8 million job openings the claims data could become volatile in the weeks ahead as 26 states with mostly republican governors pull out of federal government funded unemployment programs including a 300 weekly check which businesses complained were encouraging the jobless to stay at home the early termination started on june 5 and will run through july 31 louisiana is the only state with a democratic governor to terminate federal benefits for the rest of the country these benefits will lapse on sept 6 there is no evidence so far of a surge in job searches in the 12 states that have already ended the federal benefits the fits and starts in the labor market should be expected and imply that a premature withdrawal of support for the unemployed would be a policy error that will reduce overall economic activity said joe brusuelas chief economist at rsm in new york at least 150 million americans have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus allowing the economy to begin reopening a shortage of childcare facilities is keeping some parents mostly women outside the labor force some people also are hesitant to return to work out of fear of contracting the virus pandemic related retirements and transitions into new careers are factors as well federal reserve chair jerome powell told lawmakers on tuesday that he believed the economy would see strong job creation in the fall stocks on wall street were trading higher with the nasdaq and s p 500 indexes hitting all time highs u s treasury prices were mixed strong growth the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid dropped by 144 000 to 3 390 million in the week ending june 12 at least 14 8 million people were receiving unemployment checks under all programs in the first week of june compared to 31 3 million during the same period in 2020 in addition to the brightening public health situation trillions of dollars in pandemic relief from the government are underpinning the economy in a separate report on thursday the commerce department said shipments of non defense capital goods excluding aircraft a closely watched proxy for business spending plans rose 0 9 in may after gaining 1 0 in april core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government s gross domestic product measurement but supply bottlenecks could be slowing momentum still a strong rebound in corporate profits and excess savings accumulated by households should allow factories to weather the production and labor supply constraints profits from current production increased 55 2 billion in the first quarter after decreasing 31 4 billion the fourth quarter we expect strong revenues this year while margins remain well supported as stronger productivity growth and increased pricing power offset higher labor costs said lydia boussour lead u s economist at oxford economics in new york the summer will be hot for the u s economy strong demand and tight supply are forcing businesses to turn to imports boosting the trade deficit in a third report the commerce department said the goods trade deficit increased 2 8 to 88 1 billion in may while inventories at wholesalers rose 1 1 stocks at retailers dropped 0 8 that mostly reflected a 5 3 decline in inventories of motor vehicles auto production has been hampered by a global semiconductor shortage the swelling goods trade deficit and falling retail inventories did little to change economists robust gdp growth expectations for this quarter with estimates around a 10 annualized rate the commerce department confirmed in a fourth report that economic growth accelerated in the first quarter thanks to the massive fiscal stimulus the economy grew at a 6 4 rate last quarter unrevised from the estimate published in may that followed a 4 3 pace of expansion in the fourth quarter reporting by lucia mutikani editing by paul simao by lucia mutikani

social media posts have claimed the spike protein the body creates after receiving an mrna vaccine kills cells experts say there is no evidence of that throughout the rollout of the covid 19 vaccines in the united states there have been people questioning the safety of the vaccines recently posts on social media have suggested the spike protein created in people s bodies after receiving the pfizer and moderna mrna covid 19 vaccines is cytotoxic meaning the protein kills cells in the body after the mrna vaccines are administered the spike protein causes the immune system to create antibodies to defend itself against covid 19 a video posted june 13 on youtube with the headline spike protein is very dangerous it s cytotoxic has more than 1 8 million views a day later an instagram post that links to the youtube video said the fda was alerted months ago that the spike protein in the covid vaccines are cytotoxic on june 20 one of the people in the youtube video questioned the safety of the covid 19 vaccines on twitter by saying the spike protein in sars cov 2 the virus that causes covid 19 is cytotoxic that post has been retweeted more than 4 000 times the question is the spike protein in the covid 19 vaccines cytotoxic the sources dr carolyn machamer cell biology professor at johns hopkins school of medicine dr monica gandhi infectious disease physician and professor of medicine at university of california san francisco dr benhur lee microbiology professor at icahn school of medicine at mount sinai the answer no there is no evidence the spike protein in the covid 19 vaccines is cytotoxic experts say the spike protein created by the human body after mrna vaccination is different than the sars cov 2 spike protein what we found the bottom line is the vaccine spike isn t toxic said dr carolyn machamer a cell biology professor at johns hopkins school of medicine in a tweet shared thousands of times dr robert malone who identifies himself as the inventor of mrna vaccines wrote the sars cov 2 spike protein is cytotoxic that is a fact who says so multiple peer reviewed references the salk institute it is the responsibility of the vaccine developers to demonstrate that their expressed version is not toxic show us dr benhur lee a professor of microbiology at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai said the potential cytotoxicity of sars cov 2 has no bearing on the safety of the mrna vaccines the sound bite sars cov 2 spike protein is toxic is not technically wrong also not news at per se but that has nothing to do with overall established safety of sars cov 2 vaccines especially the mrna vaccines lee said that s in part because according to machamer the spike protein in sars cov 2 is different than the spike protein created after the administration of the mrna vaccines the vaccine at least the moderna and the pfizer vaccines the mrna vaccines they supply the information to make spike but it s not exactly the spike that s in the virus she said there are changes that were made on purpose that would prevent the spike protein from being able to undergo binding to the receptor and fusion machamer explained and so all this business about toxicity that has been shown for the real spike protein the one that doesn t have that block is totally irrelevant for the vaccine the mrna vaccines essentially give instructions to the immune system on how to defend itself against the virus that causes covid 19 according to dr monica gandhi an infectious disease physician and professor of medicine at the university of california san francisco once the immune cells get the message they make the spike protein at that point the immune system responds by creating antibodies which fight off the covid 19 virus in the case of infection all it does is allow you as a human host to raise an immune response against something that you don t like which is a spike protein that looks different from your body gandhi said and then you have that nice healthy immune response so that if you ever see the virus you will fight that virus the mrna then disappears and doesn t stay in the body gandhi said more than 300 million doses of the mrna covid 19 vaccines have been administered in the u s and gandhi says there s no evidence the spike protein created in the human body after mrna vaccination is cytotoxic definitely no evidence in the human body even in cells that the spike protein itself hurts normal healthy cells she said not cytotoxic
