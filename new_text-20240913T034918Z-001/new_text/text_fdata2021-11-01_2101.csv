so last week i had to pop into rami levy s to do some shopping rami levy is first of all an important businessman in israel but rami levy refers to the chain of supermarkets he owns they are popular for several reasons notably lower prices on many goods a quality house brand and although i know that tastes in coffee are rather personal i find his coffee importer to know his or her stuff and viva italia the stores also stock an enormous variety of products keep the place very clean and offer cell phone accounts including kosher phones for those who want to avoid the internet the checkout lines were not too long and i was soon loading my goods onto the conveyer the cashier was a muslim lady who once helped me retrieve my lost pin number rami levy cashiers are an interesting lot young women in hijabs middle aged russian ladies and a few middle aged haredi men everyone is nice and pleasant and sometimes joking around sometimes obviously tired rami levy stores on friday mornings and the day before any holiday is usually a nightmare to be avoided even if it means missing some last minute item my stuff was moving along and i was packing up with my usual stunning efficiency when things came to a halt there were two bottles of beer the cashier wanted me to pass them over the scanner at first i didn t understand but of course she or her husband has become more religious or raised the issue with management or who knows what i put the bottles over the scanner not wanting to make a fuss but afterwards i began to feel really perhaps irrationally annoyed as i got out of my car at home i said hello to my ethiopian friend adamahon and asked her if she had had the same thing happen sure she said it s because they re arabs or muslims and aren t supposed to handle alcohol i know i said and on one hand it s not a big deal but on the other it s bad if you have a lot of beer and wine though adamahon admitted you think why am i doing your job this echoed my thoughts exactly but she added jews have a lot of shtick too now there s a word you won t find in amharic shtick is yiddish i m not quite sure how to define it it s a way of doing things but not in the sense of methodology if your grandson is jumping up and down on the living room couch yelling at the top of his lungs you tell him stop doing shtick when i lived in california and went to the berkeley chabad house sometimes i was always disconcerted by the fact that the rabbis all born and bred in the new york yeshiva world would turn their heads aside when speaking to me they were invariably polite interested in answering questions kind and thoughtful they just wouldn t look directly at a woman that s one kind of jewish shtick that adadmahon meant but the issue is more complicated than shtick or muslim customs after all the cashier didn t bat an eye to pass through a bottle of alcohol from the cosmetic section or the alco gel i don t know if religious muslims use alco gel i think there were some problems with it in american hospitals when the damned stuff was put out everywhere in the wards and public restrooms and if she s so religious why is she working the one thing i agree with in the quran is that husbands must support their families perhaps she is a widow not yet married hard to tell but she certainly is young and was wearing what might be an engagement ring with a rather impressive stone and of course the muslim arab world is changing rapidly and in some unexpected ways how to balance religious commitment with a job in the world external to a purely muslim society even bedouin girls are going to school these days after all and such challenges are hardly unique to the islamic world similar concerns have been vigorously debated throughout the jewish world as well i wonder what the store policy is i wonder if customers complain i wonder if being in israel and in a store that in this neighborhood caters to a large religious jewish population in several towns the customers just accept that if they have to pass certain products through the scanner for themselves it s only a matter of being accommodating and polite and keeping the checkout line moving i wonder if those who buy alcohol will shift to using the self checkout more often or whether rami levy will eventually stock fewer alcohol products or whether in the future i ll just get my wine and beer from the cute russian guys at yayin be ir downstairs from the supermarket they already know i like scotch and gew√ºrztraminer published in

an astonishing 82 decrease in the cost of solar photovoltaic pv energy since 2010 has given the world a fighting chance to build a zero emissions energy system which might be less costly than the fossil fuelled system it replaces the international energy agency projects that pv solar generating capacity must grow ten fold by 2040 if we are to meet the dual tasks of alleviating global poverty and constraining warming to well below 2 c critical challenges remain solar is intermittent since sunshine varies during the day and across seasons so energy must be stored for when the sun doesn t shine policy must also be designed to ensure solar energy reaches the furthest corners of the world and places where it is most needed and there will be inevitable trade offs between solar energy and other uses for the same land including conservation and biodiversity agriculture and food systems and community and indigenous uses colleagues and i have now published in the journal nature the first global inventory of large solar energy generating facilities large in this case refers to facilities that generate at least 10 kilowatts when the sun is at its peak a typical small residential rooftop installation has a capacity of around 5 kilowatts we built a machine learning system to detect these facilities in satellite imagery and then deployed the system on over 550 terabytes of imagery using several human lifetimes of computing a map of all the large solar facilities detected up to 2018 lighter colours more recent kruitwagen et al nature we searched almost half of earth s land surface area filtering out remote areas far from human populations in total we detected 68 661 solar facilities using the area of these facilities and controlling for the uncertainty in our machine learning system we obtain a global estimate of 423 gigawatts of installed generating capacity at the end of 2018 this is very close to the international renewable energy agency s irena estimate of 420 gw for the same period tracking the growth of solar energy our study shows solar pv generating capacity grew by a remarkable 81 between 2016 and 2018 the period for which we had timestamped imagery growth was led particularly by increases in india 184 turkey 143 china 120 and japan 119 facilities ranged in size from sprawling gigawatt scale desert installations in chile south africa india and north west china through to commercial and industrial rooftop installations in california and germany rural patchwork installations in north carolina and england and urban patchwork installations in south korea and japan solar mixed with rice fields on reclaimed land in south korea stock for you shutterstock the advantages of facility level data country level aggregates of our dataset are very close to irena s country level statistics which are collected from questionnaires country officials and industry associations compared to other facility level datasets we address some critical coverage gaps particularly in developing countries where the diffusion of solar pv is critical for expanding electricity access while reducing greenhouse gas emissions in developed and developing countries alike our data provides a common benchmark unbiased by reporting from companies or governments geospatially localised data is of critical importance to the energy transition grid operators and electricity market participants need to know precisely where solar facilities are in order to know accurately the amount of energy they are generating or will generate emerging in situ or remote systems are able to use location data to predict increased or decreased generation caused by for example passing clouds or changes in the weather this increased predictability allows solar to reach higher proportions of the energy mix as solar becomes more predictable grid operators will need to keep fewer fossil fuel power plants in reserve and fewer penalties for over or under generation will mean more marginal projects will be unlocked using the back catalogue of satellite imagery we were able to estimate installation dates for 30 of the facilities data like this allows us to study the precise conditions which are leading to the diffusion of solar energy and will help governments better design subsidies to encourage faster growth the authors compared the locations of the solar facilities to data on land use to find out what was there before cropland light brown was easily the most common kruitwagen et al nature knowing where a facility is also allows us to study the unintended consequences of the growth of solar energy generation in our study we found that solar power plants are most often in agricultural areas followed by grasslands and deserts this highlights the need to carefully consider the impact that a ten fold expansion of solar pv generating capacity will have in the coming decades on food systems biodiversity and lands used by vulnerable populations policymakers can provide incentives to instead install solar generation on rooftops which cause less land use competition or other renewable energy options the github code and data repositories from this research have been made available to facilitate more research of this type and to kickstart the creation of a complete open and current dataset of the planet s solar energy facilities

let me preface this by saying that i love history i wouldn t be writing a history column if i didn t not only can learning about our past reveal clues for solving future problems but reading old newspapers records and stories is just a great deal of fun similarly as an urban studies student i understand the importance of the built environment every individual thing that we introduce to our cities and towns every tree every light every bit of pavement has a particular importance things can be seemingly minor but not necessarily frivolous with all of that being said i think the way we have sought to preserve parts of chapel hill in amber for generations has had and will continue to have devastating consequences for our shared home let me explain the town of chapel hill is currently home to three local ordinance historic districts franklin rosemary cameron mccauley and gimghoul all are either located on or near franklin street if you ever walk through these neighborhoods you will quickly understand why they were preserved the houses within are easy on the eyes and have a lot of character this character is absolutely not some product of an organic process the town government has published a nearly 180 page document detailing maintenance and appearance standards for structures in these districts restrictions include paint colors foundation maintenance deck construction and a host of other things that are deemed important to maintaining the district s aesthetics now as chapel hill has grown in population by around 4 500 people since 2010 alone it has needed more places to house people there are a variety of ways that developers and administrative officials are attempting to do so
ranga mataire writing back for the first time since the imposition of sanctions on zimbabwe by the united states and her allies we had an objective voice from an internationally recognised body condemning the economic embargoes united nations special rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights to zimbabwe professor alena douhan whom i doubt has ever visited zimbabwe before called on the west and the united states to remove sanctions as their continued stay were worsening the country s economy over the last 20 years sanctions and various forms of over compliance with sanctions have had an insidious ripple effect on the economy of zimbabwe and on the enjoyment of fundamental human rights including access to health food safe drinking water and sanitation education and employment reads douhan s report predictably the mdc alliance whose leadership has campaigned and continue to vouch for sanctions stay condemned the un rapporteur casting all manner of aspersions on her report if there were any people who doubted that the mdc alliance is a western stooge then the party s response to the un special rapporteur put to rest all such doubts it was not only shameful but the highest form of treachery for a party that claims to be championing the rights of zimbabweans to be seen vouching for the continued stay of sanctions that have caused untold suffering of the generality of the populace it surely is a case of one crying more than the bereaved as the mdc through one of their vice presidents tendai biti held a media briefing to attack prof douhan it is surely hard to be a western front as one is given to throwing away rationality for the sake of being in good stead with the benefactors what is saddening the most is that the majority of those who support this opposition party do so out of mere protest against certain unfulfilled obligations and not out of any enduring ideological grievances it is also disheartening to note that the majority of those who support the mdc alliance have zero clue of what the party really stands for including its relations with some imperial powers that have continued to economically strangle zimbabwe because it dared to embark on a revolutionary land redistribution exercise meant to correct historical iniquities in other words the majority of those who support the mdc alliance have no idea that the party s leadership is more concerned with lining their pockets than genuinely representing their interests for how can a home grown party with interest of zimbabweans at heart be so much piqued by the prospects of the lifting of economic sanctions how can a party whose roots must be in zimbabwe behave in such an unpatriotic manner of siding with imperial powers the time has come for zimbabweans to resist the blurring of national memory and ensure that the laws of the country protect and safeguard our national interests by outlawing political organisations that have proven beyond doubt they exist solely as appendages of foreign interests while we were aware of the late morgan tsvangirai s duplicitous antics we were somehow relieved that he seemed to have revised his stance at the tail end of his life the coming into the fold of nelson chamisa as the leader of the mdc alliance has somewhat disfigured the political culture and discourse that zimbabwe has always been admired for i can t fathom for a moment that a country born from the idea of freedom can at any time be governed by an unstable individual who exhibits traits of an authoritarian demagogue ready to sell his soul for a case of whiskey before the coming into the country of prof douhan the mdc alliance had already gone into an overdrive of creating all sorts of hullabaloo including making balderdash claims of an assassination attempt on chamisa surely the time has come to resist the slightest extension of what is right and wrong by calling to order political leaders prone to making wild allegations that are meant to tarnish our very existence as a nation sadly there is a large constituency of people who actually believe chamisa s antics because for long the arms of law have either been hesitant or unwilling to unearth some of the unfounded claims of violence the time has come to confront and deal with the mdc alliance s addiction to faking abductions and faking assassination attempts in the vein hope rising their stunted and tattered political stock we must say it as it is and speak out the truth about the chicanery that afflicts some opposition figures for silence may sound more like some form of appeasement for long zimbabwe has been denigrated and humiliated because of opposition antics that are normally heightened during major international events the plot has become so predictable zimbabweans need to demand justice for the suffering they have endured under the yoke of sanctions those that have campaigned for sanctions must surely be held accountable for the suffering of the people an international tribunal needs to be set up and those who have campaigned for sanctions must be put on trial in the words of nigerian author chimamanda ngozie adichie now is the time to burn false equivalences we cannot act as if both sides of an issue are equal when it is clear that the mdc alliance does not act in the national interest of zimbabwe devoid of alternative life changing policies the mdc alliance is resorting to dark populism that manipulates impressionable minds we surely need to call a spade a spade and counter lies with facts unflaggingly we are a decent nation born out of a protracted struggle we cannot allow an ugly infamy to take root in our body politic an ugly idea left to fester will eventually turn the colour of normalcy
irish consumers and businesses can expect little relief in the short term from the supply bottlenecks and disruption that have heaped transport costs on importers this year supply chain experts have warned major congestion at the main european feeder ports serving ireland antwerp and rotterdam continues to delay the flow of goods from asia to irish ports once the goods have arrived in ireland a long flagged shortage of truck drivers exacerbated by brexit and the pandemic is causing further delays in the run up to christmas irish haulage infrastructure is only getting tighter with delays of up to a week for deliveries according to a report by woodland group a uk supply chain management and consulting company with a presence in ireland whereas we used to be able to ring one of our and get a delivery even within the next 48 hours without problems you re talking now potentially a week to get something delivered kevin brady managing director at woodland group s irish arm told the journal in its asia ireland supply chain impact report published last month woodland cautioned importers and exporters that there is is no quick fix to the global disruption businesses and consumers can expect delays and shipping rates to remain elevated until at least chinese new year in february 2022 the report warned but in an updated version seen by the journal woodland is telling its customers that these problems could last the entirety of 2022 key factors trade links with asia particularly china sometimes referred to as the factory of the world are crucial for ireland the report highlights according to woodland s analysis goods from asian countries represented 15 of ireland s total imports in 2020 worth 10 billion 6 billion of which came from china alone up from 5 1 billion in 2019 but the growth rate of imports from china has slowed in the second half of 2021 delayed shipping timeframes and increased costs due to skyrocketing freight prices are the key factors in this decline according to the report covid outbreaks in china which have resulted in the temporary closures of ningbo shanghai and other ports coupled with pandemic related labour shortages have resulted in mass congestion in some cases typhoon in fa which struck china in july also caused delays woodland said the cost of shipping goods from asia to ireland meanwhile has ballooned to a record high level over the past year or so this is down to a number of factors including booming post lockdown consumer demand in many european countries a shortage of freight containers and backlogs of ships queuing to enter ports symptoms of this global malaise have been generating headlines across the world just this week there were a record 77 ships sitting off the twin ports of los angeles and long beach in california container shps queing off the congested ports of long beach and los angeles in the us earlier this month alamy stock photo alamy stock photo it s a case of elevated demand kevin brady told the journal we saw this last year in the run up to thanksgiving in the us but it s definitely a worsening situation from last year longer waits for berths mean disrupted shipping schedules disrupting the rhythm of global trade flows and causing a ripple effect of delays across the globe and european ports haven t escaped the chaos brady said for getting containers off mother vessels in those base ports like antwerp rotterdam and zebrugge and getting them shipped off on smaller feeder vessels we re talking about delays of anything between one and two weeks this process of loading goods from one ship to another to be brought to their final destination is called transhipment delays at major transhipment ports both in europe and asia are now beginning to impact irish exporters the woodland report highlights they are seeing a 25 30 increase in pricing to their goods although irish exports in general have performed very well this year led by the booming pharmaceutical industry pinch points happily however irish ports like dublin cork and rosslare have coped very well with the disruption brady said advertisement there are always specific times for pinch points he explained but i think the big problems have been at origin in asia or the transhipment ports in europe in fairness to irish ports we haven t had a huge amount of problems where issues are cropping up in ireland however are once the goods have arrived here and need to be delivered to their final destination he said although not nearly as acute as the situation in the uk brady said there are definitely pressure points emerging which are having an impact on final deliveries haulage companies have sounded the alarm in recent weeks about a long standing shortage of drivers a structural issue within the sector that has been made worse by brexit and the pandemic earlier this month hauliers told the journal that many eastern european drivers used to drive uk landbridge routes from ireland to mainland europe but since brexit those routes have become more difficult the result of extra regulatory and customs checks resulting in long delays so many drivers have gone back to poland and to the eastern bloc countries and they avoided the hassle that way wexford td verona murphy a former president of the irha said in early october speaking to the journal this week aidan flynn chief executive of the freight transport association of ireland said the industry has been highlighting this issue for years concertina effect our reference point for this is the forf√°s report from 2015 flynn said it estimated that there would be 33 000 job openings in the freight distribution sector up to 2025 he explained about 7 500 of those would be for drivers because of an ageing workforce so it s not a new phenomenon but the shortage has definitely been exacerbated by the covid 19 pandemic not just in ireland but across europe flynn added the likes of germany have a shortage of about 80 000 drivers britain has obviously highlighted the fact that they have a shortage in excess of 100 000 france has shortages and so on flynn said the situation has been made worse in the last six months due to the uncertainty within the industry he explained with many businesses closing and then starting up again and then closing due to public health restrictions however flynn said he believes the actual shortage peaked in about september yes there s gonna be challenges within the supply chain for christmas he said but they re more linked to global supply disruption it s this kind of concertina thing where you have delays and then all of a sudden you ve got lots of products being delivered at the same time i suppose there is a little bit of chaos built into the supply chain now because of the uncertainty this week minister of state for business employment and retail damien english announced that the government will scrap the quota on the number of non eu drivers allowed to work in ireland in a statement he said removing the cap will support the work of those businesses responsible for importing and exporting consumer goods and products to and from ireland flynn said the move is welcome but it s unlikely to have much of an impact in the short term the demand for the permits in the last six or seven months has increased significantly and i think removing the cap definitely helps out he said but he said that competition for drivers is a pan european and a global issue and fta ireland is focused on raising awareness of the industry domestically and trying to attract drivers on a local basis earlier this week eugene drennan president of the irish road haulage association told the journal that many businesses using trucking companies have steadfastly refused to accept any increase to transport rates despite the cost increases that trucking companies have incurred this year in the lead in to what could be a very challenging christmas flynn said the haulage sector and drivers in particular need to be afforded respect by businesses and consumers they need to understand the actual value of the haulage sector in terms of their associations and arrangements with them he said these guys are also faced with massive increases in operational expenses due to the carbon tax increases the cost of fuel as for shipping prices and transport costs the next few weeks will be telling said kevin brady with many major companies due to lock in their rate agreements with shipping companies for the coming year those deals will basically set the precedent for the rates for 2022 he said so really we re just waiting on those big ticket items to be concluded and then that sets the tone really for everybody else

it is difficult enough for an owner or breeder to have one charge develop into a starter at the breeders cup world championships consider then stud rio dois irmaos stud rdi and bonne chance farm which will have two homebred breeders cup competitors nov 6 at del mar the brazilian based breeding and racing operation whose north american arm is centered at bonne chance farm in woodford county outside lexington is enjoying a banner season in the u s with homebred turf runners in love and ivar both ticketed for the fanduel breeders cup mile presented by pdjf g1t the group also pre entered imperador for the longines breeders cup turf g1t but withdrew him from consideration oct 28 the operation s success in north america is a bounty of riches well appreciated by chief executive officer alberto figueiredo who manages bloodstock for the partners it is a dream come true for all of us the team here and the owners and the team in brazil and argentina figueiredo said of reaching the breeders cup with two horses and even arriving at the pre entry stage with three it is really difficult to put into words what we are feeling who would ever dream to have three horses together in the same year we never know when this could happen again so we must enjoy it photo anne m eberhardt alberto figueiredo with 30 mares in argentina and brazil stud rdi mainly races in argentina with its best stock if those horses show enough talent they are brought to north america to continue their careers this concept has been around for decades and figueiredo was involved in a similar plan when with rio clara thoroughbreds which sent top shelf performers such as siphon and romarin to achieve elite status in the care of california conditioner richard mandella stud rdi has itself enjoyed previous success stateside with baruta a homebred crimson tide mare who took the 2015 senator ken maddy stakes g3t with mandella and with editore a homebred redattore gelding who was a group 1 winner in brazil before winning the 2017 and 2018 berkeley handicap g3 with trainer paulo lobo we know these things are possible if things are properly done noted figueiredo we are not inventing the wheel but are trying to copy other farms that have done this we are lucky that the success has traveled to us in love an agnes gold gelding riding a three race win streak into the mile heads the duo of 5 year olds both trained by lobo ironically he was second to imperador in the first lifetime race for each in argentina after a 10 month break last year he won his second u s start but has really come to hand this season with victories in the tvg stakes at kentucky downs and the keeneland turf mile stakes g1t he has won half of his eight u s starts and banked 729 700 lifetime to date photo anne m eberhardt in love heads out to train oct 27 at the thoroughbred center we got in love here in america last year in april lobo said his first start was last year at churchill he ran very good he missed the break came from way off the pace and finished third we went to keeneland and he won very impressively that day then we stopped our horses in the winter they didn t have any problems we just rested them when he came back last april he wasn t the same horse that showed up here in the first two races we ran him at keeneland on the dirt he didn t run well we ran at churchill in an allowance he ran good then we went to the graded stakes he failed and then talking with alberto we decided let s try chicago maybe a softer spot over there and then he won but he won and if you saw him at the three eighths pole he was going to pass by them easily and he did but he kind of stopped and waited for the horse inside then we decided to put him in blinkers and maybe it s the key he went to kentucky downs and won very easily and his next race the keeneland mile he was very very impressive challenging in love in the mile is ivar also by agnes gold ivar was far more accomplished than his stablemate in argentina where he won the gran criterium g1 and estrellas juvenile g1 before heading north for the 2020 race season following an 11 month break ivar took his second u s start in allowance optional claiming company and his fourth in the shadwell turf mile stakes g1t at keeneland he ran a good fourth in last year s breeders cup mile and was most recently fourth behind in love in the keeneland turf mile for his career he has banked a tick below 727 000 we gave him a winter break after the breeders cup and brought him back in the old forester bourbon turf classic g1t and he came out with a problem from that race after finishing sixth he was 4 years old and had a splint bone it s not normal but it was minute we treated him we gave him two months off and then we spoke in the middle of the year and said let s try the breeders cup but we needed a race for him i didn t want to ship him he was coming from a long layoff we ran in the keeneland mile and he ran a very good race he had a little trouble turning for home the horse inside bumped the horse in the middle and the horse in the middle bumped my horse probably could have cost me the second place that day but we were glad he came back in perfect shape eating very happy he enjoyed this race back in keeneland i think his form is going up photo anne m eberhardt ivar during morning training oct 27 at the thoroughbred center both horses ship nov 1 to del mar and although they have made names for themselves in kentucky racing in california for the breeders cup should carry with it optimism south american imports have historically thrived in the golden state while in the care of trainers like mandella charlie whittingham ron mcanally and bobby frankel the weather over there is very similar to south america noted figueiredo the horses are used to it another key to their success is the break given to them as they acclimate to north america figueiredo noted that while a minimum rest of six months is required often south american runners will show their best efforts after a year in north america there are adjustments he said the stretches are much shorter here than in argentina and brazil the system of training and daily routine are different they need time to get better just because all the two are excelling on grass doesn t mean they will stay on that surface ivar s group 1 wins in south america came on dirt and he in particular may receive another chance on the main track you don t want to change when they re so successful on turf but it is in our plans maybe next year to try ivar and in love on dirt said figueiredo that can change a lot of ideas as to them being stallion prospects with 27 mares based in kentucky at bonne chance the former hopewell farm on pisgah pike the operation takes most of its yearlings to auction but is happy to race those that don t bring enough money as well as certain female lines it wishes to perpetuate we are trying to do a bit of everything figueiredo said they are doing all of it extraordinarily well
roy orbison in clingfilm or how i learned to stop worrying and disturb the fuck out of everyone it always starts the same way i am in the garden airing my terrapin jetta when he walks past my gate that mysterious man in black hello roy i say what are you doing in dusseldorf attending to certain matters he replies story 1 history and summary when i think of unusual sexual fetishes i think of things like bdsm or heterosexual men who enjoy it when women sodomize them with strap on dildoes i guess it s worth pointing out that i don t spend that much time thinking about sexual fetishes so perhaps it s my fault that i didn t make the effort to conceive of this one namely the arousal derived from the idea of wrapping the late roy orbison in cling film or saran wrap tm for us americans as far as i have been able to determine the roy orbison in clingfilm genre was conceived of by a young german man named ulrich haarb√ºrste it is most certainly not a joke created by one michael kelly the owner of an outrageously hilarious website that can be found at that the roy orbison in clingfilm stories happen to be hosted on mr kelly s server is i assume a coincidence if the internet way back machine is to be believed the original roic stories first appeared in late 2003 herr haarb√ºrste introduces his modest website thusly hello and welcome to my homepage my name is ulrich haarb√ºrste and i like to write stories about roy orbison being wrapped up in cling film if you have written any stories about roy being completely wrapped in clingfilm please send them to me and i may put them up on the site if you have a site with stories about other pop stars being wrapped in cling film mail me and we can exchange links what follows are seven masterpieces of extreme niche slash fiction the first five stories are called appropriately roy in clingfilm story 1 5 the final two are special entries into the series the first being roy in clingfilm in space and the second being roy in clingfilm at christmas each story contains sparse dialogue and is written in an extremely minimalistic style with the average story length being between one and a half and two pages the three lines quoted above are the beginning of the first story the slash fic that started a revolution there are three recurring characters in all seven stories first there is herr haarb√ºrste as the narrator a social misfit who seeks and finds validation in the act of wrapping roy orbison in cling film next is ulli s pet terrapin a type of sea turtle named jetta loyal to a fault but generally unwilling to put up with ulli s excesses finally and most importantly is the man himself roy orbison orbison seems very against type in the clingfilm canon whereas the real orbison is remembered as a kind and gentle soul plagued by personal tragedy the roy orbison that spends much of his time in dusseldorf is laconic aloof and actually somewhat arrogant presumably the fact that he is constantly hounded by fans looking to wrap him in cling film is the cause of this arrogance each of the stories has a few familiar elements often jetta is the motivating factor that leads to the meeting between haarb√ºrste and orbison for example it is orbison s admiration for jetta that attracts him to haarb√ºrste s house in the first story while in the third installment they meet at a pet shop while haarb√ºrste is buying food for jetta the circumstances differ but obviously at some point haarb√ºrste is either required or offers to wrap orbison in cling film uniformly he begins at the feet and works his way up when he has finished he always announces a basic variation of the statement you are now completely wrapped in clingfilm at some point after this announcement ulli is forced to unwrap orbison for some reason or another always to his dissatisfaction story synopses warning spoilers story 1 roy orbison admires jetta from a distance and agrees to enter ulli s home to look at his clingfilm collection of which ulli claims to have nearly a kilometre in the kitchen alone the two men make a wager if ulli can wrap orbison s entire body in clingfilm using only one roll he will receive free tickets for orbison s show that night if not orbison will take jetta as a lesson not to speak boastfully ulli wins but refuses to unwrap orbison the latter escapes and notifies the police causing ulli to briefly lose custody of jetta story 2 ulli and jetta are driving along the autobahn when they are frantically flagged down by a man outside of a winnebago it turns out that the winnebago belongs to roy orbison and the man is his tour manager orbison is inside clinically dead and must be transported to a hospital for recusitation ulli wraps orbison in cling film and they take him to a hospital where he is brought back ulli receives a pair of concert tickets for his troubles the first happy ending of the series story 3 ulli is in a pet shop buying food for jetta while roy orbison is buying medicine for his dog the two men argue after ulli makes an inappropriate comment about jetta prospectively eating the dog s tape worms but they are interrupted by a pair of armed robbers one of the robbers commands ulli to wrap orbison in cling film which he does and is then told to wrap himself to orbison the robbers take what they want and after the police arrive to unwrap them orbison seemingly forgives ulli and the two share a laugh story 4 ulli takes jetta to a beauty salon and discovers that roy orbison is there awaiting a massage ulli enters the massage room and lies to orbison saying that he will be unable to be covered in seaweed since a huge maritime disaster destroyed all the seaweed stock he offers instead to wrap him in cling film which orbison agrees to he makes orbison stay wrapped up for several hours until an actual employee enters the room and demands to know what is going on ulli informs her that orbison is wrapped in cling film for medical reasons but allows her to unwrap him since it is not in his nature to do so story 5 this is probably the best roic story ulli is watching television and sees an ad about herr christo a performance artist who wraps things in white sheets he is due to wrap a statue of the prince in the town square the next day with roy orbison officiating ulli decides he must go but when the ceremony begins the mayor discovers that christo has failed to arrive because he was delayed after a man entered his hotel room with a terrapin ulli volunteers his services but as he unveils the statue to wrap it in cling film as no white sheets can be found he discovers that the statue is covered with obscenities ulli and the mayor agree that the ceremony can t go on as planned but it is clear that a riot will develop if someone doesn t do something ulli volunteers to wrap roy orbison instead which both men accept the crowd breaks into a wild applause but the police arrive and it is revealed that ulli was the man who prevented christo from arriving and that he defaced the statue in order to put himself in the position to wrap orbison as the crowd clamors for the police to disarrange his clothing and banish him to a distant province ulli wakes up in a cold sweat and realizes it was all a dream or was it in space roy orbison is the captain of a spaceship and ulli is his second in command while jetta works like the ship s computer providing detailed information about the ship s status an engine comes out of alignment and orbison must exit the ship to repair it as they brought no suits with them it becomes obvious that ulli must wrap orbison in cling film so that he can survive the trip outside this done he repairs the engine but the ship is thrown into a time warp as a result of this ulli must rewrap orbison much to his delight at christmas roy orbison is ulli s neighbor and asks to borrow some kitchen necessities while the two men are chatting orbison reveals that he has forgotten to buy his mother a christmas present thinking quickly ulli says the best gift a son can give his mother is himself and orbison agrees asking ulli to wrap him in wrapping paper ulli regretfully informs him that he has no wrapping paper but offers to wrap him in cling film instead orbison agrees but another shocking discovery is made ulli has no cling film either suddenly santa claus appears and gives him a large amount of cling film much to his delight he then wraps orbison entirely in cling film which intrigues santa santa then asks to be wrapped in cling film as well and ulli obliges the final two lines need to be quoted in their entirety i place santa next to roy and stand in between them with some difficulty i wrap all three of us up together as best i can we enjoy a quiet but satisfying yuletide until people from the social services come to release us god bless us one and all spin offs an idea this good couldn t stay hidden for long ulli s site features several fan written roic stories that are lamentably not as good as his other roic pretenders include a livejournal group an roic haiku page a star trek crossover crossover a song based on a computer reading story 1 and a story that sees orbison in oslo the sky seems to be the limit for this confusing but ultimately rewarding genre of erotic fiction links the original stories fan written stories archived on ulli s site orbison in oslo star trek livejournal community haiku
u s corn based ethanol production over the last year or so has been more of a drag than a support on grain markets as demand and world economies continue to claw back from the coronavirus slump now with global energy prices at seven year highs and gasoline consumption improving profit margins for u s ethanol producers have surged lifting output near record highs the risk of strong production is that stockpiles could build excessively without equally robust demand though so far that has not been the case an increase in lagging exports could help balance any extended rise in output though two of the united states top customers have been less active u s ethanol production last week reached 1 106 million barrels per day the second best for any week on record and the second consecutive week of top level output the recent production rate is more than 10 above the late summer downturn despite the production boost stocks have mostly maintained over the last month drifting less than 1 lower in the latest week to 19 9 million barrels that is slightly above year ago levels on the same date but well below those from the three prior years although only about 10 of u s ethanol output is exported each year trade has recently been a sore spot for the industry shipments through the first eight months of the year reached 3 billion liters 796 million gallons down 10 from last year and the lowest for the period in five years brazil is part of the problem as u s ethanol imports have become more expensive than local product since the free tariff rate quota ended late last year january august u s exports to brazil normally a top two importer of the u s biofuel were down 82 from last year to an eight year low for the time frame there are some ideas that brazil may soon resume u s ethanol purchases in the meantime china had perhaps been expected to take on a bigger role in the u s market than it has after promising volumes earlier this year have not persisted chinese imports china four years ago announced plans to implement a nationwide e10 mandate by the end of 2020 but those were scrapped a couple years ago as corn stocks withered the lack of ethanol production capacity also negatively impacted the goal according to usda s beijing attache only two new ethanol production facilities have come online in china within the last year chinese production margins for corn based ethanol were terrible early this year with soaring prices of the grain and relatively weaker ethanol prices the attache forecasts china s fuel ethanol production in 2021 will drop for a second year down more than 20 from 2019 however consumption is forecast near the strong 2019 levels meaning imports are the most logical way to fill the gap back in january it was reported that china had secured about 200 million gallons 757 million liters of u s ethanol for the first half of 2021 which would slightly surpass the annual record there was a surge of u s exports to the asian country but not to the degree suggested between january and may u s ethanol exports to china reached 379 million liters though that rises to 499 million if including november and december volumes however shipments were virtually nonexistent from june through at least august and prior to last november usda s attache early last month forecast china s 2021 fuel ethanol imports at a second best 800 million liters with most originating in the united states though the latest available data suggests that may be hard to meet a potential barrier to a meaningful and sustained increase in ethanol imports is the fact that beijing s biofuel policies have been unclear and sporadically enforced for a couple of years now it is also unclear how biofuels fit in with china s stated goals of reducing carbon emissions source reuters reporting by karen braun editing by matthew lewis

wild virginia has submitted a report to the virginia department of environmental quality and state water control board summarizing thousands of public comments addressing the proposal by mountain valley pipeline to dig and blast through streams and wetlands across western virginia the board will consider the public s oral and written testimony in making a decision on a water permit for mvp in december the permit decision will fulfill the state s responsibilities under virginia law and the federal clean water act a denial by the board would serve as a veto of a related permit by the u s army corps of engineers covering the same activities wild virginia undertook this task because the deq has decided not to provide such a summary to the board as the department has traditionally done it is vital that both the board and the public get a comprehensive picture of the views expressed about this important matter this summary will help accomplish that while some documents submitted at the end of the comment period could not be acquired in time for inclusion in this review this document provides both a useful overview and much important specific information selected findings from the summary report include of 2 290 comments reviewed 2 069 90 percent oppose the project only a small number of comments reviewed specifically address the central legal question the board must answer whether the board can ensure water quality standards will not be violated almost all comments that specifically address issues that must govern the board s decision oppose approval these comments overwhelmingly describe deficiencies in the data and analysis submitted by mvp and describe serious risks to our waters some nearly certain to occur of just 33 sites where mvp has already crossed waterbodies in virginia mvp failed to give deq advance notification as required in nine instances greater than 25 percent of the time therefore deq was unable to properly monitor those risky in stream operations and pollution problems may have gone unobserved a necessary component of virginia s water quality standards the antidegradation policy to prevent harm to high quality waters was not even mentioned in deq documents and has not been addressed by data or analyses from either mvp or deq according to jacqueline goodrum conservation policy associate at wild virginia we presented all of the information and documents we could gather whether for or against project approval and did so in a straightforward manner we have also provided the board members and the public with links in the document so they have easy access to each and every comment we could acquire and can form their own conclusions we do not presume that board members will agree with our opinions or those of any other party goodrum continued however one fact seems clear to us opponents of mvp provided a huge body of evidence backed by legal analysis scientific reports and data indicating that mvp has not proven its case supporters of project approval provided very little of that type of information nor did deq cite such proofs in its recommendation to the board we prepared this document because we respect the fact that the board members donate their time and efforts for this important work and as we wrote in the report we see ourselves as partners with all who are working to protect our waters stated david sligh wild virginia s conservation director we want the facts known as widely and clearly as possible because we are confident that if the evidence is thoroughly and fairly reviewed issuance of this permit can never be supported we and thousands of other virginians have and will continue to work hard to see that the record is complete and that the truth is known the board has information that was not available to it in 2017 and that must help determine the outcome now mvp has caused much destruction and pain to local residents and water users so far and these proposals would be a major blow to our precious resources and our communities further damage must not be allowed

press release everedge global limited new research from intangible asset specialist everedge highlights the relationship between intangible assets such as data brand confidential information patents design rights systems and processes and relationships and business growth and new research from intangible asset specialist everedge highlights the relationship between intangible assets such as data brand confidential information patents design rights systems and processes and relationships and business growth and value a trend that is set to continue as digitisation accelerates in post pandemic economies commenting on the research everedge global ceo paul adams said this research affirms that intangible assets are the most important drivers of company growth and value today over the twenty years of the study the data shows how capital has consciously or unconsciously actively and disproportionately rewarded intangible asset rich companies it has done so because other things being equal companies that are able to harness the inherent scalability and differentiation of intangible assets to growth orientated business models will generate outsized performance the everedge intangible benchmarking index eibi tracks the evolution of intangible assets at both an index and sector level across four major stock indices s p 500 s p asx 200 ftse st all share index fstas and s p nzx all index between approximately 2000 and 2020 it is the first report to analyse the evolution of intangible assets as drivers of company value for global industry classification standard gics sectors in the singapore australia and new zealand indices the eibi was developed to address a gap in existing benchmarks which have traditionally focused on the increase in intangible assets as a proportion of market capitalisation however focusing solely on this metric risks conflating operating performance and financing choices to neutralise the effect of financing choices everedge has deliberately expressed intangible assets as a proportion of a company s enterprise value instead of market capitalisation which provides a more accurate measure of the capital required for any business because it includes the debt the company takes on to finance its activities adams added expressing intangible assets as a proportion of enterprise value yields a lower and slower moving number than if it was compared to equity however it is a more robust expression of the importance of intangible assets for company valuations and deliberately and perceptibly neutralises the effect of financing choices this allows for better analysis of a company s strategic position and management s build up of intangible assets for a long time analysts auditors and cfos have independently estimated the value of intangible assets without the benefit of robust benchmarks but they now have a resource that fills that gap our research delivers an in depth analysis based on reported vetted and carefully analysed data of intangible assets across four major capital markets and more than 800 companies the everedge intangible benchmarking index will become an important tool as companies and markets continue to evolve in a post pandemic economy findings from everedge intangible benchmark index index analysis the s p 500 recorded the highest proportion 85 in 2020 of intangible assets relative to enterprise value and has seen the steady growth of intangible assets as a percentage of enterprise value from 2000 to 2020 in new zealand and australia analysis of the s p nzx all index and the s p asx 200 revealed a consistent rise in the proportion of intangible assets over 15 years however in singapore the ftse st all share index showed a significant decline in intangible assets as a proportion of enterprise value over the past decade due in part to a change in the mix of companies listed in singapore and a substantial number of de listings over the period analysis also showed that growth in intangible assets as a proportion of enterprise value for s p 500 accelerated over the last five years this is mirrored by the s p nzx all index and s p asx 200 indices the findings from the eibi confirm everedge s observations from more than 2 000 client engagements over 14 years companies that identify their intangible assets and monetise them via scalable business models tend to outperform those that don t and are able to command superior enterprise values from external investors or acquirers says adams consequently these intangible asset rich companies attract more capital and thereby better perform their ultimate function of increasing shareholder value the s p nzx all index has shown a consistent rise in intangible asset value as a function of enterprise value over the last decade from a low base all sectors exhibited a consistent rise in the ratio throughout the period of the study says craig margolius head of transactions everedge this comes on the back of growth in the health care and utilities sectors led predominantly by fisher paykel healthcare meridian energy and mercury new zealand the research highlights that new zealand companies that focus on building leveraging and protecting their intangible assets along with articulating their value to consumers and investors alike are increasingly rewarded with disproportionate growth in investor capital allocation sector analysis within sectors the share of intangibles as a proportion of enterprise value has been increasing in most sectors reflecting the shifting characteristics of businesses in some sectors such as information technology it has nearly reached its theoretical maximum of 100 within markets the persistent outperformance of sectors with high intangible assets has led to a shift in the composition of the indices driving up the aggregate proportion of intangible assets as a proportion of enterprise value the everedge intangible benchmark index is available for download here

technical and commercial experience around the globe to find out more about everedge please visit www everedgeglobal com everedge annex a summary of key findings from the everedge intangible benchmark index for new zealand the s p nzx all index has shown a consistent rise in intangible asset value as a function of enterprise value from 2002 to 2020 at 45 to 63 respectively there was a noticeable tail effect from the 2007 global financial crisis that continued to affect the weighting in 2010 the timing of this recognition lagged some of the other markets however the consistent rise shows that at least a limited pool of capital within the market has pursued intangible asset rich companies compared to other indices studied the s p nzx all index s level in the contribution of intangible assets to enterprise value has risen to new highs on the back of growth in health care led predominantly fisher paykel healthcare and utilities sectors led by growth achieved by meridian energy and mercury new zealand the sectors with the highest and lowest levels of intangible assets as a percentage of enterprise value from 2002 to 2020 are year highest proportion of intangible assets against enterprise value by sector lowest proportion of intangible assets against enterprise value by sector 2020 information technology 97 consumer staples 84 health care 80 real estate 18 financials 39 materials 48 2002 information technology 58 consumer staples 25 health care 76 financials 10 real estate 10 utilities 14 the proportion of intangible assets within nzx listed companies enterprise values has become more prominent in all eleven sectors with the exception of the consumer discretionary sector 65 in 2002 to 60 in 2020 the utilities and industrial sectors combined have grown from 28 in 2002 to over 44 of the total enterprise value of the index in 2020 with the percentage of intangibles in the utilities sector reaching 58 in 2020 up from 14 in 2002 the narrowness of the nzx all share index causes it to be susceptible to rapid and dramatic change reliance on a small number of intangible asset rich companies to drive the index highlights the potential for volatility it is noted that the market has exhibited a willingness to continue to support high growth companies the new zealand market has a limited pool of capital directed to intangible asset rich companies and is capable of keeping some of these companies on shore at least for a period this highlights that these and other companies that focus on building leveraging and protecting their intangible assets along with articulating their value to consumers and investors alike are increasingly rewarded with disproportionate growth in investor capital allocation annex b selection of quotes relating to research findings from key industry commentators it is well established in recent decades that equity investors value business based on earnings potential earnings and on the capability of assets of any kind to generate and maintain earnings whether those assets are tangible or intangible is not a great concern they either perform the value enhancing function or not as the opportunities for value enhancement have shifted for many activities away from fixed assets increasing proportions of value accrue to intangibles this research maps that for a variety of equity capital markets this is simply a rational shift from what counts for less to what counts for more not just investors but also managers and boards need to follow the money and think this way too rob campbell cnzm chair of health nz skycity entertainment group nz rural land co wel group ltd tourism holdings limited ara ake chancellor of auckland university of technology owner of tutanekai investments forty years ago banks and other financial institutions could largely ignore intangible assets not so today in a truly digitised economy it is now essential for capital providers to understand both the value of intangibles and the criteria by which to lend against them this is no short term trend as capital flows increase and intangibles continue to represent an ever greater share of company value understanding and managing intangible assets is now mission critical chandu bhindi treasurer asb bank historically physical assets have been the main driver behind the value however we now live in an age where digital or intangible assets have proven to be more valuable banks generally lend money on cash flow and assets never taking into consideration the intangible asset that might have less risk or could be sold more than once should things go wrong companies that truly understand their digital footprint and intangible assets have thrived over the last few decades would a bank lend coca cola a billion dollars if they were not willing to put up any physical assets of course would the brand be the asset with the world in lockdown companies will need to be very clear on their digital narrative and how the intangible part of the business adds value how to leverage it and commercialise it a great example of this is nfts you only need to look at open sea to see the huge demand for art in a digital context the world is changing it s time to look at things differently james brown general manager fintechnz former this work is timely in view of enterprise value including intangible assets being central to the concept of sustainability being embraced by the ifrs foundation and iosco as they work to create the new international sustainability reporting standards board the initial focus is on a climate reporting standard with further work on broader esg matters it is essential that the issb also focuses from day 1 on intangibles as a major component of enterprise value this work focused on intangibles and enterprise value is closely aligned to the where the foundation of corporate reporting is moving which will assist investors with their work on how they perceive and place value on intangible assets professor peter carey director research deakin university integrated reporting centre michael bray professor of practice integrated reporting deakin university integrated reporting

among the many nicknames conjured up by his opponents empty shelves joe may be the harshest on the very dedicated u s president joe biden since taking office high inflation rates and a serious supply chain crisis linger on and empty shelves run across stores and markets nationwide the situation is expected to continue and stands to affect the christmas shopping season from mid to late december as usual china becomes the easy target some american politicians claim that the root cause of the ongoing supply chain crisis in the west lies in china s accomplishment of extreme poverty alleviation after the living standards of 1 4 billion chinese people are improved the population s consumption of food and energy has amplified a newfangled conspiracy theory sets forth that the chinese government is interfering in the production activities of enterprises in order to control the global supply chain and bring down the u s economy so that china can take over the reins and rule the world these statements do not measure up to further analysis the biggest loophole being has china really reduced its exports to the u s at a time when the u s supply chain is in dire crisis according to statistics from the general administration of customs of china china s total exports in the first half of this year reached 9 85 trillion yuan 1 54 trillion an increase of 23 8 percent over the same period in 2019 exports to the u s continued to expand and the total distribution of goods to the u s in september increased by 15 04 percent compared with august ergo if the u s is indeed experiencing a major supply chain crunch this is by no means china s fault in reality one of the major reasons is an overissue of greenbacks this is how the u s has been dealing with economic crisis overissuing using paper money to acquire solid goods from other countries and transferring inflationary pressures onto the rest of the world the latest report from the international monetary fund shows that the expected gdp growth rate of the u s in 2021 remains 6 percent on the surface the negative impact of the epidemic on the american economy is fading social demand is strong and most enterprises are once again turning a profit yet since the outbreak of covid 19 epidemic in 2020 the u s has bore witness to a somewhat bizarre phenomenon in which social production activities have in fact stagnated but the stock market still displays a rebound√¢ a continuous elevation even the wealth of the richest 1 percent in the u s has increased by more than 6 5 trillion on the other hand during the pandemic the american government implemented several policies to stimulate consumption not only directly depositing the dollar bills into every citizen s bank account but also offering a large number of relief funds to the unemployed therein hides the second problem the u s does not face a shortage of goods it faces a shortage of labor different sectors feature different degrees of labor shortages with the trade and transportation industries standing out at present it is reported that mountains of cargo are stuck at chief ports across the u s the latest data released by the u s department of labor showed that 4 3 million americans chose to quit their jobs in august the highest number since statistics were first recorded including many longshoremen and truck drivers beyond the aforesaid the factors of a weakening global production capacity and a surge in international freight rates too must be addressed while covid 19 remains the immediate cause preventing many countries from returning to full production capacity the current spike in global energy prices has dramatically increased the cost of commodity production and transportation when factories are experiencing difficulties to obtain sufficient energy and consequently face the risks of making fewer profits this will in turn affect the supply chain the u s is not alone in this regard as china is also hit hard by rising energy prices especially when it is entering central heating season the best we can do is to join hands and deal with the same challenges we all face print edition title the crunch conspiracy copyedited by elsbeth van paridon
were these ill equipped basically unarmed protesters really planning a coup by s t patrick there is a disconnect within the department of justice about the motivations of the jan 6 capitol protestors one u s attorney has been arguing in court that the qanon shaman jacob chansley aka bull horn guy case includes strong evidence including chansley s own words and actions at the capitol the intent of the capitol rioters was to capture and assassinate elected officials another assistant u s attorney is arguing that retired lt col larry brock who was carrying zip tie restraints means to take hostages he means to kidnap restrain perhaps try perhaps execute members of the u s government this goes directly against the most recent statement of the nation s top prosecutor in d c u s attorney michael sherwin whose jurisdiction the capitol protest falls within that there is no direct evidence at this point in time of kill capture teams or assassination the confusion can partially be traced to an incompetent and dishonest mainstream media msm which has done little but inflame the obediently observing masses throughout the past year it is a media that rightly so criticized donald trump s tendency to berate attack lambaste and pillory opponents into either emotional submission or frothing hatred yet it has at the same time adopted those exact tactics against mr trump and his supporters even if there were a physical threat which seems unlikely at this point the main target was republican vice president mike pence yet pence has not been the politician to use it most for political gain when sen ted cruz r texas agreed with the tweet of rep alexandria ocasio cortez r n y about starting an investigation into the decision of robinhood a commission free stock and investing app to halt trading of gamestop stock a moment of unity for which the biden team has been begging cortez responded to cruz you almost had me murdered three weeks ago so you can sit this one out democrat rep cori bush d minn moved her congressional office later in the week because bush tweeted a maskless marjorie taylor greene her staff berated me in a hallway she targeted me others on social media i m moving my office away from hers for my team s safety a videotape was later released by rep greene s office it was bush who yelled at greene in the hallway for being unmasked it was bush who instigated the confrontation yet it was bush who capitalized on the recent media narrative that all democrats are to be afraid for their lives when confronting all republicans especially those tied to support for trump joe lauria for consortium news wrote even if there were such murderous intentions it would not have amounted to a coup attempt without the backing of the military or paramilitaries and without taking over the airport and radio and tv stations these days it would probably mean taking over social media companies too the u s government and media structures are vaster and more powerful than just the legislature charging any capitol protestor with seditious conspiracy will be next to impossible as long as the justice department keeps confirming that there was no assassination threat against politicians and there was no vast right wing conspiracy to take over the country in a coup d √©tat without taking over something other than one building in washington d c even had it been a coup attempt it would have been the most poorly executed coup in history as congress could have just reconvened elsewhere with the same constitutional authority the protesters would have had the physical building but they would have none of the constitutional power the military the media major infrastructure etc lauria summed up the real plight of the protesters writing what happened at the capitol cannot be condoned but unless congress defies its oligarchic backers and serves the interests of average americans who also fund them a real insurrection may be inevitable instead of the reforms to defuse that and bring more economic justice we are witnessing a crackdown that will only further inflame the country rather than getting real stories about massive internet censorship reneging on the promise of 2 000 stimulus checks and a healthcare overhaul to combat a pandemic the media has glowed like a giddy little girl that the biden pets had arrived at the white house that joe biden had overcome a speech impediment half a lifetime ago and that hunter biden is a skilled bagel runner which did prove that he does something well other than dropping off shady laptops we have also gotten a level of fearful reportage unlike any seen in contemporary american history democrats be very afraid of trumpers because your lives are in danger they must all be expelled from every professional and public position they hold after all they have a political ideology that we as responsible mainstream media members hate freedom of the press we are reminded also allows freedom of bad press and it allows your freedom to ignore the press as more news consumers turn to individual blog sites and alternative media outlets the major media empires of years past cling to fear but it s the misplaced fear to which they cling the real fear for them is that their reporting will increasingly be considered irrelevant to real events increasingly antagonizing of the hard working middle class and increasingly less important in people s lives the market share then dwindles the ad revenues are lost and the msm then has about as much power as the whig party fear is what sells and fear is what they will keep peddling as long as it brings in eyes and dollars to their media empires s t patrick holds degrees in both journalism and social studies education he spent 10 years as an educator and

women have typically taken the backseat when it comes to participating in household finances especially in investing while the general perception particularly among men is that women do not know how to invest women too are not confident about their own financial skills while women are better at saving they are not too enthusiastic about investing because they do not know where or how to do it so should the wives make the effort to learn about investing and take on this responsibility yes they should and here s why various studies have shown that the portfolios of women investors deliver better returns than those of men for instance according to a survey by et money whose findings were released in march this year women investors have generated better returns than men every year from 2017 to 2020 in fact during the pandemic in 2020 they recorded 14 returns while men generated only 11 not just in india even in the us and uk women have performed better than men as per a 2021 women and investing study by fidelity between 2011 and 2020 in the us women s returns were 40 basis points higher than men s as per another study by warwick business school in 2018 among 2 800 investors women not only outperformed the ftse 100 over three years but also the men while men s annual returns were 0 14 over the ftse 100 those of women were 1 94 above it the reason women are able to give a better investing performance than their male counterparts could be due to their specific behavioural traits compared to men women are more risk averse trade less frequently research more diligently are more disciplined and not over confident so they tread with caution investing more in mutual funds rather than stocks remain invested for the long term without frequent trades and switches and are disciplined about their asset allocations without any knee jerk reactions or impulsive redemptions according to the university of california berkley analysis of common stock investments of men and women from over 35 000 households from 1991 1997 revealed that men traded 45 more frequently than women but women outperformed men by 0 94 per year if the wife invests the husband can remain assured that all their financial goals will be met beause women not only have an outcome based approach to investing but also a longer term view this means that since they are focused on the financial goal instead of relishing the thrill of investing they invest in a manner that helps them achieve the goals in the given time frame one of the most important reasons women should start investing is that it will help them become more involved and aware about the fi nancial dealings of the household in case of the death of husband or a debilitating illness the wife would not feel lost due to her ignorance or be forced to depend on others for fi nancial guidance she would not only be able to secure her own fi nancial future but also that of her children without being defrauded or indebted to others all of us have been in a financial dilemma when it comes to relationships how do you say no to a friend who wants you to invest in his new business venture should you take a loan from your married brother are you concerned about your wife s impulse buying if you have any such concerns that are hard to resolve write in to us at etwealth timesgroup com with wealth whines as the subject disclaimer the advice in this column is not from a licensed healthcare professional and should not be construed as psychological counselling therapy or medical advice et wealth and the writer will not be responsible for the outcome of the suggestions made in the column
salisa berrien the entrepreneur behind a startup that helps companies eliminate energy waste says she s putting to use as many crucial lessons from her family as from engineering school what we have learned from our grandparents and parents is that you have got to learn how to make something from nothing said berrien you come up with an idea that s based on a pain you have experienced or the folks around you have experienced berrien is one of a small but rising number of black founders joining the fast growing tech sector in new york as the city recently reported they come armed with ideas and energy but can encounter steep challenges in attracting start up money with the tech industry booming in the city and barely over 1 of start up investment going to black owned firms nationwide new york has a generational opportunity as one think tank executive put it to deliver on its promise of a more equitable post pandemic economy here are the stories of four of the 10 new york black owned tech start ups awarded grants of up to 100 000 and other help from google s black founders fund as they attempt to make their mark make it easy to pay workers after earning a scholarship to attend washington and lee eli polanco left the dominican republic at 18 to study economics and chinese at the college in virginia j p morgan chase snapped her up and brought her to new york where she spent about a decade focusing on innovation and technology involving payments she was the only black woman on the team just before the pandemic hit she had decided she wanted to start something from scratch and focused on a goal that would improve finances for low income workers getting them paid faster she took a sabbatical and traveled around the country focusing on the problems and opportunities in payroll disbursement eli polanco works at her blockchain security startup s office in the flatiron credit hiram alejandro dur√°n the city polanco bootstrapped the early development by putting in her own money and selling stock she also convinced a small number of companies to sign on for pilots of what would become her payments company nivelo last year she raised 2 5 million from venture funds including firstmark and barclays as well as early stage angel investors and other founders who liked her idea while she won t disclose the number of clients she says she s facilitated 17 billion in payments to workers while building out her company we want to make it as easy as possible to pay workers she said we move it from account to account faster an obvious need for tech after finishing high school in dallas andrew hill studied information management at the university of texas at austin and got a big break the giant consulting company deloitte hired him he helped start the company s deloitte digital unit for large scale technology implementation but after five years he burned out on the endless travel decided to take advantage of the company s willingness to pay for an mba and was accepted at the university of california at berkeley i have a lot of peers who didn t go to ut or berkeley he said it afforded me an opportunity to get to deloitte andrew hill is toiling on a special education app startup out of a dumbo co working office credit ben fractenberg the city just before heading to berkeley in 2014 his sister asked him to spend some time with her over the summer a district coordinator for special education in new jersey she found the system of monitoring progress of individual students allowing the team of teachers and service providers to collaborate and report to parents and administrators ridiculously complicated there was an obvious need for tech here hill said while the technology is aimed at serving all special education students black and brown students are disproportionately given that designation he notes hill spent his time at berkeley building his app to connect families and educators he won a series of competitions that helped fund the initial costs and eventually raised 2 2 million over six years lifteded had signed up 20 districts representing 130 schools when the pandemic hit and disrupted school systems reducing his client base by 50 the goal this year is to take his evolving product and land between 30 and 50 new clients this school year show people you are passionate renee king calls herself a tri state baby she was born and raised in the bronx but her mother was so determined that she get the best education possible that she kept moving her from schools in her home borough to ones in manhattan and then on to greenwich in connecticut after graduating from suny albany king joined pfizer in brooklyn and then a series of media companies where she developed the desire to start a company fundblackfounders is essentially creating a system to crowdfund the crucial friends and family round for black entrepreneurs without wealthy parents or friends her company won 50 000 in a competition that it leveraged into 1 7 million in funding for 50 black entrepreneurs the google grant will allow her to more than repeat that performance renee king of fundblackfounders credit hiram alejandro dur√°n the city king is also working with nba all star jrue holiday and two time olympic gold medalist lauren holiday to give out 1 million in grants to black led nonprofit organizations and black owned businesses in underserved areas of greater milwaukee new orleans indianapolis and los angeles fundblackfounders has hit 4 000 members who have been vetted for an idea worth funding a sign of the growing number of aspiring black entrepreneurs across the country she said she s learned that getting investors takes exceptional perseverance you have to show people what you are passionate about she said you have be the person who waits at a conference to talk to a venture capitalist after having googled and researched them and you have to keep the relationship going repurposing waste for good salisa berrien grew up in a family of seven in allentown pa and remembers how despite her father s job at a steel plant they frequently had the power turned off because there was no money to pay the bill after graduating from high school she studied mechanical engineering at the university of pittsburgh where she was the only black woman in the program she spent the first half of her career working for utilities when she decided to try the startup world and learned an important lesson negotiating for a job with a startup the company offered her 1 800 less than she was asking her prospective bosses didn t want to increase the salary at first so they offered her 1 800 shares of stock instead she said no demanded the 1 800 and got it to her everlasting chagrin eventually the company went public at 26 jumped to 52 and split its stock several times if i had taken those options i would have been an instant multi millionaire she said but where i came from i didn t know anything about the startup world she learned in 2016 she founded her own company called coi which designed to help companies eliminate energy waste by combining all the various elements of energy management rather than pay for each service her customers sign up for subscriptions the environmental impact of more efficiency could be significant since businesses waste 30 of the energy they use each year a portion of the money saved goes to underserved communities affected by climate change berrien financed the earliest stage by bootstrapping using her savings and selling stock eventually she raised 3 million in venture funding customers now total 350 she s seeking more money to build out her team to expand the platform for the 1 500 clients she needs to break even she also just received her first patent for the new technology she has employed in the business it s really how we look at detecting and eliminating energy waste in buildings and making that excess capacity available to others he said we re repurposing that waste for good and so i don t see anyone else looking at it that way

products and crude our inland business was also materially impacted by hurricane ida which made landfall near new orleans louisiana in late august this intense storm left a widespread path of destruction that ultimately resulted in closures of key waterways and many refineries and chemical plants for much of september and extending well into october we estimate the reduced demand combined with damages incurred to our fleet reduced our third quarter earnings by approximately 0 08 per share despite the challenging third quarter the inland market has improved in october with increased customer demand and our barge utilization recently rising into the high 80 range in coastal the market showed signs of improvement during the third quarter with modest increases in spot market demand and our barge utilization rising into the mid 70 range during the quarter we decided to exit hawaii and the coastal wire tank barge market incurring a one time noncash impairment charge this decision focuses our coastal business on attractive markets eliminates significant future capital outlays and removes our exposure to marketing coastal wire assets with poor market acceptance through these actions we expect our coastal business will improve its performance in 2022 and is now positioned for long term success in distribution and services improvement in oil and gas market fundamentals contributed to strong demand for new transmissions parts and service as well as continued growth in manufacturing backlog and activity as a result our oil and gas businesses returned to profitability for the first time in more than two years despite considerable supply chain delays which have deferred the delivery of several manufacturing orders into 2022 in commercial and industrial the timing of major back up power installations and seasonal increases in mobile rental fleet utilization led to strong sequential increases in power generation revenue and operating income improved thermo king product sales and peak summer refrigeration demand also contributed favorably to the quarter s results these gains were partially offset by modest reductions in marine repair activity during the quarter mr grzebinski concluded third quarter 2021 segment results marine transportation marine transportation revenues for the 2021 third quarter were 338 5 million compared with 320 6 million for the 2020 third quarter operating income for the 2021 third quarter was 16 9 million compared with 32 4 million for the 2020 third quarter operating margin for the 2021 third quarter was 5 0 compared with 10 1 for the 2020 third quarter in the inland market average 2021 third quarter barge utilization was in the low 80 range compared to the low 70 range in the 2020 third quarter during the quarter the inland market and kirby s operations were adversely impacted by the covid 19 delta variant customer activity levels were further impacted by hurricane ida which made landfall in southeast louisiana in late august shuttering almost the entire southeast louisiana refinery and chemical complex and key waterways for an extended period of time aside from the areas impacted by hurricane ida operating conditions on the inland waterways were good with favorable summer weather conditions throughout much of the quarter average spot market rates during the quarter were unchanged sequentially and compared to the 2020 third quarter term contract pricing on a few expiring contracts that renewed in the third quarter declined in the low to mid single digits on average compared to a year ago revenues in the inland market increased 3 compared to the 2020 third quarter primarily due to increased fuel rebills and barge utilization offset by lower pricing on term contracts renewed in the past year during the 2021 third quarter the inland market represented 76 of segment revenues inland s operating margin was in the mid to high single digits and was significantly impacted by hurricane ida and lower term contract pricing from the year ago period and increased maintenance in the coastal market modest demand improvements for refined products and black oil transportation contributed to increased spot market activity resulting in increased barge utilization into the mid 70 range pricing on spot and term contracts was generally stable during the quarter revenues in the coastal market increased 13 compared to the 2020 third quarter primarily due to higher fuel rebills and modest increases in spot market activity coastal represented 24 of marine transportation segment revenues during the third quarter and the business had a negative operating margin in the low single digits third quarter 2021 segment results distribution and services distribution and services revenues for the 2021 third quarter were 260 4 million compared with 176 0 million for the 2020 third quarter operating income for the 2021 third quarter was 11 0 million compared with 1 1 million for the 2020 third quarter operating margin for the 2021 third quarter was 4 2 compared with 0 6 in the 2020 third quarter in the commercial and industrial market revenues increased compared to the 2020 third quarter primarily due to improved economic activity across the u s which resulted in higher business levels in the power generation and on highway businesses increased product sales in thermo king also contributed favorably to the quarter s results the marine repair business was down year on year due to reduced service activity the commercial and industrial businesses were not materially impacted by hurricane ida with reduced marine repair activity in the louisiana service centers being offset by higher utilization in the mobile power generation rental fleet overall commercial and industrial revenues increased 20 compared to the 2020 third quarter and represented approximately 59 of segment revenues commercial and industrial operating margins were in the mid single digits in the oil and gas market revenues and operating income improved compared to the 2020 third quarter due to higher oilfield activity which resulted in increased demand for new and overhauled transmissions engines parts and service the manufacturing business although impacted by supply chain delays also experienced year on year increases in orders and deliveries of new and remanufactured pressure pumping equipment overall oil and gas revenues increased 120 compared to the 2020 third quarter and represented approximately 41 of segment revenues oil and gas operating margins were positive in the low to mid single digits one time items kirby s 2021 third quarter results were impacted by one time items related to the noncash impairment of coastal marine equipment and goodwill during the quarter the company completed the sale of its hawaii marine transportation assets including four coastal tank barges and seven coastal tugboats for cash proceeds of 17 2 million in addition the company retired 12 coastal wire tank barges and four coastal tugboats which had limited customer acceptance in today s market these events resulted in a noncash impairment charge of 121 7 million as a result of the sale of the hawaii equipment and the decision to retire additional coastal marine equipment the company concluded that a triggering event had occurred and performed interim quantitative impairment tests these tests resulted in a noncash impairment of goodwill totaling 219 million overall the company recorded non cash impairments of long lived assets related to coastal marine equipment and impairments of goodwill in the marine transportation segment totaling 340 7 million before tax 275 0 million after tax or 4 58 per share for a reconciliation of gaap earnings to non gaap earnings excluding the one time items please refer to the table on page 8 cash generation for the 2021 third quarter ebitda of 79 5 million compares with 85 7 million for the 2020 third quarter during the quarter net cash provided by operating activities was 82 6 million capital expenditures were 33 6 million and free cash flow was 49 0 million during the quarter the company sold assets with net proceeds of 22 4 million including 17 2 million for the coastal marine equipment in hawaii as of september 30 2021 the company had 54 4 million of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet and 908 0 million of liquidity available total debt was 1 208 2 million reflecting a 260 4 million reduction compared to december 31 2020 and the debt to capitalization ratio was 29 8 2021 fourth quarter outlook commenting on the 2021 fourth quarter outlook mr grzebinski said overall we expect our fourth quarter earnings to sequentially improve in marine transportation with some major refinery and chemical customers only recently resuming operations post hurricane ida and portions of the gulf intracoastal waterway still closed some of the impacts from the storm have carried into the fourth quarter despite these headwinds we have seen steady improvement in volumes and inland barge utilization during october which we expect will contribute to improved marine transportation revenue and operating income in the fourth quarter in distribution and services although the oil and gas market outlook remains strong normal seasonality in the commercial and industrial market is expected to result in sequentially lower segment results in the fourth quarter additionally supply chain issues continue to constrain our businesses and will likely delay some oem product sales and deliveries of manufactured equipment into 2022 finally early in the fourth quarter kirby acquired an energy storage systems manufacturer based in texas which has been a key partner in the development of our new power generation solutions for electric fracturing equipment this acquisition will be important to the development of kirby s energy storage solutions for the oilfield industrial applications and marine transportation in inland marine kirby s barge utilization which is currently in the high 80 range is expected to remain strong for the duration of the fourth quarter as louisiana refinery and petrochemical plants restart and customers boost production levels to meet pent up demand while ongoing navigational issues in the wake of hurricane ida which have resulted in extended closures of key waterways and contributed to some increases in barge utilization should subside the onset of seasonal winter weather and continued economic growth should result in improved barge utilization overall increased inland activity levels should yield further improvements in the spot market which currently represents approximately 35 of inland revenue and contribute to improved revenues and operating margins during the fourth quarter and into 2022 term contracts that renewed lower over the past year should reset to reflect the improved market conditions overall inland revenues are expected to increase in the fourth quarter with operating margins around 10 in coastal marine market conditions are expected to modestly improve in the fourth quarter combined with the recent sale of the hawaiian marine equipment and the retirement of underutilized barges coastal barge utilization is expected to be near 90 in the fourth quarter although the hawaii equipment has been sold the company will charter and continue to operate the assets until existing customer contracts expire at the end of 2021 elsewhere in coastal planned shipyard activity on several large capacity barges will likely result to an overall sequential revenue reduction in the mid single digits during the fourth quarter with operating margins at or slightly below breakeven in distribution and services seasonality in the commercial and industrial market including reduced marine repair activity lower demand for thermo king refrigeration parts and service and reduced utilization of the power generation rental fleet are all expected to contribute to sequential reductions in revenue and operating income in the fourth quarter in the oil and gas market strong commodity prices and oilfield activity levels are expected to yield robust demand for new transmissions service and parts for the duration of the year in manufacturing activity is also expected to remain strong driven by an increasing backlog of environmentally friendly pressure pumping equipment frac related power generation equipment and remanufacturing of existing conventional equipment however increasing oem supply chain issues are expected to delay some sales into 2022 and result in a sequential reduction in oil and gas revenues and operating margins overall compared to the 2021 third quarter distribution and services revenues are expected to decline modestly with operating margins in the low to mid single digits kirby expects 2021 capital spending to range between 120 to 130 million with the midpoint representing a year on year reduction of more than 15 approximately 10 million of the spending is associated with the construction of new inland towboats and approximately 95 to 100 million is associated with capital upgrades and improvements to existing inland and coastal marine equipment and facility improvements the balance of approximately 15 to 20 million largely relates to new machinery and equipment facility improvements and information technology projects in distribution and services and corporate overall kirby expects to generate net cash provided by operating activities of 380 million to 410 million with free cash flow of 250 million to 290 million in 2021 mr grzebinski concluded while the emergence of the covid 19 delta variant and hurricane ida delayed our recovery we firmly believe that kirby is well positioned for significant growth in 2022 and beyond throughout the pandemic we have taken the necessary actions to restructure poor performing businesses retire aging and underutilized equipment improve our product offerings and realign our cost structure through strict capital discipline and intense focus on cash flow generation we have significantly reduced our debt and have increased our liquidity firmly placing the company in a strong position to act on strategic growth opportunities with continued economic improvement anticipated going forward and expectations that global energy demand will meet or exceed pre pandemic levels in 2022 we are excited about kirby s future earnings potential source kirby corporation
this early roadster from porsche history was famed for two things performance on the track and the death of james dean but it was the 90 units limited production that made it such a desired vehicle and with so many replicas with the porsche 550 spyder porsche proved that it deserves the sportscar manufactured badge ferry porsche designed the small roadster especially for racing while the work on the car started in 1951 the carmaker unveiled it at the 1953 paris motor show it was small light and powerful enough for its approximately 550 kilos 1 212 lbs hence its nameplate with such a limited production number there s no wonder that dozens of manufacturers started building replicas after the famous roadster and selling it for cheaper than the original according to forbe s a genuine 1955 porsche 550 spyder has an estimated value of 6 million so that would be a garage queen or a piece of art in an exhibition the vehicle shown here on the other hand is a replica but it is not just some build around the corner in an unknown shop but by special edition of bremen indiana sold by dsfm2005 in huston texas they built the vehicles based on the 1955 beck chassis and fitted it with a subaru naturally aspirated engine the flat four water cooled four mill is paired with a four speed transaxle gearbox that sends 170 hp to the rear wheels what makes this beck s spyder so unique is its light fiberglass bodywork and the custom interior while some might not think that it s a fast vehicle the 5 8 seconds needed for it to rocket from zero to 60 mph 0 97 kph might change their minds about this replica spyder the car s exterior is painted in silver with gold lettering for the spyder on the front fenders a set of red stripes adorns the rear quarter panels behind the vehicle a single center mounted exhaust pipe gives the car a nice flat engine sound as for the interior special edition added a set of leather wrapped bucket seats with a race harness that matched the look of the original porsche 550 spyder the car also features a hidden am fm cd stereo for rainy days a removable black soft top is included in the sale at the time of writing special edition asked for a stock beck spyder for 56 000 but the vehicle shown here has a few extras for example the quaife limited slip differential is worth 2 000 and the nardi steering wheel is 475 also the manufacturer has a backlist order of at least 36 months thus there s no wonder that the bid for the shown vehicle exceeded 46 550 at the time of writing less than 20 hours before the hammer s drop last but not least the subaru engine has only 366 miles 589 km since it was rebuilt

in february of 2020 renelle collins had never laced up a pair of roller skates but somehow she knew she needed them to be honest i just thought they were the most beautiful things i ve ever seen said collins no relation to this writer a toronto resident who ordered herself a pair that same month as impulse purchases go it was a prescient bit of retail therapy by march well we all know what happened and in those first few months of covid 19 lockdown the world was already pining for freedom escape an elusive feeling that was captured in just about every roller skating video cropping up on tiktok how else to explain the roller skating boom of the summer of 2020 or rather the boom in roller skating content especially as it proliferated on social media on instagram and tiktok roller dancers including oumi janta and ana coto saw their followings swell in coto s case into the millions the latter slid into a music video with dua lipa a pop star whose disco revival style had been channelling roller rink esthetics since the before times and indeed there had been hints of a resurgence of the sport pre pandemic harley quinn and co were skating circles around the baddies in birds of prey s climactic battle royale february 2020 and the kids on euphoria weren t too cool to hang out at the roller rink 2019 for quad wheel enthusiasts however roller skating culture wasn t something to get nostalgic over it had never truly faded away especially within the black american community the hbo documentary united skates covers that history thoroughly and was nominated for an emmy in summer of 2020 back to collins for a moment and the thought that was running through her mind in the early days of the pandemic for whatever reason she was on the same mission as a lot of folks she wanted skates and a place to use them and because the only thing more fun than roller skating is roller skating with other people she would have to recruit some like minded pals collins whipped together a facebook group and labelled it roller skate toronto so named because it s the first thing anyone in the area might peck into google i was thinking it was just going to be me and maybe like 10 other people she said as of publishing there are more than 3 400 members and through the last several months when there s been relatively little to do in downtown toronto you could at least find a place to roller skate thanks in no small part to the information being shared through that group if the world was desperate to own skates in 2020 it was 2021 when people finally gave them a spin according to renelle collins fifth from left this photo was taken in june 2020 at the first roller skate toronto meet up roller skate toronto facebook where s everybody skating through word of mouth unused hockey rinks and other patches of unclaimed concrete have become open air roller palaces in toronto a sheltered rink at greenwood park is one such example as is a ring of pavement at college park a high traffic spot where roller skaters share space with skateboard kids preschoolers on scooters and any number of bystanders trying to navigate the melee on their way to marshalls beyond those diy alternatives roller skaters also had the option of hitting up the bentway where retro rolla a shop run out of a shipping container was renting colourful quad wheel skates by the hour this summer they plan to return in spring of 2022 in august the galleria mall parking lot was transformed into the dusty star drive in diner a pop up event that boasted carhops and roller disco tickets sold out and organizers staged a second edition near kipling station in late september even the city of toronto launched a roller skating initiative this year earmarking nine public sites for free drop in programs according to a city rep it was a response to the activity s growing popularity and while the last official session of the summer was on sept 11 the fun kept on rolling as part of openstreetsto there was a skate party complete with dj at the humber bridge parking lot sept 26 skaters at the bentway in toronto during the summer of 2021 a pop up shop called retro rolla offered skate rentals on site brock wunderlich retro rolla of course that s just a slice of what s happening in one city people are roller skating just about everywhere in many cases they re doing it outside pushed outdoors by the pandemic if not the general scarcity of covered rinks and if the summer of 2021 is remembered as that time when roller skaters conquered the sidewalks it s because a lot of those folks waited an entire year to finally have fun on eight wheels worth waiting out a worldwide shortage of all the pandemic related supply issues the worldwide shortage of roller skates attracted plenty of attention in the summer of 2020 and you can bet canadian shoppers were on waiting lists for candy coloured quad wheels to call their own specialty retailers across the country couldn t keep their recreational skates in stock coffin skate shop in halifax retro rollers in southern ontario toe stop derby shop and bad girlfriend skates in the edmonton area nerd roller skates in calgary rollergirl ca in vancouver all of those stores told cbc life their sales surged in the spring of that year with most reporting unprecedented highs at the end of the month of march it started to pick up and then it just kept picking up said claudia garcia owner of toe stop derby shop like the other retailers shortages stalled her sales for a time and yet 2020 was her best year ever this far into 2021 she said she s on track to triple that record in nearby morinville alta lesley mcdonald owner of bad girlfriend skates said business has been so strong during the pandemic that she helped her brother open his own shop elsewhere in the province hinton s tzzz roller skates it s the first time that run into other roller skaters at our local parks and it s awesome dani peddigrew owner of the battery skate shop and as all that coveted gear made its way onto the feet of consumers something incredible began happening on canadian streets dani peddigrew operates the battery skate shop in st john s i ve been involved in my local roller derby league for seven years now and i ve never seen anything like it she said in an email it s the first time that run into other roller skaters at our local parks and it s awesome stephanie coffin co founder of coffin skate shop in halifax said she s placing larger orders than ever to stay on top of demand and in summer 2020 her business launched a couple of new ideas while waiting for long delayed shipments to serve all the local newbs who were clamouring to try the sport they now offer skate rentals and the store also began teaching classes something garcia s tried in edmonton too it s a direct response from people coming into our store and asking for lessons said coffin it s not even a subtle thing people purchase their skates and they say ok now what now what do i do now what learn to skate for most people their lessons start online search roller skating on your platform of choice and you ll turn up someone like michka moon aka retroroller a toronto based skater who began making tiktok tutorials during the pandemic as of writing her community there has grown to more than 200 000 followers at first tiktok was a means of documenting her progress she d record herself roller dancing on the spot in her bedroom on her porch on a favourite ice rink in her neighbourhood but the platform also opened up a new side hustle teaching throughout the summer she was leading in person classes for the retro rolla pop up at the bentway the fact they share extremely similar brand names was pure coincidence she said and all summer long her classes were sold out there s so many more skaters now and i see roller skating all over said moon even when i m driving down the street i ll see a roller skater and it makes me so happy martina emard said she s watched the same thing happen more than 2 500 kilometres away in lethbridge alta emard or cherri blaster as she s known in roller derby circles founded roller skate lethbridge in 2016 then called learn to rollerskate yql and she s been teaching classes and organizing roller dance parties in the city since then but she s witnessed a special rush of interest during the pandemic what i m really seeing is a lot of new faces like a lot of people that are messaging me i just got my roller skates i want to learn she said cherri blaster martina emard left dances with abigail reimer at the end of summer skate party in lethbridge alta the event was held at casa lethbridge on aug 28 2021 cassandra navratil salt birch photography and students are coming to her from beyond southern alberta earlier this year she began leading virtual lessons through a vancouver island based club roller skate victoria i have people from cuba and the u s attending my classes she said if you would ve told me 10 years ago that i d be teaching roller skating online i d be like what that s crazy for the most part though emard teaches irl when restrictions were in place she moved her classes outdoors something she plans to continue next summer regardless of whether the pandemic requires it it is just really nice to skate outside she said you get that air flowing through your hair it s just lovely but in a lot of circumstances skating outdoors is simply the only option skate somewhere anywhere even pre covid finding an indoor rink was tough said emard she s rented alternative venues in the past a dance studio a warehouse everyone s always looking for that permanent space she said garcia is on track to open an indoor roller rink in edmonton this fall but she said she s found it tricky to organize outdoor meetups in the city and though her shop was able to stake out some pavement for summer lessons a parking lot at the telus world of science most public ice rinks the obvious option are off limits many are grown over with grass she explained and there s one in her area that s been filled with sand for beach volleyball as for the tennis courts local bylaws state that those are for tennis only other places are a little more amenable to folks on wheels in london ont the ice skating trail at storybook gardens got a summer weather makeover reopening in july as the humpty dumpty roller rink that same month a group of roller skating seniors in small town tillsonburg ont made local headlines when they successfully petitioned their town s rec department to throw a roller disco in a freshly paved parking lot and then there are the municipalities that hardly need persuading when the pandemic s officially over the mayor of guelph ont wants to throw a giant skate party or so he tweeted make room for more dancers in calgary the quest for concrete has forged a thriving skate scene the calgary roller skate culture is ridiculously awesome right now said emard rattling off the names of several online groups and diy organizations bringing skaters together true north skaters calgary roller skate fresh rollers and more and yet the city doesn t have an indoor roller rink in 2018 one classic local venue lloyd s roller rink shut down after 53 years in business it s where olivia walker got hooked on roller dancing six years ago i just fell in love with the music the lights the people the sound the sound of wheels rolling around on the floor she said since then she s travelled to the u s and the u k to learn more about roller dancing and she s brought those international moves back to her students in alberta with the rink closing down it s kind of brought the roller skate community here closer together said walker we ve had to find venues and like come together and figure out a way where we can still skate for her part she ll try almost anything that involves a pair of quad wheels path skating roller skating on outdoor trails park skating roller skating in skateboard parks she ll pass on roller derby however i m more of a lover she said laughing i don t like to be aggressive but according to her if you want to roller skate in calgary there s something for everybody and the sport is still growing when i go out now i pass by dozens of people on quad skates said walker and she wants to see the scene get stronger especially when it comes to roller dance back in walker s newbie days when she first started frequenting lloyd s she knew there had to be something more to the sport that skating around in a loop in search of new moves she d spend hours on youtube that s when she stumbled on footage of soul skate a long running party out of detroit i was like i want that i want to be in a community like that said walker as she dove into researching the history of roller skating in the states and the ties to black music and culture what she learned was a revelation with the rink closing down it s kind of brought the roller skate community here closer together olivia walker roller skater i actually would love to see more bipoc people on skates she said i am a person of colour myself and ultimately her goal is to nurture a local skate community where everyone people of all ages abilities and cultures get dancing that is something that was not part of the rink culture here she said here it was more shuffle skating going around in a circle there was really nobody dancing in the middle when i started going to lloyd s walker said that s why she teaches more and more people are doing dance routines and dancing together but i don t think we re quite there she said i want to help build that it isn t from the latest tiktok video as more people learn how to do the moonwalk and electric slide on their roller skates alisa luke wants newbies to consider where those moves originated it isn t from the latest tiktok video she said and that s why her vancouver based crew bad bounce bipoc skaters has made education part of its mission the roller skating content that s booming on social media the techniques the music the style it all owes a debt to black roller skaters across the united states we absolutely want to share that and want people to learn from that and realize that this isn t just a cool new thing that happened overnight she said the reason why you re enjoying doing this today is because this community kept it alive on social bad bounce shares plenty of memes about roller skating history luke was new to the sport when she learned those lessons herself and the knowledge was empowering she s roller skated for nearly a decade and it s roller derby that first got her on wheels it s a sport that s proud of its inclusive culture she said but that inclusion is very much body positivity gender and sexuality she added and in all the years she played it was rare to meet black skaters like herself but then luke heard about jam skating an often acrobatic genre of roller dancing that emerged from black roller skating communities in the 90s in my downtime i used to watch a lot of videos online of jam style dance skaters skate parties she said and i quickly realized that roller skating itself had always been a source of joy for the black community through all the struggles and strife knowing that it was so steeped in history i mean it was a beautiful thing she started immersing herself in whatever she could learn about black skate culture online like this is my happy place roller skating itself had always been a source of joy for the black community through all the struggles and strife knowing that it was so steeped in history i mean it was a beautiful thing alisa luke co founder bad bounce bipoc skaters but the reality she found in vancouver was anything but luke talked about hitting up a local roller rink with some buddies in the before times their first impression of the place was meh the music was undanceable but that was nothing compared to what they witnessed next the party was a costume night she recalled some people prancing around wearing afro wigs and other people had blackface she said i felt like it was a hostile territory incidents like that convinced luke she d have to make her own safe space to skate and by june of 2020 she and three friends jessie wilson mariana menendez and katya isichenko co founded bad bounce with the mission to make skating more welcoming and accessible to bipoc folks the black lives matter demonstrations were at their height roller skating was fully trending on social alongside posts calling out appropriation of black culture the least they could do was open their crew to some new pals luke estimates they now have around 80 members who come out to dance at regular meetups which they hold in different spots around the lower mainland and if beginners can t get access to equipment bad bounce will hook them up the founders of vancouver s bad bounce bipoc skaters l r jessie wilson alisa luke katya isichenko mariana menendez courtesy of alisa luke in calgary walker described a similar pay it forward ethos among roller skaters you want to give back and turn more people onto the love of skating so you share your knowledge she said i like to think that it s a community of people who just want to meet up and see each other as well why s it worth risking a broken tailbone for a solo sport one that grew while the world was in solitary confinement at that there s something oddly social about roller skating and for a lot of beginners that s what makes it a hobby worth busting your tailbone to learn joshua harper is something of a local celebrity around guelph ont last june he was grooving by himself outside city hall too caught up in a carefree skate session to realize the mayor was posting video to facebook the clip wound up making local headlines and people loved it i would skate around town and people would stop said harper oh you re the guy from the news but he was still a relative novice when that moment went viral he had only started roller skating at the very beginning of the pandemic egged on by a cousin and eventually a crew of friends to fend off the lockdown blahs they challenged each other to level up their skills there s always something else you can learn you can always get better he said and then i can share it with my loved ones and i can teach people it was honestly perfect by that summer harper and his friends took their skates out of the house and started hunting for any skate able surface within driving distance from pier 8 in hamilton to a roller rink in napanee more often than not though he s making a trip to toronto i mean downtown toronto it s a city made of concrete he said sometimes i wonder if the pandemic didn t hit would i have skated and honestly maybe not no it was kind of the perfect time right skate for life skating has been a bright spot during emmie tsumura s pandemic as well the toronto based artist has only been on wheels for three months now but she loves to practice at greenwood park as soon as i bring my speaker out and put music on all the kids come out and start skating too said tsumura who s also connected with a lot of new roller skating buds via instagram where she s been dutifully charting her progress artist emmie tsumura all laced up and ready to roller skate at toronto s greenwood park emmie tsumura it s brought a lot of people together in my small world she said and it s brought her a lot of joy too this time last year tsumura was undergoing cancer treatment now in recovery roller skating is adding much needed fun to her physio routine sure she s had a few wipeouts along the way but they ve been worth it it s good to know that you can fall and get back up again she said and she has every intention to keep her green apple licious beauties laced up through the winter though the snow will probably drive her practice sessions inside her apartment sometimes i wonder if the pandemic didn t hit would i have skated and honestly maybe not no it was kind of the perfect time right joshua harper roller skater roller skating doesn t stop when summer ends and some folks aren t shy about sub zero conditions i don t let weather stop me usually from getting my skate on laughed walker if her favourite skate park is iced over the folks in her circle will clear it themselves if they have to people have snowblowers people have propane torches she said we do skate all year round and maybe by the summer of 2022 there will be even more new skaters on the sidewalk wobbling like baby deer in suede high top boots said harper i never plan to stop skating for the rest of my life to be honest it s my new lifestyle and i just plan to continue to get better
on september 15th new york based amc cinemas announced its intention to accept payment from customers using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by the end of 2021 the company s ceo adam aron had this to say on twitter customers of the popular us cinema chain will soon be able to pay for movie tickets and snacks using bitcoin and a variety of other cryptocurrencies as well as us dollars it follows hot on the heels of the entire nation of el salvador adopting bitcoin as legal tender throughout the nation earlier this month it also follows a similar announcement from walmart earlier in the week that suggested they d start accepting payments in litecoin an announcement that was later exposed as fraudulent if creatively and diligently executed as scams go so why now what does amc know that other businesses don t is this a shrewd business move or simply a bid for publicity is it a desperate bid to keep themselves on top of the resurgent wave that s seen their corporate fortunes improve throughout 2021 after their stock was pumped by the r wallstreetbets crowd a blockbuster move the announcement may benefit amc in various ways don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free first and foremost it keeps the company in front of mind for its investors the financial markets and customers alike when bitcoin became legal tender in el salvador social media was awash with posts from those who d paid for coffee or breakfast using bitcoin some customers and investors are attracted to novelty as much as anything else the cinema chain has had a record year financially having witnessed its stock price soaring from 2 at the start of 2021 to over 62 in june a significant factor in this growth was the meme stock craze of early 2021 that saw struggling companies like amc and gamestop having their stock price inflated significantly through the coordinated actions of private traders since this turn of fortune the company has explored ways of maintaining public interest including offering free popcorn to its shareholders accepting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may well attract further investment from crypto enthusiasts who are usually keen to encourage the adoption of cryptocurrency within the general public this certainly happened when tesla announced plans to accept bitcoin in payment for vehicles there were a flurry of posts on twitter from those sharing screenshots of their vehicles ordered and paid for using bitcoin conversely when elon musk backtracked on accepting bitcoin there were many orders petulantly cancelled too finally there s the benefit for amc of potentially accumulating a holding of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a means of diversifying its balance sheet bitcoin itself is up by over 4 900 in the last five years and has more than doubled in value in 2021 many businesses including microstrategy tesla and square have invested some of their corporate reserves in bitcoin as a means of hedging against inflation amc might view this as a means of accumulating and holding cryptocurrency and potentially leveraging future increases in its price quite why the cinema chain has chosen to accept multiple cryptocurrencies rather than selecting one is yet to become clear maybe that s about diversification and hedging their bets too maybe it s a play for publicity and to win favour with multiple tribes in the crypto community we can be a fickle and tribal bunch early adopters el salvador adopting bitcoin as legal tender demonstrates that entire nations can transition to accepting bitcoin and cryptocurrency payments with ease but for now amc is an early adopter in the usa it joins companies like paypal and square that have announced the facility for customers to conduct transactions in bitcoin tesla continues to hold bitcoin in its corporate reserves even though they keep flip flopping over accepting it as payment elon musk has recently hinted that they may start accepting it again the oakland a s baseball team has also experimented with accepting bitcoin in payment for suites at their home stadium new york giant saquon barkley has opted to be paid his future endorsements worth over 10 million per year in bitcoin such signs point to a gradual widening of adoption and acceptance of cryptocurrency in wider society and amongst corporations they re outliers at this point but things have to start somewhere amc may have sealed its place as a visionary for getting into crypto early or maybe they re just doing what they can to remain front of mind for consumers and investors and taking whatever steps they can to get coverage in the media either way it will be interesting to see whether their plan becomes a reality and customers are able to pay for tickets and popcorn

the perspective atlanta georgia november1 2021 the liberian people s party lpp calls on our liberian lawmakers to encourage the national social security and welfare corporation nasscorp to reduce risky portfolios or private equity such as real estate and invest into stocks bonds etc the general audit commission of liberia gac in its audit report dated october 2020 for the fiscal period ended on 6 30 2019 and 6 30 2018 stated that the entity reported usd 141m assets available for benefits or which nasscorp called total reserve what is the purpose of nasscorp long before liberia enacted its first pension act in 1976 which was revised in 2016 europe envisioned the concept and north america adopted it in the 1930s then as it is now everyone agrees that it has become difficult for siblings and or communities to finance the costs of living of injured employees retired workers and their dependents therefore the government should create a susu type organization since poor employees might find it difficult to individually accumulate adequate savings the employee retired entity is responsible to collect withholdings from employees and employers management shall invest the net withholdings into less risky portfolios but yield a profitable rate of returns instead of reporting a profitable rate of return on investment nasscorp s rate of return was 2 3 5m 141m see page 4 audit report 1 nasscorp earned 2 3m investment income from 6 7m invested in securities of the liberia bank for investment and development lbdi see pages 22 29 2 nasscorp generated 0 6m rental income from real estate investment of 35m 49m minus 13m invested in medical diagnostics center the 49m includes the buildings used by the liberian revenue authority and 19 additional real estates see page 29 3 nasscorp received 0 4m interest income from 62m investment 69m minus 6m invested in lbdi the 69m includes 40m lent to the gol and 3m loaned to the central bank of liberia gol and cbl did not pay interest income see page 23 4 nasscorp generated 0 05m from other income from other assets is nasscorp s 2 rate of return acceptable yes if a significant portion of the investment were stocks bonds etc since the 2 is within the average range of 5 according to private equity however nasscorp invested into risky portfolios as per the list below a nasscorp bought usd 40m of liberian government t bills and treasury notes which is 28 40m 141m but nasscorp did not report usd 8m 20 of usd 40m as interest income received or interest income to be received in exchange for buying the government s promissory notes see page 23 of the audit report b nasscorp recorded usd 23m as receivable and prepayment which is 20 of the usd 141m assets available for benefits nasscorp did not record interest income see page 23 c nasscorp invested usd 14m into real estate located at the elwa and tubman boulevard paynesville which is leased to the liberian revenue authority a government agency which is 10 of 141m worse the government has not paid rent for two years usd 1 3m and usd 0 7m for 6 30 19 and 6 30 18 respectively see page 32 of the audited report d nasscorp invested usd 14m into real estate property that it uses as headquarters which is 10 of the usd 141 assets available for benefits see page 29 e nasscorp invested usd 13m into medical diagnostic center jamale nasscorp did not report any income dividend from subsidiary capital from this investment which is 9 of the 141m see page 29 why nasscorp continues to invest 49 i e 20 10 10 and 9 of its funds into private equity i e risky portfolios even though it generates 2 or better yet how come other pension funds generate a 12 5 to 15 rate of return from the same type of portfolios www oecd org daf pension pensionmarkets table 3 1 on page 6 shows that pension funds generated 12 7 to 15 the table did not provide information on how well african countries performed with private equity however african countries invested in private equity ranged from unclear to 2 5 and 10 please see page 15 within www oecd org daf pension pensionmarkets ghana did not authorize a specific percent while botswana authorized 2 5 percent to private equity and pension funds in kenya were allowed to allocate 10 in private equity it is true that ghana s allocation to private equity was unclear but it invested 10 in stocks and 74 in bills and bonds according to figure 2 on page 4 within this report pension funds in jamaica invested 40 in stocks and 54 in bonds while namibia invested 55 in equity and 40 in bonds pension funds around the world invested 74 in equity and bonds in 2020 the report stated real estate offers predictable cash flow but it has limited transparency thus experts link it to corruption according to www researchgate net signup signup html also it is not easily exchanged into liquid assets other factors that affect the values of real estate include political crisis chaos rallies military insurrection etc further volcanoes earthquakes floods etc could affect the values of real estate if liberians are to benefit from their investment lpp recommends these measures regulatory commission to regulate and supervise the functions of nasscorp reduce the 11 eleven member board members to five and select a six member regulatory commission civil society employees and employers should appoint one member of a regulatory commission and one member of the board of directors the president of the republic of liberia shall appoint the remaining members of the regulatory commission and board of directors the regulatory commission should be responsible to approve the percent of private equity the pension funds can purchase the president of the republic of liberia should appoint a special investigation team to review nasscorp investment portfolios the regulatory commission should advise and recommend the foreign investment portfolios the pension funds can purchase especially since liberia does not have

the everyday practical activity of tribesmen reproduces or perpetuates a tribe this reproduction is not merely physical but social as well through their daily activities the tribesmen do not merely reproduce a group of human beings they reproduce a tribe namely a particular social form within which this group of human beings performs specific activities in a specific manner the specific activities of the tribesmen are not the outcome of natural characteristics of the men who perform them the way the production of honey is an outcome of the nature of a bee the daily life enacted and perpetuated by the tribesman is a specific social response to particular material and historical conditions the everyday activity of slaves reproduces slavery through their daily activities slaves do not merely reproduce themselves and their masters physically they also reproduce the instruments with which the master represses them and their own habits of submission to the master s authority to men who live in a slave society the master slave relation seems like a natural and eternal relation however men are not born masters or slaves slavery is a specific social form and men submit to it only in very particular material and historical conditions the practical everyday activity of wage workers reproduces wage labor and capital through their daily activities modern men like tribesmen and slaves reproduce the inhabitants the social relations and the ideas of their society they reproduce the social form of daily life like the tribe and the slave system the capitalist system is neither the natural nor the final form of human society like the earlier social forms capitalism is a specific response to material and historical conditions unlike earlier forms of social activity everyday life in capitalist society systematically transforms the material conditions to which capitalism originally responded some of the material limits to human activity come gradually under human control at a high level of industrialization practical activity creates its own material conditions as well as its social form thus the subject of analysis is not only how practical activity in capitalist society reproduces capitalist society but also how this activity itself eliminates the material conditions to which capitalism is a response daily life in capitalist society the social form of people s regular activities under capitalism is a response to a certain material and historical situation the material and historical conditions explain the origin of the capitalist form but do not explain why this form continues after the initial situation disappears a concept of cultural lag is not an explanation of the continuity of a social form after the disappearance of the initial conditions to which it responded this concept is merely a name for the continuity of the social form when the concept of cultural lag parades as a name for a social force which determines human activity it is an obfuscation which presents the outcome of people s activities as an external force beyond their control this is not only true of a concept like cultural lag many of the terms used by marx to describe people s activities have been raised to the status of external and even natural forces which determine people s activity thus concepts like class struggle production relations and particularly the dialectic play the same role in the theories of some marxists that original sin fate and the hand of destiny played in the theories of medieval mystifiers in the performance of their daily activities the members of capitalist society simultaneously carry out two processes they reproduce the form of their activities and they eliminate the material conditions to which this form of activity initially responded but they do not know they carry out these processes their own activities are not transparent to them they are under the illusion that their activities are responses to natural conditions beyond their control and do not see that they are themselves authors of those conditions the task of capitalist ideology is to maintain the veil which keeps people from seeing that their own activities reproduce the form of their daily life the task of critical theory is to unveil the activities of daily life to render them transparent to make the reproduction of the social form of capitalist activity visible within people s daily activities under capitalism daily life consists of related activities which reproduce and expand the capitalist form of social activity the sale of labor time for a price a wage the embodiment of labor time in commodities saleable goods both tangible and intangible the consumption of tangible and intangible commodities such as consumer goods and spectacles these activities which characterize daily life under capitalism are not manifestations of human nature nor are they imposed on men by forces beyond their control if it is held that man is by nature an uninventive tribesman and an inventive businessman a submissive slave and a proud craftsman an independent hunter and a dependent wage worker then either man s nature is an empty concept or man s nature depends on material and historical conditions and is in fact a response to those conditions alienation of living activity in capitalist society creative activity takes the form of commodity production market production of marketable goods and the results of human activity take the form of commodities marketability or saleability is the universal characteristic of all practical activity and all products the products of human activity which are necessary for survival have the form of saleable goods they are only available in exchange for money and money is only available in exchange for commodities if a large number of men accept the legitimacy of these conventions if they accept the convention that commodities are a prerequisite for money and that money is a prerequisite for survival then they find themselves locked into a vicious circle since they have no commodities their only exit from this circle is to regard themselves or parts of themselves as commodities and this is in fact the peculiar solution which men impose on themselves in the face of specific material and historical conditions they do not exchange their bodies or parts of their bodies for money they exchange the creative content of their lives their practical daily activity for money as soon as men accept money as an equivalent for life the sale of living activity becomes a condition for their physical and social survival life is exchanged for survival creation and production come to mean sold activity a man s activity is productive useful to society only when it is sold activity and the man himself is a productive member of society only if the activities of his daily life are sold activities as soon as people accept the terms of this exchange daily activity takes the form of universal prostitution the sold creative power or sold daily activity takes the form of labor labor is a historically specific form of human activity labor is abstract activity which has only one property it is marketable it can be sold for a given quantity of money labor is indifferent activity indifferent to the particular task performed and indifferent to the particular subject to which the task is directed digging printing and carving are different activities but all three are labor in capitalist society labor is simply earning money living activity which takes the form of labor is a means to earn money life becomes a means of survival this ironic reversal is not the dramatic climax of an imaginative novel it is a fact of daily life in capitalist society survival namely self preservation and reproduction is not the means to creative practical activity but precisely the other way around creative activity in the form of labor namely sold activity is a painful necessity for survival labor is the means to selfpreservation and reproduction the sale of living activity brings about another reversal through sale the labor of an individual becomes the property of another it is appropriated by another it comes under the control of another in other words a person s activity becomes the activity of another the activity of its owner it becomes alien to the person who performs it thus one s life the accomplishments of an individual in the world the difference which his life makes in the life of humanity are not only transformed into labor a painful condition for survival they are transformed into alien activity activity performed by the buyer of that 1abor in capitalist society the architects the engineers the laborers are not builders the man who buys their labor is the builder their projects calculations and motions are alien to them their living activity their accomplishments are his academic sociologists who take the sale of labor for granted understand this alienation of labor as a feeling the worker s activity appears alien to the worker it seems to be controlled by another however any worker can explain to the academic sociologists that the alienation is neither a feeling nor an idea in the worker s head but a real fact about the worker s daily life the sold activity is in fact alien to the worker his labor is in fact controlled by its buyer in exchange for his sold activity the worker gets money the conventionally accepted means of survival in capitalist society with this money he can buy commodities things but he cannot buy back his activity this reveals a peculiar gap in money as the universal equivalent a person can sell commodities for money and he can buy the same commodities with money he can sell his living activity for money but he cannot buy his living activity for money the things the worker buys with his wages are first of all consumer goods which enable him to survive to reproduce his laborpower so as to be able to continue selling it and they are spectacles objects for passive admiration he consumes and admires the products of human activity passively he does not exist in the world as an active agent who transforms it but as a helpless impotent spectator he may call this state of powerless admiration happiness and since labor is painful he may desire to be happy namely inactive all his life a condition similar to being born dead the commodities the spectacles consume him he uses up living energy in passive admiration he is consumed by things in this sense the more he has the less he is an individual can surmount this death in life through marginal creative activity but the population cannot except by abolishing the capitalist form of practical activity by abolishing wagelabor and thus de alienating creative activity the fetishism of commodities by alienating their activity and embodying it in commodities in material receptacles of human labor people reproduce themselves and create capital from the standpoint of capitalist ideology and particularly of academic economics this statement is untrue commodities are not the product of labor alone they are produced by the primordial factors of production land labor and capital the capitalist holy trinity and the main factor is obviously the hero of the piece capital the purpose of this superficial trinity is not analysis since analysis is not what these experts are paid for they are paid to obfuscate to mask the social form of practical activity under capitalism to veil the fact that producers reproduce themselves their exploiters as well as the instruments with which they re exploited the trinity formula does not succeed in convincing it is obvious that land is no more of a commodity producer than water air or the sun furthermore capital which is at once a name for a social relation between workers and capitalists for the instruments of production owned by a capitalist and for the money equivalent of his instruments and intangibles does not produce anything more than the ejaculations shaped into publishable form by the academic economists even the instruments of production which are the capital of one capitalist are primordial factors of production only if one s blinders limit his view to an isolated capitalist firm since a view of the entire economy reveals that the capital of one capitalist is the material receptacle of the labor alienated to another capitalist however though the trinity formula does not convince it does accomplish the task of obfuscation by shifting the subject of the question instead of asking why the activity of people under capitalism takes the form of wage labor potential analysts of capitalist daily life are transformed into academic house marxists who ask whether or not labor is the only factor of production thus economics and capitalist ideology in general treats land money and the products of labor as things which have the power to produce to create value to work for their owners to transform the world this is what marx called the fetishism which characterizes people s everyday conceptions and which is raised to the level of dogma by economics for the economist living people are things factors of production and things live money works capital produces the fetish worshipper attributes the product of his own activity to his fetish as a result he ceases to exert his own power the power to transform nature the power to determine the form and content of his daily life he exerts only those powers which he attributes to his fetish the power to buy commodities in other words the fetish worshipper emasculates himself and attributes virility to his fetish but the fetish is a dead thing not a living being it has no virility the fetish is no more than a thing for which and through which capitalist relations are maintained the mysterious power of capital its power to produce its virility does not reside in itself but in the fact that people alienate their creative activity that they sell their labor to capitalists that they materialize or reify their alienated labor in commodities in other words people are bought with the products of their own activity yet they see their own activity as the activity of capital and their own products as the products of capital by attributing creative power to capital and not to their own activity they renounce their living activity their everyday life to capital which means that people give themselves daily to the personification of capital the capitalist by selling their labor by alienating their activity people daily reproduce the personifications of the dominant forms of activity under capitalism they reproduce the wage laborer and the capitalist they do not merely reproduce the individuals physically but socially as well they reproduce individuals who are sellers of labor power and individuals who are owners of means of production they reproduce the individuals as well as the specific activities the sale as well as the ownership every time people perform an activity they have not themselves defined and do not control every time they pay for goods they produced with money they received in exchange for their alienated activity every time they passively admire the products of their own activity as alien objects procured by their money they give new life to capital and annihilate their own lives the aim of the process is the reproduction of the relation between the worker and the capitalist however this is not the aim of the individual agents engaged in it their activities are not transparent to them their eyes are fixed on the fetish that stands between the act and its result the individual agents keep their eyes fixed on things precisely those things for which capitalist relations are established the worker as producer aims to exchange his daily labor for money wages he aims precisely for the thing through which his relation to the capitalist is re established the thing through which he reproduces himself as a wage worker and the other as a capitalist the worker as consumer exchanges his money for products of labor precisely the things which the capitalist has to sell in order to realize his capital the daily transformation of living activity into capital is mediated by things it is not carried out by the things the fetish worshipper does not know this for him labor and land instruments and money entrepreneurs and bankers are all factors and agents when a hunter wearing an amulet downs a deer with a stone he may consider the amulet an essential factor in downing the deer and even in providing the deer as an object to be downed if he is a responsible and well educated fetish worshipper he will devote his attention to his amulet nourishing it with care and admiration in order to improve the material conditions of his life he will improve the way he wears his fetish not the way he throws the stone in a bind he may even send his amulet to hunt for him his own daily activities are not transparent to him when he eats well he fails to see that it is his own action of throwing the stone and not the action of the amulet that provided his food when he starves he fails to see that it is his own action of worshipping the amulet instead of hunting and not the wrath of his fetish that causes his starvation the fetishism of commodities and money the mystification of one s daily activities the religion of everyday life which attributes living activity to inanimate things is not a mental caprice born in men s imaginations it has its origin in the character of social relations under capitalism men do in fact relate to each other through things the fetish is in fact the occasion for which they act collectively and through which they reproduce their activity but it is not the fetish that performs the activity it is not capital that transforms raw materials nor capital that produces goods if living activity did not transform the materials these would remain untransformed inert dead matter if men were not disposed to continue selling their living activity the impotence of capital would be revealed capital would cease to exist its last remaining potency would be the power to remind people of a bypassed form of everyday life characterized by daily universal prostitution the worker alienates his life in order to preserve his life if he did not sell his living activity he could not get a wage and could not survive however it is not the wage that makes alienation the condition for survival if men were collectively not disposed to sell their lives if they were disposed to take control over their own activities universal prostitution would not be a condition for survival it is people s disposition to continue selling their labor and not the things for which they sell it that makes the alienation of living activity necessary for the preservation of life the living activity sold by the worker is bought by the capitalist and it is only this living activity that breathes life into capital and makes it productive the capitalist an owner of raw materials and instruments of production presents natural objects and products of other people s labor as his own private property but it is not the mysterious power of capital that creates the capitalist s private property living activity is what creates the property and the form of that activity is what keeps it private transformation of living activity into capital the transformation of living activity into capital takes place through things daily but is not carried out by things things which are products of human activity seem to be active agents because activities and contacts are established for and through things and because people s activities are not transparent to them they confuse the mediating object with the cause in the capitalist process of production the worker embodies or materializes his alienated living energy in an inert object by using instruments which are embodiments of other people s activity sophisticated industrial instruments embody the intellectual and manual activity of countless generations of inventors improvers and producers from all corners of the globe and from varied forms of society the instruments in themselves are inert objects they are material embodiments of living activity but are not themselves alive the only active agent in the production process is the living laborer he uses the products of other people s labor and infuses them with life so to speak but the life is his own he is not able to resurrect the individuals who stored their living activity in his instrument the instrument may enable him to do more during a given time period and in this sense it may raise his productivity but only the living labor which is able to produce can be productive for example when an industrial worker runs an electric lathe he uses products of the labor of generations of physicists inventors electrical engineers lathe makers he is obviously more productive than a craftsman who carves the same object by hand but it is in no sense the capital at the disposal of the industrial worker which is more productive than the capital of the craftsman if generations of intellectual and manual activity had not been embodied in the electric lathe if the industrial worker had to invent the lathe electricity and the electric lathe then it would take him numerous lifetimes to turn a single object on an electric lathe and no amount of capital could raise his productivity above that of the craftsman who carves the object by hand the notion of the productivity of capital and particularly the detailed measurement of that productivity are inventions of the science of economics that religion of capitalist daily life which uses up people s energy in the worship admiration and flattery of the central fetish of capitalist society medieval colleagues of these scientists performed detailed measurements of the height and width of angels in heaven without ever asking what angels or heaven were and taking for granted the existence of both the result of the worker s sold activity is a product which does not belong to him this product is an embodiment of his labor a materialization of a part of his life a receptacle which contains his living activity but it is not his it is as alien to him as his labor he did not decide to make it and when it is made he does not dispose of it if he wants it he has to buy it what he has made is not simply a product with certain useful properties for that he did not need to sell his labor to a capitalist in exchange for a wage he need only have picked the necessary materials and the available tools he need only have shaped the materials guided by his goals and limited by his knowledge and ability it is obvious that an individual can only do this marginally men s appropriation and use of the materials and tools available to them can only take place after the overthrow of the capitalist form of activity what the worker produces under capitalist conditions is a product with a very specific property the property of saleability what his alienated activity produces is a commodity because capitalist production is commodity production the statement that the goal of the process is the satisfaction of human needs is false it is a rationalization and an apology the satisfaction of human needs is not the goal of the capitalist or of the worker engaged in production nor is it a result of the process the worker sells his labor in order to get a wage the specific content of the labor is indifferent to him he does not alienate his labor to a capitalist who does not give him a wage in exchange for it no matter how many human needs this capitalist s products may satisfy the capitalist buys labor and engages it in production in order to emerge with commodities which can be sold he is indifferent to the specific properties of the product just as he is indifferent to people s needs all that interests him about the product is how much it will sell for and all that interests him about people s needs is how much they need to buy and how they can be coerced through propaganda and psychological conditioning to need more the capitalist s goal is to satisfy his need to reproduce and enlarge capital and the result of the process is the expanded reproduction of wage labor and capital which are not human needs the commodity produced by the worker is exchanged by the capitalist for a specific quantity of money the commodity is a value which is exchanged for an equivalent value in other words the living and past labor materialized in the product can exist in two distinct yet equivalent forms in commodities and in money or in what is common to both value this does not mean that value is labor value is the social form of reified materialized labor in capitalist society under capitalism social relations are not established directly they are established through value everyday activity is not exchanged directly it is exchanged in the form of value consequently what happens to living activity under capitalism cannot be traced by observing the activity itself but only by following the metamorphoses of value when the living activity of people takes the form of labor alienated activity it acquires the property of exchangeability it acquires the form of value in other words the labor can be exchanged for an equivalent quantity of money wages the deliberate alienation of living activity which is perceived as necessary for survival by the members of capitalist society itself reproduces the capitalist form within which alienation is necessary for survival because of the fact that living activity has the form of value the products of that activity must also have the form of value they must be exchangeable for money this is obvious since if the products of labor did not take the form of value but for example the form of useful objects at the disposal of society then they would either remain in the factory or they would be taken freely by the members of society whenever a need for them arose in either case the money wages received by the workers would have no value and living activity could not be sold for an equivalent quantity of money living activity could not be alienated consequently as soon as living activity takes the form of value the products of that activity take the form of value and the reproduction of everyday life takes place through changes or metamorphoses of value the capitalist sells the products of labor on a market he exchanges them for an equivalent sum of money he realizes a determined value the specific magnitude of this value on a particular market is the price of the commodities for the academic economist price is st peter s key to the gates of heaven like capital itself price moves within a wonderful world which consists entirely of objects the objects have human relations with each other and are alive they transform each other communicate with each other they marry and have children and of course it is only through the grace of these intelligent powerful and creative objects that people can be so happy in capitalist society in the economist s pictorial representations of the workings of heaven the angels do everything and men do nothing at all men simply enjoy what these superior beings do for them not only does capital produce and money work other mysterious beings have similar virtues thus supply a quantity of things which are sold and demand a quantity of things which are bought together determine price a quantity of money when supply and demand marry on a particular point of the diagram they give birth to equilibrium price which corresponds to a universal state of bliss the activities of everyday life are played out by things and people are reduced to things factors of production during their productive hours and to passive spectators of things during their leisure time the virtue of the economic scientist consists of his ability to attribute the outcome of people s everyday activities to things and of his inability to see the living activity of people underneath the antics of the things for the economist the things through which the activity of people is regulated under capitalism are themselves the mothers and sons the causes and consequences of their own activity the magnitude of value namely the price of a commodity the quantity of money for which it exchanges is not determined by things but by the daily activities of people supply and demand perfect and imperfect competition are nothing more than social forms of products and activities in capitalist society they have no life of their own the fact that activity is alienated namely that labor time is sold for a specific sum of money that it has a certain value has several consequences for the magnitude of the value of the products of that labor the value of the sold commodities must at least be equal to the value of the labor time this is obvious both from the standpoint of the individual capitalist firm and from the standpoint of society as a whole if the value of the commodities sold by the individual capitalist were smaller than the value of the labor he hired then his labor expenditures alone would be larger than his earnings and he would quickly go bankrupt socially if the value of the laborers production were smaller than the value of their consumption then the labor force could not even reproduce itself not to speak of a class of capitalists however if the value of the commodities were merely equal to the value of the labor time expended on them the commodity producers would merely reproduce themselves and their society would not be a capitalist society their activity might still consist of commodity production but it would not be capitalist commodity production for labor to create capital the value of the products of labor must be larger than the value of the labor in other words the labor force must produce a surplus product a quantity of goods which it does not consume and this surplus product must be transformed into surplus value a form of value which is not appropriated by workers as wages but by capitalists as profit furthermore the value of the products of labor must be larger still since living labor is not the only kind of labor materialized in them in the production process workers expend their own energy but they also use up the stored labor of others as instruments and they shape materials on which labor was previously expended this leads to the strange result that the value of the laborer s products and the value of his wage are different magnitudes namely that the sum of money received by the capitalist when he sells the commodities produced by his hired laborers is different from the sum he pays the laborers this difference is not explained by the fact that the used up materials and tools must be paid for if the value of the sold commodities were equal to the value of the living labor and the instruments there would still be no room for capitalists the fact is that the difference between the two magnitudes must be large enough to support a class of capitalists not only the individuals but also the specific activity that these individuals engage in namely the purchase of labor the difference between the total value of the products and the value of the labor spent on their production is surplus value the seed of capital in order to locate the origin of surplus value it is necessary to examine why the value of the labor is smaller than the value of the commodities produced by it the alienated activity of the worker transforms materials with the aid of instruments and produces a certain quantity of commodities however when these commodities are sold and the used up materials and instruments are paid for the workers are not given the remaining value of their products as their wages they are given less in other words during every working day the workers perform a certain quantity of unpaid labor forced label for which they receive no equivalent the performance of this unpaid labor this forced labor is another condition for survival in capitalist society however like alienation this condition is not imposed by nature but by the collective practice of people by their everyday activities before the existence of unions an individual worker accepted whatever forced labor was available since rejection of the labor would have meant that other workers would accept the available terms of exchange and the individual worker would receive no wage workers competed with each other for the wages offered by capitalists if a worker quit because the wage was unacceptably low an unemployed worker was willing to replace him since for the unemployed a small wage is higher than no wage at all this competition among workers was called free labor by capitalists who made great sacrifices to maintain the freedom of workers since it was precisely this freedom that preserved the surplus value of the capitalist and made it possible for him to accumulate capital it was not any worker s aim to produce more goods than he was paid for his aim was to get a wage which was as large as possible however the existence of workers who got no wage at all and whose conception of a large wage was consequently more modest than that of an employed worker made it possible for the capitalist to hire labor at a lower wage in fact the existence of unemployed workers made it possible for the capitalist to pay the lowest wage that workers were willing to work for thus the result of the collective daily activity of the workers each striving individually for the largest possible wage was to lower the wages of all the effect of the competition of each against all was that all got the smallest possible wage and the capitalist got the largest possible surplus the daily practice of all annuls the goals of each but the workers did not know that their situation was a product of their own daily behavior their own activities were not transparent to them to the workers it seemed that low wages were simply a natural part of life like illness and death and that falling wages were a natural catastrophe like a flood or a hard winter the critiques of socialists and the analyses of marx as well as an increase in industrial development which afforded more time for reflection stripped away some of the veils and made it possible for workers to see through their activities to some extent however in western europe and the united states workers did not get rid of the capitalist form of daily life they formed unions and in the different material conditions of the soviet union and eastern europe workers and peasants replaced the capitalist class with a state bureaucracy that purchases alienated labor and accumulates capital in the name of marx with unions daily life is similar to what it was before unions in fact it is almost the same daily life continues to consist of labor of alienated activity and of unpaid labor or forced labor the unionized worker no longer settles the terms of his alienation union functionaries do this for him the terms on which the worker s activity is alienated are no longer guided by the individual worker s need to accept what is available they are now guided by the union bureaucrat s need to maintain his position as pimp between the sellers of labor and the buyers with or without unions surplus value is neither a product of nature nor of capital it is created by the daily activities of people in the performance of their daily activities people are not only disposed to alienate these activities they are also disposed to reproduce the conditions which force them to alienate their activities to reproduce capital and thus the power of capital to purchase labor this is not because they do not know what the alternative is a person who is incapacitated by chronic indigestion because he eats too much grease does not continue eating grease because he does not know what the alternative is either he prefers being incapacitated to giving up grease or else it is not clear to him that his daily consumption of grease causes his incapacity and if his doctor preacher teacher and politician tell him first that the grease is what keeps him alive and secondly that they already do for him everything he would do if he were well then it is not surprising that his activity is not transparent to him and that he makes no great effort to render it transparent the production of surplus value is a condition of survival not for the population but for the capitalist system surplus value is the portion of the value of commodities produced by labor which is not returned to the laborers it can be expressed either in commodities or in money just as capital can be expressed either as a quantity of things or of money but this does not alter the fact that it is an expression for the materialized labor which is stored in a given quantity of products since the products can be exchanged for an equivalent quantity of money the money stands for or represents the same value as the products the money can in turn be exchanged for another quantity of products of equivalent value the ensemble of these exchanges which take place simultaneously during the performance of capitalist daily life constitutes the capitalist process of circulation it is through this process that the metamorphosis of surplus value into capital takes place the portion of value which does not return to labor namely surplus value allows the capitalist to exist and it also allows him to do much more than simply exist the capitalist invests a portion of this surplus value he hires new workers and buys new means of production he expands his dominion what this means is that the capitalist accumulates new labor both in the form of the living labor he hires and of the past labor paid and unpaid which is stored in the materials and machines he buys the capitalist class as a whole accumulates the surplus labor of society but this process takes place on a social scale and consequently cannot be seen if one observes only the activities of an individual capitalist it must be remembered that the products bought by a given capitalist as instruments have the same characteristics as the products he sells a first capitalist sells instruments to a second capitalist for a given sum of value and only a part of this value is returned to workers as wages the remaining part is surplus value with which the first capitalist buys new instruments and labor the second capitalist buys the instruments for the given value which means that he pays for the total quantity of labor rendered to the first capitalist the quantity of labor which was remunerated as well as the quantity performed free of charge this means that the instruments accumulated by the second capitalist contain the unpaid labor performed for the first the second capitalist in turn sells his products for a given value and returns only a portion of this value to his laborers he uses the remainder for new instruments and labor if the whole process were squeezed into a single time period and if all the capitalists were aggregated into one it would be seen that the value with which the capitalist acquires new instruments and labor is equal to the value of the products which he did not return to the producers this accumulated surplus labor is capital in terms of capitalist society as a whole the total capital is equal to the sum of unpaid labor performed by generations of human beings whose lives consisted of the daily alienation of their living activity in other words capital in the face of which men sell their living days is the product of the sold activity of men and is reproduced and expanded every day a man sells another working day every moment he decides to continue living the capitalist form of daily life storage and accumulation of human activity the transformation of surplus labor into capital is a specific historical form of a more general process the process of industrialization the permanent transformation of man s material environment certain essential characteristics of this consequence of human activity under capitalism can be grasped by means of a simplified illustration in an imaginary society people spend most of their active time producing food and other necessities only part of their time is surplus time in the sense that it is exempted from the production of necessities this surplus activity may be devoted to the production of food for priests and warriors who do not themselves produce it may be used to produce goods which are burned for sacred occasions it may be used up in the performance of ceremonies or gymnastic exercises in any of these cases the material conditions of these people are not likely to change from one generation to another as a result of their daily activities however one generation of people of this imaginary society may store their surplus time instead of using it up for example they may spend this surplus time winding up springs the next generation may unwind the energy stored in the springs to perform necessary tasks or may simply use the energy of the springs to wind new springs in either case the stored surplus labor of the earlier generation will provide the new generation with a larger quantity of surplus working time the new generation may also store this surplus in springs and in other receptacles in a relatively short period the labor stored in the springs will exceed the labor time available to any living generation with the expenditure of relatively little energy the people of this imaginary society will be able to harness the springs to most of their necessary tasks and also to the task of winding new springs for coming generations most of the living hours which they previously spent producing necessities will now be available for activities which are not dictated by necessity but projected by the imagination at first glance it seems unlikely that people would devote living hours to the bizarre task of winding springs it seems just as unlikely even if they wound the springs that they would store them for future generations since the unwinding of the springs might provide for example a marvellous spectacle on festive days however if people did not dispose of their own lives if their working activity were not their own if their practical activity consisted of forced labor then human activity might well be harnessed to the task of winding springs the task of storing surplus working time in material receptacles the historical role of capitalism a role which was performed by people who accepted the legitimacy of others to dispose of their lives consisted precisely of storing human activity in material receptacles by means of forced labor as soon as people submit to the power of money to buy stored labor as well as living activity as soon as they accept the fictional right of money holders to control and dispose of the stored as well as the living activity of society they transform money into capital and the owners of money into capitalists this double alienation the alienation of living activity in the form of wage labor and the alienation of the activity of past generations in the form of stored labor means of production is not a single act which took place sometime in history the relation between workers and capitalists is not a thing which imposed itself on society at some point in the past once and for all at no time did men sign a contract or even make a verbal agreement in which they gave up the power over their living activity and in which they gave up the power over the living activity of all future generations on all parts of the globe capital wears the mask of a natural force it seems as solid as the earth itself its movements appear as irreversible as tides its crises seem as unavoidable as earthquakes and floods even when it is admitted that the power of capital is created by men this admission may merely be the occasion for the invention of an even more imposing mask the mask of a man made force a frankenstein monster whose power inspires more awe than that of any natural force however capital is neither a natural force nor a man made monster which was created sometime in the past and which dominated human life ever since the power of capital does not reside in money since money is a social convention which has no more power than men are willing to grant it when men refuse to sell their labor money cannot perform even the simplest tasks because money does not work nor does the power of capital reside in the material receptacles in which the labor of past generations is stored since the potential energy stored in these receptacles can be liberated by the activity of living people whether or not the receptacles are capital namely alien property without living activity the collection of objects which constitute society s capital would merely be a scattered heap of assorted artefacts with no life of their own and the owners of capital would merely be a scattered assortment of uncommonly uncreative people by training who surround themselves with bits of paper in a vain attempt to resuscitate memories of past grandeur the only power of capital resides in the daily activities of living people this power consists of the disposition of people to sell their daily activities in exchange for money and to give up control over the products of their own activity and of the activity of earlier generations as soon as a person sells his labor to a capitalist and accepts only a part of his product as payment for that labor he creates conditions for the purchase and exploitation of other people no man would willingly give his arm or his child in exchange for money yet when a man deliberately and consciously sells his working life in order to acquire the necessities for life he not only reproduces the conditions which continue to make the sale of his life a necessity for its preservation he also creates conditions which make the sale of life a necessity for other people later generations may of course refuse to sell their working lives for the same reason that he refused to sell his arm however each failure to refuse alienated and forced labor enlarges the stock of stored labor with which capital can buy working lives in order to transform surplus labor into capital the capitalist has to find a way to store it in material receptacles in new means of production and he must hire new laborers to activate the new means of production in other words he must enlarge his enterprise or start a new enterprise in a different branch of production this presupposes or requires the existence of materials that can be shaped into new saleable commodities the existence of buyers of the new products and the existence of people who are poor enough to be willing to sell their labor these requirements are themselves created by capitalist activity and capitalists recognize no limits or obstacles to their activity the democracy of capital demands absolute freedom imperialism is not merely the last stage of capitalism it is also the first anything which can be transformed into a marketable good is grist for capital s mill whether it lies on the capitalist s land or on the neighbor s whether it lies above ground or under boats on the sea or crawls on its floor whether it is confined to other continents or other planets all of humanity s explorations of nature from alchemy to physics are mobilized to search for new materials in which to store labor to find new objects that someone can be taught to buy buyers for old and new products are created by any and all available means and new means are constantly discovered open markets and open doors are established by force and fraud if people lack the means to buy the capitalists products they are hired by capitalists and are paid for producing the goods they wish to buy if local craftsmen already produce what the capitalists have to sell the craftsmen are ruined or bought out if laws or traditions ban the use of certain products the laws and the traditions are destroyed if people lack the objects on which to use the capitalists products they are taught to buy these objects if people run out of physical or biological wants then capitalists satisfy their spiritual wants and hire psychologists to create them if people are so satiated with the products of capitalists that they can no longer use new objects they are taught to buy objects and spectacles which have no use but can simply be observed and admired poor people are found in pre agrarian and agrarian societies on every continent if they are not poor enough to be willing to sell their labor when the capitalists arrive they are impoverished by the activities of the capitalists themselves the lands of hunters gradually become the private property of owners who use state violence to restrict the hunters to reservations which do not contain enough food to keep them alive the tools of peasants gradually become available only from the same merchant who generously lends them the money with which to buy the tools until the peasants debts are so large that they are forced to sell land which neither they nor any of their ancestors had ever bought the buyers of craftsmen s products gradually become reduced to the merchants who market the products until the day comes when a merchant decides to house his craftsmen under the same roof and provides them with the instruments which will enable all of them to concentrate their activity on the production of the most profitable items independent as well as dependent hunters peasants and craftsmen free men as well as slaves are transformed into hired laborers those who previously disposed of their own lives in the face of harsh material conditions cease to dispose of their own lives precisely when they take up the task of modifying their material conditions those who were previously conscious creators of their own meagre existence become unconscious victims of their own activity even while abolishing the meagreness of their existence men who were much but had little now have much but are little the production of new commodities the opening of new markets the creation of new workers are not three separate activities they are three aspects of the same activity a new labor force is created precisely in order to produce the new commodities the wages received by these laborers are themselves the new market their unpaid labor is the source of new expansion neither natural nor cultural barriers halt the spread of capital the transformation of people s daily activity into alienated labor the transformation of their surplus labor into the private property of capitalists however capital is not a natural force it is a set of activities performed by people every day it is a form of daily life its continued existence and expansion presuppose only one essential condition the disposition of people to continue to alienate their working lives and thus reproduce the capitalist form of daily life 1969 reprinted in anything can happen october 1992 phoenix press london which

state capitalism in russia the problems of the social system in russia have often been compared with those created by revolutionary france more than a century and a half ago an understanding of both it is said requires perspective historians are reminded that the years have dissolved the acrimony heaped on the events of the great french revolution that more good than harm was done much the same is implied for russia supporters even mild critics of the stalin regime tell us that so new a phenomenon requires the test of many generations that the judgement nourished by immediate events by passing abuses must be suspended until lasting outlines appear in place of the years and of abuses engendered by expediency a vast theoretical corpus has been brought to the support of the russian social system we are invited to equate the nationalization of industry to progress economic planning to the elimination of crises mounting indices in steel coal and petroleum production to the well being of the russian people in the meantime fact progressively contravenes theory the nationalization of russian industry has not been marked by any sort of social progress russian economic planning such as it is has sharpened crises known to the capitalist world and the mounting indices in heavy industry little as we are actually permitted to know about them have been accompanied by abject misery and worsening of conditions for the russian people to anyone informed of russian social life the contradiction between theory and reality has reached nightmarish proportions moreover just as theory has been used to distort the meaning of events so events have revenged themselves on theory the most vulgar prattling has been employed to override russian reality from one aspect or another and with it the means for social analysis itself one has only to examine the tortured ideas of stalinism and its supporters on economic theory aesthetics and often enough even science to judge the wholesale misapplication of thinking to all questions the shoe is invariably placed on the wrong foot and the adherent is invited to limp through a host of broad economic political and cultural as well as specifically russian problems it becomes a social responsibility in every sense of the term to bring fact and theory into accord although objective and systematic accounts have been available for some time there has been a marked failure to employ them adequately for the purposes of generalization by contrast stalinist theory was given the semblance of a certain unity and comprehensiveness the rather popular notion that russia is a managerial society is unsatisfactory and starts from the same premises as the stalinist approach both assume that russia represents a historically new social formation the managerial theory it is true poses a significant issue if the state exercises full control over the economy it is necessary to ask who controls the state to this question stalinist apologists have no reply unless we are to give serious credence to the benign intentions of the russian leaders or to the claim that russia has the most democratic constitution in the world on the other hand the managerial theory explains little of the energizing forces of the russian economy of its dynamics and of russian expansion abroad from so purely negative a definition developed in reaction to the incredibility of the stalinist view rather than from a positive elucidation of the conditions of russian material life it would be difficult to find serious points of difference between a managerial society and for example ptolemaic egypt the position fails to bring anything into relief it lacks an explanation of anything that is socially distinctive but if russian society is not to be regarded as a new historical stage what does it represent the contention made here is that russia is integrally tied to capitalist development that its social system may be called state capitalism such a judgement follows from two considerations the first and most general is the entire process of world capitalist development the barbarization of society so graphically represented by fascism and its stalinist predecessor is anchored in the bourgeois mode of production it requires absolutely no departure from an analysis of capitalist retrogression to explain all the phenomena of stalinism in point of fact russia reflects this decline in every feature the second and more specific consideration is the backwardness of russia this historically retarded development suffice to say for the present cannot be regarded as a bag of excuses for justifying contemporary excesses or what amounts to the same thing for keeping russian society in suspended animation free from the compulsion of social law the intentions or wishes of the stalin leadership whatever they may be may be disregarded under capitalism backwardness has its own laws by which russia like germany italy and spain each in a certain sense are relentlessly governed a discussion of russia as a state capitalist system therefore presents the challenge of large issues at every point the analysis lends itself to homologous developments in england america indeed in the entirety of capitalist society concretely there is almost no special starting place developments in western europe among the democracies suggest the same problems that in russia have achieved only greater poignancy nationalization and the background of russian capitalism russia to day has a nationalized and allegedly planned economy this has by common consent been regarded as the unique characteristic of stalinist society at once its point of departure from capitalism and its most progressive feature planning is at most a claim and may for the moment be put aside the nationalization of industry however remains indisputable the question at issue is why is industrial nationalization per se non capitalist or progressive it is true that nationalization at least juridically precludes the individual ownership of industrial enterprises and such individual ownership has been associated with capitalism and its consequences more generally with private property in the means of production but many civilizations have been known where state ownership of the productive forces for one reason or another became the dominant economic institution without in any conceivable sense eliminating problems engendered by individual property private property remained in the real sense that the control of the productive forces yielded the relatively autonomous decisions that characterize individual ownership the point to be made is that the apparent economic relationship of men to the productive forces must be explained by the economic relationship between men at all times of course a certain technological level is presupposed hunters for example cannot be expected to establish feudal social relations but to borrow again from the fruitful analogy of the ancient world the feudal social relations of egypt dominated the transitions from the centralized state owned lands of the old kingdom through the somewhat atomized middle kingdom into the empire and completely centralized economy of the hellenistic age throughout the relationship between the broad mass of serfs and the ruling nobility and priesthood remained same although these changes met many real needs feudal problems and relations persisted and dominated egyptian society the point behind this analogy can be verified in the history of russian capitalist development if european capitalism of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries had room for development russian capitalism due to its belated appearance could find little sustenance in a precarious world market overcrowded by superior rivals and in an internal market inhibited by feudal relations true russian capitalism did not recapitulate the industrial and political history of europe from the start it was in possession of a technically advanced and highly concentrated plant but from the nature of the situation this contained as many disadvantages as advantages alongside the peasant hungering for land of his own was added the ferment of the new labouring classes to which the insecure restricted bourgeoisie was incapable of granting reforms fearing its own masses confined by world imperialism which clung desperately as the general situation worsened to privileges acquired in an earlier period incapable as a result of its weakness of effectively forcing its way into the perpetual race for markets the russian bourgeoisie was compelled to cement many of its ties with the czarist regime more often than not this was a source of extreme frustration the regime and nobility had its own fish to fry and the relationship often presented the character of two dogs sharing a bone but if the bourgeoisie generally strives to secure itself by concentration and monopolistic practices the narrow margin of industrial survival imperatively dictated the formation of great combines in russia that increasingly paralleled and merged with the state the two acted upon each other as conditions worsened in the respective sphere of each an interpenetration tended to occur these were the tendencies of pre revolutionary capitalist development they must not be mistaken for a fait accompli quarrels differences as to ways and means eternal exasperation with the inefficiency of czarism precipitated bitter and often violent controversies lurking behind these differences lay the prospect of an internal market free from feudal restrictions but lurking behind this market was the fear of a jacquerie and an urban uprising which variously but on the whole negatively coloured the political activity of russian capitalism the focus of all russian political activity of course was the countryside could the bourgeoisie imitate its french brethren and give the land to the peasants in point of fact the french bourgeoisie had not liquidated the land problem the breakdown of the feudal estates was consummated by the jacobins at the cost of bloody conflicts with the capitalist class under the leadership of robespierre danton and h√©bert the revolution had over extended itself gaining an indispensable margin for the play of radical social forces in so doing it managed to override the fears rural interests and narrow conservatism of the bourgeoisie but afterward the revolution retrenched retreating to the only forms possible at the time this it might be supposed could also provide a model for the russian revolution the parties of the russian sans culottes would endeavour to establish a radical democracy largely over and against the reactionary summits of russian capitalism land would be distributed among the peasants and improved working conditions introduced in industry the bourgeoisie no doubt would fume and storm it might endeavour to raise another lyons and the nobility certainly another vend√©e but the economic axis of such a revolution could only be the full extension of capitalist relations to the countryside its most obvious result the creation of a firm peasantry at the expense of the feudal elements certain sharp differences however are evident the french revolution occurred in 1789 the russian revolution in 1917 the two were separated by a century and a quarter of capitalist development the french revolution coincided with the first upswing of the development the russian revolution with its decline and retrogression both aspects of the cycle were planted in these events in consequence the russian revolution might give an initial perhaps not inconsiderable impetus to industrial activity at worst conditions would portend the tug of war and instability following the overthrow of the spanish monarchy in 1931 but under bourgeois conditions instability in russia was inevitable the whole character of world economic conditions nurtured the persistence and eventual growth of conditions that were already clearly in focus during the last years of czarism in effect this meant increasing monopolization state intervention to support sagging industries and finally the nationalization of industry and totalitarian policing of the standard of living this is essentially the gamut of russian events after 1917 the conditions of the war precipitated a long standing crisis pushing the feudal system into the abyss they served to arouse hopes in the lenin group that the inevitable over extension of the democratic revolution would be consolidated economically by a different type of revolution in europe the ebb of the european revolution however left the bolshevists with little more than what they had in any case namely a capitalist economy rounded out by land seizures in the countryside the fact was clearly acknowledged by the new economic policy of 1921 an open market was not only recognized but there is every indication to believe that a policy of tolerating small merchant and individual peasant enterprises was calculated for a length of time greater than permitted it by the stalin regime the nationalization of industry while precipitately introduced on the strength of other more radical hopes as well it may be agreed as many immediate expediencies accelerated an economic development which confronted russian capitalism in any case there can be no question that we are simplifying events which might have at least retarded the depth of totalitarian development in russia had a different insight prevailed in england for example we are witnessing much the same line of development for industry left to itself british capitalism is apparently moving with less of an edge than did the stalinist reaction of 1925 7 the possibilities for intervention are more pronounced than for russia during those years further speculation as to the course of the russian revolution however can be left to those who are living with rather than learning from the past it is only necessary to stress here the full coincidence of industrial nationalization with the entire background of russian capitalist development the presence of capitalism in russia depends not on nationalization per se which may reflect reaction and retrogression as well as progress but on other factors which accordingly make for one or the other capitalism in russia the burden of any discussion of russia as a state capitalist society devolves upon three issues the existence and weight of competition the anarchy bred by the plan and the difficulties disproportions and crises in reproduction created by competition for sources of raw material and skilled labour the consequences of these problems even if considered only by themselves are ramified through all channels of the economy with growing intensity and reach their summit in factional struggles disputes liquidations and regroupings that like the incessant jockeying for power among capitalist groups in europe and america have become characteristic of russian life the state supporting the economy as a whole reflecting by its function the weakness of the entire economic structure becomes the arena in which the maladjustments of the system take form it is not so much a plan that passes between the managers supply agencies glavks glavks are administrative boards directly below people s commissariats and people s commissariats as antagonisms and rivalries between individual capitalists and blocs of capitalists attempting to secure and advance their positions in theory the russian manager is supposed to have very little independence dr marshak describes the position of the manager as follows the soviet manager is unable to manipulate freely the size of his plant or his inventories nor can he take advantage of market situations current or prospective by bargaining with sources of supplies or with customers for better prices or by winning customers through low prices and sources of supplies through high ones to be sure with supply chronically lagging behind demand it would in any case be pointless for a manager to reduce prices in order to win customers on the other hand to win preference for a source of supplies by bidding up prices for raw materials would not be pointless but it is forbidden russian law or the official administration of industry suggests an even more severe picture sales contracts plant property production and labour efficiency norms the number of workers to be employed average earnings and the annual payroll in fact nearly every detail of the industrial process is supposed to require state approval where this is not pure juridical fiction it affords a restricted picture it would be surprising to conclude that all elements in russian capitalism reflect a homogeneous pattern of status and economic control the capitalists of russia like those elsewhere maintain variegated relationships among themselves many are subject to the crass authority of higher elements others probably managers of large heavy industrial enterprises are relatively independent assuredly the people s commissars the ministers and those who are so situated as seriously to influence the power relationships between competing blocs correspond to the monopolists and commanding bourgeois elements of western capitalist states different frames of reference therefore exhibit different views to a purely juridical mind german and russian economic regulations seem to agree point by point if we were not familiar with the clearly capitalistic nature of the german economy under hitler nazi law would engender the belief that the german economy reflects some sort of managerial society from the standpoint of lesser managers or those who have not ferreted out the possibilities inherent in any given situation the full burden of the totalitarian regulations descends on their shoulders to be sure stalinist society is more centralized than elsewhere but by the same token influence power exploitation and competition is more severe it would be absolutely unpardonable and superficial to discount the influence of the plant manager as a member of the party his connections in the government and above all the countless tricks and manoeuvres included in such relationships but even according to juridical arrangements the manager is no mere automaton of the planning bodies and state bienstock discussing the growth and recognition of managerial independence writes most important the manager became the only person responsible for the operation of the plant in all its subdivisions the manager s authority within the plant has increased he rules the whole production process bears responsibility for the technological process for quantitative fulfilment of the plan and for the quality of the goods produced since 1938 a sinking fund is withdrawn from plant output estimated at about 5 per cent of initial capital value 40 to 60 per cent of which is at the manager s disposal for capital replacement as well as repairs the manager even according to economic regulations disposes of considerable resources at any given plant level it is obvious that the lure of a more commanding position in a country where disproportions in income are matched only by the extremities of want creates and even necessitates bitter competition for further access to such resources the position of the russian manager gains greater reality when the authority he possesses is dynamized by the actual relationship of plant production to the plan planning in russia has either been grossly exaggerated or totally misunderstood this has in so many words been admitted in the day to day reports of the russian press itself all theoretical pronunciamentos and considerations aside our planning is still to a great extent clerical and statistical work reports meizenberg absolutely divorced from economic practice in this connection bienstock observes the practice of planning has gradually brought the leaders of soviet economy to the conclusion that tasks set by plan must be adjusted in accordance with practice that planning cannot be confined to orders but requires continual checking in every phase of production in theory these rules were formulated unequivocally long ago as a matter of fact principles were not applied until the outbreak of war in the summer of 1941 the remark gains significance because it is now known that if anything planning was considerably relaxed during the war conditions on an earlier page the same writer notes that many plants have been given the initiative in working out their own production programmes in line with directives of the previous years without waiting for new orders from above they transmit their programmes to the glavk or directly to the people s commissariat the glavk checks and if necessary changes plans taking into account supply possibilities unknown to the plant the possibility of co operation between plants financial resources regional needs etc the russian manager must operate outside the plan commodity funds stocks are often apportioned only five or six days before the beginning of a quarter realization delivery is sometimes greatly delayed ordinarily delivery is obtained only towards the end of a quarter say in its last three or four weeks the amount of goods apportioned for a quarter is almost below a plant s real needs because the people s commissariat and glavk usually fear that the manager s application for goods especially scarce materials is exaggerated bienstock our emphasis m s again to obtain goods he the manager must often send representatives to supplying factories or to agencies of people s commissariats and glavks many plants have permanent representatives in moscow or other supply centres with the special task of securing the timely supply of goods of pushing orders for materials of arranging shipments etc and of course the plant management must maintain a storage organization a plant manager who does not get needed goods in time is often compelled to break rules and seek new ways to supply his plant there is thus a contradiction between theory and practice theory has recently taken a few steps toward practice e g the direct agreements the author cites several examples to illustrate the magnitude of these problems and we may add operations during the first eight months of 1940 the tractor works spent 200 000 roubles on telegrams and 250 000 roubles on travelling expenses the same story was told half a year later of another giant plant the rostov works for agricultural engineering in the course of several articles on russia in the herald tribune newman cites izvestia to the effect that one third of the ten thousand daily arrivals in moscow by railway and plane were on unnecessary government business izvestia makes the accusation that these arrivals waste millions of rubles in sprees and excursions an entire body of market relations underlies the reproductive mechanism of russian industry according to bienstock the turn over of many supply organizations particularly local offices is so insignificant that they are compelled to transgress their jurisdiction to justify their existence they buy materials and equipment not needed in their own branch of industry and sell to plants of other branches they become in a sense ordinary dealers the reports that consistently appear in the russian press are only a surface picture of idle plants or factories working far under capacity while goods and raw materials circulate throughout the country without any apparent destination other undoubtedly than a profitable buyer the incidents are notorious frequently embracing some of the most important industrial projects of the stalinist regime an example cited by bienstock is worth quoting in full on 3rd june 1938 the council of people s commissars issued a decree concentrating sale of ferrous metals in a new board some six months later the head of this board s volikov complained about individualistic methods of procuring metals metals were sent from one end of the union to the other without reason or plan often large quantities were brought from the urals or krivoi rog ukraine to moscow as a storage and supply centre only to retrace a portion of the original route to get to a consumer how often how large were the quantities volikov apparently did not say but like the daily sprees to moscow and only to moscow there is good reason to believe that such infractions are enormous in our opinion decisive harry schwartz for example recently reported in the n y times that complaints in the russian press indicate one third another third of the secretaries of collective farms in the ukraine were transgressing the rights of collective farm members in violation of the law newman again reports charges in pravda that heaps of vegetables and fruits were spoiling on railway platforms of the south western north caucasian moscow kiev tashkent askhabad and turkestan siberian lines in 1947 at the same time it is indicated the periodical bolshevik claimed that 20 per cent of railway stock was idle and an even higher proportion was the case for motor transport throughout profit reigns supreme the government writes yugow fixes the factory price for some item at 20 roubles viz 14 roubles production costs 2 roubles planned profit and 4 roubles 20 per cent turnover tax if plant management reduces the cost from 14 to say 10 roubles the profit becomes 6 roubles of which 2 are planned profit and 4 above the plan from this it follows the desire to increase profits has become a real incentive to more responsible active and careful management yugow provides us with examples from heavy industry in coal mining for each per cent of reduction of real cost of production below planned cost the manager assistant manager chief and assistant engineers get a bonus of 15 per cent of monthly salary in iron and steel industry the figure is 10 per cent furthermore for each per cent of overfulfilment of planned output the bonus for a coal mine manager and his immediate assistants is 4 per cent of salary in iron and steel bonuses for extra output are calculated progressively if pig iron production exceeds plan by 5 per cent the monthly salaries of a section head assistant section head engineer and electrical engineer are raised 10 per cent for each per cent of excess output if the production excess is 10 per cent the bonus for each per cent of excess output is 15 per cent of monthly salary etc no less important is the effect of plant profits on managerial influence prestige and power the distinction between managers and capitalists or between bonuses and profits seems to be blurred by the information at our disposal does it mean as the managerial theory implies that all capitalists become managers that profits in the socially significant sense of the term become mere bonuses actually this is only a pseudo problem between the extremes of an industrial manager in a small circumscribed shoe factory and a people s commissar the distinction is quite clear it is necessary that the spectrum of russian industrial authority be viewed under the aspect of qualitative differences rather than similarities that blend one shade of control into another if the premises of competition disproportions direct agreements etc are granted we need only compare the historical effect of stalinist society with those produced in known capitalist sectors of the world should they coincide the ostensible chain of authority that juridical fiction reduces to the common denominator of manager requires the assumption of differentiation between managers and capitalists the presence of specific social forces and their effects summons as it were the ruling class and its capitalistic character concealed at most only to economic theoreticians by the impersonality of the system and the anonymity of the regime into real life neither the propaganda of the apologists nor the intentions of their leaders can alter such indispensable distinctions russia and the retrogression of capitalism at first glance a comparison between russia and trends in world capitalism presents many divergencies among these the most conspicuous are first the decline in the standard of living on an international scale stalinist propaganda on the other hand celebrates a steady rise in the well being of the russian masses the comparison we are reminded must be made between pre revolutionary and contemporary russia rather than between russia and advanced capitalist states once this criterion is adopted we are assured there can be no doubt that the material conditions of the people have improved steadily second since imperialism is characterized by the export of capital russia cannot be viewed as an imperialist state this once stated often seems to suffice russian expansion is ascribed to military exigencies the fear of war the desire to spread communism etc but not to imperialism in the scientific sense of the term finally all accounts of russia never cease to point to the continual unprecedented growth of industry at a time when the tendency elsewhere has long been toward industrial contraction the endless panegyrics at least indicate mounting swollen statistics in every field of production each five year plan is completed in four years and every plan is made to mark a milestone over earlier conditions this has even impressed opponents of the regime so we are told by friends of the regime by separating crass fact from pure fiction and qualitative analysis from the blinding storm of meaningless statistics a second glance discloses basic similarities between russia and world capitalism 1 the standard of living in russia now on this question there are sound reasons for believing that if the material conditions of the masses have shown a steady improvement russia is a striking exception to the trends in world capitalism in an economy based on competition only a cold blooded selection by destruction operates to exist in effect means to survive and to survive means to absorb rival capitals the ideal of bourgeois enterprise is full control over the productive process and market this alone the system dictates can assure survival and provide the security and stability which all elements of the system continually endeavour to achieve in time the elements of the system change their character numerous capitalists are transformed into a handful of large capitalists commanding whole branches of industry national monopolies and international cartels the growth of monopolies and cartels only serves to intensify the degree of rivalry and instability huge masses of capital formerly controlled by many individuals are now pitted against each other by a few monopolists the system must increase its demands upon all the means at its disposal demands in turn which are always insufficient to meet the growing dimensions of the struggle reforms permissible in an earlier context are withdrawn exploitation is intensified living standards are depressed oddly enough the stalinist regime has maintained a statistical conspiracy against the apprehension of facts concerning the standard of living in russia despite much official propaganda photography and guided tours of pre war vintage we are aware of no official indices tracing the material conditions of the people in any way comparable to the information provided by most if not all capitalist countries so far as direct analysis admits the economic position of the masses is shrouded in mystery cast in vague proportionate accounts and classified into statistically useless categories the indirect analysis of russian data however is of remarkable interest on the basis of hubbard s data comparing the average food consumption of petrograd textile families during czarist days with later periods peter meyer has demonstrated that between 1929 and 1937 the average standard of living declined to 34 per cent below pre revolutionary days the same analysis shows an increase of 54 per cent from the revolution to 1929 material in colin clark s studies of russian statistics show a decrease of around 20 per cent in food consumption per head between 1913 and 1934 whatever the differences between both analyses the depth of the downward trend is unmistakable to bring matters as much up to date as is possible vera micheles dean observes again on the basis of an indirect analysis of russian nominal wages that if 1938 is taken as a 100 the index of increase in nominal wages is 165 and 175 depending on the categories of work owing to the continuance of high prices however and to various curbs recently placed on individual purchases real wages have actually undergone a sharp decline recent press reports from russia indicate that the regime has placed the monetary policy on the gold standard accompanied by drastic price reductions we must confess that on the basis of previous price reduction policies we view this latest achievement with considerable scepticism on 16th september 1945 for example the price structure was also overhauled miss dean observes the price of certain essential rationed goods were sharply raised on an average of 180 per cent over previous prices with the effect of further draining off money in circulation by contrast prices of unrationed goods in commercial government stores were reduced by 30 to 55 per cent while the upward revision of prices of rationed goods and the downward revision of unrationed goods were intended to close the gap between the two sets of prices the gap remains substantial it is reasonable to question if the gap is being closed by lowering or raising the price of commodities within the purchasing range of the masses thus on 17th july 1948 the stalinist government announced a 10 to 20 per cent reduction of prices in state stores the reduction was confined to such items as bicycles phonographs watches caviar moskvich automobiles hunting guns cameras perfumes cosmetics stoves and beer and vodka in the infamous currency reform of december 1947 prices remained essentially the same as before except for bread and a few staple items w bedell smith notes that the tremendous hardships imposed by the production norms established for 1950 led to such demoralization that the government had to change its production plans to increase the amount of consumer goods available for purchases these measures gradually improved the production situation to the point where the government finally felt able to act drastically to lower the purchasing power of the soviet people in order to reduce the general demand for consumers goods and relieve the pressure on light industry the currency reform undertaken in december 1947 accomplished this the existing ruble currency was declared obsolete without warning and new currency was issued that was exchanged at the rate of one new ruble for ten old rubles state bonds were devaluated by two thirds bank deposits however were exchangeable at equal value but only up to 3 000 rubles with a smaller return on larger amounts food rationing was removed at the same time the farmers were wiped out as their money was not in banks but in state bonds and currency to pay taxes and meet current expenses they sold food so that for a brief period immediately after the monetary change there was a flood of food in city markets for the first time in years this lasted only a short time and thereafter the industrial workers found that an even more drastic form of rationing actually existed as only a limited quantity of each kind of food was sold to one person the same rationing apparently did not apply so far as we know in the commercial government stores catering to the stalinist millionaires where white bread was easily obtainable at 7 5 times the value of the same type of bread for sale in regular stores but is it necessary to enter into the income differentials of an economy which bountifully provides for the few who are privileged with truly astronomical incomes 2 imperialism and the export of capital in this connection there has been so much misunderstanding that a number of general remarks are in order the course of capitalist development evokes many contradictions that shape and give it form since competition requires the steady replacement of labour by machinery at least two simultaneous effects are evident the rate of profit declines and millions are deprived of employment as the internal market contracts the entire productive process tends to follow in its wake attempts to compensate for this contraction turn the bourgeoisie to the international market particularly the super profits of colonial trade and industry it is apparent of course that capitalism always endeavoured to reap these imperial profits the wealth derived from colonial exploitation was a prerequisite for the primitive accumulation that launched capitalist development in the modern era the point to be made however is that when the internal market contracts imperialism comes into its own as an imperative force an absolute precondition for the very life of the system for a while imperialism yields a spurt to the economy extending the limits of the internal market and providing new bases for industrial expansion but in time this engenders further contradictions the obstacle of new rival imperialisms and of entrenched predecessors increasing exhaustion due to frequent conflicts etc in its classic period imperialism was characterized by the export of capital this perhaps more than the paeans of kipling encouraged many liberal economists to believe that the white man s burden could only mean the full industrial development of the colonial world actually capital export was invariably one sided calculated not to develop a competitor but so to upset aboriginal social relations that dependence rather than independence was emphasized the effect of imperialism therefore has always been to create so much misery and discontent that national uprisings of one degree or another continually follow in its wake as the contradictions of capitalist imperialism converge into a general crisis the export of capital is subordinated entirely to the needs of colonial regimentation policing and control a sort of roman parasitism prevails all the material and spiritual sources of resistance are numbed by planned starvation and terror masses of population created by the capitalist mode of production are reduced enslaved or exterminated industrial activity is rendered more and more one sided and dependent or in many cases comes to a virtual standstill many colonies have long since travelled part of the road to this new barbarism indeed the prototype of contemporary enslavement and exploitation was nurtured for generations on the continents of asia africa south america and in the archipelagoes of the orient but the colonial countries do not stand alone under the heightened conditions of present day rivalry and instability even the industrially advanced nations of europe face oppression and reduction to a colonial status europe enjoys the special status wherein her stabilization involves no less than the physical destruction of much of her industry thus the iron heel german capitalism prepared for europe now descends upon germany industries are destroyed millions bombed out and permanently uprooted the country is dismembered and occupied by foreign imperialist armies the loser of the last war however is only the harbinger of conditions that await nearly all the victors of to day eastern europe already shares the fate of germany england france belgium all progressively become the economic and political instruments of american policy the economic one sidedness and dependency that are imposed on the colonial world eventually face the earlier colonial oppressors themselves the international market like the internal market contracts all social existence threatens to shrivel and decline it is in this milieu that is under the conditions and possibilities created by the second world war that russia definitely embarked upon an imperialist course initially this took form in collaboration with fascist germany if the seizure of territory from finland poland and rumania is often excused by military expediency further negotiations with the nazis concerning the hinterlands of asia leave absolutely no doubt as to the imperialist character of russian expansion ribbentrop s appreciation of russian natural spheres of influence is very concise the focal points in the territorial aspiration of the soviet union would presumably be centred south of the territory of the soviet union in the direction of the indian ocean to day the imperialist activities of the stalinist regime occur as is the case with the rest of europe under the shadow cast by the polarized concentrated power of the united states beside this american colossus rivalry must generally find circuitous routes infiltrate into weak positions operate in the crevices and around the fringes of american control the phenomenal privileges allocated to russia however are explicable only in terms of the political limitations of the united states the stalinist regime largely holds those positions where the need for the naked application of force places the bourgeois democracy of the united states at a current disadvantage to employ the more precise formulation of ernst zander the secret of the situation as of america s weakness consists in russia having become her most reliable and indispensable policeman in europe and asia it is predominantly from this that russia derives her astounding strength in the haggling with other powers no other country can be entrusted with the ruthless police function once the stalin regime collapses in effect the stalinist regime complements and is for the present indispensable to american imperialism as in 1939 stalinism remains a precondition for world reaction and retrogression in the first case precipitating world war ii and to day assuming the functions of hitler during the thirties in this context where expansion goes hand in hand with total parasitism dictated by rivalry and survival where the dismemberment and exploitation of advanced capitalist countries makes its appearance the export of excess capital resources becomes an ancillary feature of imperialism 3 the growth of russian industry if russian industrial development means anything it refers first and foremost to armaments industries much the same can be said for the entire capitalist world the armament industry is to day the lubricant of the entire system and growingly extends over consumer goods production precisely because it alone can co exist with a falling standard of living guns tanks aircraft weapons of all kind explode in waste they require only the intervention of the state as a purchaser the state on the other hand becomes a buyer by virtue of the revenue it exacts from the system as a whole principally by milking the masses dry in true publican fashion in the united states this essentially takes the form of taxation in england rationing and wage fixing finally in russia and germany naked police supervision over the living standards of the people the poverty of the masses is planned and this by far is the major function of planning as greater recourse is had to direct measures the more armaments are required to keep the masses in subjugation these operations occur on a world scale occupation armies arms for docile elements abroad etc to be sure profits too require distribution again planning to sustain the state as the essential agent for and market of the system in this rule the state frequently appears as the disciplinarian of contending bourgeois blocs although by no means the most desirable situation for elements accustomed to a laissez faire economy choices cease to exist the system must be sustained as a whole despite the fact that the stalinist regime came very close to defeat in 1941 42 it compared only with germany as a producer of armaments during pre war years between 1934 39 russian armament expenditure was twice that of england it seems likely writes prof a j brown that the soviet union spent at least as much on military purposes in the five years or so before she was attacked as germany had spent in the corresponding period leading up to her aggression against poland germany s two year lead in this race however gave her a formidable advantage at the time of her attack on the ussr her military expenditure was probably still at least twice that of russia though not all of it perhaps little more than two thirds could be applied on the eastern front whatever the margin of error in the calculation it is clear that the real cost of military preparation to the soviet union was like the subsequent burden which it bore in battle casualties the heaviest carried by any nation by examination of mere surface facts economists judge that expenditures on armaments comprised 6 per cent of russian national income in 1934 12 per cent in 1937 25 per cent shortly before the german invasion and according to recent estimates in life magazine 25 per cent to day these assumptions are much too cordial we submit that the russian economy from the very logic of the system is oriented as a whole toward armament production that proportions estimates and statistical juggling are entirely meaningless this situation gestates in capitalist development itself even in such bastions of industry as the united states armament production is the life fluid of the bourgeois mode of production the co efficient of all industrial output the one dollar that keeps the other three four five or ten in motion in russia however such determinations are already fruitless armaments are the absolute foundation of the economy itself the moloch to which all resources are delivered the sacrificial altar of all industrial development it becomes absurd from this standpoint to regard the index of russian production as any hopeful sign of progressive possibilities steel in russia means guns or the means for making guns if supporters of the stalin regime hope that perhaps and not without a revolution against the regime the russian people can be induced to use bayonets for buttering bread then it may be supposed that they will dwell in cities of tanks wear the drab grey of the army uniform and use helmets for toilet bowls the slave state during the depths of the economic crisis almost two decades ago letters to the american press opined that the unemployed should be placed on unseaworthy rafts and set adrift in principle the suggestion was not original although required by german fascism ten years later efficiency often dictating crematoria it was long anticipated in the slave labour camps of stalinist russia for more than a quarter century russian capitalism has followed the relentless logic inherent in contemporary world development through countless purges liquidations and collectivization drives it has literally appropriated the bodies of millions of men women and children whom the contracting system can no longer support on the basis of anything remotely resembling a free labour market like chained gangs on ancient latifundia they are placed to work in the bleak hells of siberia in mines and on wastes where life is scarcely maintainable and quickly passes out of existence from the caspian sea to the solovietsky islands on the white sea hopeless masses of human beings living and dying under unbearable conditions are devoured by the camp system whole areas like the gold mining region of kolyma are entirely populated by chattel slaves comprising every profession and vocation occupying camps on the dimensions of cities magadan for example serviced maintained and renewed by the system the law of population under moribund capitalism dictates that millions pushed outside society by the general contraction must be worked to death but the individual merely perpetuates the species which locust like slowly consumes all before it for each who perishes two appear slave workers recruit slave technicians the technicians recruit slave engineers these in turn are followed by guards factories and more camps the new mode of labour reproduces itself not only from the inner crisis of capitalism but from the division of labour in modern industry it recreates the entire juridical political and economic fabric adapting all institutions to its needs and by giving rise to its own qualitative forms threatens to negate the capitalist mode of production itself slave labour already germinates in every phase of the russian economy the internal passport the work book countless labour regulations ranging from job lateness to sabotage compulsory vocational training etc etc all reduce the industrial worker to a captive of his specific job on the collective farms practically every pretence is cast to the winds yugow makes the following significant observation of the russian kolkhoz system productive machinery with the exception of small tools belongs as already mentioned to the government which by agreement works the land and harvests for the kolkhozes labour is furnished by the kolkhoz which in addition is obliged to assign a specified percentage of its manpower to certain compulsory tasks road work transportation felling timber etc and to work in urban factories centuries ago capitalism took form in mediaeval europe by developing the instruments of production the possibility was poised for a historic solution to want and exploitation with the first world war the curve of capitalist development took a downward turn and here history has reached the heights of irony alongside the most remarkable technological achievements undreamed of advances in electronics servo mechanisms turbo engines and nuclear physics in a word all the means of lightening human labour reappear the institutions want and exploitation of the past infinitely intensified literally moribund capitalism generates its own negation in the forms of a dark barbaric past when the material bases of mankind lay at the threshold of pre history the system converges toward stability on the shambles of whole cultures industry as it were thrives in laboratories surrounded by a desert of human agony and hunger only to achieve florescence in armaments all the ingenuity of mankind from science communications and technology to the products of the printing press and the paint brush conspire to suck every isolated or remote community into the rising slave state indeed as compared with the stalinist regime which can be considered no more than a mirror of relentless developments in europe and america if authentic democratic forces fail to intervene the particularness of past mediaevalism will appear as a veritable haven for the human spirit 23rd june 1950 text taken from here

tokyo afp japan s ruling coalition celebrated holding on to a strong majority in weekend elections with prime minister fumio kishida hailing the results as a big deal for trust while saying he wants to focus on boosting the world s third biggest economy advertising read more investors in tokyo cheered news that kishida s long ruling liberal democratic party ldp and its junior coalition partner komeito had won 293 of the 465 seats in parliament s lower house the benchmark nikkei stock index rose more than two percent after japanese media reported the result which enables the ruling bloc to enact bills on issues from pandemic stimulus to defence spending on its own but even though the coalition lost fewer seats than feared newspaper editorials urged kishida who took office a month ago to act decisively to shore up public support ahead of a key upper house vote next summer kishida said sunday that exit polls demonstrated the public s faith in the ldp which has held power almost continuously since the 1950s if the ruling coalition is given a majority the government is given trust it is a big deal the 64 year old said the liberal democratic party ldp and its junior coalition partner won 293 of the 465 seats in parliament s lower house kazuhiro nogi afp he said he hoped to issue a fresh stimulus package by the end of the year to counter the impact of covid 19 on the economy having previously said the relief measures would be worth tens of trillions of yen kishida has outlined plans to tackle inequality heightened by the pro business policies of his predecessors yoshihide suga and shinzo abe japan s longest ruling prime minister the ldp has also said it will aim to increase defence spending to counter threats from china and north korea but the new prime minister now needs to fully prepare for a possible sixth wave of virus infections as early as this winter and firm up how his economic policy ideas will work in practice the asahi shimbun daily said in an editorial tough election battles a decline in the number of ldp seats had been expected for kishida after his predecessor yoshihide suga resigned just a year into the job partly due to public discontent over the government s response to the virus crisis japan has recorded around 18 000 deaths a comparatively low toll for its population of 126 million and has never imposed a blanket lockdown but many businesses especially bars and restaurants have suffered through prolonged periods of restrictions on commercial activity the ldp previously boasted a commanding majority of 276 seats on its own and in sunday s vote held on to 261 maintaining its single party majority in recent decades votes against the ldp have been split between multiple major opposition parties but this time five rival parties boosted cooperation in a bid to dent its stranglehold a decline in the number of ldp seats had been expected but the party managed to hold onto a majority behrouz mehri behrouz mehri pool afp the yomiuri shimbun daily said the ruling party had been forced to fight tough election battles throughout japan but differences in key policy positions between the two main opposition parties the constitutional democratic party of japan cdp and the japanese communist party especially over the country s relationship with the united states led to their defeat the newspaper said meanwhile a surge in votes for the osaka based reformist nippon ishin party pushed it to become the third largest party after the ldp and cdp nippon ishin gathered votes from conservative voters who are frustrated with the ldp komeito coalition government the yomiuri said an estimated 56 percent of voters cast their ballots japanese media said a continuation of the low turnout rates that have plagued the country s elections in recent years the prime minister has said he wants to attend the cop26 summit in glasgow as his first overseas engagement after the election 2021 afp
this article is more than 2 years old leo koguan in march 2020 when equity markets tumbled and margin calls loomed billionaire leo koguan was forced to sell much of his stock portfolio including the vast majority of 12 million tesla shares he then owned amid the early pandemic chaos koguan decided to act he says he sold the rest of his stock holdings including shares of baidu nvidia china mobile and nio and used the proceeds to buy long term call options on tesla in effect betting the house it was a risky move but it paid off tesla shares have skyrocketed more than 1 440 since march 1 koguan says he s plowed trading profits back into tesla and that today 100 of his stock portfolio consists of tesla shares and call options according to bank documents shared with forbes koguan owns 6 3 million shares of tesla and over 1 8 million in the money tesla call options as of sep 24 it s for long term you never bet short term on tesla koguan says of his investment thesis and i believe in the green technology koguan very publicly insists on twitter and linkedin that he s the third largest individual tesla shareholder the company did not respond to requests for comment though a company spokesman martin viecha appears to back koguan s claim in a september tweet as a non company director who owns less than 5 holdings of outstanding tesla stock koguan does not appear on any of tesla s securities and exchange commission filings given those tesla shares and his stake in privately held it company shi international forbes estimates koguan s fortune to be 8 6 billion that number reflects a 20 discount to the tesla holdings to take into account an undisclosed number of shares he holds in a margin account koguan insists that he doesn t care about his riches i spend 95 of my time not trying to make money but doing research says koguan speaking over video with forbes from his singapore penthouse which he purchased from vacuum cleaner mogul james dyson now he admits i spend a little bit more time on tesla born in indonesia koguan received a master s from columbia and law degree from new york law school in 1989 he married harvard mba thai lee later that year the couple paid less than 1 million for a software reseller that became shi international a global it provider with some 20 000 customers and over 11 billion in annual revenue lee continues to run the company while koguan an american citizen who moved back to asia years ago but still owns a large stake in the business serves as board chair according to koguan his belief in tesla is grounded in his admiration for its ceo elon musk the world s wealthiest person i regarded myself as elon s fanboy says koguan i would say he is the only person i really respect on earth hero worship of musk translates well to the twittersphere where koguan posts updates on his tesla shareholdings he says he s bought hundreds of thousands of more tesla shares in the last two weeks and where he ruminates about science technology and philosophy the 66 year old investor has attracted a small but dedicated online following of tesla diehards we shall now enter the word koguan into the dictionary it is a verb to mean accumulate tsla in massive quantities said one such follower we worship you and think you re the f ing man said another inviting koguan to host an ama ask me anything at tsla lounge a reddit community of 2 800 followers devoted to talking about the electric carmaker koguan says he didn t participate if you re a retail tesla investor then you know leo said tsla lounge contributor and tesla investor s3xy_art who painted a portrait of koguan and posted it on twitter he s a legend also he is a little eccentric but he is very humble and down to earth his eccentricities go well beyond his belief in tesla i m crazy about physics so i created my own system says koguan referring to his kqid time engine a byzantine concept geared toward computing the secret of our universe koguan says he applies kqid theory toward trading tesla options when koguan met his hero musk at spacex s headquarters in 2019 their conversation focused on general relativity and other physics theories nothing about tesla nothing about spacex he recalls koguan has embraced his status as a tesla whale but says he s still adjusting to the fandom he s received since he started talking about his tesla investments he only joined twitter in 2018 and declined to speak with forbes on previous occasions about his investments just now i m starting to talk to the media with the tweets and the podcasts sitting on his immense fortune of tesla shares koguan says he has no plans to sell and hopes to continue making profits on call options until he recollects 12 million shares the size of his stake in march 2020 if he d been able to hold onto those shares he d now likely be worth more than 12 billion koguan s long term plan is more outlandish to use his tesla holdings which he predicts will one day rise to 100 billion in value nearly equal to the current net worth of warren buffett to support and develop a new type of collective society fueled of course by his kqid time engine as for tesla koguan isn t looking back i m all in he recently tweeted i live or die with tesla follow me on or twitter or linkedin
traders in global bond markets may usher in the most critical moment of the year this week when the federal reserve and the bank of england are about to announce their high profile november interest rate decisions the shift has pushed the yield curve of parts of the global bond market out of its craziest run in decades as central banks have recently withdrawn from extraordinary monetary stimulus measures during the pandemic in just a few days the idea that major central banks would slowly raise interest rates was shattered short term yields from canada to australia last week rose the most since the 1990s and the collapse in short term bond prices caught even some of the best performing fund managers in the industry off guard at the same time long term bond yields have fallen a key sign that hawkish policy measures could lead to a slowdown in economic growth the non resistance policy of some central banks in the face of market interest rate hikes has also emboldened bond traders on wall street who are betting that the fed will begin to abandon its mantra that the accelerated rise in cpi is only a temporary side effect of the pandemic and inflationary pressures are temporary this week as traders in the interest rate market turned their attention from officials in ottawa and sydney to washington and london they now expect the chances of the fed raising interest rates by 25 basis points for the first time next june to be close to 90 the bank of england will raise interest rates as soon as this year and is even expected to raise rates four times by june next year there is no doubt that the market is testing the limits of central banks george bory of wells fargo asset management said in an interview britain and the united states set off the super week of the central bank the fed is widely expected to announce on wednesday that it will begin to scale back its 120 billion a month bond buying program and end it completely by the middle of next year the plan has helped drive down borrowing costs since the early days of the outbreak although federal reserve chairman colin powell jerome powell has repeatedly stressed before that there is no mechanical link between the tapering of bond purchases and the timing of interest rate hikes market traders bets now seem to overlap the two time points powell has said he will end the tapering of bond purchases in mid 2022 and the market s bet on the fed s first rate hike is also in the middle of next year the swap market on friday expected the fed to tighten policy rates of about 22 basis points at its june meeting as labour shortages pushed up wage and welfare costs to a record level this suggests that at least in the eyes of traders the fed will almost certainly raise interest rates by a standard 25 basis points just a week ago the figure was only 16 basis points indicating that the probability of raising interest rates by then was less than 2 3 looking further ahead the price of swaps now expects the fed to raise interest rates at least twice by 25 basis points each in 2022 in the interest rate bitmap dot plot released in september most fed officials expected to raise interest rates only once or not next year the fed seems to want to avoid taking the market by surprise by locking in its austerity program and is trying to postpone interest rate hikes until the second half of next year tim duy chief us analyst at sgh macro advisors a longtime fed watcher wrote on oct 27 the risk is that the more the fed refuses to signal a more aggressive rate rise in the future the more damaging the market reaction will be when such a signal is sent also interesting this week is the bank of england on thursday the change in language of the bank of england over the past month has led money markets to expect the bank of england to raise the repo rate which is currently at an all time low of 0 1 per cent by the end of the year as inflation expectations rise while the possibility of raising interest rates earlier this week is relatively slim but it s not out of the question at the beginning of the uk outbreak in march last year the bank of england cut interest rates to a very low level of 0 1 per cent which has been maintained ever since inflationary pressures and statements by central bankers have led the market to believe that the bank of england will be the first of the world s major central banks to raise interest rates bailey governor of the bank of england made a hawkish speech at the g30 international banking seminar last month saying that although the central bank could do nothing about the supply chain crisis and the energy crisis it will have to take action to curb inflation at present deutsche bank has advanced the expected time for the bank of england to raise interest rates to this week however in its forward looking report barclays does not believe that the bank of england will raise interest rates this week arguing that if the uk s structural problems are to be solved the bank of england will raise interest rates by 15 basis points in december followed by 25 basis points each in february and may next year global bond markets may continue to be volatile for traders in global bond markets many bond market bulls have suffered the consequences of a shift by central banks over the past week australian three year bond yields rose in october at their biggest monthly rise since 1994 amid signs that the rba has deliberately abandoned its goal of defending the yield curve the bank of canada unexpectedly ended its bond buying programme on wednesday and hinted that interest rates could rise early in the future narrowing the gap between the country s 2 year and 10 year bond yields to its lowest level in nearly 20 years in europe although ecb president christine lagarde said market expectations of an interest rate hike next year were not in line with the bank s guidance investors pushed their expectations of an interest rate hike sharply forward the volatility also spread to the us where the spread between 2 year and 10 year treasury yields narrowed by 13 basis points on wednesday cornerstone macro cornerstone macro estimates that this is one of the biggest one day fluctuations in the treasury yield curve since 2000 this has caught some senior fund managers off guard billionaire chris rokos s hedge fund fell 11 in october as it bet on the anglo american yield curve at the wrong time this is the worst market situation we can see george saravelos global head of foreign exchange research at deutsche bank wrote in a report titled now the var shock on oct 28 var shock refers to a surge in investment losses resulting in the liquidation of positions charlie mcelligott an analyst at nomura securities also pointed out that the var of large hedge funds increased overnight as traders worried about the hawk turn of global central banks clients bad positions were tied up traders were largely unable to provide liquidity and had to deal with event risk and var restrictions which further exacerbated the sell off in bonds for now however many investors and strategists believe that the market s current expectations of interest rate increases by major central banks are excessive and underestimate the risk of a slowdown in economic growth next year and historically the fed tends to lead other central banks in monetary policy reform rather than follow the market is a little ahead said peter tchir head of macro strategy at academy securities the fed will have an active dialogue with the market this week of course in any case this week is a big risk for investors in global financial markets and for the federal reserve neil dutta head of economics at renaissance macro research said the key question is does the fed want to verify the market bet on raising interest rates how can the fed build its credibility by keeping its words in line with its deeds or by changing as the situation develops there are a lot of outstanding questions

tokyo japanese prime minister fumio kishida s ruling ldp defied expectations and held its strong majority in sunday s parliamentary election solidifying his position in a fractious party and allowing him to ramp up stimulus kishida s conservative liberal democratic party ldp emerged with fewer seats in the powerful lower house than it won in the last election in 2017 but the ldp maintained its single party majority in a big victory for kishida who took power only a month ago the result was at odds with expectations and initial exit polls that suggested the ldp hurt by perceptions it mishandled the coronavirus pandemic would need to rely on its junior coalition party for a majority kishida a soft spoken former banker who has struggled to shake off an image that he lacks charisma is also likely to be emboldened by the win kishida who called the election soon after taking the top post has hewed to traditional policies of the party s right wing pushing to increase military spending but has also promised to address wealth inequality touting a new capitalism that has stoked concern among investors in the end the ldp claimed 261 seats against the 276 it held before the election an absolute stable majority that will give it control of parliamentary committees and ease passage of legislation including key budget proposals kishida s publicly stated goal had been for the coalition to keep a majority at least 233 seats of the 465 in the lower house although that was widely seen as a lowball target given the junior coalition partner komeito had 29 seats before the election together the ldp and komeito secured 293 seats the overall trend is in favour of stability the ldp cleared the hurdles it absolutely had to said tobias harris senior fellow at the center for american progress we ll see a lot of stimulus he said japanese stocks cheered the victory with the nikkei up 2 38 soon after trade began a poorer showing would have heightened expectations that kishida could follow predecessor yoshihide suga in becoming another short term premier the party did take some notable hits including the loss by its secretary general akira amari in his single seat district and a former economy minister and the leader of one the party s factions nobuteru ishihara who lost to an opposition candidate in a western tokyo district extra budget targeted kishida said the administration would attempt to compile an extra budget this year in what would be a tight schedule i hope to pass through parliament an extra budget this year he told reporters this would involve funding steps to support people hit by the pandemic such as those who lost jobs and students struggling to pay tuitions a big winner was the conservative osaka based japan innovation party projected to more than treble its seats and surpass komeito as the third force in the lower house after the opposition constitutional democratic party of japan the emergence of the osaka party as a national force may complicate kishida s pledge to roll back neoliberal economic policies the innovation party is really sweeping the osaka region they ve emerged as an important conservative bloc said yoichiro sato a professor of international relations at ritsumeikan asia pacific university they are going to block kishida s new capitalism idea of narrowing the rich poor income gap the usually splintered opposition was united with only one party including the widely shunned japanese communist party facing off against the coalition in most districts some voters including yoshihiko suzuki who voted for the main opposition candidate in his district and the communists in proportional representation hoped the poll might teach the ldp a lesson suzuki 68 and retired said the ldp s years in power made it complacent and arrogant underscored by a series of money and cronyism scandals i hope this election comes as a wakeup call for them he said if it does the ldp will become a better party considering the number of talented lawmakers they ve got live tv

among the many nicknames conjured up by his opponents empty shelves joe may be the harshest on the very dedicated u s president joe biden since taking office high inflation rates and a serious supply chain crisis linger on and empty shelves run across stores and markets nationwide the situation is expected to continue and stands to affect the christmas shopping season from mid to late december as usual china becomes the easy target some american politicians claim that the root cause of the ongoing supply chain crisis in the west lies in china s accomplishment of extreme poverty alleviation after the living standards of 1 4 billion chinese people are improved the population s consumption of food and energy has amplified a newfangled conspiracy theory sets forth that the chinese government is interfering in the production activities of enterprises in order to control the global supply chain and bring down the u s economy so that china can take over the reins and rule the world these statements do not measure up to further analysis the biggest loophole being has china really reduced its exports to the u s at a time when the u s supply chain is in dire crisis according to statistics from the general administration of customs of china china s total exports in the first half of this year reached 9 85 trillion yuan 1 54 trillion an increase of 23 8 percent over the same period in 2019 exports to the u s continued to expand and the total distribution of goods to the u s in september increased by 15 04 percent compared with august ergo if the u s is indeed experiencing a major supply chain crunch this is by no means china s fault in reality one of the major reasons is an overissue of greenbacks this is how the u s has been dealing with economic crisis overissuing using paper money to acquire solid goods from other countries and transferring inflationary pressures onto the rest of the world the latest report from the international monetary fund shows that the expected gdp growth rate of the u s in 2021 remains 6 percent on the surface the negative impact of the epidemic on the american economy is fading social demand is strong and most enterprises are once again turning a profit yet since the outbreak of covid 19 epidemic in 2020 the u s has bore witness to a somewhat bizarre phenomenon in which social production activities have in fact stagnated but the stock market still displays a rebound√¢ a continuous elevation even the wealth of the richest 1 percent in the u s has increased by more than 6 5 trillion on the other hand during the pandemic the american government implemented several policies to stimulate consumption not only directly depositing the dollar bills into every citizen s bank account but also offering a large number of relief funds to the unemployed therein hides the second problem the u s does not face a shortage of goods it faces a shortage of labor different sectors feature different degrees of labor shortages with the trade and transportation industries standing out at present it is reported that mountains of cargo are stuck at chief ports across the u s the latest data released by the u s department of labor showed that 4 3 million americans chose to quit their jobs in august the highest number since statistics were first recorded including many longshoremen and truck drivers beyond the aforesaid the factors of a weakening global production capacity and a surge in international freight rates too must be addressed while covid 19 remains the immediate cause preventing many countries from returning to full production capacity the current spike in global energy prices has dramatically increased the cost of commodity production and transportation when factories are experiencing difficulties to obtain sufficient energy and consequently face the risks of making fewer profits this will in turn affect the supply chain the u s is not alone in this regard as china is also hit hard by rising energy prices especially when it is entering central heating season the best we can do is to join hands and deal with the same challenges we all face print edition title the crunch conspiracy copyedited by elsbeth van paridon

pennsylvania tennessee washington and wisconsin dole won 6 states with an outright majority and 13 with a plurality while perot did not carry a single state the reelection campaign of the democratic president was based on an open appeal to business and corporate support and the dropping of any appeal to the economic interests of working people in keeping with the policy known as triangulation devised in conjunction with his chief political adviser dick morris rather than position himself as the advocate of any type of democratic party liberalism clinton presented himself as balancing between the right wing republicans who had taken control of congress in 1994 and the democratic minority he aligned himself with the republicans in abolishing welfare and adopting other austerity measures and with the democrats in opposing cuts to medicare and medicaid this in effect conceded continuing republican control of congress although the congressional elections took place at the same time as clinton s reelection victory the democrats lost a handful of seats in the senate and gained a few in the house but the results left the republicans in control of both legislative chambers the second clinton administration promised to be even more right wing and hostile to the working class than the first it was prepared to reach agreement with the republican congressional leadership on a plan to balance the budget and immediately planned to begin talks with the republican leadership in the hopes of reaching a consensus plan by the following february in spite of the campaign rhetoric about preserving and protecting medicare the administration proposed initial cuts of 124 billion just after the destruction of welfare the ruling class celebrated the reelection of the right wing democratic president and right wing republican congress with the biggest post election rally in the stock market since herbert hoover was elected president in 1928 just a year before the wall street crash that ushered in the great depression the dow jones industrial average rose 518 points in the first three weeks of november after passing the 6 000 mark in mid october 50 years ago josip tito visits us and canada president of yugoslavia josip tito visited the united states this week in 1971 traveling to canada directly afterwards while in the us tito met with president richard nixon at the white house to discuss relations between the two countries and negotiate trade agreements upon tito s arrival on october 28 nixon arranged for a pomp filled military display including a 21 gun salute military band honor guard and a state dinner at the white house to welcome the stalinist yugoslav leader when asked about his opinion of america tito responded that he liked the business like spirit of american businessmen tito by this time had become known as a leader of the so called non aligned countries that officially supported neither the united states nor the soviet union and hoped to balance between them to cut better deals for themselves in great part however the non aligned movement signified a shift of countries with former anti imperialist pretenses toward the camp of american business interests for yugoslavia this meant liquidating the gains that yugoslav workers made following world war ii during the visit tito praised nixon as a statesman who has boldly undertaken major initiatives for important and necessary contracts thus opening up new avenues for negotiations nixon spoke similarly fondly of his guest saying of tito he has strong views but he is able to talk to anyone in the world he is an excellent judge of people we hit it off so well the visit marked a critical step in the crisis of stalinism and confirmed that dissident stalinist leaders such as tito following in the footsteps of mao s china were making their peace with imperialism the bulletin the american predecessor to the world socialist web site wrote of the visit while pretending to deny the logic of the class struggle through talk about peaceful coexistence the stalinists are thrown into panic tito flatters nixon kosygin walks arm in arm with trudeau brezhnev pays homage to the bourgeois tri color of france and mao enters the united nations all for the purpose of appeasing imperialism through conscious betrayals of the working class the relationship of tito and the yugoslav bureaucracy to the world bank expresses with the greatest clarity the real role of stalinism it is the bribed agent of the bourgeoisie within the working class in must be exposed and destroyed through the struggle for the fourth international 75 years ago american trotskyists advance socialist program in elections this week in november 1946 the socialist workers party swp then the american section of the world trotskyist movement urged workers to vote for its candidates in a series of state and national elections that were underway in the november 2 issue of its newspaper the militant the swp described the campaign as the most ambitious electoral intervention in the history of american trotskyism it was standing candidates in new york washington minnesota new jersey ohio and california some for statewide offices such as governor and others for the us senate and congress in all the states except minnesota and washington the swp candidates were excluded from the ballot due to anti democratic requirements and could only be voted for by write in in new york the swp had solicited thousands of signatures to secure ballot position but the state democratic party machine lodged a successful legal challenge on technical grounds the swp linked its campaign to a groundswell of working class struggles expressed in the 1945 46 strike wave that was the largest to that point in american history involving some 5 million workers its november 2 editorial headlined vote labor by voting swp declared vote swp because it is the only way in this election to support genuine working class representatives it is your chance to say you re through with capitalist politics you want the labor movement to build its own party in its campaign the swp rallied opposition to the ongoing promotion of racialist politics by the democrats and the republicans they noted that democratic and republican politicians had been implicated in a series of recent lynchings and their cover ups while the democrats in particular were spearheading the fight against black voting rights in the south amid the opening stages of the us led cold war directed against the soviet union the swp made a powerful denunciation of militarism both of the capitalist parties the swp stated also vie in proclaiming their loyalty to american imperialism its military preparations its occupations of foreign lands and seizure of bases its atomic bomb diplomacy its get tough policy on the soviet union on this issue of issues foreign policy wall street does not permit even the suggestion of differences 100 years ago japanese prime minister assassinated on november 4 1921 the japanese prime minister takashi hara was stabbed to death as he boarded a train by a right wing railway switchman kon ichi nakaoka nakaoka despised hara and his party the rikken seiy≈´kai association of friends of constitutional government for its corruption for toying with idea of universal suffrage for its conduct in soviet siberia which the right regarded as insufficiently aggressive and for its connections to large capitalist corporations hara had been on his way to a meeting of his party in kyoto hara came into office in the aftermath of the rice riots of 1918 the first great uprising of the japanese working class while he did not grant suffrage to all male japanese workers and peasants he expanded the number of voters he was what might be called a machine politician who depended on parliamentary majorities to dispense patronage and funds to supporters and to manage corruption and the influence of large corporations hara advocated diplomacy as the means to promote japan s interests and in the division of the victors spoils in the aftermath of world war i he oversaw the japanese entry into the league of nations that is japan s development from a regional pacific power into world imperialist politics he brokered an agreement that gave china nominal sovereignty over its shandong peninsula which japan had seized from germany in 1914 hara pursued a policy of accommodation and conciliation with the united states in the words of the new york times and drew down japanese forces occupying eastern siberia in the aftermath of the development of a korean nationalist movement japan had occupied korea since 1895 and the brutal suppression of pro independence protests in 1919 hara permitted minor reforms in that country

beijing ap china s economic rebound from the coronavirus pandemic is stalling as president xi jinping s government cracks down on surging corporate debt for a decade the ruling communist party has talked about shifting to economy based on spending by 1 4 billion consumers instead of on building factories and apartments but with each slowdown beijing fell back on pepping up growth with more construction and borrowing finally xi s government is confronting the problem by clamping down on borrowing by a real estate industry that supports millions of jobs that is sending shockwaves through the economy businesses and households are jittery as housing sales and construction slump that is chilling auto and retail sales it has possible global repercussions as china buys less steel and other building materials many customers would like to wait and see said liang qiming a salesman for online real estate broker 5i5j com in nanchang a southern provincial capital that was turned into a boomtown by a flurry of construction over the past two decades china became the world s factory but the bigger power driving its economic boom was a construction frenzy that took off in the late 1990s developers and local governments poured borrowed money into blanketing the country with new apartments office towers shopping malls bridges and railways xi s government appears to be willing to accept a politically painful slowdown to get that debt under control and achieve the longer term goal of self sustaining safer growth beijing doesn t want growth at all costs followed by the likely or inevitable financial market crash which is very much the sort of european u s model said robert carnell head of asia research for ing financial markets are on edge about whether one of the biggest developers evergrande group might be allowed to collapse under 2 trillion yuan 310 billion in debt as a warning to others beijing wants to make sure families receive apartments sold to them by evergrande before they were built as is common in china economists say but they say it is trying to avoid sending the wrong message by bailing out the company evergrande is a pre emptive cleanup carnell said china revived from the coronavirus pandemic earlier than the united states europe or japan but but that rebound quickly flattened out depressed by the building slump the economy expanded just 4 9 over a year earlier in the three months ending in september much weaker than the previous quarter s 7 9 growth compared with the previous quarter the way other major economies are measured growth in the three months ending in september fell to 0 2 among the weakest of the past decade housing sales fell 32 in september from a year earlier buyers were put off by curbs on mortgage lending and anxiety about whether developers might fail to deliver apartments paid for in advance that means less spending on furniture and appliances with no sign beijing will ease up forecasters expect the economy to weaken further since consumers who are reluctant to spend won t fill the gap left by lower investment this quarter s growth might fall as low as 3 over a year ago according to nomura bank of america cut its full year forecast from 8 to 7 7 which still would be among the world s strongest it slashed next year s outlook from 5 3 to just 4 the total owed by companies households and the government rose to almost the equivalent of three times annual economic output last year from 270 in 2018 high for a middle income country xi affirmed his priorities at an august planning meeting calling for high quality development and forestalling major financial risks according to the official xinhua news agency china is in the middle of a transformation from growth driven by blind investments to high quality growth said zuo xiaolei an economist in beijing regulators tightened control over use of debt by real estate developers last year hundreds already had gone bankrupt following other restrictions imposed since 2017 tightening control beijing on oct 15 declared 19 of china s biggest banks that account for three quarters of their industry s assets to be domestic

sign up for daily news updates from cleantechnica on email or follow us on google news every time i write about solar vehicles i get the same thing from people in the comments and on social media like that s a stupid gimmick that ll add like a mile a day what a joke that can t even run the air conditioning while these statements have been true for decades solar technology and ev efficiency have slowly been chipping away at the problem now vehicles like the never charge aptera and the sono sion are proving that solar can power at least a good chunk of people s driving but can it work for larger vehicles the answer isn t a hard no like it once was the amount of yes is on the rise even for people who don t want to drive a clown truck sono and ari light delivery truck earlier this month sono motors worked with ari to add solar to a 458 box body truck while not a full sized truck or even a normal sized truck it s still an incredibly useful little beast in cities at airports or just for the last mile of package delivery the 458 box body can carry almost 1200 pounds 531 kg and up to 2 8 cubic meters about 100 cubic feet of cargo it can go a maximum of 80 km h about 50 mph and has a range of 75 300 miles on a charge at full throttle the 458 box truck uses only 7 5 kw of electric power but most driving would be with far less current so it s really an ideal platform to experiment with solar drive power sono took the stock 458 box truck and added solar modules made with ultra thin chemically stressed front glass to provide up to 450 watts of energy at peak performance under normal conditions in munich they figure that it will add 20 km of range daily without plugging in and up to 45 km of range under more ideal conditions like you d find in the us southwest sono solar sono motors b2b unit is a one stop shop for vehicle integrated photovoltaics vipv and our aim is to make every vehicle a solar vehicle the intersolar exhibition is the perfect platform to show our proprietary technology and services and we are very pleased to be able to present existing partnerships and prototypes like the electric ari transporter says mathieu baudrit sono solar group lead at sono motors fraunhofer is testing a larger solar truck when it comes to cargo trucks justin hammer was right size does matter don t let anyone tell you differently in murica we need a big 9 000 pound truck just to go to the store and buy kitty litter don t believe me ask gm about the hummer ev clown cars like the 458 box truck might be useful for the city parks and recreation department to drive around the baseball fields or for the airport to stuff tiny meals into planes with but don t expect to see them on the road when it comes to doing a real man s man work we want to be like rubber duck in the 1978 movie convoy my daddy always told me to be like a duck stay smooth on the surface and paddle like the devil underneath if we can t push 80 000 lb down the road while strung out on caffeine and modafinil among other things while eating an echo modded radio microphone and saying breaker one nine on 27 185 mhz am with an illegal 600 watt linear amplifier that makes the lights go dim when you key it up it s just not good enough i m kidding about most of the above of course while the hummer ev does weigh in at 9 000 pounds and we really do love our big vehicles almost nobody even knows what most of the last paragraph even means you ll just have to watch the youtube video and hang out at truck stops a little more to see if i m making stuff up many reasonable sane people who wouldn t ram the new mexico state police or the illinois national guard out of the way and who want to carry cargo for an honest living do really need a larger vehicle than the 458 box truck where s the solar panel for us rubber ducks fortunately the industry is working on giving even the biggest trucks some juice from the giant thermonuclear fireball in the sky fraunhofer has an electric truck driving on german roads right now with 3500 watts of solar power on the trailer sure it s no 18 wheeler but 18 tons gvwr is nothing to sneeze at either the 3 5 kilowatts of power only takes care of 5 10 percent of the electric truck s energy needs by successfully putting our high voltage photovoltaic system into operation we have achieved our goal of demonstrating the feasibility of vehicle integrated photovoltaics for heavy duty electric utility vehicles the technical components integrated into the truck function as we expected said christoph kutter project manager at fraunhofer ise there is one small safety risk though to directly charge the truck s traction battery the panels are wired in series and put out that 3500 watts of power at over 400 volts in the event of an accident that s a lot of juice to be randomly flipping around in the face of emergency workers and good samaritan types fraunhofer thought ahead and installed an automatic disconnect that cuts every solar panel off from the whole system reducing the voltage down to safe levels feeding 5 10 of the vehicle s needs from solar might seem sort of silly but fraunhofer plans to run the truck hauling real loads for a year on german roads to collect data by collecting the data on how much solar power ends up being generated used and replaced they can get a much better idea of how to build better solar vehicles in the future as the technology improves after all solar panels are getting better all the time and it will eventually be possible to take care of a significant portion of the truck s power plus trucks operating in cities and trucks that spend a lot of time sitting during the day will benefit even more from this technology so fear not rubber ducks the power of the sun will soon be yours featured

japan s coalition govt retains power in weekend elections japanese prime minister fumio kishida said he hoped to issue a fresh stimulus package by the end of the year after retaining power in weekend elections tokyo japan s ruling coalition celebrated holding on to a strong majority in weekend elections with prime minister fumio kishida hailing the results as a big deal for trust while saying he wants to focus on boosting the world s third biggest economy investors in tokyo cheered news that kishida s long ruling liberal democratic party ldp and its junior coalition partner komeito had won 293 of the 465 seats in parliament s lower house the benchmark nikkei stock index rose more than two percent after japanese media reported the result which enables the ruling bloc to enact bills on issues from pandemic stimulus to defence spending on its own but even though the coalition lost fewer seats than feared newspaper editorials urged kishida who took office a month ago to act decisively to shore up public support ahead of a key upper house vote next summer kishida said sunday that exit polls demonstrated the public s faith in the ldp which has held power almost continuously since the 1950s if the ruling coalition is given a majority the government is given trust it is a big deal the 64 year old said he said he hoped to issue a fresh stimulus package by the end of the year to counter the impact of covid 19 on the economy having previously said the relief measures would be worth tens of trillions of yen kishida has outlined plans to tackle inequality heightened by the pro business policies of his predecessors yoshihide suga and shinzo abe japan s longest ruling prime minister the ldp has also said it will aim to increase defence spending to counter threats from china and north korea but the new prime minister now needs to fully prepare for a possible sixth wave of virus infections as early as this winter and firm up how his economic policy ideas will work in practice the asahi shimbun daily said in an editorial tough poll battle a decline in the number of ldp seats had been expected for kishida after his predecessor yoshihide suga resigned just a year into the job partly due to public discontent over the government s response to the virus crisis japan has recorded around 18 000 deaths a comparatively low toll for its population of 126 million and has never imposed a blanket lockdown but many businesses especially bars and restaurants have suffered through prolonged periods of restrictions on commercial activity the ldp previously boasted a commanding majority of 276 seats on its own and in sunday s vote held on to 261 maintaining its single party majority in recent decades votes against the ldp have been split between multiple major opposition parties but this time five rival parties boosted cooperation in a bid to dent its stranglehold the yomiuri shimbun daily said the ruling party had been forced to fight tough election battles throughout japan but differences in key policy positions between the two main opposition parties the constitutional democratic party of japan cdp and the japanese communist party especially over the country s relationship with the united states led to their defeat the newspaper said meanwhile a surge in votes for the osaka based reformist nippon ishin party pushed it to become the third largest party after the ldp and cdp nippon ishin gathered votes from conservative voters who are frustrated with the ldp komeito coalition government the yomiuri said an estimated 56 percent of voters cast their ballots japanese media said a continuation of the low turnout rates that have plagued the country s elections in recent years the prime minister has said he wants to attend the cop26 summit in glasgow as his first overseas engagement after the election
file japan s prime minister and ruling liberal democratic party leader fumio kishida speaks at the party headquarters in tokyo on oct 31 2021 kishida says japan should revitalize its economy through new capitalism many in this avidly capitalist country are puzzled over exactly what he has in mind behrouz mehri pool photo via ap file tokyo prime minister fumio kishida says japan should revitalize its economy through new capitalism many in this avidly capitalist country are puzzled over exactly what he has in mind kishida has said he believes a more equal distribution of wealth is needed to prevent the world s third largest economy from sinking into stagnation that sounds dramatic but analysts say he doesn t stand for drastic change recommended videos the conservative pro u s and pro business liberal democratic party which has ruled japan almost continuously since world war ii won a better than expected 261 seats sunday in the lower house of parliament comfortably exceeding the 233 seats needed and giving kishida a mandate at least for now with this definite support from the people i will dedicate myself to working on policies and parliamentary efforts said kishida chosen as head of the governing party just a month earlier the liberal democrats prevailed over weaker opposition parties despite widespread unhappiness until a recent drop in cases with the government s handling of the coronavirus pandemic perennial corruption scandals and a failure to deliver on promises for sweeping reforms intended to drive much faster growth kishida appears unlikely to stray far from the pro market policies of the past decade under former prime minister shinzo abe who stayed in office from late 2012 mid 2020 the economy limped along with massive help from the central bank s ultra cheap credit and government spending abe s successor yoshihide suga stuck with that abenomics program now japanese are waiting to see what kishidanomics will bring kishidanomics remains a complete mystery to me said kinuko kuwabara a free lancer in shizuoka prefecture central japan what people really want tackled are coronavirus pandemic measures and corruption in high places she said maybe kishida himself isn t sure what he plans to do said hideo kumano executive chief economist at dai ichi life research institute all we have are slogans it s unclear how much you can really believe them and how they can be realized topping kishida s to do list is another big dose of government spending to help japan recover from the covid 19 shock the economy grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 9 in the april june quarter a tepid pace considering the severity of the pandemic downturn in 2020 when taking office kishida said he believed raising the tax on capital gains would help to rebalance an economy that is growing increasingly unequal although the disparity of wealth is greater statistically in the u s than in japan americans have access to more generous social welfare programs according to oecd data that means poverty is a growing problem in japan especially among single mothers struggling to make a living wage kishida backtracked from talk of raising taxes after a few days of stock market sell offs saying a higher capital gains tax which would help redress japan s highly regressive tax regime would have to wait until the economy was growing at a much stronger pace he now says he hopes to drive growth by slashing corporate taxes which abe also did in the classic trickle down strategy of encouraging companies to raise wages that approach has fallen flat however as companies hoarded their earnings instead a growing share of workers are employed part time or on contracts that don t provide full benefits the tax system meanwhile penalizes families with two full time incomes in the era of rapid growth that followed world war ii workers were promised jobs for life with lifetime employment a vanishing dream people need to freely job hop and find new opportunities and skills economists say that apart from boosting wages to encourage consumer spending what japan really needs for sustainable growth is deregulation and a freer labor market that s daunting and politically risky because such changes require reforms that would shake up vested interests angering the constituencies such as farmers and big businesses that have helped keep the liberal democrats in power for so long the current system protects and rewards old guard under performing companies while failing to drive innovation none of this was headline news in the run up to sunday s election when opposition parties campaigned on promises of cash handouts and lowering taxes the liberal democrats meanwhile promised more spending in coronavirus research carbon neutrality hydrogen energy and efforts to restart nuclear plants not better social safety nets and redistributing wealth we don t know for sure what he plans to do but we know his approach will not be that different from abenomics said hideaki tanaka a professor of public policy at meiji university in tokyo what we have is a to do list without a real analysis of why japan isn t growing and lacks innovation and a real diagnosis of what s behind this sickness there can be no cure he said ___ yuri kageyama is on twitter
a lengthy three part series on the january 6 attack on the us capitol published sunday on the website of the washington post provides new evidence that federal agencies were well aware of the advance preparations for fascist violence and turned a blind eye permitting the coup plot to go ahead according to the post the reports of imminent violence flooding in to federal agencies were so numerous that one official at the department of the homeland security in washington alerted local hospitals to prepare for a mass casualty event on january 6 the official urged hospitals to lay in additional blood supplies to treat the wounded the concerns of this official and many others however were overridden by the decision of the fbi issued on december 23 to shut down any systematic threat assessment related to january 6 with the declaration that it does not warrant further investigation at this time trump supporters at the us capitol building on january 6 2021 two weeks later several thousand fascist rioters stormed the us capitol shutting down congressional certification of trump s election defeat and seeking to capture vice president mike pence house speaker nancy pelosi and other top officials if they had been able to take hostages there is little doubt that the democratic party would have capitulated to demands to overturn the election and allow trump to extend his presidency the new account of the january 6 attack based on material collected by nearly two dozen reporters is divided into three parts headlined red flags bloodshed and contagion the first segment also labeled before contains much valuable even remarkable material the second and third sections labeled during and after are far less significant and in the case of the latter even misleading red flags begins by noting the efforts of a local homeland security official in washington d c donell harvin whose office had spotted increasing signs that supporters of president donald trump were planning violence when congress met to formalize the electoral college vote but federal law enforcement agencies did not seem to share his sense of urgency on january 2 harvin and another local security official mike sena in san francisco organized a conference call of fusion centers inter agency security offices spread across 80 regions of the united states which unexpectedly drew the attendance of hundreds of officials all reporting a similar upsurge in internet threats of violence the post account continues for the first time from coast to coast the centers were blinking red the hour date and location of concern was the same 1 p m the u s capitol jan 6 harvin made further attempts to sound the alarm he invited the federal bureau of investigation the department of homeland security military intelligence services and other agencies to see the information in real time as his team collected it he took another extreme step he asked the city s health department to convene a call of d c area hospitals and urged them to prepare for a mass casualty event empty your emergency rooms he said and stock up your blood banks according to the post additional alerts were raised by local officials fbi informants social media companies former national security officials researchers lawmakers and tipsters new documents and firsthand accounts show none of these efforts however could sway top decision makers in the national security apparatus and particularly at the fbi and the pentagon who were either intimidated by trump or were part of his fascistic cabal according to the post there was so much material now bubbling up about jan 6 that bureau analysts running the fbi s online portal where social media companies were reporting suspected criminal behavior had begun using a hashtag to track and organize incoming threats certunrest2021 one pro trump web site thedonald win appeared more than 300 times in fbi investigative reports leading up to january 6 without the agency taking any action the fbi dismissed the open planning for violence including threats to kill congressmen senators and anyone else who stood in trump s way as vague and primarily first amendment protected speech given that the fbi is one of the leading enemies of free speech rights particularly when asserted by opponents of american imperialism and representatives of workers minorities and victims of police brutality its solicitude for the first amendment is not credible the fbi didn t crack down on the fascist filth plotting violence on january 6 because fbi officials and agents were largely in agreement with these plans or at least their political aims at the department of homeland security the massive super agency created after the 9 11 attacks supposedly to centralize the defense of targets within the united states against terrorist threats top officials most of them acting officials kept on a short leash by the white house did not take any special measures except to fly in several hundred border patrol agents to protect their own offices in the district of columbia the post writes but it did not issue a security bulletin the department s most readily recognized warning to law enforcement agencies as well as to the public regarding possible violence agency leaders also never moved to put the secret service in charge of security planning for an event that would bring together all members of congress the vice president and the vice president elect a move that could have elevated intelligence sharing and security coordination similarly the pentagon stayed on the sidelines with top civilian and military leaders evading requests for the deployment of the national guard both ahead of and during the attack on the capitol acting defense secretary christopher miller army secretary ryan mccarthy and general mark milley chairman of the joint chiefs of staff reviewed a request from washington d c mayor muriel bowser to deploy several hundred national guard troops for traffic control on january 6 which would free the washington metropolitan police for duty at the capitol the post writes the main concern of both bowser and the pentagon officials was that trump might direct national guard troops to interfere with the vote count or otherwise engage in action that could be perceived as intimidating congress in other words both the pentagon officials and the democratic mayor viewed mobilization of the national guard as something of a double edged sword since trump still the commander in chief for two weeks until the january 20 inauguration might order the troops to halt the certification of the electoral college vote by congress bowser with her close connections to congressional democrats would undoubtedly have informed house speaker nancy pelosi of her concerns but neither the congressional leadership nor president elect biden sought to alert the american people to the danger that the outgoing president just rejected by the voters might seek to stay in power by force the post report is completely silent on this crucial political aspect of the january 6 crisis it indicts trump for good reason but gives the democratic party a pass the account underscores the reality that the events of january 6 were not a spontaneous riot by disappointed trump supporters whipped into a frenzy at a rally outside the white house but rather the outcome of several months of incitement organization and preparation it retraces the statements issued by trump in the two months following the election and the response at each point of the various fascist groups particularly the proud boys and the more informal networks of ultra right activists with an increasing focus on the congressional ceremony to certify the results of the electoral college vote the newspaper s account continues trump was the driving force at every turn as he orchestrated what would become an attempted political coup in the months leading up to jan 6 calling his supporters to washington encouraging the mob to march on the capitol and freezing in place key federal agencies whose job it was to investigate and stop threats to national security it then cites trump s notorious tweet calling on supporters to come to washington for january 6 be there will be wild however the refusal of federal security agencies to take action is dismissed with the same whitewash theory first developed in response to the september 11 2001 attacks to explain away the close connections between the hijackers and american intelligence agencies failure to connect the dots the post writes the paralysis that led to one of the biggest security failures in the nation s history was driven by unique breakdowns inside each law enforcement agency and was exacerbated by the patchwork nature of security across a city where responsibilities are split between local and federal authorities the political purpose of this theory is demonstrated particularly in the final part of the series the second part is largely a blow by blow account of the events of january 6 itself containing little new information part three headlined contagion follows the impact of the january 6 attack on individual policemen participants in the attack and election officials responsible for vote counting in the election it avoids however any assessment of the response of the us political establishment to the attack there is no discussion of the failed impeachment the failed effort to establish a bipartisan commission to investigate january 6 or the establishment of the house select committee which has become the chosen vehicle of the democratic party leadership to strictly limit the release of information to that permitted by the biden administration the overriding concern of the democrats is to conceal the deep involvement of wide layers of the republican party including virtually the entire republican membership of the house of representatives and many republican senators in trump s illegal and unconstitutional effort to overturn the election and stay in office a report last week from rolling stone citing two organizers of the january 6 rally at which trump urged his supporters to walk to the capitol and fight like hell said that a dozen republican congressmen and several top trump aides including white house chief of staff mark meadows participated in

one week ago on october 24 2021 the world socialist web site and the international workers alliance of rank and file committees iwa rfc hosted an historic webinar titled how to end the pandemic the event which has now been viewed by over 10 000 people from over 100 countries on every habitable continent heard testimony from scientists and workers who have advocated for the global elimination of sars cov 2 the virus that causes covid 19 the reports at the webinar explained the present state of the pandemic how the virus spreads in aerosol form the impact of long covid the role that schools play in viral transmission and what must be done to eliminate the virus worldwide the event made clear that the vast majority of all global deaths from covid 19 have been entirely preventable each report is now available in exhibit format on the wsws introducing the event wsws international editorial board chairman david north condemned the corporate media cover up of the ongoing global mass death from covid 19 and posed the question confronted with the reality of this continuing disaster at what point does it become necessary to start referring to covid not only as a pandemic but as a form of social holocaust over the ensuing five days it could be said that this point has been reached on friday the official global death toll from covid 19 surpassed five million people this figure horrific in itself is known to be a vast under count a tracker of excess deaths by the economist estimates that the most likely true global death toll now stands at a staggering 16 7 million people roughly equivalent to the global death toll from world war i the same tracker estimates that nearly 200 000 people are now dying from covid 19 every week amid the ongoing wave of mass death governments worldwide are scrapping all remaining measures to slow the spread of covid 19 with the grotesque mantra that society must learn to live with the virus two parallel processes are unfolding countries that had limited mitigation measures in place are now lifting them all while countries that had more aggressive measures aimed at eliminating the virus are giving in to mounting pressure to let the virus rip through society countries throughout the asia pacific that had previously eliminated covid 19 are quickly lifting all restrictions on monday south korea will officially enter the first phase of a gradual return to normal life in singapore there is now a seven day average of 3 707 official daily new cases only two months after the country was recording less than 50 cases per day in new zealand which abandoned the elimination strategy at the beginning of october there are now an average of 104 new cases every day and rising global finance capital is increasingly pressuring china to abandon its elimination strategy and reopen its borders to resolve the global supply chain crisis potentially exposing 1 4 billion people to the virus across europe and north america new covid 19 cases remain highly elevated or are surging once again as winter approaches the united states united kingdom russia ukraine turkey and germany now account for roughly half of all official new cases globally in germany despite the fact that cases are rising exponentially the government refuses to enact any public health measures in the us where daily new cases appear to have reached a trough at roughly 65 000 per day and another surge is lurking around the corner international travel restrictions are set to be fully lifted on november 8 due to the persistently high rates of transmission throughout the us there have already been 13 799 official breakthrough deaths among fully vaccinated individuals not including florida and other states that have covered up this data at a previous wsws webinar on august 22 new zealand epidemiologist dr michael baker condemned the school reopening policies of the boris johnson administration in the uk as a barbaric experiment similar statements were made by multiple scientists at the october 24 webinar dr deepti gurdasani referred to the uk policies as frankly criminal and dr jose luis jimenez criticized world governments for refusing to acknowledge the aerosolization of the virus because it is less convenient in the us uk turkey and germany as well as in brazil india and many other countries federal and state governments have lifted almost every mitigation measure in order to fully resume capitalist production no matter the cost in human lives following the pseudo scientific herd immunity strategy outlined in the great barrington declaration these governments have deliberately killed millions of people in essence they are pursuing a fascistic policy of social holocaust not seen since the nazi regime in germany every politician responsible for these policies as well as those corporate interests dictating their actions and trade union officials facilitating their implementation should be the subject of criminal prosecution the uk headed by the right wing boris johnson administration most starkly expresses this global process on friday it was revealed that the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation jcvi consciously enacted a policy to open schools with no mitigation measures in order to infect masses of children falsely claiming that circulation of covid in children could periodically boost immunity in adults in 2020 the policy pursued by capitalist governments was to infect the elderly in 2021 the principal target became children with schools reopened everywhere in order to send parents back to work in 2022 the stage is now set for the virus to permeate all of society infecting and reinfecting billions worldwide under conditions where only 38 5 percent of the world population is fully vaccinated these policies threaten to kill millions more globally the criminal policies pursued by capitalist governments worldwide during the pandemic represent the implementation of longstanding aims by sections of the ruling elites who have advocated for lowering the life expectancy of the working class in order to reduce pension obligations and social spending on the elderly in 2014 ezekiel emanuel one of the leading architects of the obama administration s affordable care act called for the rationing of health care based on income while discouraging the use of medical screenings emanuel was a member of the biden administration s white house coronavirus task force until it was dissolved in january the dividing lines between the strategies towards the pandemic elaborated by the wsws on august 20 have become very clear the capitalist class in every country is either pursuing herd immunity a euphemism for killing millions or so called mitigation which amounts to palliative care or putting the world population in hospice both of these policies accept the fatalistic premise that sars cov 2 is already or will inevitably become endemic with the unstated assumption that millions will needlessly die and suffer long term health consequences year after year in irreconcilable opposition to these policies of mass death and social misery the working class is increasingly advancing a policy for the global elimination of sars cov 2 to save lives this entails the nationalization of the pharmaceutical monopolies in order to rapidly vaccinate the world population mass testing contact tracing quarantining of exposed people and the safe isolation of infected patients to identify and cut off the chain of transmission the temporary closure of schools and nonessential workplaces combined with financial and social supports for all affected workers and small business people strict travel restrictions and border management universal masking improved ventilation and all other measures necessary to minimize infections in essential workplaces all of these measures are anathema to capitalist world governments that serve the financial oligarchy given the unprecedented growth of corporate debt and financialization the shutdown of nonessential workplaces for even the minimal time necessary to bring cases down to zero estimated by dr malgorzata gasperowicz to be only six to nine weeks is unacceptable and would induce a collapse of the stock market on november 3 4 the world health network is hosting its second global summit to end pandemics the event will feature a series of sessions led by scientists covering various aspects of the pandemic some will advocate mitigations while some will advocate for global elimination as outlined in a statement published by the group in the lancet last week the fundamental fallacy of the group s statement which will surely inform many of the presentations is that the policies necessary to eliminate sars cov 2 worldwide can be implemented by pressuring capitalist politicians and corporations to change their ways while advocating for solidarity and collective action at the individual local national and international levels the group s statement fails to delineate the fundamental class division in society between the working class and the capitalist class the idea that the pandemic can be halted without a direct assault on the financial interests of the ruling class without the expropriation of the vast wealth hoarded by this tiny minority is delusional one of the essential points made at the wsws october 24 webinar was that scientists cannot fight the pandemic alone without the support of the working class the activity of scientists will be confined to the halls of academia and their journals with limited circulation the reality is that the strategy of global elimination will be implemented only through the mass mobilization of the industrial strength of the working class of all genders races ethnicities and nationalities in his introduction to the october 24 webinar david north stressed the five following points the target of sars cov 2 the virus that causes covid 19 is not individuals but entire societies the virus mode of transmission is directed toward achieving mass infection sars cov 2 has evolved biologically to strike billions and in so doing kill millions therefore the only effective strategy is one based on a globally coordinated campaign aimed at the elimination of the virus on every continent in every region and in every country there is no effective national solution to this pandemic humanity people of all races ethnicities and nationalities must confront and overcome this challenge through a vast collective and truly selfless global effort the policies pursued by virtually all governments since the outbreak of the pandemic must be repudiated the subordination of that which should be the unquestioned priority of social policy the protection of human life to the interests of corporate profit and private wealth accumulation cannot be allowed to continue the initiative to bring about a decisive turn to a strategy directed toward global elimination must come from a socially conscious movement of millions of people this global movement must draw upon scientific research the persecution of scientists many of whom labor under threats to their livelihoods and even their lives must be ended the global elimination of the virus requires the closest working alliance between the working class the great mass of society and the scientific community these must become the guiding principles for the development of a mass movement rooted in the working class to stop the pandemic the scientists and workers who took part in the october 24 webinar presented an overwhelming case for the global elimination of covid 19 and their reports have an immense and lasting value the scientific truths elaborated at this event must be assimilated by broad sections of the working class the youth and the most progressive sections of the middle class all those who have committed the crime of social holocaust must be exposed in order to educate the working class on the social interests that have driven pandemic policies worldwide fundamentally the fight to stop the pandemic must be taken into the schools and workplaces of every country through a globally coordinated campaign uniting masses of workers worldwide the international workers alliance of rank and file committees was founded for this purpose and will serve as the central nexus to coordinate the global struggles of the working class to end the pandemic and save millions of lives the development of a coordinated network of working class organizations throughout the world must be connected to the building of a socialist political leadership in the working class the international committee of the fourth international to connect the fight against the pandemic with the fight against exploitation inequality war dictatorship and the capitalist system

an astonishing 82 decrease in the cost of solar photovoltaic pv energy since 2010 has given the world a fighting chance to build a zero emissions energy system which might be less costly than the fossil fuelled system it replaces the international energy agency projects that pv solar generating capacity must grow ten fold by 2040 if we are to meet the dual tasks of alleviating global poverty and constraining warming to well below 2 c critical challenges remain solar is intermittent since sunshine varies during the day and across seasons so energy must be stored for when the sun doesn t shine policy must also be designed to ensure solar energy reaches the furthest corners of the world and places where it is most needed and there will be inevitable trade offs between solar energy and other uses for the same land including conservation and biodiversity agriculture and food systems and community and indigenous uses colleagues and i have now published in the journal nature the first global inventory of large solar energy generating facilities large in this case refers to facilities that generate at least 10 kilowatts when the sun is at its peak a typical small residential rooftop installation has a capacity of around 5 kilowatts we built a machine learning system to detect these facilities in satellite imagery and then deployed the system on over 550 terabytes of imagery using several human lifetimes of computing a map of all the large solar facilities detected up to 2018 lighter colours more recent kruitwagen et al nature we searched almost half of earth s land surface area filtering out remote areas far from human populations in total we detected 68 661 solar facilities using the area of these facilities and controlling for the uncertainty in our machine learning system we obtain a global estimate of 423 gigawatts of installed generating capacity at the end of 2018 this is very close to the international renewable energy agency s irena estimate of 420 gw for the same period tracking the growth of solar energy our study shows solar pv generating capacity grew by a remarkable 81 between 2016 and 2018 the period for which we had timestamped imagery growth was led particularly by increases in india 184 turkey 143 china 120 and japan 119 facilities ranged in size from sprawling gigawatt scale desert installations in chile south africa india and north west china through to commercial and industrial rooftop installations in california and germany rural patchwork installations in north carolina and england and urban patchwork installations in south korea and japan solar mixed with rice fields on reclaimed land in south korea stock for you shutterstock the advantages of facility level data country level aggregates of our dataset are very close to irena s country level statistics which are collected from questionnaires country officials and industry associations compared to other facility level datasets we address some critical coverage gaps particularly in developing countries where the diffusion of solar pv is critical for expanding electricity access while reducing greenhouse gas emissions in developed and developing countries alike our data provides a common benchmark unbiased by reporting from companies or governments geospatially localised data is of critical importance to the energy transition grid operators and electricity market participants need to know precisely where solar facilities are in order to know accurately the amount of energy they are generating or will generate emerging in situ or remote systems are able to use location data to predict increased or decreased generation caused by for example passing clouds or changes in the weather this increased predictability allows solar to reach higher proportions of the energy mix as solar becomes more predictable grid operators will need to keep fewer fossil fuel power plants in reserve and fewer penalties for over or under generation will mean more marginal projects will be unlocked using the back catalogue of satellite imagery we were able to estimate installation dates for 30 of the facilities data like this allows us to study the precise conditions which are leading to the diffusion of solar energy and will help governments better design subsidies to encourage faster growth the authors compared the locations of the solar facilities to data on land use to find out what was there before cropland light brown was easily the most common kruitwagen et al nature knowing where a facility is also allows us to study the unintended consequences of the growth of solar energy generation in our study we found that solar power plants are most often in agricultural areas followed by grasslands and deserts this highlights the need to carefully consider the impact that a ten fold expansion of solar pv generating capacity will have in the coming decades on food systems biodiversity and lands used by vulnerable populations policymakers can provide incentives to instead install solar generation on rooftops which cause less land use competition or other renewable energy options the github code and data repositories from this research have been made available to facilitate more research of this type and to kickstart the creation of a complete open and current dataset of the planet s solar energy facilities

as a youth he attended his aunt s day school at oakland and like many other aristocratic southerners read the works of sir walter scott and alfred lord tennyson beginning in september 1869 page enrolled at washington college now washington and lee university where robert e lee was then president but he left in 1872 without graduating by that time he had decided to become a lawyer like his father lacking funds to pay for law school however he went to louisville kentucky to tutor his cousins children until he could earn enough money to enroll in the university of virginia although he struggled as a student he completed his work was graduated and passed the bar in november 1874 he practiced law in hanover until 1876 when he moved to richmond to set up a practice with his cousin he retired and moved to washington d c in 1893 the new world that page found himself having to negotiate was one that demanded different strategies altogether in order to deal with dramatically different values and social dynamics the old virginia ruled by the aristocracy had in his view behaved according to rules of chivalry and codes of honor that upheld a rigid class system this system strictly divided the worlds of aristocratic whites and poor whites while placing aristocrats in a paternalistic relationship with enslaved african americans after the war those relationships were squelched in virginia and throughout the south by an overwhelming shift toward capitalism and new social policies throughout the rest of his life page would obsess about the sharp division between the hard capitalism of the new south virginia and the aristocratic perspective of pleasant pseudo feudalism of the old south virginia in fact this contrast would form one of the strongest threads in his writing by the time thomas page reached his mid teens the civil war had already been fought and lost life before the war had been quiet and peaceful and the upheaval that followed shattered page s world and traumatized him in ways that would later be integral to his writing the soldiers of the confederacy would remain fixed as heroes of gargantuan stature to page who would always see them through the eyes of an adoring child likewise antebellum virginia would remain the uncomplicated place of a happy childhood a world destroyed not only by war but also by the devastating financial hardships of the reconstruction period that followed it thomas nelson page was born on april 23 1853 at oakland plantation in hanover county in central virginia he was the son of john page and elizabeth burwell nelson page and so descended from two of the first prominent families page and nelson in the state s history although these families differed in some ways the pages were planters from gloucester county while the nelsons were importers and ship owners in yorktown they were similar in that they both arrived in the virginia colony from england in the mid 1600s and quickly amassed wealth only to see it decline by the beginning of the early 1800s by the time page was born the families were well established aristocrats but were not extravagantly wealthy page s father had worked to earn enough money to graduate from the university of virginia and to set himself up as a respected lawyer in hanover county but despite the elder page s position and the fact that he owned land and about sixty slaves the family was one of modest means throughout thomas s youth writing career page began writing while at the university of virginia where he joined the jefferson literary society and contributed to the virginia university magazine when he moved to richmond he occasionally wrote pieces for newspapers and was even commissioned by the richmond enquirer to report on an address given by ralph waldo emerson in charlottesville page s first work as a creative writer to be published in a national magazine was uncle gabe s white folks which appeared in scribner s monthly in april 1877 the piece was a dialect poem very similar to the poetry then being published by irwin russell 1853 1979 another white southern lawyer from port gibson mississippi in which an african american speaks in vernacular and praises plantation life russell had himself borrowed from the dialect styles of such writers as john pendleton kennedy and william gilmore simms but where these writers had presented black people as background to the planter class russell actually had his african american characters speaking at center stage unfortunately their dialogue mouthed white misconceptions of black speech from a perspective that had been established by other writers and was evident in the popular minstrel shows of the day in which white actors portrayed black singers and dancers page s uncle gabe poem demonstrated a mastery of the precedent set by irwin russell but page quickly surpassed russell s work in that it went beyond entertaining poetry to become highly compelling fiction as such it managed to influence both national policy toward sectional reconciliation and national attitudes toward race relations about the time that uncle gabe s white folks was published page began working on a story that would stamp his name indelibly on virginia and southern literary history in 1880 a friend showed him a letter found in the pocket of a dead confederate soldier that the man s sweetheart had written to him in the letter she confessed her love for him but warned that if he came home to claim her without a furlough she would not marry him haunted by this powerful combination of love and honor as well as by his nostalgia for the prewar order page started to fashion a story in his mind at first he told it to his friends gauging their reactions then he wrote it down and read it to neighbors lecture audiences sunday school classes and so on keeping the parts that resonated with his audience and jettisoning those that did not it was a composition method that he would utilize for all of his early stories and one that would shape the finished products into finely tuned oral productions designed to be read aloud the story that grew out of this gestation method was marse chan which was published in the april 1884 issue of the popular century magazine the importance of this story in page s career and in the history of virginia and southern letters cannot be overestimated a frame narrative it features a formerly enslaved narrator named sam who in dialect recounts for a white listener a romantic story of master channing marse chan whose sweetheart anne spurns him out of obedience to her father who disapproves of their match because he differs politically with channing s father when channing leaves to fight in the civil war anne realizes that she still loves him and wants to marry him but her decision comes too late because he has already died in battle sam channing s personal servant brings the dead soldier home anne dies of a broken heart and the two are buried together aside from the sentimental romantic plot which appealed to readers of the day the story is important because it presents page s nostalgic view of antebellum virginia page made this view especially potent by making the narrator a black servant rather than a white aristocrat in placing his glorification of the old south in the mouth of a former slave he infused that vision with an authenticity that was all but incontrovertible to the majority of his readers many of whom were northern whites who also longed to return to an idealized antebellum era free from the stresses of capitalism if plantation society s victims themselves longed for the old days went page s logic then that time must have been great indeed marse chan remains page s most anthologized story page republished marse chan along with six other stories that developed this same nostalgic vision in his book in ole virginia or marse chan and other stories 1887 the book was seminal in the southern local color movement strongly influencing such writers as grace king joel chandler harris george washington cable and mary noailles murfree it remains a classic of plantation fiction or the so called moonlight and magnolia school of southern writing that would find ultimate incarnation in margaret mitchell s gone with the wind the other stories in page s 1887 compilation offer glimpses into the mentality of the late nineteenth century virginia aristocracy which sought to confirm its cavalier heritage even as it struggled to negotiate a world that ostensibly provided no room for the existence of that heritage page s second most important fictional work red rock a chronicle of reconstruction 1898 follows a number of storylines as it details white aristocratic loss and reacquisition of power during reconstruction one of its primary strains follows the lives of the aristocratic gray and cary families while another relates the marriage of southerner steve allen to northerner ruth welch this story is a modified version of reconciliation romance a popular late nineteenth century literary device in which northern and southern whites marry and their romantic union represents a reunion of the formerly warring factions a long novel with a complicated plot red rock nevertheless provides engaging and interesting reading and offers a vivid picture of virginia through the eyes of the aristocracy during reconstruction it has also garnered a great deal of critical attention in recent years as a text that opposes the united states turn of the century imperialism in addition to fiction and poetry page contributed a number of books in various genres including drama children s literature social and political history literary criticism and biography while his topics ranged from the writings of dante to conditions in italy during world war i u s president woodrow wilson appointed him ambassador to italy from 1913 1919 virginia and the south remained page s primary focus throughout his writing career his most important titles on these themes include two little confederates a children s book published in 1888 offering a fictionalized account of page s youth and three books of social and political history the old south essays social and political 1892 social life in virginia before the war 1897 and the old dominion her making and her manners 1908 also among page s key works are robert e lee man and soldier a biography published in 1909 and revised in 1911 on newfound river 1891 a short sentimental novel set in virginia the old gentleman of the black stock 1897 a short novel dealing with life in richmond and gordon keith 1903 a full length novel about a young virginia aristocrat who resorts to capitalism in order to regain his family s plantation at the turn of the nineteenth century

japan pm fumio kishida twitter tokyo prime minister fumio kishida s alliance claimed a comfortable majority during the october 31 parliamentary election in japan despite registering a loss on some seats as his weeks old government struggles with a pandemic grappled economy and challenges relating to regional security kishida s liberal democratic party and its alliance partner komeito together bagged 293 seats recording a comfortable majority surpassing the magic number of 233 in the 465 member strong lower house the more powerful of the nation s two chamber diet where they previously enjoyed 305 seats prime minister fumio kishida says japan should revitalise its economy through new capitalism many in this avidly capitalist country are puzzled over exactly what he has in mind kishida has said he believes a more equal distribution of wealth is needed to prevent the world s third largest economy from sinking into stagnation that sounds dramatic but analysts say he doesn t stand for drastic change the conservative pro u s and pro business liberal democrtic party which has ruled japan almost continuously since world war ii won a better than expected 261 seats sunday in the lower house of parliament comfortably exceeding the 233 seats needed and giving kishida a mandate at least for now with this definite support from the people i will dedicate myself to working on policies and parliamentary efforts said kishida chosen as head of the governing party just a month earlier the liberal democrats prevailed over weaker opposition parties despite widespread unhappiness until a recent drop in cases with the government s handling of the coronavirus pandemic perennial corruption scandals and a failure to deliver on promises for sweeping reforms intended to drive much faster growth kishida appears unlikely to stray far from the pro market policies of the past decade under former prime minister shinzo abe who stayed in office from late 2012 mid 2020 the economy limped along with massive help from the central bank s ultra cheap credit and government spending abe s successor yoshihide suga stuck with that abenomics program now japanese are waiting to see what kishidanomics will bring kishidanomics remains a complete mystery to me said kinuko kuwabara a free lancer in shizuoka prefecture central japan what people really want tackled are coronavirus pandemic measures and corruption in high places she said maybe kishida himself isn t sure what he plans to do said hideo kumano executive chief economist at dai ichi life research institute all we have are slogans it s unclear how much you can really believe them and how they can be realized topping kishida s to do list is another big dose of government spending to help japan recover from the covid 19 shock the economy grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 9 in the april june quarter a tepid pace considering the severity of the pandemic downturn in 2020 when taking office kishida said he believed raising the tax on capital gains would help to rebalance an economy that is growing increasingly unequal although the disparity of wealth is greater statistically in the u s than in japan americans have access to more generous social welfare programs according to oecd data that means poverty is a growing problem in japan especially among single mothers struggling to make a living wage kishida backtracked from talk of raising taxes after a few days of stock market sell offs saying a higher capital gains tax which would help redress japan s highly regressive tax regime would have to wait until the economy was growing at a much stronger pace he now says he hopes to drive growth by slashing corporate taxes which abe also did in the classic trickle down strategy of encouraging companies to raise wages that approach has fallen flat however as companies hoarded their earnings instead a growing share of workers are employed part time or on contracts that don t provide full benefits the tax system meanwhile penalizes families with two full time incomes in the era of rapid growth that followed world war ii workers were promised jobs for life with lifetime employment a vanishing dream people need to freely job hop and find new opportunities and skills economists say that apart from boosting wages to encourage consumer spending what japan really needs for sustainable growth is deregulation and a freer labor market that s daunting and politically risky because such changes require reforms that would shake up vested interests angering the constituencies such as farmers and big businesses that have helped keep the liberal democrats in power for so long the current system protects and rewards old guard under performing companies while failing to drive innovation none of this was headline news in the run up to sunday s election when opposition parties campaigned on promises of cash handouts and lowering taxes the liberal democrats meanwhile promised more spending in coronavirus research carbon neutrality hydrogen energy and efforts to restart nuclear plants not better social safety nets and redistributing wealth we don t know for sure what he plans to do but we know his approach will not be that different from abenomics said hideaki tanaka a professor of public policy at meiji university in tokyo what we have is a to do list without a real analysis of why japan isn t growing and lacks innovation and a real diagnosis of what s behind this sickness there can be no cure he said
