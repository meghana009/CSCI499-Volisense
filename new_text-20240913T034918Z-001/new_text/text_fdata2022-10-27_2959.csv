yacob reyes politifact rubio s ad claims demings voted with pelosi to raise taxes over 4 000 on florida families rubio s campaign said the ad is referencing the inflation reduction act signed by president biden experts say the law did not impose a significant tax hike on ordinary floridians republican u s sen marco rubio accused his democratic challenger u s rep val demings of caring more about siding with house speaker nancy pelosi d calif than with the interests of florida residents a campaign ad running a few weeks before the nov 8 election said demings voted with pelosi to raise taxes over 4 000 on florida families although it s unclear what legislation rubio s ad is referring to his campaign said the ad is referencing the inflation reduction act a sweeping law on health care climate change and taxes the legislation passed along party lines before president joe biden signed it into law in august but did the inflation reduction act impose a significant tax hike on ordinary floridians as rubio s ad suggested experts say it didn t the law levied tax hikes on large corporations and high earners the basis of rubio s claim concerns the indirect impact of the law s effect on florida taxpayers but the ad doesn t mention subsidies included in the law that could mitigate the trickle down effect of raising corporate taxes five takeaways from the u s senate debate between sen marco rubio rep val demings more politifact the only florida senate debate between val demings and marco rubio fact checked florida governor candidates debate fact checking attacks from ron desantis and charlie crist in florida s only gubernatorial debate most analyses of the inflation reduction act show a modest impact on taxpayers rubio s campaign cited an article from the heritage foundation a conservative think tank based in washington d c that is critical of the inflation reduction act the inflation reduction act is intended to raise taxes by roughly 570 billion over the next decade 4 500 per household the heritage foundation wrote the article did not detail how it arrived at that number preston brashers a heritage foundation senior policy analyst said the 4 500 figure is based on the sum of revenue brought in by the law s tax increases for corporations stock owners and an increased budget for the irs among a few other taxes divided by the number of u s households the heritage foundation estimated the law s tax provisions will result in 570 billion in new tax collections over the next decade 570 billion divided by 128 million u s households equals around 4 500 per household this guesswork is powered by several assumptions because the tax hikes are applied to corporations and stock owners it s unknown how average taxpayers will be affected company ownership and stock ownership are not divided evenly among households said john buhl senior communications manager with the independent urban brookings tax policy center in washington d c even if you think a fairly large share of corporate taxes falls on workers and consumers you wouldn t come up with numbers as large as what heritage is claiming the inflation reduction act s impact on average taxpayers will come from secondary effects stemming from the increase in corporate taxes which could include lower wages for workers such effects are difficult to measure it s also worth noting that the heritage model did not account for the law s spending provisions that could cancel those tax increases the inflation reduction act includes subsidies for energy efficiency and clean energy extends subsidies for insurance under the affordable care act and eventually allows medicare to negotiate lower drug prices congress joint committee on taxation the penn wharton budget model and the tax foundation created model estimates of the inflation reduction act none predicted significant financial hits for consumers outside of higher income households the joint committee on taxation found that the average u s household would see its after tax income fall by 1 4 and the decline would be less than 1 for people earning 30 000 to 100 000 this estimate did not factor in offsetting subsidies an analysis by the committee for a responsible federal budget a washington d c nonprofit that favors deficit reduction said the 64 billion in health insurance subsidies is more than enough to offset the after tax income fall predicted by the joint commission on taxation our ruling rubio said demings voted with pelosi to raise taxes over 4 000 on florida families rubio was referring to the inflation reduction act which passed with pelosi and demings support but the law does not include a blanket tax increase for florida taxpayers the law applied tax increases directly on very large corporations and high earners it s unclear whether and how corporations would pass those costs to consumers and the individual effect of such increases will vary the source of rubio s figure uses questionable methodology modeled over 10 years to measure the secondary effects passed down to u s households other analyses estimated the effects would be smaller and potentially offset by subsidies included in the law we

a quiet satisfaction can be detected in the high liberal centre of british politics with the implosion of liz truss s experiment in debt financed libertarianism britain can at last have the grown up government it has for so long missed once the newly crowned rishi sunak and his chancellor designate jeremy hunt are safely installed in downing street febrile ideology will be replaced by sober competence when the conservatives go to the polls in january 2025 if not before they will be succeeded by a labour party that promises prudence and stability the recurring nightmare in which the centre cannot hold which has haunted liberals since the brexit referendum in 2016 will be finally exorcised against the backdrop of the chaos of past weeks and months this is for many a reassuring vision it is also wishful thinking it is more than doubtful that conservatives can survive in office for another two years ungovernable themselves they have ceased to be a viable party of government and yearn for release from the burden of power dread of sudden extinction at the polls impels them to hang on in westminster but the contortions of the leadership election were gruesome twitches in a moribund body the historic role of the conservatives in british politics is almost certainly over for generations it dominated by accommodating a broad spectrum of ideas in changing coalitions that reflected the country it ruled today it is a theatre of rancorous warfare and spent ideologies but labour too will struggle to survive a full term in office the fiscal orthodoxy to which it is committed will be deeply unsettling for voters and destabilising for the party itself spending cuts and freezes will mean lower real incomes for millions of public sector workers and strikes will continue and spread while the semblance of unity starmer has imposed on the party will begin to crack as the tories have demonstrated a huge majority does not preclude chaos in government confronted with multiplying crises a labour landslide could soon be followed by immobility and powerlessness the stark fact is that britain is drifting into a state of chronic emergency starting this winter living standards will fall for most of the population with putin s war of terror in ukraine escalating energy prices will remain high and infrastructure in this and other european countries may come

fragilities in britain s pension schemes that run throughout the global financial system liberal capitalism has been floating on a tide of funny money ever since long term capital management a comically named hedge fund that used financial engineering to generate profit blew up in 1998 after russia defaulted on its sovereign debt fallout from the collapse threatened a global crisis which was avoided by a bailout that set the precedent for electronic money printing otherwise known as quantitative easing after the crash of 2008 nothing was learned and the market continued to devise opaque and risky products affecting trillions of dollars of assets the rise in asset values that followed was inherently unsustainable and a larger re run of the crash is not unlikely in the near future any policy programme that depends on a steady trajectory of economic growth will be stymied before it has begun if there is a bright side to the present situation it is that the free market ideology that inspired truss s mad dash for growth will be banished from government for at least a generation contrary to those of us who believed her will to power might triumph over her avowed beliefs truss was a convinced market fundamentalist who surrounded herself with fellow true believers the result was a project that had virtually no support beyond her circle it has been said with some justice that polling a small group of ageing tories is an odd way of choosing a prime minister the ill judged 1998 rule change under which party members were given a vote was the work of william hague who has since taken on the mantle of elder statesman but not many of the constituency members who elected the former prime minister can have shared the world view she paraded at the party conference conservatism has never been a fixed ideology but what conservatism is not is clear enough and truss s libertarianism was always an unconservative creed in the eighties the conflict between market liberalism and conservatism was openly and proudly acknowledged in free market think tanks such as the institute of economics affairs where nothing was more despised than the weak kneed caution of the tory trimmer here the think tanks had the backing of their intellectual godfather in why i am not a conservative a celebrated postscript to his treatise the constitution of liberty 1960 friedrich hayek denounced conservatives for their unprincipled embrace of politics as the art of the possible and their irrational reverence for the past the overriding imperative was continuing progress the cumulative growth of knowledge and power over nature he acknowledged that this does not mean we shall like all its results or that all will be gainers many would be unhappy but that did not matter what matters is the successful striving for what at each moment seems attainable progress is movement for movement s sake if sections of humanity have to be left behind in the unending march so be it during most of thatcher s time in power libertarian ideology was curbed by her attachment to the british tradition of parliamentary government and her instinctive political nous the right wing think tanks shaped policy directly only with the adoption of the poll tax introduced in scotland in 1989 and in england and wales the following year and it was then that thatcher was forced out truss s abortive free market experiment was a stilted plagiarism of thatcherism without any of thatcher s ambiguities or hayek s sense of the emptiness of material progress truss s debacle is severely damaging for the libertarian right but the centrists who rejoice in her downfall have not renounced the cult of the market their unspoken dream is a technocratic government of experts through which liberal capitalism can be insulated from democratic politics the model for this kind of governance is italy with sunak a british version of the former banker mario draghi who resigned in july this year after the collapse of his unity government after serving as unelected prime minister for 20 months the post fascist giorgia meloni won the ensuing election it is unlikely that sunak will last as long if pensions and welfare benefits are not uprated in line with inflation millions of households will be pushed into poverty when the energy cap expires in april of next year many of them will be at risk of destitution hunt the new chancellor has talked vaguely of targeting aid to the worst off but it is hard to conceive how the tories could be re elected in such conditions the new tory centrism is being welcomed as a return to reality but how realistic is rule by the bond market when it means ruin and despair for so much of the population a starmer government is a likely outcome whatever sunak and hunt may do but there is no sign of the radical programme labour needs to prevail in challenging circumstances aside from criticisms of tory misrule the party has little to offer an osbornist regime of austerity veneered over by fashionable chatter about a green new deal will do nothing to rebuild the red wall starmer would be well advised to ponder the gmb general secretary gary smith s september interview with the new statesman s rachel wearmouth smith s warning against shutting down nuclear power stations and promising displaced workers jobs in renewable energy that don t exist is particularly compelling working class people are as concerned with climate change as anyone else but they will not support programmes in which they suffer the most as a result of what the gmb leader aptly describes as bourgeois environmentalism the revolt of the french gilets jaunes from 2018 and donald trump s mobilisation of the us s abandoned deplorables are a warning to labour but one this now ineffably bourgeois party is unlikely to heed the green new deal is like truss s dash for growth an illusion as the global economy deteriorates and fragments the real task will be averting mass impoverishment and a breakdown in social order public utilities and much of the energy industry will have to be nationalised ruinously costly anachronisms including the hs2 railway line must be scrapped renovating the state and using its resources to develop technologies such as hydrogen and small modular nuclear reactors will be urgent priorities instead research and development will likely be among the first areas of spending to be cut under a new regime of austerity national defence and justice will be defunded at a time of mounting danger the nhs will be left unreformed and starved of resources britain will continue its decline into pauperdom and disorder whichever of them is in government none of the main parties can steer the country through the privations that lie ahead in these circumstances proportional representation is not the distraction it has been in the past but an unavoidable necessity the centrist consensus is an obstacle to understanding the present and shaping any humanly tolerable future britain needs a conservative party that prizes social cohesion over economic expansion a non corbynite party of the left that rejects liberal capitalism and a green party that breaks with the bankrupt agenda of bourgeois environmentalism the reborn sdp and blue labour deserve a much wider hearing we may even need a libertarian party though it will surely be small and marginal there are risks in moving to proportional representation in continental europe and israel it has enfranchised extremist minorities but the belief that market forces cannot be allowed to wreck society is not an extreme or minority position if the british majority have a common view of things this is it one of the benefits of electoral reform would be to put the conservatives out of their misery boris johnson s apparent attempt to resume his role as political clown in chief petered out because his record of lies and his divisive personality were recognised to be potentially fatal for the party but a death wish animates the conservatives today and it will not go away once johnson has slunk back to the lucrative american lecture circuit he will remain a shapeshifting trickster offering new life to a party that yearns to die but lacks the capacity for agency that is required for suicide proportional representation will give the tories what they secretly desire a peaceful euthanasia the conservatives know they have no solution for britain s worsening crises labour has yet to realise it has no answers either but it will quickly find out once it is in power rather than being the prelude to an era of centrist government truss s downfall will be remembered as the beginning of the end related

casey good afternoon and thanks for listening to our quarterly earnings call last quarter i shared with you the impressive results posted by our investment teams as well as the exciting news of our agreement to acquire salient partners highly complementary asset management business as many of you know we ve just celebrated an important milestone our 20th anniversary as a publicly traded company as we reflect on our journey we ve delivered many notable accomplishments over these past 20 years through good times as well as in tougher years like this one as we finalize the transaction and integrate the salient team and its attractive lineup of products we are enthusiastic about our position as a firm and can t wait to build our expanded business together in the years ahead there were several notable items to highlight this quarter our acquisition of salient partners asset management business is on track to close this year and is expected to be highly accretive to westwood s earnings several us value strategies outperform their benchmarks and our multi asset strategies continue to post strong relative returns during the third quarter global equity markets extended their losses as many of the same risks of the previous quarter remained or even accelerated continued above trend inflation and central bank responses to deal with this threat have elevated the probability of recession adding to the risk off sentiment that dampened demand for both equities and debt securities geopolitical uncertainties and the upcoming u s midterms aren t helping much either against this difficult backdrop i m pleased to report that nearly all our u s value strategies outperform this quarter in largecap our team beat the russell 1000 value index by 175 basis points for the quarter and has now outperformed its benchmark year today and overall trailing time periods of 135 and 10 years and since inception among its peers in the morningstar large value universe whglx ranked in the 11th percentile for the quarter and is well positioned in the top third for trailing one five and 10 years among its institutional peers in the evestment s largecap value universe largecap ranked in the 15th percentile for the quarter and scored the 31st percentile for the trailing one year ended september 30th its longer term rankings for the trailing five and 10 years were almost identical with comfortable top third postings our midcaps midcap and allcap strategies beat their benchmarks this quarter outperforming the russell midcap value index by 222 basis points the russell 2500 value by 128 basis points and the russell 3000 value by 101 basis points respectively our smidcap strategy ranked in the 24th percentile among its investment institutional peers in the small to midcap value universe our quality allcap mutual fund wqaix ranked in morningstar s 22nd percentile for the quarter and rank 36th percentile and evestment s allcap value universe to round things off for the quarter or midcap strategy is sitting pretty in the 10th percentile among investment midcap value peers and our mutual fund wwmcx scored ninth percentile among morningstar s midcap value peers our smallcap strategy underperformed the russell 2000 value index this quarter as the good performing high quality securities we seek experienced a reversion to the mean after previously outperforming and multi asset it was yet another difficult quarter for global stocks and bonds but i m pleased to say that our free strategies total return income opportunity and high income all turned in good outperformance as equity markets extended their losses and government bond yields trended higher across all durations the fixed income holdings selected by our multi asset teams contributed to outperformance in the strategies and put it simply our strategies benefited from reduced equity weights relative to their blended benchmarks the use of convertible securities and their decision to underweight u s treasuries and overweight corporates and selected high yield securities our largest multi asset strategy income opportunity finished 103 basis points ahead of its benchmark consisting of 40 s p 500 and 60 bloomberg barclays aggregate bond index our total return strategy came in 204 basis points ahead of its benchmark 60 s p 500 and 40 bloomberg barclays aggregate bond index our total return mutual fund wlvix was in the 16th percentile and morningstar s 50 to 70 equity universe and did even better posting an eighth percentile ranking among evestment s global tactical asset allocation universe high income was 198 basis points ahead of its blended benchmark 20 s p 500 and 80 bloomberg barclays aggregate bond index and achieved a 17th percentile ranking among institutional peers in the u s tactical asset allocation universe our alternative income mutual fund ticker wmnix rose 72 basis points on an absolute basis for the quarter this alternative strategy has a meaningful allocation that convertible securities but despite the headwinds of a lower equity market our alternative income mutual funds finished in the 21st percentile for the quarter and 90th percentile both for year to date and trailing one year periods and morningstar s relative value arbitrage category credit opportunities which we launched in 2020 trailed the ice bofa high yield index by 26 basis points for the quarter although our portfolio was conservatively positioned relative to the index it modestly underperformed due to a sell off in certain distressed investments given the outlook for rising interest rates we are limiting exposure to long duration investments keeping overall portfolio duration shorter than the benchmark and focusing on opportunities with identifiable catalysts like previous cycles we ll deploy capital into attractive risk adjusted investments while managing downside risk the opportunity set for credit opportunities has vastly expanded recently and we re excited about the future lastly in our systematic strategies largecap growth let its benchmark the russell 1000 growth index by 197 basis points and landed in the 11th percentile and evestment largecap growth universe our smallcap growth strategy struggled somewhat as its holdings were out of sync with market factor movements but recent rebalances have gotten the strategy back on track and better performance is emerging our systematic smallcap growth strategy remains ahead of the russell 2000 growth benchmark year to date it s 18th percentile among smallcap growth institutional peers and the fund wscix is 22nd percentile among morningstar s smallcap growth peers on a year to date basis we expect continued near term volatility for equities and fixed income as the feds aggressive stance to combat inflation cools the economy and this will likely be exacerbated as an increasing number of market participants adjust their forecast in response while it s quite clear that the tightening actions of central banks across the globe present the biggest known risks to the markets the geopolitical risks of the ongoing war in ukraine and the volatility in the world s energy markets add even more uncertainty to the economic environment we firmly believe that our current environment lends itself well to our investing philosophy our u s value strategies constantly focus on quality and value as they seek high quality businesses trading at an attractive price by investing across a diversified allocation of asset classes and risk exposures our multi asset strategies efficient alpha generation and the most attractive markets allocating risk between idiosyncratic and systematic risks our approach aims to generate attractive total returns with lower volatility a key factor given market uncertainty our wealth management strategies delivered mixed performances quarter as dividend select and high alpha outperform the russell 1000 value and russell 1000 growth indices by 26 basis points and 303 basis points respectively dividend select which focuses on high quality dividend paying domestic securities is ahead 357 basis points year to date and 108 basis points over the trailing period with a dividend yield of 3 2 versus the s p 500 dividend yield of 2 5 it s an attractive alternative for high net worth clients seeking income and long term capital appreciation high alpha rebounded after lagging its benchmark earlier and beat its index by 303 basis points this quarter a top third percentile finish in the evestment enhanced allcap equity universe shifting now to institutional and intermediary distribution market performance was the largest driver of lower aum this quarter but i m pleased to report that our institutional team saw strong client retention with low client outflows our improved performance and many products positions as well to compete for new assets this quarter s assets under management saw inflows of 159 million offset by outflows of 309 million netting to 150 million in outflows within our various strategies smallcap enjoyed positive net flows generated by our institutional team and two new consultant driven client accounts were added this quarter institutional client net flows were negative but most of them were driven by client rebalances and participant directed dc plan changes rather than client losses our pipeline of clients awaiting funding includes our first win from a major ocio outsourced cio client into our smidcap strategy using a newly launched collective investment trust specifically created to serve this channel we remain focused on serving our institutional clients while newly launched strategies such as smallcap growth and midcap along with our expanding consultant approvals underpin our key growth initiatives for the space in the intermediary channel industry wide outflows and risk assets are hitting multi year highs and outflows and the equity and fixed income asset classes are also hitting record highs against this backdrop are allcap smallcap alternative income high income and total return strategies all had positive flows overall the level of mutual fund redemptions slowed relative to the second quarter and is running at a lower rate than our peers our intermediary team continues to focus on client retention across the board and we are hopeful that interest in equity and multi asset products will increase as investors see signs of a market bottom turning now to wealth management our dallas and houston teams delivered inflows of 123 million offset by outflows of 172 million inflows are driven largely by new clients including a 48 million client win in the dallas office and additions to several existing client accounts outflows are driven by a state settlement client withdrawals in the normal course of business and some account closures workflows this year have had to overcome the market environment advisor turnover and certain institutional clients who engage new consultants overall our team is on track to meet its goal and gross new assets for the year business development has ramped up nicely and currently we have opportunities in the pipeline totaling over 200 million we continue to attract corporate professionals and entrepreneurs including many clients who are leaving large banks for a more customized and holistic financial solution a recent jd power associates survey indicated that the defection rate for large regional and mid sized banks averaged between 10 and 11 of customers as new fees and poor customer service have sparked in exodus a 2022 survey conducted by wealth x database the world s largest collection of intelligence on the world s wealthiest people demonstrates that the very high net worth population those having between 5 million and 30 million continues to grow here in the u s up 7 1 since 2019 in terms of individuals nearly 85 of them are self made as in non inherited wealth and they present a perfect fit for our wealth team the complexity of asset choices and family and business relationships continues to rise and a successful wealth group needs to offer a diverse set of skills and resources able to service complex clients nearly half of our advisors are attorneys 15 are cfps and 23 are cfas which allows westwood to effectively serve extremely complex client needs our tested ability to serve such clients recently received a warm endorsement from a survey in which 95 of our current clients stated they would refer this to us our two wealth offices are well positioned in two the best growth markets in texas 40 years ago the dallas fort worth metroplex had fewer than five fortune 500 headquarters and today it s home to 24 fortune 500 companies trailing only in new york and chicago dfw s economy has grown markedly faster than its largest rivals including new york los angeles and chicago and it has emerged from the covid 19 pandemic with fewer unemployment losses than any other among the nation s 12 largest metro areas houston was recently identified as one of the wealthiest and fastest growing cities in the world and it s in the top 20 cities with the most millionaires our houston office is on track for its best new sales here in its 40 year history and it s gaining share in the houston market over 60 of houston s gross new sales are projected to come from new relationships this year earlier this year we announced an agreement to acquire the asset management business of salient partners which has offices in houston and san francisco where its tactical growth strategy is managed by broadmark salient is a well known highly respected asset manager focused on energy infrastructure real estate and tactical allocation strategies as i noted previously we expect the acquisition will be highly accretive for westwood our team has been working closely with our salient counterparts on integration planning and it s clear to us that they are a great cultural fit salient s products are very complementary to our own product lineup and they re also highly scalable which will enable us to leverage the capabilities of our combined distribution teams we have started the proxy solicitation process to move salient s five mutual funds to our ultimus platform and we expect the transaction to close before year end deal related costs recorded this quarter were approximately 575 000 putting it all together as the year comes towards an end and looking at over the next few months while markets have faltered and asset flows have slowed we re pleased with our investment teams performance improvements and our wealth group is growing in a promising an environment we re busy working on closing and integrating the salient acquisition and we re all looking forward to working together we liked the opportunities presented by our current strategies we re ready for salient s exciting new products and we can t wait to begin the future now i ll now turn the call over to terry forbes our cfo terry forbes thanks brian and good afternoon everyone today we reported total revenues of 15 4 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to 15 6 million in the second quarter and 17 9 million in the prior year s third quarter revenues were lower than the second quarter and last year s third quarter reflecting lower average assets under management mainly attributable to the downdraft affecting markets worldwide the third quarter net loss of 1 2 million or 0 15 per share compared unfavorably with a net loss of 0 4 million or 0 05 per share in the second quarter due to lower revenues and higher expenses primarily employee compensation and benefits non gaap economic earnings were 0 8 million or 0 10 per share in the current quarter versus 1 6 million or 0 20 per share in the second quarter the third quarter net loss of 1 2 million or 0 15 per share compared unfavorably with last year s third quarter net income of 1 9 million or 0 24 per share primarily on lower revenues and higher expenses related to our acquisition of salient partners asset management business economic earnings for the quarter were 0 8 million or 0 10 per share compared with 3 7 million or 0 47 per share in the third quarter of 2021 firm wide assets under management totaled 11 5 billion at quarter end consisted of institutional assets of 5 5 billion or 48 of the total wealth management assets of 3 5 billion or 31 of the total and mutual fund assets of 2 4 billion or 21 of the total over the quarter we experienced market depreciation of 0 4 billion and net outflows of 225 million our financial position continues to be very solid with cash and short term investments at quarter end totaling 74 million and a debt free balance sheet i m happy to announce that our board of directors approved a regular cash dividend of 0 15 per common share payable on january 3rd 2023 to stockholders of record on december 2nd 2022 that brings our prepared comments to a close we encourage you to review our investor presentation posted on our website reflecting quarterly highlights as well as a discussion of our business product development and longer term trends and revenues and earnings we thank you for your interest in our company and we ll open the line to questions question and answer session operator thank you first question comes from the line of charles with bellsouth unidentified analyst good morning or good afternoon i was looking at the results and while there s a loss for the quarter there is an impact of income tax i was wondering why you would have to pay income tax if you if we retained loss brian casey well the income taxes is going to be based on the effective rate so it s what s expected over a year unidentified analyst okay thank you brian casey and there s also some permanent differences that you don t get to deduct for income tax purposes unidentified analyst okay thank you very much brian casey thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of macrae sykes with gamco macrae sykes good afternoon gentlemen i actually have two questions brian casey hi mac macrae sykes two separate ones i ll just ask them and you can address them first brian i just wanted to get your thoughts on the rise in fixed income rates and expected returns there what they mean for the industry in terms of those that offer multi asset solutions will it be more competitive for those kind of fixed income products and then secondly i wanted to just get an update on how salient is tracking from an aum perspective from the i guess the during the announcement in may thanks brian casey okay great well thanks mac for your question first of all this has been an unprecedented period this year in terms of having both stocks and bonds go down at the same time so we have an industry that has lots of unhappy clients because they ve always counted on bonds to really be their anchor and they ve been anything but that this year we think that rates are reaching pretty constructive levels high single digits for investment grade and just under double digits for high yield and i think that bodes really well for those that construct multi asset portfolios like we do in fact it s a part of our portfolio that we ve actually been increasing a bit here of late and it s an area that i think as as baby boomers retire and start to look at how they allocate their money it s going to be something that s definitely a much more attractive part of the mix given the yields that are available to them now and the fact that so many are on fixed income and then second as far as salient tracking on aum it s down from where we announced as all markets are down but it s not down probably as much as a lot of others it s roughly 4 billion now and we re on track we think to close the transaction here in mid november and that s contingent upon getting the proxy successful proxy votes for all the funds and the client consents for all the institutional clients but we see positive momentum on both of those fronts and look forward to closing this and working together i d also add that this place doesn t run that well at 11 billion it runs a lot better at 15 5 billion and i m pleased to report that as of this morning that our assets are just under 12 billion as of today as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we earned a couple of new smid clients from a consultant outsource cio program this month and we expect to earn more each time this consultant on boards a new client we ll get a new client and that s a terrific pipeline for us for the next year year and a half we also earned two new wealth clients this month in the 30 million to 50 million range and have other sizable relationships which could close before year end and as i said i think we re literally weeks away from getting the salient transaction across the finish line and we re on a path to immediately creative earnings and broader sales opportunities and one of the most exciting aspects to the salient integration is the complete lack of overlap between the distribution teams and we have roughly 1 500 clients together and there are less than 50 in common where they have both westwood and salient and there s only two in common where they have over 1 million with westwood and 1 million with salient and salient has a big presence in the national wires we have a really good footprint in the ria space and the regional broker dealers so we felt like we should be able to take our products to their clients and channels and they take their products to ours and it s going to be fun to watch as our expanded salesforce takes our new message to market in the institutional side money has been slow to move around institutionally but our pipeline is now in excess of 700 million and we re optimistic that we ll see some sales and so we look forward to reporting to you again next quarter hopefully with better results and appreciate your taking the time to listen to the call and if you have any further questions you can visit westwoodgroup com or call terry or i directly operator thank you i ll now hand the call back over to ceo brian casey for any closing remarks brian casey well thank you those are my closing remarks as i didn t see any further questions so again if you have if you do have questions please feel free to call terry or i directly thanks for taking the time to listen have a good day operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes today s conference call thank you for participating and you may now disconnect

drilling results at brucejack red chris and havieron expand the high grade mineralisation and support the potential for resource growth melbourne australia newsfile corp october 26 2022 newcrest managing director and chief executive officer sandeep biswas said this week a colleague and team member from our mining and development contractor procon was involved in a critical incident while working underground at our brucejack operation there is nothing more important than the safety and wellbeing of those who work with us and our focus is on providing support to all those impacted during this distressing time as we assist with the ongoing investigation while overshadowed by the upsetting news from brucejack newcrest delivered a solid performance during the september quarter which reflected our normal cadence for planned major maintenance shutdowns across our operations during this period our group gold and copper production has increased substantially from a year ago reflecting maintenance and productivity improvements at cadia and lihir and additional ounces from brucejack following this strong start to the year we expect gold and copper production to be higher in the december quarter on lower planned maintenance and remain on track to meet fy23 guidance cadia marked further significant milestones with the first draw bell for pc2 3 successfully fired to enable the commencement of undercutting and completion of the two stage plant expansion which is now in commissioning we continued to make great progress on our brucejack transformation program and remain relentlessly focused on disciplined capital management as we extend the havieron feasibility study to allow time for further project optimisation with a focus on capital management continued strong operating performance in line with our guidance and a clear pathway to materially increase our already significant copper production in the future i believe newcrest s upside potential will be recognised more broadly as we strive to unlock further value for our shareholders said mr biswas overview gold production was 17 lower than the prior period6 with lower mill throughput across all operations following planned maintenance shutdowns in the september 2022 quarter consistent with prior years gold production was also impacted by lower gold head grade at lihir cadia and brucejack gold and copper production is expected to improve in the december 2022 quarter on lower planned maintenance newcrest s aisc of 1 098 oz2 for the quarter was 23 higher than the prior period driven by lower gold and copper sales volumes with lower production following planned maintenance and a lower realised copper price this was partly offset by the benefit of a weakening australian and canadian dollar against the us dollar on operating costs with a significant proportion of operating costs exposed to the australian and canadian dollars continued weakness of these currencies against the us dollar will favourably impact aisc injury rates decreased in the quarter however the critical incident at brucejack is a reminder of the unwavering focus on safety that must be maintained to ensure everybody goes home safe and healthy every day injury rates were reviewed during the quarter with the previously reported frequency rates at red chris and brucejack restated following an internal

wyoming s had a much better fiscal year than expected after a shaky couple of years the state braced for more of the same in 2022 but unexpectedly high energy prices particularly oil and natural gas helped state revenue outperform predictions made at the start of this year the consensus revenue estimating group creg announced wednesday gov mark gordon cautioned in a written statement that this welcome news is not cause for excessive celebration or reason to relax our fiscal conservatism we must remember that there has been a lot of volatility in our mineral revenues over the past few years and that remains a concern for our future international pressures still on the horizon at the start of 2022 turned it into an exceptional year for the wyoming economy uncertainty and fuel shortages in the wake of russia s invasion of ukraine pushed up the price of oil and then natural gas commodities already in short supply because of the covid 19 pandemic and soaring and sustained demand for coal has also kept its price higher than any time in the last decade as the global economy picks up steam or decelerates energy use will go with it said patrick fleming chief investment officer for the wyoming state treasurer s office and a member of creg geopolitical risk is still elevating oil prices fleming said but fears of recession are introducing downward pressure too the creg report found that during the last fiscal year the general fund and budget reserve account the primary accounts used to pay for state programs and services collected 329 4 million more than expected an additional 109 4 million from federal mineral royalties 103 5 million from severance taxes 49 4 million from sales and use taxes and 45 8 million from investment income oil contributed 43 7 of wyoming s severance taxes during the 2022 fiscal year followed by 34 5 from natural gas 19 2 from coal and 2 6 from other minerals including trona according to creg the report identified oil as wyoming s leading revenue contributor and warned that while the trona industry is forecast to remain relatively stable production of both natural gas and coal each buoyed temporarily by their recent surge in price will likely start to decline again within the next several years as prices come back down it also warned that wyoming s state revenue streams are volatile and over the last couple of years the trend has become even more pronounced and is unlikely to abate since 2020 the report added wyoming has experienced two opposite amplitudes of the proverbial revenue pendulum external factors including but not limited to geopolitical events changes in energy markets and demand preferences weather available infrastructure and infrastructure outages world financial markets pandemics monetary policy federal regulations and federal fiscal policies continue to dramatically influence fluctuations in revenue the reason the state is so susceptible to such shifts fleming said is that wyoming has three key revenue streams investments mineral production and sales and use tax and the first two aren t stable unfortunately it s cyclical with the economy fleming said as the economy slows we get less income the good news is we built up a significant amount of reserves he added the state s rainy day fund has grown significantly which will help cushion the blow for when you have a weaker economy and lower receipts photos on the true drilling rig

flood damage at a mobile home community in vermont following tropical storm irene in 2011 photo credit courtesy of dan baker vermont business magazine the university of vermont is part of a new regional collaboration to study the climate related vulnerabilities of mobile home park communities with funding announced today from the national oceanic and atmospheric association noaa s climate adaptation partnership s program the project brings together researchers from the universities of vermont new hampshire and maine as well as all three northern new england state climatologists mobile home communities are an important part of the region s affordable housing landscape but are more likely to be impacted by risks posed by climate change such as high winds flooding and extreme temperatures previous research from the university of vermont found more than 20 of mobile home communities in the state are at least partially located in fema mapped floodplains during tropical storm irene mobile homes accounted for 15 of homes damaged during the storm though mobile made up only 7 of the state s housing stock as we saw with irene mobile home communities are at higher risk for flooding but with climate change also comes greater risks from extreme temperatures and other weather events said kelly hamshaw co principal investigator and senior lecturer in the uvm department of community development and applied economics who together with fellow uvm investigator dan baker has been working with mobile home communities for nearly a decade this collaboration will allow us to better support the resilience of these important communities which are essential to vermont s housing landscape mobile homes are more difficult to heat and cool especially older homes built prior to 1976 before certain manufacturing and safety codes were in place which account for a large portion of mobile homes across vermont new hampshire and maine rising energy costs are expected to place a greater financial burden on mobile home residents which include some of the region s most economically vulnerable populations as of 2021 there were 236 park communities in vermont according to the vermont agency of commerce and community development s annual mobile home park registry the only such registry in the region working with colleagues at umaine and unh hamshaw baker and vermont state climatologist lesley ann dupigny giroux will use the noaa grant to create a database of mobile home park communities in the three states and convene meetings with mobile home residents to determine climate change impacts in different ecoregions across the northeast the meetings will also build relationships that will support climate resilience efforts with mobile home park frontline communities one of the exciting aspects of this project is the melding of the geographic traditions of climatology and the importance of place to better grasp the very pressing challenges and vulnerabilities faced by mobile home residents said dupigny giroux professor in the uvm department of geography and geosciences the results of co producing a shared appreciation for the ways in which climate change has and will continue to affect mobile home frontline communities will better allow state agencies and community partners across northern new england to better assist frontline communities as they prepare for climate change dupigny giroux is the immediate past president of the american association of state climatologists and has served as the vermont state climatologist for over two decades state climatologists are federally credentialed through noaa to provide climate and climate change services and research to their respective states and beyond we ve learned from our earlier research in vermont that mitigating climate risk for mobile home communities requires collaboration between residents researchers community groups and government agencies it also requires sensitivity to the social and economic concerns of mobile home park residents good data and trust between partners said baker associate professor emeritus in the dept of community development and applied economics who will lead the facilitation of stakeholder and community meetings for uvm we are excited about the opportunity to share knowledge and develop strategies across to strengthen the resilience of these communities across the region learn more about the study on the umaine website many mobile home communities across vermont are located in areas particularly vulnerable to climate related extreme events such as this one situated close to an eroding stream bank photo courtesy of dan baker about the university of vermont since 1791 the university of vermont has worked to move humankind forward

million in the quarter compared with operating income of 13 2 million and adjusted ebitda2 of 26 9 million in the prior year period the year over year increases in operating income and adjusted

lower firstnet construction revenues due to the timing of completed sites operating income was 0 7 million in the quarter improving from an operating loss of 9 8 million in the same period a year ago

the increased cost of housing is a major driver of inflation it s even forcing modest change in the restrictive zoning codes that distort and restrict supply california has now moved to legalize small accessory dwelling units on housing lots statewide and minneapolis has rolled back single family zoning legal constraints on housing supply still abound however but less noticed than the exclusionary impact of 4 acre house lot requirements as in greenwich connecticut is the fact that city officials are using thousands of local zoning codes to define what a family is doing so encourages inefficient use of the housing stock we have and stands in the way of living arrangements that could help young families and older americans lower their housing costs widespread local regulations limit so called unrelated co occupants i e roommates or lodgers even though there are no limits on the number of occupants related by blood marriage or adoption the language often used by local zoning codes even when there are empty bedrooms that could accommodate more occupants such rules stand in the way of older homeowners who might like to rent rooms to unrelated helpers or younger families who would like to share quarters to more easily make their mortgage payments for a new american enterprise institute research paper i reviewed zoning regulations in 30 major cities and nearby suburbs and found that notwithstanding changing social norms zoning restrictions on the composition of households remain common zoning codes in 23 of the 30 largest u s cities or nearby suburbs impose limits on occupants deemed unrelated in village of belle terre v boraas 1974 the supreme court allowed localities to impose the related by blood regulations the ruling upheld a new york village ordinance that restricted land use to mean one or more persons related by blood adoption or marriage or not more than two unrelated persons even traditionally tolerant cities have kept such restrictions in new york city for instance as explained by the popular rental listing service streeteasy real property law stipulates that when two people sign a lease there should be no more than four occupants living in the apartment at one time even stricter laws are not uncommon in the city of baltimore no more than two unrelated persons may live together unless in an approved rooming house in las vegas the limit is four the same zoning limit applies in grand rapids michigan no more than three unrelated persons may share a household in st louis the same is true in nashville where housing affordability is a crisis just because the supreme court found such laws to be constitutional does not of course mean that localities must adopt them change is not widespread but it is definitely afoot including laws which distinguish between crowding which may be a health and safety concern and the relationships among residents legislation in oregon passed last year prohibited municipalities from regulating occupancy based on familial relations pam marsh a democratic state legislator from ashland oregon said in support of the bill we know that unrelated people live together for lots of important reasons and there is simply no reason for cities to be regulating that property owners would not be barred from restricting occupancy based on potential crowding this has long been the legal rule in california in the wake of a 1980 state supreme court decision which struck down a santa barbara local law that defined family as two or more persons related by blood marriage or legal adoption living together as a single housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit change is not limited to blue states in 2020 the columbus ohio suburb of bexley revised its zoning code to recognize persons living together as a functional family who share the entire dwelling unit and live and cook together as a single housekeeping unit one can view this as cultural change or simply a means to make better use of our existing housing stock this is no call for change dictated by courts or washington though gradual change at the local level is the best way to proceed some communities will prefer to continue to use their zoning law to endorse the traditional nuclear family with two parents and children in the american federalist tradition that should be their choice still it s worth reexamining local laws that promote those preferences at the expense of the fuller and varied use of homes we ve become accustomed to the idea that housing market pressures can only be relieved by grand policy interventions led by washington but the quiet zoning code definitions of what may constitute a family can both accommodate changing social norms and help make sure bedrooms don t go empty while young families are locked out of communities in which they grew up let s consider leaving the definition of family to families themselves
yacob reyes politifact rubio s ad claims demings voted with pelosi to raise taxes over 4 000 on florida families rubio s campaign said the ad is referencing the inflation reduction act signed by president biden experts say the law did not impose a significant tax hike on ordinary floridians republican u s sen marco rubio accused his democratic challenger u s rep val demings of caring more about siding with house speaker nancy pelosi d calif than with the interests of florida residents a campaign ad running a few weeks before the nov 8 election said demings voted with pelosi to raise taxes over 4 000 on florida families although it s unclear what legislation rubio s ad is referring to his campaign said the ad is referencing the inflation reduction act a sweeping law on health care climate change and taxes the legislation passed along party lines before president joe biden signed it into law in august but did the inflation reduction act impose a significant tax hike on ordinary floridians as rubio s ad suggested experts say it didn t the law levied tax hikes on large corporations and high earners the basis of rubio s claim concerns the indirect impact of the law s effect on florida taxpayers but the ad doesn t mention subsidies included in the law that could mitigate the trickle down effect of raising corporate taxes five takeaways from the u s senate debate between sen marco rubio rep val demings more politifact the only florida senate debate between val demings and marco rubio fact checked florida governor candidates debate fact checking attacks from ron desantis and charlie crist in florida s only gubernatorial debate most analyses of the inflation reduction act show a modest impact on taxpayers rubio s campaign cited an article from the heritage foundation a conservative think tank based in washington d c that is critical of the inflation reduction act the inflation reduction act is intended to raise taxes by roughly 570 billion over the next decade 4 500 per household the heritage foundation wrote the article did not detail how it arrived at that number preston brashers a heritage foundation senior policy analyst said the 4 500 figure is based on the sum of revenue brought in by the law s tax increases for corporations stock owners and an increased budget for the irs among a few other taxes divided by the number of u s households the heritage foundation estimated the law s tax provisions will result in 570 billion in new tax collections over the next decade 570 billion divided by 128 million u s households equals around 4 500 per household this guesswork is powered by several assumptions because the tax hikes are applied to corporations and stock owners it s unknown how average taxpayers will be affected company ownership and stock ownership are not divided evenly among households said john buhl senior communications manager with the independent urban brookings tax policy center in washington d c even if you think a fairly large share of corporate taxes falls on workers and consumers you wouldn t come up with numbers as large as what heritage is claiming the inflation reduction act s impact on average taxpayers will come from secondary effects stemming from the increase in corporate taxes which could include lower wages for workers such effects are difficult to measure it s also worth noting that the heritage model did not account for the law s spending provisions that could cancel those tax increases the inflation reduction act includes subsidies for energy efficiency and clean energy extends subsidies for insurance under the affordable care act and eventually allows medicare to negotiate lower drug prices congress joint committee on taxation the penn wharton budget model and the tax foundation created model estimates of the inflation reduction act none predicted significant financial hits for consumers outside of higher income households the joint committee on taxation found that the average u s household would see its after tax income fall by 1 4 and the decline would be less than 1 for people earning 30 000 to 100 000 this estimate did not factor in offsetting subsidies an analysis by the committee for a responsible federal budget a washington d c nonprofit that favors deficit reduction said the 64 billion in health insurance subsidies is more than enough to offset the after tax income fall predicted by the joint commission on taxation our ruling rubio said demings voted with pelosi to raise taxes over 4 000 on florida families rubio was referring to the inflation reduction act which passed with pelosi and demings support but the law does not include a blanket tax increase for florida taxpayers the law applied tax increases directly on very large corporations and high earners it s unclear whether and how corporations would pass those costs to consumers and the individual effect of such increases will vary the source of rubio s figure uses questionable methodology modeled over 10 years to measure the secondary effects passed down to u s households other analyses estimated the effects would be smaller and potentially offset by subsidies included in the law we

no one should underestimate the scale of the task facing rishi sunak and his chancellor jeremy hunt as they seek to plug the black hole in the public finances bring down inflation and turn around a misfiring economy it is a daunting agenda after liz truss and kwasi kwarteng played havoc with the markets temporarily endangered the pensions of 10 million people and massively ratcheted up the costs of mortgages for countless homeowners inflation is rampant and britain s current rate of 10 1 per cent brings with it the threat of impossible wage demands and diminishes the value of savings for everyone no one should underestimate the scale of the task facing rishi sunak and his chancellor jeremy hunt as they seek to plug the black hole in the public finances bring down inflation and turn around a misfiring economy our nation s naysayers have leapt with glee on our apparent travails the economist magazine could not resist a cover showing a britannia figure with liz truss s head on it saying welcome to britaly the clear implication is that this country is in such a mess both politically and economically that it is even more chaotic than italy another publication seemingly determined to take britain down is the new york times in a front page article in its european edition this week it sought to disparage the prime minister by suggesting the wealth of his family means he remains deeply out of touch with the country an opinion piece carried the headline rishi sunak won t save britain and inevitably the bbc played its part too on radio 4 s flagship today programme it chose this week to feature the eccentric financier guy hands to pronounce at length on the british economy our nation s naysayers have leapt with glee on our apparent travails the economist magazine could not resist a cover showing a britannia figure with liz truss s head on it saying welcome to britaly slog hands a fanatical remainer who left these shores more than a decade ago to become a tax exile in guernsey duly declared that the uk is on a path to be the sick man of europe our economy is frankly doomed and that our government may soon be heading to the international monetary fund for a loan as it did during the sterling crisis of the 1970s can things really be as bad as these gloom mongers claim has the truss kwarteng partnership really dealt us such a mortal blow as i said we are in for turbulent times and given our predicament it is hardly a surprise that the new government has decided to postpone its planned fiscal statement which had been due to take place on monday instead we can expect a full autumn statement on november 17 this gives the prime minister and chancellor time to assess the data robustly and make in the words of mr hunt some decisions of eye watering difficulty instead we can expect a full autumn statement on november 17 this gives the prime minister and chancellor time to assess the data robustly and make in the words of mr hunt some decisions of eye watering difficulty yet it is possible to overdo the gloom indeed to take these doom mongers at their word would be the utmost folly for while the next couple of years are going to be a tough slog britain cannot allow itself to be caught up in the narrative of despair propagated by the opposition and the remoaner media let us take for example the comparison with italy our level of debt to total output is less than 80 per cent whereas italy s is a colossal 182 per cent and its fragile banking system is held up by massive loans from the european central bank what is more now that the chaos of the truss government has gone so too has last month s bedlam in uk bond markets in fact the interest rate yield on uk gilts which determine bank borrowing and mortgage rates has fallen way below those in italy yet it is possible to overdo the gloom indeed to take these doom mongers at their word would be the utmost folly yesterday mortgage rates here started falling too look at other countries in europe the uk s debt to gdp total output ratio is lower than every other g7 advanced country except germany which unlike britain is still worryingly dependent on russian gas as for france while we hopefully enter a period of stability and sensible politics with the sunak government the nation is beset by the turmoil of strikes fuel shortages with some 30 per cent of petrol stations running dry and endless protests the truth is that any comparison with european countries today shows britain in a favourable light meanwhile gas prices have fallen to their lowest levels since june in a huge boost to the public finances the chancellor will address in his autumn statement shipping costs are down 20 per cent since the start of the year steel prices have fallen to their lowest level since early 2021 vital component costs such as semi conductors have fallen tenfold since the start of the year the reason is that supply bottlenecks caused by the huge surge in demand post covid are finally easing lockdowns during the pandemic and port shutdowns in china meant that supply chains were under immense pressure and we saw the fastest price rises in advanced economies in decades as for france while we hopefully enter a period of stability and sensible politics with the sunak government the nation is beset by the turmoil of strikes fuel shortages with some 30 per cent of petrol stations running dry and endless protests the truth is that any comparison with european countries today shows britain in a favourable light stock image potential now thankfully they are beginning to function properly again which once more will help this country s coffers then there is britain s innate potential instead of force feeding us a daily dirge of gloomy outside broadcasts from food banks and soup kitchens the bbc could surely spend a little time during its 100th anniversary celebrating the nation s triumphs from satellite communications to the creative industries a true assessment of what is happening might come from our over stretched airports where the office for national statistics reports traffic is back up to 77 per cent of where it was before the pandemic families flying overseas for half term and business people scurrying to do deals across the world simply do not chime with keir starmer s charge that the tories have crashed the economy families flying overseas for half term and business people scurrying to do deals across the world simply do not chime with keir starmer s charge that the tories have crashed the economy despite the immediate difficulties there is good reason to believe that with the right policies tax cuts will come in the future and the uk s resilient economy will emerge from the malaise stronger than it has ever been after all thanks largely to rishi sunak s furlough scheme britain still has near full employment when people are working that boosts taxes on income and spending over recent years we have seen tax revenues outperforming forecasts on a regular basis closing the shortfall in the public finances far more quickly than expected in the first half of the year when the u s was in technical recession and europe almost at a standstill the uk grew in spite of over gloomy forecasts from the bank of england after all thanks largely to rishi sunak s furlough scheme britain still has near full employment attractive the nation is becoming so besmirched by negativism that i fear people are unwilling to lift their eyes and see our achievements such as the futuristic bond street underground station in the capital with the longest platform in europe and the newly opened and restored battersea power station overseas buyers continue to swarm around the uk s great high tech companies with the satellite company inmarsat among recent targets a survey this week of top private equity managers from around the globe found that as many as 70 per cent saw the ftse100 as the most attractive place in the world to invest and let us not forget that the last month alone has seen uk owned life sciences company astrazeneca the hero of covid 19 vaccinations win approvals for new medicines for ovarian cancer muscle weakness and a liver cancer treatment in the u s there is no doubt in my mind that in spite of the political and economic tornadoes we have faced the post brexit dream of a successful britain is far from dead for

the social media debate on our story about sweet betty s closing has been um interesting opinions have been wide ranging from people don t want to work to restaurant owners don t pay enough a sampling and my thoughts yet you have the government saying that unemployment is at all time low but retail or restaurant has lack of employees well if unemployment is low that means there are fewer people looking for work that means it is harder for existing businesses to fill open positions more people working leads to a lack of employees looking for work that was a small business they should have been able to run themselves with little help i know because i did the same exact thing they either weren t willing to do what it takes to be successful or they weren t willing to pay someone what they were worth simple as that clearly a comment by somebody who has never owned a food service business running such a business means multiple jobs overlap taking orders cooking food washing dishes cashing out customers and then somebody has got to keep the books it s not a one or two person business they are getting money to stay home and not work stop the free hand outs and watch how many people look for work extended unemployment benefits ended a long long time ago and the economic evidence is the payments had little impact when still active on people s willingness to work there are currently 900 people drawing unemployment in genesee county according to the most recent labor department data that is not a number that screams people are mooching off unemployment insurance payments 3 unemployment rate yet why are there almost a million on welfare time for workfare for the lazy actually in the u s there are nearly 60 million people drawing some sort of assistance and nearly all of them who are of working age and not on full disability have jobs then there are the people who blamed the owners love how they say it s the workers why not blame the owners for not paying more for the work or putting on the work outfit and working themselves simple supply demand and people have a life simple you wanna pay minimum wage you get minimum result crazy how they re closing and many other family owned restaurants aren t time to stop blaming staff and look to themselves as to where the problem lie whether it be their management or their product and some readers did jump to their defense such as susan macomber the owners family and friends worked there 99 of the time they were very hard working and very friendly and the food was delicious the owners also closed for holidays and closed at times to give their workers some time off because they couldn t get enough help and they paid their workers well more blaming the owners from somebody who almost certainly never owned a business unemployment is lowest it s been in 40 years only the failed businesses are having trouble finding employees the strong survive my friends it s survival of the fittest and you ain t fit look around you there are help wanted signs everywhere there was a time more than a decade ago when economists considered an unemployment rate of five percent to be full employment the idea is that at five percent being unemployed was transitory people moved quickly from one job to the next it was temporary and the normal economic shuffling of the deck as businesses changed strategy closed for various reasons or people quit jobs just to have the time to find a better job also covid itself has taken a lot of people out of the workforce more than one million people in the u s have died and nearly half of them had not yet reached full retirement age and presumably a lot of them were or could be in the workforce this is a very very tight job market probably the tightest any of us have seen in our lifetimes so let s talk about the free market this makes me so sad i love sweet betty s but i get it no one wants to work anymore or if they do it s completely on their terms and hours businesses everywhere are impacted by this here s the thing in a free market people can choose where they want to work they want to work on their terms i want to work on my terms you want to work on your terms we all want that opportunity i own my own business so i can work on my own terms when i worked for other people i worked hard and improved my skills and knowledge so i could advance and make more money that s working on my own terms when there isn t a tight labor market employers have the leverage to say work on my terms or leave perhaps with more nuance than that in a tight labor market the power imbalance shifts to the workers but that s how free markets work should work and we want them to work if we want a thriving economy and an improving standard of living for everybody one reader asks legitimate questions how much were you paying how many hours did you guarantee was it a regular schedule or did it vary from one week to the next were your cooks treated with respect ot treated like they were disposable people work when they feel like they are valued if that s not the case they go elsewhere there are lots of jobs out there make yours the one everyone brags about those are all things that will impact the ability of a business to hire good and qualified people however there is only so far a business can stretch on pay and hours and benefits running a business is not as easy as this reader makes it sound as i ll address later another take on the people don t want to work theme to all who wonder why they can t get help people dont want to work today they want top pay for doinb little there are plenty of jobs all over it seems to me that if you really want a job or need a job then take one of the jobs money is money let s just say there are in fact people who don t want to work there are undoubtedly some people who don t want to work period there is no wage that will entice them to leave their bedroom but this poster seems to assume that just because there are jobs there are jobs that the people without jobs want to take those jobs there are a number of reasons that people not working won t take a job you think they should take they re not qualified it doesn t fit their career path the hours won t let them take care of their children or go to school the job won t help them advance their career and could even derail it or maybe the job you think they should take isn t just offering enough of an incentive to give up fishing to go to work money is as the poster says is money and yes sometimes it takes more money to entice a person to take a job in order for a worker and an employer to find each other the worker needs to be qualified to work the job that s open even if a worker who has spent the past few years pushing a broom is willing to take a job as a line cook that doesn t mean he s qualified to be a line cook employers don t like to hire unqualified people because they don t have the track record to ensure they can do the job or will stick with it unqualified workers cost money and can be a disaster a more nuanced take that deserves a response restaurants took the worse beating when that covid crap shut n y down the ridiculous cost of living made it so minimum wage skyrocketed instead of putting caps on rent increases and utilities the more pay made prices go up more small business owners suffer because with their overhead and insurance payments they cannot afford to hire as much workers everyone suffers and people complain about higher costs in restaurants they have to raise prices just to make ends meet restaurants got a lot of financial help during and because of the pandemic restrictions all of that money being pumped into the economy is part of the cause of current inflationary pressures it s basic economics increase the money supply and prices generally go up restaurants by and large stayed alive with delivery and curbside pickup while maintaining lower overhead with the dining rooms closed when the economy kick started again companies were scrambling to fill open positions a lot of former workers found new jobs retired started their own businesses went back to school decided to become stay at home spouses picked up a job with uber door dash or instacart or otherwise left the workforce and not just because they became lazy but in the human condition there is always some of that too with a shortage of workers restaurants and other businesses were forced to raise wages that started before the current inflation cycle and is one of the multiple causes of today s inflation the sad thing is the wage gains workers first realized after the end of the pandemic have been wiped out by inflation adrian fitzgerald harris has an informed view low birth rates massive boomer retirements and no one solving the immigration problem have caused some of this the decline in the stock market might coax some people out of their early retirement the low birth rate isn t going to change so long as we remain a first world economy so that leaves immigration want more workers let more workers into the country we need about one million working immigrants flowing into this country asap that would spur the kind of economic growth we need to stave off a recession and stem inflation the economy would boom terry paine left an intelligent comment you can tell the people that have never had a business with employees before maybe these business geniuses could offer some advice on what an employee s pay should look like since we know 14 to 17 is not enough then the employer can make a decision whether they can themselves take that big of pay cut or if raising the cost to the customer will reduce sales enough that the business has to close anyway tough balance i can say that their standards for hiring wait staff is pretty high since i have enjoyed every one i ve ever had wait on me that standard might be just as important of more important than the food so to sum up there are two main camps here blame the employers and blame the employees how about if we not blame either running a small business is hard especially a food services business you have government regulations to worry about employees stealing a big problem in a mostly cash business taxes insurance lots of overhead employees who have their own lives and own issues that you need to balance supply issues competition to worry about customers who complain and so on you pretty much have to be insane to run your own business it s a hard life thank god there are people who do it though because small business owners are the true backbone of america and our communities they offer more charitable support to their communities give communities a sense of cohesion and pride and the owners are often more involved and more often make fine mentors for the young people they meet and employees have their own wishes and desires they have aspirations dreams ambitions they might have families to care for or passions they wish to pursue away from work they are often not business owners themselves because of these other constraints or priorities but humans evolved to acquire resources to make their lives more stable and better for the vast majority of us we want more money and better things so naturally we want better pay and if we can t get better pay then we look for other tradeoffs such as more time to go fishing or play in a rock and roll band in our rush to make everything political these days we miss how complex our economy really is and how something as seemingly straightforward as a restaurant closing is really about a world of competing economic forces sweet betty s closing is sad it shouldn t be fodder for scoring political points

neuroscientist claims jeffrey dahmer was not a psychopath because he showed emotional empathy with people jeffrey dahmer is not a psychopath and instead just had bpd an expert says dr james fallon says that the famed killer s actions were a symptom of bpd dahmer s crimes have risen back into public prominence due to a netflix series the infamous serial killer was diagnosed with bpd before his 1992 trial a neuroscientist is arguing notorious us serial killer jeffrey dahmer is not a psychopath because he showed emotional empathy with people professor james fallon 74 a physciatrist at the university of california irvine argues that dahmer s behavior matches more that of someone with borderline personality disorder bpd it is a condition where a person suffers an impacted ability to regulate their emotions and from poor impulse control dr fallon believes the killer who has recently risen to fame once more as a result of a hit netflix series is suffering from the condition because of his unstable childhood many believe that mr dahmer and others like him are psychopaths misusing the term as a catch all for any erratic or dangerous behavior psychopaths are people who lack empathy are manipulative and often have a total disregard for the consequences of their actions the killer recently the topic of a netflix drama murdered 16 men and boys in the us between 1978 and 1991 the infamous murderer was diagnosed with bpd before his 1992 murder trial jeffrey dahmer was an infamous serial killer who killed 16 people in wisconsin and ohio between 1978 and 1991 he was recently brought into prominence by a hit netflix series dramatizing his crimes pictured dahmer at his 1992 trial in milwaukee wisconsin the crimes of jeffrey dahmer rose to prominence once more when netflix released a series dramatizing his story earlier this year pictured dahmer portrayed by actor evan peters in the netflix series fallon argues that because of dahmer s substance addictions unusual sexual behaviors and inability to control his anger he likely has bpd each of those are traits more associated with the condition than they are psychopathy dr james fallon pictured argues that jefferey dahmer was not a psychopath and was instead just showing symptoms of his bpd jeffrey dahmer was not a psychopath his characteristics all point to bpd james said it was never confirmed he was a psychopath but everyone assumed for simplicity s sake that a bad person is a psychopath he showed emotional empathy with people and many psychopaths don t have that dr fallon has studied the brain imaging of psychopaths particularly those of murderers and serial killers since 1989 he also researched several other personality disorders including bpd bpd is characterized by extreme emotional instability impulsive behavior intense and unstable relationships and disturbing patterns of thinking dr fallon believes this is what mr dahmer had rather than psychopathy because he had too much fear of abandonment to fit the tropes of a psychopath the doctor said there are certain aspects of dahmer s behavior that didn t fit into the tropes of psychopathy he highlighted how the serial killer showed emotional empathy and developed connections with people in a way a psychopath wouldn t because his crimes appeared to be motivated by intense fear of abandonment he said a common thing with people with bpd is that they have these crazy fears of being abandoned jeffrey dahmer seemed to fear this all the time when the men he met tried to leave him he would kill them so they couldn t dr fallon added that even dahmer s most infamous behavior eating his victims which earned him the nickname the milwaukee cannibal can be attributed to this he said this cannibalism likely stemmed from a desire to make someone be a part of you forever so they can t leave you a lot of people feel this with babies or puppies like i love this baby so much that i want to eat it that s actually an impulsive take on an otherwise normal way of thinking about ingesting someone he said dahmer took it to extremes because he needed that feeling that the person would always be with him and he d never be abandoned other key behaviors which james said indicates he had extreme bpd include his unusual sexuality recklessly engaging in often unsafe sex he also highlighted self destructive behaviors such as putting himself in risky situations which could have endangered him as well as his notorious substance abuse both more common of bpd than psychopathy dr fallon concluded when you think of the famous serial killers dahmer included everyone loves to think for simplicity s sake that they re all the same it s never been fully confirmed dahmer was a psychopath but it does keep coming up but his characteristics don t agree and i don t believe he was advertisement we ll never know for sure because we can t see his genetics or brain images but i feel he was more like someone with bpd

newsfile corp october 26 2022 newcrest asx ncm tsx ncm pngx ncm managing director and chief executive officer sandeep biswas said newcrest delivered another excellent quarter of exploration results with significant growth potential highlighted across our key targets at brucejack red chris and havieron at brucejack we returned several high grade intercepts during the quarter supporting our views for significant resource growth potential golden marmot remains open to the east north and south with the target displaying many geological features of the nearby valley of the kings deposit the results of our east ridge discovery at red chris continue to expand the higher grade footprint and havieron has continued to deliver encouraging results demonstrating its potential for incremental growth outside of the current resource we were also very pleased to expand our global exploration portfolio during the quarter with the addition of five new emerging projects in the highly prospective great basin region in north america said mr biswas brucejack british columbia canada 1 the brucejack property hosts the valley of the kings vok high grade gold deposit the vok is characterised by multiple occurrences of higher grade mineralisation over selected intervals hosted within broader zones of stockwork and vein arrays growth activities are focused on both resource expansion within the existing mine area as well as brownfields exploration activities within 4km of the mine area both programs returned results of higher grade mineralisation during the period resource expansion drilling during the quarter was focused on targets in the 1080 hbx zone and galena hill a total of 19 913m in 92 drill holes was completed using 3 underground drill rigs assay results were received for four drill fans in the 1080 hbx zone all other assays are pending brownfields drilling during the quarter focused on targets in gossan hill south and golden marmot a total of 23 731m in 55 drill holes was completed using 4 drill rigs on surface during the quarter final assay results were received from the first 19 holes at golden marmot at 1080 hbx zone assays were received for 44 drill holes four drill fans all drill holes intersected gold mineralisation with 22 of the 44 drill holes intersecting higher grade mineralisation in excess of 5 grams per tonne drill holes at 1080 hbx are collared within the current pretium published resource and are drilling in the resource for the initial 120 to 150 meters depending on the orientation of the drill hole the drill program was designed to follow up on the extensions of the high grade gold mineralisation intersected in 1080 east drill program previously reported results have confirmed the continuity of higher grade gold mineralisation hosted in a zone oriented sub parallel to domain 20 which is currently being mined in the vok drill fans were spaced at 15 meters horizontally in order to rapidly advance this new zone assays received to

the brownfield exploration program is focused on the discovery of additional zones of higher grade mineralisation within the red chris porphyry corridor including targets outside of newcrest s mineral resource estimate during the period there were up to seven diamond drill rigs in operation a further 20 926m of drilling has been completed from 27 drill holes with all drill holes intersecting mineralisation this contributed to a total of 286 300m of drilling from 278 drill holes since newcrest acquired its interest in the joint venture in august 2019 at east ridge located adjacent to the east zone drilling is ongoing with 63 holes completed and 6 in progress the follow up drilling is being completed on a nominal 100m x 100m grid to determine the footprint and characterise the mineralisation and to demonstrate the continuity of the higher grade mineralisation drilling to date has tested a corridor 900m long and to a vertical extent of 1 000m within which zones of higher grade mineralisation have been identified east ridge is outside of newcrest s mineral resource estimate diamond drilling continues to define the extent and continuity of this higher grade

december 2022 quarter appendix 1 brucejack 100 newcrest jorc table 1 section 1 sampling techniques and data criteria commentary sampling techniques core samples are obtained from core drilling hq diameter diamond core was drilled on a 3m run whole core was sampled at 1 5m intervals except where visible gold was identified in which case the sample length was shortened to 1 0 or 0 5m drilling techniques core drilling was advanced with hq diameter coring configuration core from select inclined drill holes are oriented on 3m runs using an electronic core orientation tool reflex actiii at the end of each run the bottom of hole position is marked by the driller which is later transferred to the whole drill core run length with a bottom of hole reference line drill sample recovery core recovery is systematically recorded from the commencement of coring to end of hole by reconciling against driller s depth blocks in each core tray with data recorded in the database drillers depth blocks provided the depth interval of core recovered and interval of core drilled core recoveries were typically 100 with isolated zones of lower recovery logging geological logging recorded qualitative descriptions of lithology alteration mineralisation veining and structure for all core drilled 43 644m geotechnical measurements were recorded including rock quality designation rqd fracture frequency solid core recovery and qualitative rock strength measurements all geological and geotechnical logging was conducted at the brucejack mine digital data logging was captured validated and stored in a geospark database all drill cores were photographed prior to sampling the core sub sampling techniques and sample preparation sampling sample preparation and quality control protocols are considered appropriate for the material being sampled whole core hq samples whole core samples were collected in plastic bags together with pre numbered sample tags and grouped into shipping bins for dispatch to the laboratory by dedicated transport sample lengths were typically 1 5m and weights typically varied from 11 to 15kg with an average weight of approximately 12 5 kg sample sizes are considered appropriate for the style of mineralisation all drill core samples were freighted by road to the laboratory via hired transport sample preparation was conducted at the independent iso 9001 certified and iso 17025 accredited als global preparation laboratories samples were dried at 600c and crushed to 90 passing 2 mm and split to obtain up to 1 kg sub sample which was pulverised using lm2 to produce a pulped product with the minimum standard of 85 passing 75 m duplicate sample data are available from crush and pulp samples at a rate of approximately 1 20 duplicate results show an acceptable level of variability for the material sampled and style of mineralisation quality of assay data and laboratory tests assaying of drill core samples was conducted at als in north vancouver all samples were assayed for 33 elements using a 4 acid digestion followed by icp oes determination method me icp61 gold analyses were determined by 50g fire assay with atomic absorption finish method au aa26 with trigger to au gra22 50g gravimetric overlimit method at 18 ppm sampling and assaying quality control procedures consisted of inclusion of certified reference material crms coarse residue and pulp duplicates with each batch at least 1 20 assays of quality control samples were compared with reference samples in the geospark sql database and verified as acceptable prior to formal use of data from analysed batches laboratory quality duplicates including replicates and preparation duplicates are captured in the geospark sql database and assessed prepared pulp splits for mineralized samples were sent to ms analytical labs in langley bc for secondary lab check work by comparable au and icp methods to ensure agreement with original results check pulps were prepared for 20 samples from 5 of the golden marmot holes and overall a representative 5 7 of mineralized samples for vok drilling was sent for secondary lab checks including north block phase 4 and 1080 east level drilling comparisons are acceptable analysis of the available quality control sample assay results indicates that an acceptable level of accuracy and precision has been achieved the database contains no analytical data that has been numerically manipulated the assaying techniques and quality control protocols used are considered appropriate for the data to be used for reporting exploration drilling results verification of sampling and assaying sampling intervals defined by the geologist are electronically assigned sample identification numbers prior to core sampling corresponding sample numbers matching pre labelled sample tags are assigned to each interval all sampling and assay information were stored in a secure geospark database with restricted access sample submission forms providing the sample identification number accompany each submission to the laboratory assay results from the laboratory with corresponding sample identification are loaded directly into the geospark database assessment of reported significant assay intervals was verified by review of visible gold identified in the drill core and review of high resolution core photography the verification of significant intersections has been completed by company personnel and the competent person qualified person no adjustments are made to assay data and no twinned holes

an automatic core cutter and half core sampled at 2m intervals cover sequences were not sampled drilling techniques core drilling was advanced with hq3 hq nq3 and nq diameter coring configuration core from inclined drill holes are oriented on 3 4 5m or 6m runs using an electronic core orientation tool reflex actiii at the end of each run the bottom of hole position is marked by the driller which is later transferred to the whole drill core run length with a bottom of hole reference line drill sample recovery core recovery is systematically recorded from the commencement of coring to end of hole by reconciling against driller s depth blocks in each core tray with data recorded in the database drillers depth blocks provided the depth interval of core recovered and interval of core drilled core recoveries were typically 100 with isolated zones of lower recovery logging geological logging recorded qualitative descriptions of lithology alteration mineralisation veining and structure for all core drilled 20 925 8m in 27 holes all holes intersected mineralisation including orientation of key geological features geotechnical measurements were recorded including rock quality designation rqd fracture frequency solid core recovery and qualitative rock strength measurements magnetic susceptibility measurements were recorded every metre all geological and geotechnical logging was conducted at the red chris mine digital data logging was captured validated and stored in an acquire database all drill cores were photographed prior to cutting and or sampling the core sub sampling techniques and sample preparation sampling sample preparation and quality control protocols are considered appropriate for the material being sampled core was cut and sampled at the red chris mine core processing facility half core samples were collected in plastic bags together with pre numbered sample tags and grouped in wood crates for dispatch to the laboratory sample weights typically varied from 5 to 10kg sample sizes are considered appropriate for the style of mineralisation drill core samples were freighted by road to the laboratory sample preparation was conducted at the independent iso 9001 certified and iso 17025 accredited bureau veritas commodities canada ltd laboratory vancouver bureau veritas samples were dried at 650c and crushed to 95 passing 4 75 mm and the split to obtain up to 1kg sub sample which was pulverised using lm2 to produce a pulped product with the minimum standard of 95 passing 106¼m duplicate samples were collected from crush and pulp samples at a rate of 1 20 duplicate results show an acceptable level of variability for the material sampled and style of mineralisation periodic size checks 1 20 for crush and pulp samples and sample weights are provided by the laboratory and recorded in the acquire database quality of assay data and laboratory tests assaying of drill core samples was conducted at bureau veritas all samples were assayed for 59 elements using a 4 acid digestion followed by icp aes icp ms determination method ma250 gold analyses were determined by 50g fire assay with icp es finish method fa350 carbon and sulphur were determined by leco method tc000 and mercury using aqua regia digestion followed by icp es ms determination method aq200 sampling and assaying quality control procedures consisted of inclusion of certified reference material crms coarse residue and pulp duplicates with each batch at least 1 20 assays of quality control samples were compared with reference samples in the acquire database and verified as acceptable prior to use of data from analysed batches laboratory quality control data including laboratory standards blanks duplicates repeats and grind size results are captured in the acquire database and assessed for accuracy and precision for recent data due to the limited extent of the drilling program to date extended quality control programs are yet to be undertaken whereby pulped samples will be submitted to an umpire laboratory and combined with more extensive re submission programs analysis of the available quality control sample assay results indicates that an acceptable level of accuracy and precision has been achieved and the database contains no analytical data that has been numerically manipulated the assaying techniques and quality control protocols used are considered appropriate for the data to be used for reporting exploration drilling results verification of sampling and assaying sampling intervals defined by the geologist are electronically assigned sample identification numbers prior to core cutting corresponding sample numbers matching pre labelled sample tags are assigned to each interval all sampling and assay information were stored in a secure acquire database with restricted access electronically generated sample submission forms providing the sample identification number accompany each submission to the laboratory assay results from the laboratory with corresponding sample identification are loaded directly into the acquire database assessment of reported significant assay intervals was verified by re logging of drill core intervals and assessment of high resolution core photography the verification of significant intersections has been completed by company personnel and the competent person qualified person

1 sampling techniques and data criteria commentary sampling techniques core samples are obtained from core drilling in proterozoic basement lithologies pq hq and nq diameter core was drilled on a 6m run core was cut using an automated core cutter and half core sampled at 1m intervals with breaks for major geological changes sampling intervals range from 0 2 1 0m cover sequences were not sampled drilling techniques permian paterson formation cover sequence was drilled using mud rotary drilling depths of cover typically observed to approximately 420m vertically below surface steel casing was emplaced to secure the pre collar core drilling was advanced from the base of the cover sequence with pq3 hq3 and nq2 diameter coring configuration core from inclined drill holes is oriented on 3m and 6m runs using an electronic core orientation tool reflex actiii at the end of each run the bottom of hole position is marked by the driller which is later transferred to the whole drill core run length with a bottom of hole reference line drill sample recovery core recovery is systematically recorded from the commencement of coring to end of hole by reconciling against driller s depth blocks in each core tray with data recorded in the database drillers depth blocks provided the depth interval of core recovered and interval of core drilled core recoveries were typically 100 with isolated zones of lower recovery cover sequence drilling by the mud rotary drilling did not yield recoverable samples logging geological logging recorded qualitative descriptions of lithology alteration mineralisation veining and structure for all core drilled 15 824m for 21 drill holes all intersecting mineralisation including orientation of key geological features geotechnical measurements were recorded including rock quality designation rqd fracture frequency solid core recovery and qualitative rock strength measurements magnetic susceptibility measurements were recorded every metre the bulk density of selected drill core intervals was determined at site on whole core samples all geological and geotechnical logging was conducted at the havieron site digital data logging was captured on diamond drill core intervals only and all data validated and stored in an acquire database all drill cores were photographed prior to cutting and or sampling the core the logging is of sufficient quality to support mineral resource estimates sub sampling techniques and sample preparation sampling sample preparation and quality control protocols are considered appropriate for the material being sampled core was cut and sampled at the havieron core processing facility half core samples of between 0 2 and 2 0 m were collected in pre numbered calico bags and grouped in plastic bags for dispatch to the laboratory sample weights typically varied from 0 5 to 8kg sample sizes are considered appropriate for the style of mineralisation drill core samples were freighted by air and road to the laboratory sample preparation was conducted at the independent iso17025 accredited intertek laboratory perth intertek samples were dried at 105oc and crushed to 95 passing 4 75mm and the split to obtain up to 3kg sub sample which was pulverised using lm5 to produce a pulped product with the minimum standard of 95 passing 106¼m routine grind size analysis is conducted duplicate samples were collected from crush and pulp samples at a rate of 1 20 duplicate results show an acceptable level of variability for the material sampled and style of mineralisation periodic size checks 1 20 for crush and pulp samples and sample weights are provided by the laboratory and recorded in the acquire database quality of assay data and laboratory tests assaying of drill core samples was conducted at intertek all samples were assayed for 48 elements using a 4 acid digestion followed by icp aes icp ms determination method 4a ms907 which is considered to provide a total assay for copper gold analyses were determined by 50g fire assay with aas finish method fa50n aa which is considered to provide a total assay for gold sampling and assaying quality control procedures consisted of inclusion of certified reference material crms coarse residue and pulp duplicates with each batch at least 1 20 assays of quality control samples were compared with reference samples in acquire database and verified as acceptable prior to use of data from analysed batches laboratory quality control data including laboratory standards blanks duplicates repeats and grind size results are captured in the acquire database and assessed for accuracy and precision for recent data extended quality control programs including pulp samples submitted to an umpire laboratory and combined with more extensive re submission programs have been completed analysis of the available quality control sample assay results indicates that an acceptable level of accuracy and precision has been achieved and the database contains no analytical data that has been numerically manipulated the assaying techniques and quality control protocols used are considered appropriate for the data to be used for reporting exploration drilling results verification of sampling and assaying sampling intervals defined by the geologist are electronically assigned sample identification numbers prior to core cutting corresponding sample numbers matching pre labelled calico bags are assigned to each interval all sampling and assay information were stored in a secure acquire database with restricted access electronically generated sample submission forms providing the sample identification number accompany each submission to the laboratory assay results from the laboratory with corresponding sample identification are loaded directly into the acquire database assessment of reported significant assay intervals was verified by re logging of diamond drill core intervals and assessment of high resolution core photography the verification of significant intersections has been completed by company personnel and the competent person qualified person no adjustments are made to assay data and no twinned holes have been completed there are no currently known drilling sampling recovery or other factors that could materially affect the accuracy or reliability of the data location of data points drill collar locations were surveyed using a differential gps with gnss with a stated accuracy of 0 5m for all drill holes reported drill rig alignment was attained using an electronic azimuth aligner downhole survey was collected at 6 12m intervals in the cover sequence and every 6 to 30m in diamond drill core segments of the drill hole using single shot axis mining champ gyro the single shot surveys have been validated using continuous survey to surface axis mining champ along with a selection of drill holes re surveyed by an external survey contactor using a devigyro tool confirming sufficient accuracy for downhole spatial recording a lidar survey was completed over the project area in nov 2019 which was used to prepare a dem topographic model for the project with a spatial accuracy of 0 1m vertical and 0 3m horizontal the topography is generally low relief to flat elevation within the dune corridors in ranges between 250 265m australian height datum ahd steepening to the southeast all collar coordinates are provided in the geocentric datum of australian gda20 zone 51 all relative depth information is reported in ahd 5000m data spacing and distribution within the south east crescent and breccia zone drill hole spacing ranges from 50 to 100m to 50 by 50m within the resource extents outside the initial resource boundary drill hole spacing ranges from 50 to 200m in lateral extent within the breccia zone over an area of 2km2 the data spacing is sufficient to establish the degree of geological and grade continuity significant assay intercepts remain open further drilling is required to determine the extent of currently defined mineralisation no sample compositing is applied to samples drilling intersects mineralisation at various angles orientation of data in relation to geological structure drill holes exploring the extents of the havieron mineral system intersect moderately dipping carbonate and siliclastic sedimentary facies mineralised breccia and sub vertical intrusive lithologies geological modelling has been interpreted from historic and newcrest drill holes variable brecciation alteration and sulphide mineralisation is observed with a footprint with dimensions of 650m x 350m trending in a north west orientation and over 1000m in vertical extent below cover the subvertical southeast high grade arcuate crescent sulphide zone has an average thickness of 20m and has been defined over a strike length of up to 550m and extended to over 700m in vertical extent below cover drilling direction is oriented to intersect the steeply dipping high grade sulphide mineralisation zones at an intersection angle of greater than 40 degrees the drilled length of reported intersections is typically greater than true width of mineralisation sample security the security of samples is controlled by tracking samples from drill rig to database drill core was delivered from the drill rig to the havieron core yard every shift on completion of geological and geotechnical logging core processing was completed by newcrest personnel at the havieron facility high resolution core photography and cutting of drill core was undertaken at the havieron core processing facilities samples were freighted in sealed bags by air and road to the laboratory and in the custody of newcrest representatives sample numbers are generated directly from the database all samples are collected in pre numbered calico bags verification of sample numbers and identification is conducted by the laboratory on receipt of samples and sample receipt advise issued to newcrest details of all sample movement are recorded in a database table dates hole id sample ranges and the analytical suite requested are recorded with the dispatch of samples to analytical services any discrepancies logged at the receipt of samples into the analytical services are validated audits or reviews internal reviews of core handling sample preparation and assays laboratories were conducted on a regular basis by both project personnel and owner representatives in the competent person s opinion the sample preparation security and analytical procedures are consistent with current industry standards and are entirely appropriate and acceptable for the styles of mineralisation identified and will be appropriate for use in the reporting of exploration results and mineral resource estimates there are no identified drilling sampling or recovery factors that materially impact the adequacy and reliability of the results of the drilling programme in

for the periods prior to the consummation of the respective divestiture or closing same store operating results and statistical information exclude businesses divested in 2021 and 2022 businesses closed or substantially closed in 2022 and one hospital opened in 2022 there were no discontinued operations reported for 2022 and 2021 b the following table provides information needed to calculate

community health systems inc stockholders basic and diluted 42 111 369 52 c ebitda is a non gaap financial measure which consists of net loss income attributable to community health systems inc before interest income taxes and depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda also a non gaap financial measure is ebitda adjusted to add back net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and to exclude loss gain from early extinguishment of debt impairment and gain loss on sale of businesses gain on sale of equity interests in macon healthcare llc expense related to government and other legal matters and related costs expense incurred in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to the settlement of certain professional liability claims for which the third party insurers obligation to insure the company against the underlying loss was being litigated along with income during the fourth quarter of 2021 associated with the settlement of such litigation for the recovery of amounts covered by such third party insurance policies expense related to employee termination benefits and other restructuring charges and expense from settlement and fair value adjustments on the contingent value right agreement liability related to the hma legal proceedings and related legal expenses the company has from time to time sold noncontrolling interests in certain of its subsidiaries or acquired subsidiaries with existing noncontrolling interest ownership positions the company believes that it is useful to present adjusted ebitda because it adds back the portion of ebitda attributable to these third party interests the company reports adjusted ebitda as a measure of financial performance adjusted ebitda is a key measure used by management to assess the operating performance of the company s hospital operations and to make decisions on the allocation of resources adjusted ebitda is also used to evaluate the performance of the company s executive management team and is one of the primary metrics used in connection with determining short term cash incentive compensation and the achievement of vesting criteria with respect to performance based equity awards in addition management utilizes adjusted ebitda in assessing the company s consolidated results of operations and operational performance and in comparing the company s results of operations between periods the company believes it is useful to provide investors and other users of the company s financial statements this performance measure to align with how management assesses the company s results of operations adjusted ebitda also is comparable to a similar metric called consolidated ebitda as defined in the company s asset based loan facility the abl facility and the company s existing note indentures which is a key component in the determination of the company s compliance with certain covenants under the abl facility and such note indentures including the company s ability to service debt and incur capital expenditures and is used to determine the interest rate and commitment fee payable under the abl facility although adjusted ebitda does not include all of the adjustments described in the abl facility adjusted ebitda includes the adjusted ebitda attributable to hospitals that were divested during the course of such year but in each case solely to the extent relating to the period prior to the consummation of the applicable divestiture footnotes to financial highlights financial statements and selected operating data continued adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under u s gaap it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net loss income operating income or any other performance measure calculated in accordance with u s gaap the items excluded from adjusted ebitda are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance the company believes such adjustments are appropriate as the magnitude and frequency of such items can vary significantly and are not related to the assessment of normal operating performance additionally this calculation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies the following table reflects the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda as defined to net loss income attributable to community health systems inc stockholders as derived directly from the condensed consolidated financial statements in millions three months ended nine months ended september 30 september 30 2022 2021 2022 2021 net

stockholders for both the three and nine months ended september 30 2022 so the effect of dilutive securities is not considered because their effect would be antidilutive if the company had generated net income the effect of stock awards and options on the diluted shares calculation would have been an increase in shares of 565 641 and 1 305 604 during the three and nine months ended september 30 2022 respectively during the three and nine months ended september 30 2021 the effect of stock awards and options on the diluted shares calculation was an increase in shares of 3 807 353 and 3 247 660 respectively footnotes to financial highlights financial statements and selected operating data continued e the following supplemental table reconciles net loss income attributable to community health systems inc stockholders as reported on a per share diluted basis to net loss income attributable to community health systems inc stockholders per share diluted with the adjustments described herein total per share amounts may not add due to rounding the company believes that the presentation of non gaap adjusted net loss income attributable to community health systems inc stockholders per share diluted presents useful information to investors by highlighting the impact on net loss income attributable to community health systems inc stockholders per share diluted of selected items used in calculating adjusted ebitda which may not reflect the company s underlying operating performance and assisting in comparing the company s results of operations between periods three months ended nine

months ended september 30 2022 and 2021 respectively primarily from impairment charges to reduce the value of certain long lived assets at businesses the company identified for closure sale or sold and also gains on the sale of certain businesses during such periods these impairment charges do not have an impact on the calculation of the company s financial covenants under the abl facility g the maximum aggregate principal amount under the abl facility is 1 0 billion at september 30 2022 the available borrowing base under the abl facility was 935 million of which 83 million is reserved for

article 3 months old always an independent thinker rudi has not shied away from making big out of consensus predictions that proved accurate later on when rio tinto shares surged above 120 he wrote investors should sell in mid 2008 he warned investors not to hold on to equities in oil producers in august 2008 he predicted the largest sell off in commodities stocks was about to follow in 2009 he suggested australian banks were an excellent buy between 2011 and 2015 rudi consistently maintained investors were better off avoiding exposure to commodities and to commodities stocks post gfc he dedicated his research to finding all weather performers see also all weather performers on this website as well as the special reports section rudi s view oct 27 2022 this story features coles group limited and other companies for more info share analysis col in this week s weekly insights in bonds we must trust conviction calls research to download by rudi filapek vandyck editor fnarena in bonds we must trust normally when economic recession is coming you d expect defensives and solid reliable quality industrials to be among the outperformers in the share market but 2022 is not following that script at least not thus far shares in supermarket operators coles col metcash mts and woolworths wow are down since the start of the calendar year while packaging giant amcor amc and its local offshoot orora ora are equally notably absent from this year s star performers on the asx what to think of australia s third largest index weight global plasma leader csl csl which only a week ago increased its profit guidance for fy23 but whose share price cannot hold on to positive momentum for longer than a few days this year a similar observation can be made for resmed rmd the global leader in diagnosing and treating sleep apnoea stands to extra benefit from a major competitor s problems resmed s also not so flash when it comes to sustaining share price momentum is it possible maybe investors are simply not that convinced economies stand to lose most of their momentum in the year coming not so according to the latest global fund manager survey by bank of america which according to bofa market strategists screams of mass capitulation average levels of cash at 6 3 have never been as high since april 2001 in the midst of an extremely brutal bear market fund managers are now three standard deviations underweight equities a net 72 of respondents sees a weaker economy on the horizon only a smidgen off the record high print of the july survey 91 says corporate earnings will be lower than is forecast today a net 74 of survey respondents sees a global recession in 2023 the highest percentage since april 2020 at the very beginning of the global pandemic so how then can we explain this great discrepancy between the overwhelming acceptance of recession next year with negative consequences for corporate profits and the failure of the usual defensive stalwarts to perform i believe the answer lays with global bonds it was the lauded benjamin graham himself who in the intelligent investor highlights that bond yields are an important input for determining the value of companies but after four decades of mostly positive impact from bonds most analysts and investors in shares could be forgiven for paying scant attention in 2022 however the direction in bond yields matters it has mattered whole year for the record higher bond yields as we are witnessing throughout this year impact on all listed assets but the impact is most felt for those equities that trade on higher valuations in a theoretical example stocks that trade on a forward pe multiple of 32x might be pushed back to 26x while a stock trading on 9x might only be pushed lower to 8 5x it s not difficult to see how rising bond yields benefit the so called value segment in the share market while growth and higher valued quality stocks suffer usually when a recession shows up on the horizon bond yields fall in anticipation of lower inflation and central banks cutting interest rates which also adds that extra valuation support to the more defensive oriented stocks i mentioned earlier thus far however inflation is still on the rise and central bankers continue lifting interest rates in response this explains why going all in defensive in preparation for next year s recession hasn t worked so well this year the obvious point to make is that virtually no one believes inflation will not respond to central bank tightening and slowing economies hence a time will come when bond yields stop rising as markets try to anticipate a change in direction for inflation and global interest rates but don t get excited just yet this global inflection point can be as little as a few weeks away or it can be as far away as a number of months taking guidance from the above mentioned global fund managers survey a majority of investors sees the federal reserve lifting its fed funds rate to 4 5 5 from 3 3 25 currently implying there s still more to go if current forecasts are correct for 75bp and 50bp hikes before year end the good news nevertheless is the end of this cycle of interest rate hikes is drawing nearer unless those forecasts need another reset central bankers are all too aware too much tightening might break the system thus if inflation stays higher for longer their first response is likely to leave interest rates higher for longer delaying any loosening as inflation simply cannot be left footloose and free when it comes to the next black swan event bofa s survey suggests investors are most worried about europe and european financials the advent of the next recession usually corresponds with a noticeable reduction in corporate profits yet again if 2022 teaches us anything this process too is a long and drawn out affair up to now corporate profits have started showing various signs of emerging weaknesses but overall corporate profitability has remained remarkably resilient both in australia and in the usa as a matter of fact earnings estimates in australia have recently bucked the trend and started rising again yet another discrepancy a closer look into the finer details shows this unexpected improvement is due to rate hike beneficiaries of banks and other financials combined with resources companies and other cyclicals as well as ongoing benefits for major re opening trade beneficiaries think qantas airways qan airports resorts hotels and the likes there is no debate this is a positive short term however the great unknown remains what happens next analysts at credit suisse put it as follows current eps revisions are reflective of current rather than forward economic conditions credit suisse continues to see a 15 reduction in australian corporate earnings throughout calendar 2023 also highlighting the danger of extrapolating current trends further out when multiple signals are warning about notable economic slowing ahead a warning that also applies to one sector that has found general support from this year s general dynamics australian banks from banking sector analysts at barrenjoey it is often said that it is darkest before dawn but in banking it is also brightest before sunset two weeks ago fy22 results from bank of queensland boq showed a quicker than anticipated margin benefit from rising rates which lit a fuse underneath the sector since analysts have been busy recalibrating their models and share prices have responded positively but is this simply the last hurrah before the reality of next year s slowing economy hits nobody is forecasting a long and deep recession for australia and banks should at the very least be expected to keep their dividends at current level but tougher times usually bring about a lower multiple for the sector which creates a natural headwind a la bond yields for csl metcash and the likes to date incidentally westpac wbc quasi uniformally considered today s weak laggard among the local big four had more bad news to share on monday make of this what you like resources too have been among key beneficiaries thus far in 2022 in particular those sections for which end users seem to have no other option than to pay up for limited supplies a rather sharp division has thus opened up between say aluminium copper crude oil and iron ore on the loser s end and lithium metallurgical coal natural gas and uranium as this year s true market leaders regarding those commodities that have proved more vulnerable to changes in supply demand balances already also including the agricultural sector history shows prices can and likely will pull back deeper which is also why local sector analysts have been cutting forecasts over the weeks past on monday the team of energy sector analysts at rbc capital joined the trend reducing average brent oil forecasts for 2023 and 2024 to us 94 75 bbl and us 88 10 bbl respectively arguably these forecasts do not differ fundamentally from where prices are but rbc s previous forecasts had a significantly higher number in mind for next year but maybe the true message stems from the fact rbc capital is forecasting a multi year bull cycle for commodities while preaching caution for the shorter term as an avid reader of investment research including comments and views on social media i sense there is great belief among investors that commodities a la lithium and met coal are the new defensives that simply cannot fail but not all analysts are equally as confident either way the market will have no hesitation to put the thesis to some serious tests over the months ahead the one exception potentially is natural gas for which the odds seem to favour a very negative outcome for europe in case of a cold winter this spells bad news for the continent and makes escaping a damaging recession sheer impossible but potentially great news for producers the overall index weight of the local energy sector is now approaching 7 the highest percentage of the asx100 in twenty years including the pre gfc super cycle period ongoing rises in bond yields and relatively resilient earnings forecasts have pushed back the share market s average pe multiple to circa 13x this is down from 20x and higher in 2020 and 17 7x late last year the australian share market has seldom appeared as cheap as today with the decade past offering but two precedents the euro crisis of 2012 and early 2020 combine this with extremely negative sentiment and record high cash levels as also revealed by the bofa monthly survey and it is not difficult to see why some are hopeful equities might enjoy their annual santa rally this year judging from recent false starts any relief from bonds and or central banks is likely to be violent and quick as far as equities are concerned with markets worrying later about next year s recessions and corporate profits in case of a definitive change in direction of bond yields investors might keep in mind the gold sector and a reits have both been among key victims of this year s bond market tribulations underlying the need for companies to successfully navigate next year s slowing economies remains all important even if this hasn t proved part of the magic investing formula so far in 2022 conviction calls it appears qantas airways shock announcement in a positive way the previous guidance for the first half will already be achieved in the first quarter was not just a one off company specific event auckland international airport aia has since also raised its guidance

enable the commencement of undercutting and completion of the two stage plant expansion which is now in commissioning we continued to make great progress on our brucejack transformation program and remain relentlessly focused on disciplined capital management as we extend the havieron feasibility study to allow time for further project optimisation with a focus on capital management continued strong operating performance in line with our guidance and a clear pathway to materially increase our already significant copper production in the future i believe newcrest s upside potential will be recognised more broadly as we strive to unlock further value for our shareholders said mr biswas overview gold production was 17 lower than the prior period6 with lower mill throughput across all operations following planned maintenance shutdowns in the september 2022 quarter consistent with prior years gold production was also impacted by lower gold head grade at lihir cadia and brucejack gold and copper production is expected to improve in the december 2022 quarter on lower planned maintenance newcrest s aisc of 1 098 oz2 for the quarter was 23 higher than the prior period driven by lower gold and copper sales volumes with lower production following planned maintenance and a lower realised copper price this was partly offset by the benefit of a weakening australian and canadian dollar against the us dollar on operating costs with a significant proportion of operating costs exposed to the australian and canadian dollars continued weakness of these currencies against the us dollar will favourably impact aisc injury rates decreased in the quarter however the critical incident at brucejack is a reminder of the unwavering focus on safety that must be maintained to ensure everybody goes home safe and healthy every day injury rates were reviewed during the quarter with the previously reported frequency rates at red chris and brucejack restated following an internal

4 08pm tech shares endure tough day us markets ended a volatile session in subdued fashion with the dow jones posting its fourth consecutive day of gains just but with tech stocks under pressure following disappointing results from alphabet and microsoft at the close the djia was up 3 points at 31 840 the s p 500 was down 28 points or 0 74 at 3 831 and the nasdaq composite slipped 228 points or 2 04 to 10 971 after a weak start markets were given a boost by a lower than forecast hike to canadian interest rates which sparked hopes that this could be a trend other central banks may follow central banks are starting to blink said paul kim chief executive officer at simplify etfs in new york it s part of the larger trend and supports the fed pivot narrative the dow at one stage advanced over 300 points but these gains were lost as the session wore on as investors turned their focus to a mixed bag of earnings which highlighted a weak economic backdrop sales of newly constructed us homes plunged in september while mortgage rates hit their highest level in more than two decades adding to the growing pile of data suggesting a softening economic landscape tech stocks bore the brunt of the losses with shares in google parent alphabet down 8 after the tech giant missed expectations while microsoft tumbled 7 after revenue guidance came in below forecasts 12 05pm us markets run mixed midday us indices were mixed at midday with a dovish hike from the bank of canada potentially kicking off a risk rally at noon the s p 500 was up by 0 5 at 3 876 while the nasdaq composite was down by 0 3 at 11 166 and the dow jones rose by 0 9 to 32 112 points michael hewson chief market analyst at cmc markets uk said the bank of canada raised rates by a less than expected 50 basis points to 3 75 in a move that suggests that central banks are starting to wake up to the possibility that too aggressive rate rises could do more harm than good it s also got markets asking the question could the fed follow suit next week after another poor set of housing numbers from the us hewson wrote in a report in reaction both the canadian and american dollars slipped with the greenback sliding in anticipation of the us federal reserve s possible slowing of its interest rate hikes hewson wrote weakness in the us economy does appear to be prompting a reassessment of the size and pace of hikes if recent comments from san francisco fed president mary daly are any guide it will be interesting to see whether any of her colleagues share her concerns in the coming weeks hewson wrote on october 21 daly said the 4 5 to 5 range is likely where the fed would hold interest rates otherwise the fed could find itself over tightening hewson also wrote that crude oil prices have taken a leg higher in the wake of the bank of canada s smaller than expected rate hike at midday the price of west texas intermediate was up by 3 trading at us 88 a barrel the major movers at midday included solar power systems maker enphase energy which was up by 13 8 on beating analyst estimates on 3q earnings of us 1 25 per share universal health services also rose by over 13 pinduoduo was up by 13 and pest control company rollins was up by over 10 a new 52 week high on the downside business services company assurant nyse aiz hit a new 52 week low down by 11 8 along with cloud security firm f5 which fell by 8 and google parent alphabet was down by 6 4 9 35am tech stocks drop on disappointing earnings us stocks opened mixed on wednesday with the tech heavy nasdaq composite in the red as weak earnings from tech giants alphabet and microsoft released after the bell yesterday added to investors ongoing growth concerns just after the market opened the nasdaq had shed 227 points or 2 at 10 978 points and the s p 500 was down 26 points or 0 7 at 3 883 points the dow jones industrial average had added 70 points or 0 2 at 31 907 points forex com market analyst fiona cincotta said disappointing earnings from alphabet and microsoft had unnerved investors pulling the nasdaq sharply lower ad revenue growth has been a worry since snap s earnings last week and alphabet s results have confirmed that no company is immune to the slowdown in digital ad revenue she said meta is due to report after the close and is expected to show ongoing struggles owing to the tough macroeconomic climate growing competition from tik tok and fallout from apple s ad tracker 6 30am wobble after recent gains us stocks were expected to open lower on wednesday dented by disappointing earnings from the likes of computer giant microsoft and alphabet which owns youtube and the popular search engine google futures for the dow jones industrial average were 0 2 lower in pre market trading while those for the s p 500 were down 0 8 and contracts for the nasdaq 100 shed 1 6 investors are continuing to take direction from the performance of big technology companies alphabet said after hours on tuesday that its sales slowed as firms cut their advertising budgets while microsoft noted that demand for its computers and other technology had weakened while wall street closed tuesday s regular session higher the disappointing numbers from alphabet after the closing bell may be acting as something of a catalyst to rein in the recent spate of buying said james hughes chief market analyst at scopemarkets com much of this is stemming from optimism that the federal reserve will now ease off its monetary policy tightening agenda something that yesterday s disappointing consumer confidence figures and that earnings miss from ups both lend credibility to he said looking ahead earnings news once again spans old and new companies alike with boeing ford and meta among the day s higher profile releases said hughes adding the latter will be especially relevant given the challenges seen at alphabet s youtube division on tuesday over recent weeks investors have tended to treat softer economic data as a reason to buy stocks investors are beginning to hope that softer economic data will persuade us rate setters to step back from continuing to hike interest rates aggressively having raised interest rates by three 75 basis points hikes this year as they attempt to head off inflation which remains at around 40 year highs on the data front today the focus will be on us new home sales figures for september due out at 10 00am et which are expected to show a softening yet more dovish tones from fed board members would be no surprise although radio silence here could serve to erode the confidence

would have been spooked there is simply no connection hence the asx200 jumped up 45 points in the first hour on wall street s broader day session strength but when the cpi numbers came out that was the end of that the headline cpi rose 1 8 in the september quarter to a 7 3 annual rate when consensus had 1 6 and 7 0 the core cpi rose 1 8 to 6 1 when consensus had 1 6 and 5 5 the result is economists have reassessed their forecasts there is talk of the rba being forced into another 50 point hike next week but that would belie the intention behind only hiking by 25 this month when 50 was expected more likely economists suggest is the rba will go 25 points both next week and in december to 3 10 thereafter it appears more hikes will be needed anz bank economists for one have lifted their peak rate expectation to 3 85 by may they see higher inflation extending into 2023 due to both the stronger september quarter data and the upside risks ahead given continuing cost pass through flooding a lower aussie and evidence of persistence in inflationary pressures globally in the shorter term 7 3 might have been above expectations but it lies with the trajectory between the august result of 6 8 and the rba s 7 75 year end forecast so is it really that much of a shock not according to the bond market if inflation comes in hot one would expect yields to rise in anticipation of further rba rate hikes yesterday the bond market ignored the local and acted globally in sending the ten year yield down 16 points to 3 91 and the two year down 8 to 3 37 following the us and uk hence disaster was averted real estate rose 2 5 utilities 2 4 industrials 0 9 and discretionary 0 5 the big banks all rose between 0 2 0 5 but financials closed flat due to the offset of medibank private mpl which came back on the boards and fell 18 1 perhaps the biggest surprise was technology which also closed flat materials managed a 0 3 gain as gold miners offset falls in lithium and coal miners energy fell 1 3 despite little movement in oil prices the big loser was defensive star consumer staples 2 4 not only did the cpi come out hot coles col bemoaned inflation at its quarterly update flying in the face was costa group cgc which having taken a hit on its weather beaten update jumped 10 7 yesterday on news private equity has taken a stake it was a two speed market on wall street last night with the nasdaq on its own base metal prices surged in london last night and gold and oil are up and our futures are up 26 points this morning oh canada having reported in tuesday night s aftermarket last night google fell 9 and microsoft 7 all the big tech names were impacted during last night s session including a sympathetic fall of 6 for meta meta has reported this morning and is currently down 15 having already been down 60 from its high i erroneously suggested amazon would report this morning in fact it s tomorrow morning along with apple in other news boeing reported during the session last night and it fell 8 8 the fall in microsoft was worth 125 dow points and boeing 80 so put that into the context of a flat dow close the big surprise last night nevertheless came from north of the border the bank of canada hiked by 50 points it was a surprise because 75 points was widely expected the move brought back memories of the rba only going 25 early this month when 50 was assumed the expectation is becoming greater the fed will soon need to ease off the pace as well once again the us ten year fell sharply down 9 points to 4 01 with the two year down only 2 points it was no help for the nasdaq which was always set to cop a hiding but it s good for everyone else the us dollar plunged another 1 1 all up we had the nasdaq down 2 versus a flat dow and the s p500 splitting the difference to 0 7 things aren t going well in big tech land fang co have led wall street higher for a decade and as late as last year were being called defensive growth stocks not

acquisition of west suburban bancorp inc west suburban on december 1 2021 was 19 6 million or 0 43 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2022 see the discussion entitled non gaap presentations below and the tables beginning on page 17 that provide a reconciliation of each non gaap measure to the most comparable gaap equivalent the increase in net income in the third quarter of 2022 was primarily due to net interest and dividend income of 55 6 million which increased 10 3 million from the second quarter of 2022 primarily due to loan growth and market interest rate increases and increased 33 0 million from the third quarter of 2021 as west suburban loan and securities income net of interest expense on acquired deposits was included in the third quarter of 2022 the third

increase of 10 6 million from the second quarter of 2022 and an increase of 33 2 million from the third quarter 2021 growth in interest and dividend income in 2022 reflected the market interest rate increases in 2022 as well as the inclusion of west suburban loan and securities income interest expense for the third quarter of 2022 was 2 4 million an increase of 314 000 from the second quarter of 2022 and an increase of 266 000 from the third quarter of 2021 the year over year increase in interest expense stems primarily from an increase in interest bearing deposits and the interest paid on short term fhlb advances during the third quarter of 2022 which were partially offset by the pay down of 10 2 million of notes payable and other borrowings we recorded a net provision for credit losses of 4 5 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to a net provision for credit losses of 550 000 in the second quarter of 2022 and a 1 5 million release of provision expense in the third quarter of 2021 the increase in the net provision in the third quarter of 2022 was primarily driven by a 244 3 million increase in total loans growth in credit line utilization as well as consideration given to macroeconomic factors such as rising market interest rates inflation and changes in the unemployment rate noninterest income was 11 5 million for the third quarter of 2022 an increase of 2 3 million or 24 8 compared to 9 2 million for the second quarter of 2022 and an increase of 2 2 million or 23 1 compared to 9 3 million for the third quarter of 2021 the increase from the prior quarter was primarily due to an increase in net mortgage banking income of 1 1 million as well as a 1 2 million increase in other income due to a gain on a visa portfolio sale and a gain on the sale of a land trust portfolio service charges on deposits increased for the third quarter of 2022 by 333 000 compared to the prior quarter and increased by 1 3 million compared to the third quarter of 2021 card related income in the third quarter of 2022 was 2 7 million a decrease of 314 000 from the second quarter 2022 and an increase of 1 0 million over the third quarter 2021 these increases in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021 were partially offset by a decrease in net mortgage banking income of 1 1 million primarily due to a decline in the volume of mortgages being originated due to rising market interest rates in 2022 noninterest expense was 36 0 million for the third quarter of 2022 a decrease of 1 3 million or 3 4 compared to 37 2 million for the second quarter of 2022 and an increase of 13 9 million or 62 6 compared to 22 1 million for the third quarter of 2021 the decrease from the second quarter of 2022 is the result of a decline in conversion related data processing fees as well as a reduction in salary and employee benefit expense partially offset by higher occupancy furniture and equipment expense and card related expenses contributing to the year over year increase was 650 000 of acquisition costs in the third quarter of 2022 primarily in data processing and other expense as well as a 411 000 net loss on branch sales in addition growth in salaries and employee benefits and occupancy furniture and equipment expenses were recorded in the third quarter of 2022 primarily stemming from the additional employees and branches due to the west suburban acquisition as well as higher salary rates being paid in 2022 we had a provision for income tax of 7 1 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to a provision for income tax of 4 4 million for the second quarter of 2022 and a provision for income tax of 2 9 million for the third quarter of 2021 the increase in tax expense for the third quarter of 2022 over both prior periods was due to an increase in pre tax income on october 18 2022 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0 05 per share payable on november 7 2022 to stockholders of record as of october 28 2022 president and chief executive officer jim eccher said we are extremely pleased with our results this quarter our net interest margin is approaching four percent loan balances are up 13 year to date through september 30 2022 deposit trends are performing as expected and operating expenses remain well controlled our efficiency ratio in the third quarter was approximately 52 on a core basis and reflects not only the cost saves from our most recent acquisition but also tremendous success in realizing returns on the investments in lending teams and sales people over the last twelve months credit remains very well behaved though we remain mindful and diligent in monitoring trends both within the portfolio and more broadly third quarter return on average assets and return on average equity were 1 29 and 16 7 respectively and represent a return to the type of performance we had been accustomed prior to the pandemic the return of relatively higher market interest rates has allowed us the opportunity to demonstrate the strength of the franchise that we are building here at old second asset repricing should remain robust in the coming quarters which will allow for further improvement in our core trends including additional expansion in the net interest margin deposit repricing is expected to remain excellent but will be modestly higher in the near future as we take the necessary steps to protect our greatest strength the speed of interest rate changes this year does pose certain challenges as demonstrated by the unrealized loss position of our securities portfolio however we believe we have been extremely cautious and managed the risk relatively well we remain invested at the short end of the yield curve with a weighted average portfolio duration at september 30th of 2 65 years we currently estimate that approximately half of the current loss position will have reversed in that time assuming the current yield curve remains consistent and spreads in the market persist i am hopeful that we will begin delivering book value growth commensurate with our financial performance in the near future we are excited for the future and believe we have the resources and momentum to focus on growth and building a better old second for our stockholders and communities capital ratios 1amounts are shown inclusive of a capital conservation buffer of 2 50 2

interest rate increases as well as changes year over year in the composition of the securities portfolio non gaap presentations management has disclosed in this earnings release certain non gaap financial measures to evaluate and measure our performance including the presentation of adjusted net income net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis and our efficiency ratio calculations on a taxable equivalent basis the net interest margin fully taxable equivalent is calculated by dividing net interest income on a tax equivalent basis by average earning assets for the period consistent with industry practice management has disclosed the efficiency ratio including and excluding certain items which is discussed in the noninterest expense presentation on page 7 we consider the use of select non gaap financial measures and ratios to be useful for financial and operational decision making and useful in evaluating period to period comparisons we believe that these non gaap financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenditures or assets that we believe are not indicative of our primary business operating results or by presenting certain metrics on a fully taxable equivalent basis we believe these measures provide investors with information regarding balance sheet profitability and we believe that management and investors benefit from referring to these non gaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting analyzing and comparing past present and future periods these non gaap financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for gaap financial measures and we strongly encourage investors to review the gaap financial measures included in this earnings release and not to place undue reliance upon any single financial measure in addition because non gaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare the non gaap financial measures presented in this earnings release with other companies non gaap financial measures having the same or similar names the tables beginning on page

almost a year until experts say the federal government will hit its borrowing limit which gives congress plenty of time to avert a default experts say a pledge by the gop to use the debt ceiling as leverage if they take a chamber of congress could lead to a partisan clash with devastating effects should the government default democrats already have a packed agenda to finish off in the few remaining weeks of the year giving president biden s party little time to push through another debt ceiling increase and only the lengthy and complicated budget reconciliation process allows democrats

houston tx accesswire october 26 2022 patterson uti energy inc nasdaq pten today reported financial results for the quarter ended september 30 2022 the company reported net income of 61 5 million or 0 28 per share for the third quarter of 2022 compared to net income of 21 9 million or 0 10 per share for the second quarter of 2022 revenues for the third quarter of 2022 were 728 million compared to 622 million for the second quarter of 2022 andy hendricks patterson uti s chief executive officer stated we are proud to report another quarter of solid financial results with significantly increasing profitability we remain focused on generating returns on our invested capital while maintaining the high level of service quality and technology enhancements that customers expect from patterson uti as our profitability continues to improve we are increasing our forecast for 2022 consolidated adjusted ebitda to more than 650 million we are also increasing our 2022 capex forecast to approximately 425 million due primarily to the acceleration of customer funded rig upgrades for delivery in 2023 and an opportunistic acquisition of additional pumps with tier 4 engines to increase the quality of our fleet and potentially contribute to the activation of a 13th frac spread in 2023 mr hendricks continued for the third quarter our average rig count in the united states increased by seven rigs to 128 rigs across the industry rig demand remains strong and our rig count continues to grow for the fourth quarter we expect our rig count in the united states will average 132 rigs contract drilling revenues and margins improved during the third quarter as leading edge dayrates continued to strengthen and we benefited from contract renewals with more favorable pricing in the united states during the third quarter average rig revenue per day increased by 2 770 to 28 670 average rig operating cost per day in the united states increased by 1 690 to 18 200 during the third quarter due in part to wage increases for both rig based and support personnel as well as general cost inflation for repairs and maintenance average adjusted rig margin per day in the united states increased by 1 080 to 10 470 for the third quarter as of september 30 2022 we had term contracts for drilling rigs in the united states providing for future dayrate drilling revenue of approximately 710 million up from 440 million at june 30 2022 based on contracts currently in place in the united states we expect an average of 81 rigs operating under term contracts during the fourth quarter and an average of 56 rigs operating under term contracts during the four quarters ending september 30 2023 in pressure pumping revenues and margins improved as our active spreads were highly utilized and we obtained better pricing pressure pumping revenues increased 21 sequentially to 288 million for the third quarter and adjusted gross margin increased 62 sequentially to 76 0 million the strong financial results for the third quarter validate the efforts of our pressure pumping team to increase the operational efficiency of the organization while reducing the overall cost structure these efforts have resulted in strong financial returns and adjusted ebitda per spread recently we completed an opportunistic acquisition of 35 500 frac horsepower with tier 4 engines which allows us to upgrade existing spreads as well as to possibly activate a 13th spread in 2023 in directional drilling increased pricing and activity resulted in sequentially higher revenues and margins during the third quarter directional drilling revenues improved to 58 9 million in the third quarter from 54 8 million in the second quarter and adjusted gross margin improved to 10 4 million from 9 4 million mr hendricks concluded patterson uti has a strong history of returning cash to shareholders having returned more than 1 billion since 2012 through dividends and share repurchases we expect the contract drilling market to be much less capital intensive than prior cycles as the major re tooling of our drilling rig fleet is complete we believe this lower capital intensity combined with our strong balance sheet and increasing cash flow visibility from term contracts positions us well to continue returning capital to shareholders as we look forward we are targeting to return 50 of free cash flow defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures to shareholders through dividends and buybacks as such i am pleased to announce that our board of directors has doubled our quarterly cash dividend to 0 08 per share and increased our share repurchase authorization to 300 million the dividend will be payable on december 15 2022 to holders of record as of december 1 2022 the shareholder

off the alder and the berry bushes wilt i start thinking about chowder fall reminds me of cupping my hands around a bowl of warm halibut chowder and dipping in a cranberry fritter though i make a variety of chowders all year long eating a steaming bowl of chowder is one way to celebrate fall in fact one of my dad s favorite foods is clam chowder though he s come to love all the variations i ve made it s all good i make halibut chowder shrimp chowder salmon chowder and more and if i m not in the mood for seafood which is rare i make chicken corn chowder the word chowder has its origin from

if you have experience making chowder it ll make you hungry hopefully you ll be inspired to make different types of chowder and use local ingredients the first thing to know is that making chowder is about timing and sequence so prep your vegetables potatoes seafood and bacon beforehand also decide beforehand which kind of broth will be the base chicken broth works and so does fish or bone broth

cooked pour the contents into a strainer straining the grease into another small pot so you can save the grease i use the bacon grease for lightly sauteing the halibut or scallops or whatever you re going to use halibut chowder at mickey s fishcamp in wrangell vivian faith prescott for the capital city weekly chowder tip if the seafood is smoked or salted add your seasoning after you ve added the fish so the chowder won t be too salty next scoop the crisp bacon pieces onion and celery into a large cast iron pot or other large pot then add a few cups of chicken or fish stock to the pot and turn your burner on low mixing chicken bouillon and water works as a broth base too add a cup or two of water to the pot until you have enough broth to cook the potatoes for the potatoes i use yukon gold potatoes from the garden but you can also buy them i ve used all types of potatoes usually whatever s on hand sometimes i substitute yams or sweet potatoes for the regular potatoes chop about six to eight potatoes into small to medium bite sized squares and add them to the simmering pot simmer on low if you need the time to make biscuits to go with your chowder otherwise use medium low heat and start cooking the potatoes chowder tip you can add two different types of potatoes in a single batch of chowder next lightly sauté small chunks of halibut or whatever seafood in a few tablespoons of the bacon grease remember if your fish is already smoked and cooked you can skip this step you ll be adding the smoked salmon or hooligan to the pot when your potatoes are almost cooked through i sauté the seafood just enough to let the bacon grease and whatever spices i might add like garlic and pepper seep into the meat it ll finish cooking in the hot chowder you don t want to overcook your seafood crab and scallops can be easily overcooked so add those seafood types to the pot of chowder after the potatoes and vegetables are done cooking in the broth chowder tip make seafood chowder using a couple different types of seafood in a single pot as for the vegetables i sneak them into my chowder for finicky kids or elders it s about being creative some suggestions are celery broccoli carrots red peppers and green onions my elder dad who lives with me hates vegetables or so he says after he declares how much he hates vegetables i remind him we just had scallop chowder and it contained carrots zucchini and kale well i like that he says i remind him we also had halibut enchiladas or halibut pizza with spinach and zucchini he likes that too he says so maybe he does like vegetables just not as a side dish mitchell mickey prescott gives two thumbs up for chowder with vegetables vivian faith prescott for the capital city weekly you can add your vegetables at several stages it s up to the cook sauté them lightly with the bacon and onions or add them in before the potatoes are done if you like firmer vegetables then add them after the potatoes are cooked chowder tip you can chop your vegetables small or large or somewhere in between experiment with making larger chopped vegetable chunks like you would make deer stew seasoning your chowder is important local seaweeds go well in seafood chowders chop red seaweed sea lettuce beach asparagus or goose tongue even small newly bloomed buds of popweed i ve added blanched fiddleheads and devil s club tips to chowder chowder tip a few chopped spruce tips add flavor to your fish chowder or dumplings vegetables seaweed spruce tips and halibut ingredients for chowder vivian faith prescott for the capital city weekly for additional flavor i sometimes cut up a small butternut squash and boil it until soft then puree it in a blender i mix the puree into the broth after the potatoes are cooked after it s mixed thoroughly then i add the coconut milk to the pot i use coconut milk in my chowders because canned milk is too rich though i grew up on homemade clam chowder made with evaporated milk when you re making chowder don t add the milk until all the vegetable and potatoes have softened slightly this prevents curdling or overcooking i use one can of concentrated coconut milk though i ve used boxed coconut almond milk blended milk make sure your coconut or almond milk is unsweetened or isn t the vanilla flavor if you like your chowder thick which my dad does then make what s called a roux which is a paste use a small mason jar and fill half of it with water then take several forkfuls of flour and mix it one forkful at a time into the glass jar until you have a thick paste add the paste to the chowder after the milk is added but before adding any dumplings stir until the chowder thickens a bit sometimes i use cornstarch and water mixed in a jar to make a slurry for thickening the chowder this photo shows a bowl of smoked salmon chowder vivian faith prescott for the capital city weekly and lastly i typically make dumplings biscuits or fritters to go with the chowder you can make fry bread too but if you don t have time get out the pilot bread or a pack of saltines dumplings are made from small scoops of dough plopped on top of boiling chowder and cooked uncovered for ten minutes and then covered to cook for another ten minutes i sometimes make baking powder biscuits a simple biscuit recipe can be livened up by folding in a handful of lingonberries lowbush cranberries or blueberries into your biscuit or fritter batter no sugar added if you re going to make fritters there s a wide range of ideas i make halibut corn chowder with cornmeal fritters if you like spicy add cumin and red pepper flakes finally before serving the chowder top the chowder with any shredded cheese you have on hand plus a dollop of plain yogurt or sour cream chowder tip chowder is often better the second day any leftover chowder can be thickened and folded into a crust to make a pot pie
the surface transportation board stb in october 2022 sought public comment on a new report that identifies and evaluates alternatives to the uniform railroad costing system urcs that could be used as a replacement general purpose costing methodology the association of american railroads aar and the western coal traffic league wctl respond stb uses urcs for a variety of regulatory functions urcs is implemented in rate reasonableness proceedings as part of the initial market dominance determination at later stages it is used in parts of the stb s determination as to whether the challenged rate is reasonable and when warranted the maximum rate prescription among urcs s other uses to develop variable costs for making cost determinations in abandonment proceedings to provide the railroad industry and shippers with a standardized costing model to cost the stb s carload waybill sample to develop industry cost information and to provide interested parties with basic cost information regarding railroad industry operations urcs is an accounting allocation method using class i railroad data as reported annually to the stb explains railway age capitol hill contributing editor frank n wilner a former white house appointed chief of staff at the stb and during two decades at the association of american railroads was assistant vice president for policy urcs was developed by stb predecessor interstate commerce commission in 1978 and adopted for use in 1989 urcs replaced rail form a an accounting allocation system in use since 1939 that contained elements dating to 1907 urcs however was developed using now antique mainframe computers with low processing speeds and although it was given updates in 1993 2009 and 2011 its reliability is questionable a 2015 transportation research board report modernizing freight rail regulation characterized urcs as a cost allocation scheme that has no economic foundation in an aug 9 2019 online article for railway age urcs love it or hate it we re stuck with it former stb chief economist william f huneke compared urcs to a classic car lacking modern gps and satellite radio built in averages from a time when railroads rather than shippers owned most of the freight car fleet and line hauls were shorter as the modern merger movement had not yet run its course a key gripe of shippers is stb s prior refusal to allow movement specific adjustments to system average urcs costs stb in 2020 commissioned laurits r christensen associates inc to perform a study and write a report to identify and evaluate alternatives to urcs the stb reported in an oct 26 federal register notice for more on the commissioning process read stb moves to rehab antique urcs according to wilner it is a follow up on a 2008 christensen report a study of competition in the u s freight railroad industry and analysis of proposals that might enhance competition which said do not appear to be excessive from a financial market perspective the railroad industry is pricing at levels generating earnings that maintain or slightly exceed those necessary to ensure financial viability implies that there is little room to provide significant rate relief to certain groups of shippers without requiring increases in rates for other shippers or threatening the railroads financial viability alternatives to urcs in its new 203 page report download below christensen evaluated alternatives to urcs that could better or more efficiently reflect the operating environment of the modern railroad industry the project focused on costing methodologies that could be used as replacements or major structural updates to urcs to generate movement specific variable costs for regulatory purposes according to christensen the project assessed the economic cost measure s that urcs or a successor cost system should represent given the regulatory applications of urcs identified economic assumptions under which urcs or successor cost systems produce economically appropriate measures of costs for railroad movements evaluated whether alternative costing methodologies and structural updates to urcs could generate economically valid railroad variable costs for regulatory purposes implemented urcs alternatives and updates and compared model costs and revenue to variable cost r vc ratios to current methodology urcs quantified the effects of urcs alternatives and updates on the application of the surface transportation board s jurisdictional threshold for market dominance determinations considered advantages and disadvantages of urcs alternative and updated approaches including the ability to reflect current railroad operations and adherence to the costing principles in the railroad accounting principles board rapb final report based on the project s analysis christensen reported reaching the following main conclusions short run economic costs marginal and incremental costs are appropriate for the statutory application of urcs urcs and similarly structured models can produce short run economic costs for railroad movements but urcs costs depend materially on input values based on stale analyses and non empirical assumptions using carload waybill sample cws data to reveal movement cost information has promise but also practical and theoretical challenges urcs variability inputs can and should be updated but limitations of the r 1 annual report data may merit consideration of changes to cost reporting requirements the hybrid model is a feasible alternative for costing class i movements and its costs generally are plausible where different from legacy urcs updates to urcs phases i and iii can improve movement costing largely within the existing urcs framework both the hybrid alternative and urcs update approaches have merit with the key tradeoffs related to the validity of the hybrid s use of neio regression models to measure movement specific costs implementing either the hybrid model or a significant urcs update will materially affect application of the stb s statutory jurisdictional threshold the deadline for public comment was feb 23 2023 stb noted in the october 2022 federal register notice that it has not made any determinations on whether it will propose changes to its general purpose costing system additionally iven the preliminary and exploratory nature of this request for comments the board will not release supporting materials such as the confidential carload waybill sample data or underlying workpapers developed by christensen associates at this time should the board move forward with a proposal to modify its general purpose costing system a further opportunity for comment will be provided aar responds following its comments submitted by the feb 23 2023 deadline aar on may 24 wrote in an stb filing download below that the board should reject consideration of the hybrid model as an alternative to urcs as it is inappropriate for railroad costing it outlined the following reasons which also address comments filed by wctl and the american petroleum institute api the hybrid alternative approach is a flawed model that is inappropriate for railroad costing according to aar the christensen report did not conduct any updated empirical studies or solicit full input from current stakeholders and acknowledges that if the board were to pursue an alternative e g hybrid model or otherwise update urcs there remains substantial study to be undertaken and stakeholder involvement to be secured aar also pointed out that the report s focus on an alternative hybrid model that combines results from its new empirical industry organization neio revenue analysis with marginal cost estimates from an econometric cost analysis relies on the incorrect conclusion that short run or marginal costs are the appropriate standard for a regulatory costing model in addition the approaches are unable to disentangle costs from the effects of market markup factors on rates which is significant given that railroads price differentially in combination these two flaws prove fatal to the proposed hybrid model additionally the report aar said incorrectly focuses on the elimination of step functions while the proper use of step functions may merit additional study the step function in urcs between through train and unit train costing has a solid logical foundation finally aar noted that the report offers a flawed analysis of urcs regressions due to a misunderstanding of the industry according to aar the christensen report did not conduct any updated empirical studies or solicit full input from current stakeholders and acknowledges that if the board were to pursue an alternative e g hybrid model or otherwise update urcs there remains substantial study to be undertaken and

study the step function in urcs between through train and unit train costing has a solid logical foundation finally aar noted that the report offers a flawed analysis of urcs regressions due to a misunderstanding of the industry wctl supports the results of the hybrid model but offers little in support of the hybrid model beyond collateral attacks on the present system aar reported that wctl in its comments urges the board to explore further the hybrid model discussed in the report while acknowledging that its analysis of the model has been frustrated by the board s determination not to make available the underlying workpapers and data wctl nonetheless offers its support for certain aspects of the hybrid model specifically wctl expresses interest in updating the urcs phase i variabilities in order to reduce the rate level at the statutory rate floor for shipments subject to the board s jurisdiction increasing the share of traffic with rates above the jurisdictional threshold aar said that if the stb is going to proceed with updating urcs it should not base that update on a desire to increase or decrease the amount of traffic subject to board jurisdiction rather any revision should be undertaken in light of the statutory goal to ensure the availability of accurate cost information in regulatory proceedings and based on a thorough understanding of the model which no party has here given the board s decision not to provide underlying workpapers and data aar reported that wctl in its comments urges the board to explore further the hybrid model discussed in

workpapers and data api acknowledges the flaws of the hybrid model in its comments api argues that the urcs model should be replaced according to aar however even as api shares its support for the hybrid model advanced by christensen associates it acknowledges that it is flawed for example api recognizes that the report suggests that the hybrid model is not totally aligned with the data integrity principle further api recognizes the hybrid model s limited ability to cost movements by class ii and class iii railroads as well as its limited ability to distinguish commodity specific effects on costs thus api concludes that while the hybrid model is the better of the two options there may be room for improvement wctl weighs in because there is merit to some of the alternatives proposed for urcs in the christensen report the stb should move forward with a proposal to modify its general purpose costing system wctl wrote in its may 24 filing download below economists thomas d crowley and robert d mulholland of l e peabody associates inc provided testimony on the report on the league s behalf in comments submitted to the stb in february they supported many of the findings conclusions and urcs recommendations that the report put forward in wctl s may 24 filing the two economists provided reply testimony in response to the comments submitted by the aar and bnsf in february crowley and mulholland concluded the freight railroad industry has evolved from an inefficient patchwork of regional rail systems in the 1970s and 1980s to the lean and highly concentrated market that exists today the once aspirational goal of revenue adequacy is now a reality for the six 6 remaining class i railroads this evolution was made possible in large part due to laws and regulations that enable the railroads to employ differential pricing and extract supra competitive rates on captive shipments the christensen report concludes that the decades old inputs that urcs uses to determine the extent to which costs vary with output in urcs phase i do not reflect the economics of the modern freight rail industry the christensen report authors further conclude that updating urcs phase i variabilities applicable to capital costs under their preferred alternative would reduce urcs variable costs across the board in the absence of any other adjustments this would reduce the rate level at the statutory rate floor for shipments subject to the board s jurisdiction increasing the share of traffic with rates above the jurisdictional threshold a result that aligns with the current environment in which the freight railroads have demonstrated an ability to consistently achieve revenue adequacy despite the good financial health of the industry the board has not yet developed a framework for implementing a revenue adequacy constraint on rates so captive shippers maximum lawful rates remain inextricably linked to the regulatory cost of providing service as measured by urcs not surprisingly the railroads offered several proposed changes to urcs which would either 1 increase urcs costs across the board e g increase default variabilities and use replacement cost to calculate a railroad s variable road property costs or 2 reallocate regulatory costs from exempt traffic groups intermodal to regulated traffic groups carload and unit train bnsf proposes to do away with cost based economic regulation altogether based on a misplaced argument that the railroads need freedom to innovate and cut costs in order to compete with other modes for exempt traffic without fear of limiting the profit that they can extract from captive shippers class i railroads now earn adequate revenues by the board s standards and this was made possible over the long term through outsized contributions the railroads are permitted to earn on captive shipments under the regulatory framework changes to urcs that are designed to elevate regulatory costs and the commensurate profits railroads can generate on captive shipments would perversely increase the level of permissible contribution on regulated traffic just as the need for differential pricing is waning

companies concerns rise on digital advertising as economic outlook deteriorate the morning news round was dominated by the revelation that google parent alphabet us googl had registered third quarter revenue of 69bn up 6 per cent year on year but lower than analyst estimates of 70 9bn that s hardly a disaster on the face of it but the main problem centred on advertising revenue at youtube which contracted for the first time since the company started reporting youtube earnings separately the dominant online advertisers are relatively well insulated from any fall off in advertising volumes as macroeconomic problems mount at least compared to print but platforms like youtube aren t immune to the wider economic malaise and it has become a more competitive corner of the digital market since

a sign on a shelter reads unconditional housing for all end the sweeps as city of seattle workers remove tents trash and personal belongings from a stretch of sidewalk across from city hall on march 9 2022 clausen is an author and professor at the university of san diego he lives in escondido i sympathize with those who are concerned about the burgeoning homeless population in our nation s cities however blaming the homeless for being homeless often assigns blame to the wrong people the ceos at interfaith services and father joe s village both of which deal directly with the homeless have stated that their experiences taught them that homelessness is not a willful decision people make to avoid productive lifestyles on the contrary leaders at both nonprofit organizations attribute the homelessness crisis primarily to economics advertisement in february 2019 financial journalist andrew keshner published an article titled america s 1 hasn t had this much wealth since just before the great depression the subtitle states a new study puts wealth inequality in a historical and perhaps worrying perspective since the article was published the nation s homeless population has increased substantially the coronavirus pandemic accounts for some of this but income inequality is still a major factor signs of income inequality are evident everywhere jeff bezos net worth is estimated in the multibillions but the average amazon driver s salary was recently estimated to be 34 000 to 50 000 hardly enough to keep families housed in many american cities employees in chain stores like walmart are among the most poorly paid members of the working class even though the walton family has a combined net worth of more than 200 billion according to the bloomberg billionaires index this while walmart employees earn an average yearly salary of 31 618 and others in positions such as stock clerk earn an average salary of 27 476 per year according to research by carter c price and kathryn edwards of the rand corp inequality in taxable income has increased substantially over the last four decades thus transferring 50 trillion out of the poor and middle class and into the pockets of the wealthy today wall street and other wealthy individuals are also buying up homes and apartments inevitably raising prices and making housing even more unaffordable this is not the first time america has encountered a homelessness crisis created by huge disparities in wealth income inequality today is the highest it has been since 1929 when the stock market crashed and the great depression gradually crushed the lower classes eventually an increasing number of americans were forced to live in encampments known as hoovervilles i remember the stories my father and his generation told about these displaced farmers they drove horse drawn wagons containing everything they owned down dirt roads without any real destination in mind most of them had lost their farms to droughts or unscrupulous financial institutions they often stopped to beg for food from the remaining farmers who managed to maintain ownership of their farms although many of them would eventually join the ranks of the 1930s era homeless entire trainloads of displaced workers crowded into railroad boxcars to journey to cities seeking employment when employment was unavailable they too joined the urban homeless of the 1930s as i worked to recreate those depression era hardships in a 1999 book titled prairie son i studied photographs and researched these displaced families like today s homeless they sheltered in cities under homemade encampments constructed out of improvised building materials they too were often threatened and under attack by 2012 i began to see similar signs on the streets of san diego like their predecessors in the 1930s these homeless were displaced primarily by economic factors often caused by human greed there were also growing signs of violence directed against the homeless the san diego union tribune had many accounts of homeless people who were badly beaten stabbed and even set on fire after reading these accounts i decided to learn more about the area homeless and how they lived at first i was hesitant to approach them i had heard too many stories about the violence that existed in the homeless camps i met some who were clearly mentally ill and probably capable of hurting themselves or others however as interfaith services and father joe s village reported i learned that most of the homeless were displaced by economic factors beyond their control i eventually connected those stories to my other writing projects that discussed homelessness and poverty in the context of history and even biblical prophecies this included christ s message in the new testament regarding the fate of the poor blessed are you who are poor for yours is the kingdom of god blessed are you who are hungry now for you will be filled yes there are several factors that need to change if we are to effectively address our current homelessness crisis but a good place to start is to consider building a more equitable society
in faith or business david greene has always known who s truly the boss the 80 year old founder and ceo of hobby lobby the world s largest privately owned arts and crafts retailer is as unassuming as he is successful in just a few short decades he s seen his company grow from a 600 startup to an 8 billion behemoth drawing not from get rich quick self help books but from the pages of scripture his new book leadership not by the book 12 unconventional principles to drive incredible results co written with longtime collaborator bill high shares a dozen core ideas that drive green and the divinely inspired mission of hobby lobby which gives away over half of its annual profit to fund gospel initiatives all over the world get our latest news for free subscribe to get daily weekly email with the top stories plus special offers from the christian post be the first to know subscribe in an interview with the christian post greene said for all his success he sees himself not as some high powered ceo but as a merchant who god has given that gift to be a merchant growing up as the son of a pastor in altus oklahoma green said there was a point early in his life when he wondered why god hadn t called him into ministry like his five siblings who are all either pastors or pastors wives but in time the lord just worked with me that i know for a fact that i have been gifted to be anointed even in what god has gifted me to do he said i enjoy being a merchant and i know that s where god would have me be it might be tempting to see the success of hobby lobby as preordained but green isn t shy about sharing some early headwinds he and his wife barbara faced in the chain s early days he recalled the mid 1980s in oklahoma during an oil bust that green described as a very very difficult time where he nearly lost the business i was not where god wanted me in terms of my pride he said in leadership by the book green recalled how during that time he overextended hobby lobby when he bought inventory on credit assuming the money would keep rolling in when the economy finally tanked green said he had nowhere to go but god i found myself literally physically under my desk day in and day out just asking god for forgiveness and for direction to go into the future he said i know that god used that time just to bring us to a point where we know that anything we do that s successful is because of him ultimately hobby lobby s fortunes turned around but green said god used that hardship to teach him an unforgettable lesson god brought us through that and i m thankful for that and i always want to remember that we can t without the lord and so i want to walk with him he said it wouldn t be the last time green said that god answered prayer in the early days of the covid 19 pandemic when not unlike most other businesses throughout the world hobby lobby closed its doors green said he wondered how the company could cover its roughly 40 million in monthly rent where are we gonna get it cause there s nothing coming in green recalled adding he and barbara would get on their knees and ask god to help us to survive and once again god was faithful green said 2021 actually proved to be the biggest year ever for hobby lobby with gains that green said would typically take three years god brought us through that and so we thank him for that he said but we also believe prayer had a lot to do with that decades later hobby lobby has grown to nearly 1 000 stores with over 43 000 employees operating in 47 states and stewardship is still top of mind for green who through various foundations he supports has helped the distribution of over 1 5 billion copies of gospel literature in over 100 countries across africa and asia we want to be as successful as we can to do as much as we can in terms of the giving that we are able to do so that s very very important to us he said we really don t apologize for making a profit that s done with integrity but at what point is there not enough profit at what point is there not enough ministry there s an awful lot that we can do that just doesn t matter a hundred years from now so we think in those terms and we want to make sure what we re doing is going to matter for eternity that includes projects like the museum of the bible in washington d c a 500 million 430 000 square foot museum dedicated to the history and impact of the scriptures that has also been the source of some controversy for the green family green acknowledged he and his son steve green the chairman of the board of museum of the bible made some mistakes in acquiring ancient manuscripts and approximately 45 000 other antiquities we didn t know in advance we were going to have a project of that size we were just buying antiquities he said despite such setbacks green has never been shy about prioritizing stewardship both at hobby lobby and in the green family with an estimated net worth of about 13 billion green said it really is about having a biblical perspective on money even sometimes christian businessmen will say god owns it but then if you follow what they re doing with it it doesn t look that way because maybe they ve got a fourth home a fifth home and just on and on and on buying more and more stuff he said i think it means that when we decide that it s not ours we re not wealthy so i don t see myself as wealthy because i have nothing that belongs to me i see it that this is what god has given us to steward for green one of the key moments for him came when he asked himself what are we going to do with this wealth and how are we going to not mess our kids up in order to help guide him through that process green asked other christians to come alongside and help his family with practical things like saving on taxes and passing his wealth down to his children with 17 great grandchildren and two more on the way green didn t ever want them to have to sort through what it means to live with generational wealth to be honest with you i was making my great grandkids millionaires before they were born so i really didn t want to affect my family with wealth because in wealth it s a curse wealth is a curse if it s yours but if it s god s it can be of great benefit last week green announced in a fox news piece that 100 of hobby lobby s voting stock has been moved to a trust bucking advice from attorneys and accountants to pass down ownership to his children and grandchildren it didn t seem fair to me that i might change or even ruin the future of grandchildren who had not even been born yet wrote green

important indicators of how paypal was performing but as the paypal class action lawsuit alleges while touting its nna growth paypal failed to disclose that many of the additional users acquired through its cash account creation incentive campaigns were illusory because those incentive campaigns were easily susceptible to fraud specifically paypal failed to disclose that its cash incentive campaigns significantly increased paypal s susceptibility to bot farms that were able to systematically take advantage of paypal s 10 00 account opening by creating millions of illegitimate accounts which ultimately generated no future revenue for paypal in addition the paypal class action lawsuit alleges that investors were unaware of the lengths paypal was going to keep inactive customers and fake bot accounts on the platform to prevent churn and inflate its nna guidance which would have provided a more realistic view of the true demand for paypal s platform on february 1 2022 paypal revealed that its nnas were only 49 million for 2021 less than the guidance of 50 million it initially provided in february 2021 in doing so paypal admitted that in connection with the increased use

strategies including incentive led campaigns in the fourth quarter further because paypal was evolving its customer acquisition and engagement strategy paypal now expected only 15 20 million net new

antisemitism it damaged the adidas brand as well as the effort to thwart antisemitism not taking immediate action only allows conspiracies about jews to metastasize if these antisemites actually face consequences for their bigotry they call it proof of jewish power adidas had put its relationship with ye under review on oct 6 following the performer s public criticism of the german company for allegedly not giving him enough control over his yeezy line of shoes and clothes which the sportswear business has called its most successful collaboration the next day for no apparent reason ye took to social media to lash out at jews and over the following week accused them repeatedly of controlling the music industry and threatened to go death con 3 on jewish people instagram and twitter took down some of his posts and restricted his accounts but throngs of followers had already seen what he had to say he has at least twice as many followers as the global jewish population of 15 million in the ensuing days numerous businesses dropped him including balenciaga foot locker and talent agency caa ye and gap parted ways last month and the company removed the last of its stock of his yeezy line on tuesday but adidas sat on its hands despite being his most prominent vehicle it s the company that made him a billionaire and is responsible for the vast majority of his wealth according to forbes it was a test case to see whether corporations are willing to take strong stances that can do real damage to the bottom line of a hatemonger but also their own as a result calls for a boycott trended on social media with the anti defamation league launching a campaign to pressure adidas to runawayfromhate well known figures in entertainment media and politics jewish and non jewish spoke out including actresses kat dennings and valerie bertinelli donald trump impeachment witness lt col alexander vindman and former msnbc host keith olbermann as the new york times dealbook noted adidas stock dropped 23 percent over the past month as ye s erratic behavior drew criticism the company said it took the step of breaking with ye after a thorough review its actions at this late date suggest it was motivated more by money than principle if the company had acted more quickly it might have avoided this perception and either way it would have done more to nip antisemitic conspiracy theories in the bud jew hatred comes in many forms one of the most common revolves around an imaginary reality antisemites say that jews secretly control everything media government banks you name it and cause all the world s problems if these antisemites actually face consequences for their bigotry they call it proof of jewish power as the atlantic s yair rosenberg explained it s a self fulfilling conspiracy theory that provides its own evidence and can never be falsified in the mind of the anti semite in a series of interviews this month ye expressed this philosophy in one with fox news tucker carlson he said some things that were so extreme they weren t even aired despite carlson having his own disturbing record of antisemitism some removed clips were later leaked to vice which explained that ye offered up a mishmash of conspiracy theories including the ideas that non black jewish people aren t really jewish and that jews control the financial system throughout ye portrayed himself as a freedom fighter thereby completing the conspiracy theory cycle by declaring himself the man standing up to those imaginary all powerful jews meanwhile not a word from adidas crickets an adidas director was one of those who publicly called out the company for this silence ye for his part bragged on a podcast i can literally say antisemitic s and they cannot drop me six days after that the company finally did it s better that adidas did this late than never yes but the delay fuels the antisemitic narrative by suggesting adidas took this step reluctantly and only under pressure that leaves the door open to the idea that behind the scenes machinations and calculations were at play feeding antisemites belief that it s only when jewish people pull strings that anything is done as a company with its own nazi history adidas had every reason to know the dangers of letting antisemitism grow and fester rabbi abraham cooper director of global social action at the simon wiesenthal center which fights antisemitism told me he agrees that adidas lack of immediate action had this effect also he said faster action and condemnation from even more people including elected officials could have sent an unmistakable message to ye you crossed the line you sowed and so now you will reap perhaps he would have stopped before going over the cliff in the meantime some hate groups used ye s rhetoric to fuel their efforts a nazi group on saturday hung a banner over a los angeles freeway reading kanye is right about the jews antisemitism is growing rapidly inspiring violent deadly attacks in the united states and across the globe according to the adl they reached an all time high in the u s last year jewish people make up about 2 of the united states but experience the vast majority of hate crimes based on religion as a company with its own nazi history adidas had every reason to know the dangers of letting antisemitism grow and fester the company was founded by two german brothers who joined the nazi party the jewish telegraphic agency reported it s a fact that should make adidas the first business to act against antisemitism on its watch

analysts see an interest rate hike of 0 75 percentage points as a done deal copyright afp file ina fassbender michelle fitzpatrick the european central bank is expected to roll out another super size rate hike thursday to combat runaway inflation despite concerns higher borrowing costs could deepen the pain of a looming eurozone recession the ecb s 25 member governing council is likely to lift its key interest rates by 75 basis points for the second consecutive time economists say the frankfurt institution is under pressure to rein in record high inflation driven by surging food and especially energy prices in the wake of russia s war in ukraine eurozone inflation stood at just under 10 percent in september nearly five times the ecb s two percent target ecb president christine lagarde warned recently that inflation was far too high and more action was required to prevent price shocks from becoming entrenched like other central banks the ecb is fighting back with a series of rate hikes intended to dampen demand by making credit more expensive for households and businesses at the risk of triggering an economic downturn the 75 basis point rate hike looks like a done deal said ing economist carsten brzeski the ecb has turned a blind eye on recession risks he added political pushback the outlook for the eurozone economy has darkened in recent weeks as the 19 nation region grapples with the fallout from the ukraine war soaring tensions with moscow and pandemic induced global supply chain woes if russia completely cuts off gas flows to europe the eurozone economy could shrink by nearly one percent in 2023 ecb vice president luis de guindos has warned that scenario has become more likely after russia in late august shut down the crucial nord stream 1 pipeline to europe s economic powerhouse germany the german economy is already forecast to shrink by 0 4 percent next year as european governments race to unveil multi billion euro support measures to help citizens through a cost of living crisis this winter the ecb s monetary policy tightening has come under scrutiny italian prime minister giorgia meloni this week slammed the ecb s rash choice to keep hiking rates saying it created further difficulties for member states that have elevated public debt bloomberg news reported french president emmanuel macron has also expressed concern that the ecb was shattering demand in europe the ecb has already increased rates twice since july ending over a decade of ultra low and even negative interest rates lagarde has repeatedly urged governments not to fall into the trap of spending so much that they end up boosting inflation and working against the ecb in the united states inflation has been fuelled not by energy costs but by pandemic era stimulus spending the federal reserve has hiked rates faster and more aggressively leaving the ecb open to criticism that it was slow to jump into action balance sheet in focus the ecb is also expected to use this week s meeting to discuss bringing other monetary policy levers in line with its inflation busting efforts policymakers are likely to announce changes to the 2 1 trillion euros dollars in super cheap long term loans tltros offered to banks in recent years to help the eurozone through several crises sometimes at negative rates as a consequence of the rate hikes lenders can now make an easy profit by parking their excess tltro cash at the ecb and pocketing the new higher deposit rate prompting policymakers to look for ways to incentivise early repayment of the loans the ecb may also ponder how best to shrink the five trillion euros worth of bonds on its balance sheet after years of hoovering up government and corporate debt to drive up stubbornly low inflation but given the uncertain outlook and the risk of rattling financial markets analysts say the start of any quantitative tightening letting the bonds mature or actively selling them is some way off the recent events in the uk which forced the bank of england into a major u turn on bond purchases could be viewed as a useful reminder that any aggressive withdrawal of liquidity risks being highly disruptive for the bond market and the transmission of monetary policy said ducrozet

it s clear that most playwrights have never spent any time working in an office they consistently underestimate the severe decorum that restricts subordinates from going off on their boss in that dramatic fashion playwrights just can t resist those explosions occasionally happen between the cubicles but they tend to be followed by a quick visit to the human resources department lucy prebble and james graham got office mores and politics all wrong in their plays enron and ink respectively and now it is david hare s turn to muck up professional behavior with his latest straight line crazy which opened wednesday at the shed after a run at the london theatre company hare does manage to get one office subordinate almost right and that s a toady named ariel porter adam silver who basically tells robert moses ralph fiennes precisely what the powerful new york masterbuilder wants to hear as any intern would know at first glance moses is not a boss to be confronted or challenged in any way he not only bulldozes entire neighborhoods in new york city and long island to build roads among other things he uses that same drive and ambition to demolish any human being breathing any of his oxygen even the honorable al smith danny webb doesn t get what he wants in showdowns with the almighty moses for example the new york state governor 1923 28 wanted a train built to take people from the city to the new jones beach on long island moses on the other hand wanted only people in cars to enjoy the park and even constructed the overpasses and roads to prevent buses from making the trip the urban planner s logic was simple when jones beach opened in 1929 white people owned cars and people of color did not advertisement advertisement also read topdog underdog broadway review yahya abdul mateen ii and corey hawkins create sparks porter is a quick learner for a fictional character after making the mistake of moving a road a few yards to prevent a wealthy man s trees from being cut down porter quickly understands that compromise is not a word tolerated by his boss in act 2 reduced by illness to working from a wheelchair porter consistently refuses to take a position when two other subordinates dare to go head to head with moses hare delivers that office dynamic to the tee beyond porter i had to wonder having worked in an office for over 40 years why the fictional character mariah heller alisha bailey had ever been hired by the moses office much less lasted there beyond the 10 30 coffee break heller s family had been displaced from their home when moses created the cross bronx expressway begun in 1948 while she has enough career savvy to keep that family factoid a secret for a few minutes of stage time heller s attitude is as defiant as it is loud hare clearly expects us to cheer her on instead he merely exposes his own threadbare technique in telling a cogent story much more dishonest is one of the play s other fictional characters finnuala connell judith roddy who plays moses s right hand woman for 30 years she is essentially the enabler in chief until hiring heller and empathizing with the new employee she ends up not only damning moses s entire career but labeling him an uncaring husband for ignoring his alcoholic wife and an uncaring boss for never inquiring about porter s health problems again my office experience got in the way i ve seen reporters berated for not covering stories because they were in the hospital or caring for a dying parent to my jaded eyes moses appears to be a very reasonable boss ditto meryl streep s amanda priestly in the devil wears prada on one level it s fun to see a powerful jerk like moses get his comeuppance his downfall arrives when he tries to run a highway through washington square park and instead gets run over by protesters on another level we have to wonder where the suddenly hyper critical finnuala connell has been all these years except as a figment of the playwright s duplicitous imagination advertisement advertisement also read the piano lesson broadway review john david washington gives a master class in acting regarding the brawl in washington square park that took place in 1955 the protesters were greatly aided by the real life reporter jane jacobs helen schlesinger author of the death and life of great american cities here hare turns jacobs into a victim of knee jerk liberalism at its worst when she muses that what moses did to one neighborhood with the cross bronx expressway rich people did to greenwich village and soho with their gentrification nicholas hytner and jamie armitage s blunt direction emphasizes the incongruities implicit in the situations in which the actors find themselves trapped they and hare are slightly less boxed in during the big confrontation between moses and smith unlike all the scenes with subordinates these two characters carry equal weight in the role of the governor webb delivers a remarkable impersonation of eli wallach whenever that actor wasn t impersonating a mexican bandit his governor is both folksy and tough and webb uses the one trait to enhance the other it would be nice to report that fiennes delivers an impersonation of walter huston or lee j cobb or george c scott actors who knew how to play american titans without showing us their technique nowadays brian cox or bryan cranston would be perfect casting fiennes not only sweats he relies on a few stock poses to deliver what he has called male toxicity his best gimmick is to replicate richard nixon s gripping of his narrow shoulders with tight fists was nixon trying to prevent himself from exploding fiennes is good at conveying that kind of moral and physical desiccation more often he tries to go big and repeatedly sticks out his pelvis and hangs his arms down to dry so that we see not the palms but the back of his hands which sometimes rest on his buttocks the pose gives him size but more often looks like that new deodorant has given him an underarm rash advertisement advertisement perhaps moses went around as fiennes does here shouting at everybody he ever met then again he didn t have hare writing him aphorisms that attack in the following order america capitalism and democracy whenever fiennes lets go with one of these witty one liners he gazes over the audience to accept the laughter and all too often the applause captured on youtube moses spoke in a very measured cadence with a hard american accent in 1994 s quiz show fiennes delivered arguably one of the worst american accents since laurence olivier wrestled with big daddy in a 1976 tv version of cat on a hot tin roof in straight line crazy fiennes manages to at least sound mid atlantic but moored a few miles off the coast he keeps elongating all the wrong syllables for anyone who grew up in one of the boroughs not inhabited by william f buckley also read carly simon mourns death of 2 sisters joanna and lucy their loss will be long and

san francisco elon musk the billionaire poised to acquire twitter later this week strolled into the company s headquarters wednesday carrying a porcelain sink and tweeting entering twitter hq let that sink in musk s 44 billion deal to take twitter private faces a friday deadline although the video he posted offered no evidence that the acquisition is complete twitter and musk representatives had no comment on that question although twitter did confirm that musk s video tweet was real musk also changed his twitter profile to refer to himself as chief twit and his location to twitter s san francisco headquarters the splashy video a vintage musk production also pulled the spotlight back to the world s richest man and his on again off again pursuit of the social platform the friday deadline to consummate the deal was ordered by the delaware chancery court in early october it is the latest step in an epic battle during which musk signed a deal to acquire twitter then tried to back out of it leading twitter to sue the tesla ceo to force him to conclude the deal if the two sides don t meet the friday deadline the next step could be a november trial robert anderson a law professor at pepperdine university said he fully expects the deal to close by friday s deadline but didn t see much substance to musk s video i don t see anything unusual about it other than that he brought a sink he said musk had been expected to visit twitter this week and is expected to return again friday if the deal is finalized according to an internal memo cited in a report by bloomberg news his apparent enthusiasm about visiting twitter headquarters stood in sharp contrast to one of his earlier suggestions that the building should be turned into a homeless shelter because he said so few employees actually worked there the washington post reported last week that musk told prospective investors that he plans to cut three quarters of twitter s 7 500 workers when he becomes owner of the company the newspaper cited documents and unnamed sources familiar with the deliberation several hours after posting his sink video musk tweeted that he was meeting a lot of cool people at twitter today he gave no details one of musk s biggest obstacles to closing the deal was keeping in place the financing pledged roughly six months ago a group of banks including morgan stanley and bank of america signed on earlier this year to loan 12 5 billion of the money musk needed to buy twitter and take it private solid contracts with musk bound the banks to the financing although changes in the economy and debt markets since april have likely made the terms less attractive musk even said his investment group would be buying twitter for more than it s worth less clear is what s happening with the billions of dollars pledged to musk by investors who would get ownership stakes in twitter musk s original slate of equity partners included an array of partners ranging from the billionaire s tech world friends with like minded ideas about twitter s future such as oracle co founder larry ellison to funds controlled by middle eastern royalty the more equity investors kick in for the deal the less musk has to pay on his own most of his wealth is tied up in shares of tesla the electric car company that he runs since april he has sold more than 15 billion worth of tesla stock presumably to pay his share more sales could be coming musk 51 has shared few concrete details about his plans for the social media platform while he s touted free speech and derided spam bots since agreeing to buy the company in april what he actually wants to do about either remains a mystery technology analysts have speculated that musk wants to use twitter to help create an everything app similar to china s wechat service which allows users to do video chats message stream video scan bar codes and make payments musk s flirtation with buying twitter appeared to begin in late march that s when twitter said he contacted members of its board including co founder jack dorsey and told them he was buying up shares and was interested in either joining the board taking twitter private or starting a competitor then on april 4 he revealed in a regulatory filing that he had become the company s largest shareholder after acquiring a 9 stake worth about 3 billion at first twitter offered musk a seat on its board but six days later ceo parag agrawal tweeted that musk would not be joining the board after all his bid to buy the company quickly followed inside twitter musk s offer was met with confusion and falling morale especially after musk publicly criticized one of twitter s top lawyers involved in content moderation decisions in july musk abruptly reversed course announcing that he was abandoning his bid to buy twitter his stated reason twitter hadn t been straightforward about its problem with fake accounts he dubbed spam bots twitter sued and two weeks before a 5 day trial was scheduled to begin musk changed his mind again saying that he wanted to complete the deal after all
