their divorce as the one released today by jeff bezos and his wife such agreed statements often form part of the negotiations over a financial split and come attached to an nda they demonstrate the importance of high profile divorcing couples lawyers working hand in glove with their pr agents jeff bezos is worth close to 140 billion the statement did not mention how the two will split that fortune jeff right is pictured attending the amazon prime video s golden globe awards after party at the beverly hilton hotel on january 6 in beverly hills california with mr robot series creator sam

split include nearly 79 million shares of amazon stock which is currently worth about 130 billion along with rocket ship maker blue origin and the washington post according to refinitiv eikon data mackenzie does not hold any amazon shares directly liat sadler a san francisco matrimonial lawyer noted that spouses owe a fiduciary duty to one another they have duties not to waste or devalue marital resources and to keep the value of marital property as high as possible she said i don t think there is an issue of concern for shareholders as to what will happen to amazon because of the divorce sadler said the main options facing the couple regarding amazon stock were for jeff to buy out his wife or for mackenzie to retain shares if she trusts that he would manage amazon well either he should pay her for her share of the stock or they could enter a more complicated agreement where she keeps stock and he keeps voting rights she said it is unlikely that many details of the divorce will become public new york lawyer bernard clair who is representing judith giuliani in her divorce from former new york mayor rudy giuliani said these two have been separated for a not insignificant time and i would assume they would have used the time to reach a private confidential agreement clair said less than two years ago jeff and mackenzie couldn t keep their hands off of each other as

under pulitzer prize winning writer toni morrison while in college who said she was one of the best students i ve ever had in my creative writing classes morrison who was mackenzie s thesis adviser was the one who connected her with famed literary agent amanda binky urban jeff also graduated from princeton but in 1986 and the two never crossed paths while studying there jeff and mackenzie met at work in new york city in 1992 jeff was the first to interview mackenzie at the investment management firm of de shaw at the time jeff was a vice president there and mackenzie had come on board as a research associate business insider reported the two princeton graduates were engaged three months later and married in 1993 when bezos net worth reached 105 1 billion in january of 2018 cnn reported that he was the richest person in history jeff is shown at left during a press conference on august 23 2000 his wealth has grown exponentially in the last five years with forbes estimating his net worth at 32 billion in march of 2014 jeff is shown during the allen co media and technology conference in sun valley idaho on july 13 2017 that was all before jeff founded amazon which he started from a garage in seattle in 1994 since that time the two have made a noticeable style transformation portraits of the amazon ceo that were taken in 1997 the year his company went public show him wearing a blue button down shirt pleated khaki pants and a black leather wrist watch while posing next to stacks of books fast forward to 2017 and jeff set the internet alight when he showed up to the annual allen company sun valley conference with bulging muscles peeking out from his polo shirt with his shaved head and tinted sunglasses plus the bulging biceps many on twitter couldn t help but compare the amazon ceo to action star vin diesel gone were jeff s baggy shirts and receding hairline and there among the richest and most influential people in the world he seemed to emerge reborn mackenzie meanwhile went from frumpy separates to sleek form fitting sheath dresses that she often accessorizes with a pair of classic pumps the two were most recently seen attending senator john mccain s

senator john mccain s funeral in early september in washington dc jeff was wearing a classic black suit with a blue tie while mackenzie wore a long sleeve black sheath and matching heels speaking of their early years at an event in berlin in april jeff said mackenzie s support was instrumental when he founded amazon and that she did the accounting for the company in its first year when you have loving and supportive people in your life like mackenzie my parents my grandfather my grandmother you end up being able to take risks he said at the event now if the two file for divorce in their home state of washington their assets may be subject to the community property state s laws of division in washington all income earned and property acquired by either spouse during a marriage is owned by both spouses together and will be split equally upon divorce unless that default rule is opted out of with a prenuptial agreement but since the duo s fortune was amassed after they met it s highly likely they didn t draft a pre nup before they wed jeff s wealth has grown exponentially in the last five years with forbes estimating his net worth at 32 billion in march of 2014 when his net worth reached 105 1 billion in january of 2018 cnn reported that jeff was the richest person in history now he s worth 136 9 billion and he and mackenzie are thought to own more land together than almost anyone else in the united states of america according to business insider if his 137 billion fortune is split equally with mackenzie it would mean jeff would lose the title as world s richest person and mackenzie would gain the title of world s richest woman but even with a 69 billion fortune the amazon founder would still be ranked fifth richest person according to the bloomberg billionaire index the two who have been known to live relatively modestly despite the monumental wealth they ve acquired in recent years reportedly lived in a one bedroom rented home in seattle through 1999 to date they now own at least five homes throughout the country community property is the default rule in washington which means all assets acquired by either spouse during a marriage are split equally

property in 1998 on the west coast they own two homes in medina washington an exclusive seattle suburb that is also home to bill gates they paid 10 million for 5 3 acres of property in 1998 according

growing up figure 2 serves as the home base for jeff s private space company blue origin which was founded in 2001 a portion of the duo s net worth comes from blue origin which is valued at somewhere between 1 billion and 28 billion it is difficult to determine the specific value of the company because of the lack of details available about the enterprise and the fact that jeff is the sole shareholder chad anderson ceo of venture fund space angels told bloomberg jeff said in april 2017 that he funds blue origin through the sale of about 1 billion a year of amazon stock the bezos paid 23

jan shepel correspondent cambria maintaining a way of life for amish dairy farming families and preserving a successful canned milk market are two of the core missions of the salemville cheese co op in rural cambria things they have been doing for decades it s more to do with sustaining a way of life for people in our community who want to milk cows says nelson schrock the operations manager of the plant these amish farmers have got it in their blood farming is their way of life speaking at a recent dairy exchange at the wisconsin department of agriculture trade and consumer protection shrock explained the value of the cooperative plant to other members of the dairy industry a large new addition to the country cheese plant last year positions the co op for growth and is a strong step in meeting the mission of the plant for its local amish community well into the future when the co op began in 1984 there were 20 patrons with an average of 10 cows in their herds and 10 000 pounds per day came into their cheese factory to make blue cheese today there are more than 60 patrons with an average of 15 cows and 25 000 pounds of milk comes into their plant each day in addition to the milk from their amish community members sometimes milk can come into their new intake area on bulk trucks from other farmers as well shrock said the plant which is eight miles north of cambria in green lake county is a key part of the local amish community offering jobs and a profitable market for those who milk cows the amish community which surrounds the dairy plant got started in 1978 when families migrated from northern indiana at that time there were four creameries in the area but within a few years they were closed or getting ready to close one of them salemville cheese had been a cheese factory and the owner cheesemaker came to the leaders of the amish community to see if there was interest in keeping the plant in business the community gave the project a green light allowing members to work in what for amish folks is a non traditional setting it uses electricity shrock s father william and his uncle lavern miller took the lead and the plant got started in 1984 once again making blue cheese that same year there was a 1 000 square foot cooler expansion at the cheese plant schrock explains that once the mold that creates blue cheese is in a cheese plant it permeates the facility and no other kind of cheese like cheddar can be made there the exception is gorgonzola cheese which is a close enough cousin to blue that there isn t a problem when the plant was getting off the ground another arrangement had to be made for salemville to move forward the plant had to have a non amish owner that is a standard for the community he said in those first years the plant had gone through several owners but the current owners canaan properties inc have stood with the community for over 20 years the people behind canaan properties susan and stan harris have been friends of nelson s family and the amish community for more than 35 years they were friends before they were business partners he said as the plant began to crank out blue cheese they ran into a problem not enough sales of their finished product we struggled for six years says nelson then in 1990 they began working with dan carter inc which was looking for domestic suppliers of specialty cheeses that was one of the best things that ever happened here he added that was also the year that the salemville brand was born when dci got the amish specialty cheese into a variety of retail markets a substantial amount of value was added to the milk brought into the plant in the early years about 90 percent of their cheese was sold into commodity channels but once those specialty connections were made virtually all of the co op s cheese has been sold at retail for higher prices expanded product line today their expanded product line includes a rocky meadow brand of cheese amish blue gorgonzola a reserve aged blue and a smokehaus blue the products can be found in large retailers like hy vee whole foods and kroger he said as well as other major outlets it is sold in every state of the union he adds but the greatest amount of product is moved in the east as that business took off the plant added cold storage and then space for packaging in 2016 they broke ground for a large expansion and completed it in 2017 dan carter s dci cheese company was sold to saputo specialty cheese in 2011 and nelson notes both have been very good to work with those relationships are highly valued by the co op and the community members of the dci marketing team went along over to saputo their marketing efforts have made all the difference he adds without those efforts our farm gate milk prices would suffer because of the marketing we are able to pay our farmers prices that are superior to class iii one of the things that the marketing team has done in recent years is bring their buyers to the plant and visit the farms where the milk comes from they really believe in getting buyers to the plant having them watch the milk come in and see the cheese being made after such a visit one buyer moved all her business to salemville he says since the community doesn t allow mechanical milkers and since our farms are all family run we meet a lot of truly artisan requirements for our buyers it is a true fit for the farm to table movement schrock said in addition all the amish farmers shun the use of genetically modified crops so down the road there is the potential opportunity to use that as part of their story we did a survey for the plant and every farmer raises non gmo feed all our farmers are virtually organic they just haven t been certified he noted besides offering a place for amish dairy farmers to sell their milk in cans the plant offers employment schrock said his employees are all from the amish community including licensed cheesemakers and food safety specialists who have all been trained in their areas they aren t afraid of hard work he said other regional amish communities have studied what has been accomplished at salemville to see if they could make it work in their areas they are asking us to tell them how we did it so they can help the farmers in their communities he says schrock credits the fact that the whole community helped with the project and it was started some decades ago it could be a challenge to do it now he adds but every amish community now has a produce auction why not dairy there are 40 50 amish communities in the state schrock estimated salemville is one of three plants in wisconsin that takes in canned milk he adds that cows have such long productive lives on the amish farms that most are in the herd for eight to 10 years and many farmers have the opportunity to sell off springing heifers because they don t need them as herd replacements schrock himself became one of the plant s farmer patrons in 2015 when he bought an 85 year old timber frame barn from a neighbor with help from family and friends he took the barn down and re erected it at his farm now he begins his days milking cows before he comes in to manage the plant he wanted to milk cows to see what other farmers face on a daily basis but also to have chores and teach responsibility to his children economic engine partnerships with buyers workers and farmers have helped make the salemville cheese co op an economic engine for the community schrock says the average age of farmer patrons milking cows is 37 years old he notes which is quite a bit younger than wisconsin s dairy farm population overall having those younger farmers puts us in a position to keep this going into the future he said positioning for the future has also meant expanding the facilities in 1995 they added 2 500 square feet of cold storage and in 2004 they added 8 300 square feet for packaging and storage the plant employs 35 amish workers from the community doing production and packaging of the cheese for 15 years the plant had only one licensed cheesemaker schrock s uncle lavern but today there are two licensed cheesemakers on staff along with four apprentices those cheesemakers have scored best in class awards for gorgonzola at the national cheese contest nelson credits the many resources available in wisconsin the center for dairy research university of wisconsin and the wisconsin cheesemakers association with helping put all the pieces together to run a solid business the financial impact to the greater community says nelson is from 3 4 million something he and the five member board of directors appreciate last year canaan properties completed its largest expansion yet with the backing of the salemville amish co op allowing them to completely move out of the 117 year old cheese factory next to the road where they started this addition includes 15 000 square feet and includes a fully enclosed bay to unload full cans of milk and reload the washed and sanitized cans the building of the new cheese plant and intake employed a number of amish carpenters and non amish vendors the bank required a licensed general contractor to oversee the project new intake for cans the process starts at the intake where contracted milk haulers bring the milk into the plant in an enclosed box truck designed to haul cans all the amish dairy farmers put their milk in cans and cool it in a tank filled with well water at the farm the haulers now enter the new intake where a conveyor system allows workers to empty the 10 gallon stainless steel cans each can is marked with a farm number weights and samples are taken and recorded from each as they are emptied the cans and lids are washed sanitized and returned to the farm the milk then moves through a state of the art pasteurization center and goes into cheese vats in the next room workers place curds in small round forms and once that curd is set the cheese comes out of the form and goes into brining tanks the cheese eventually ends up in cold storage to be aged until it reaches the requirements of its standard of identity we inventory 250 000 pounds of blue cheese on a daily basis schorck said of the 1 1 5 million pounds of production at salemville each year 80 percent of it is sold as crumbled cheese and the plant packages its products under numerous labels we have 45 different sku s he said future ideas while the co op is still enjoying the new facility they are mulling over ideas for the future there is an opportunity in doing goat s milk cheese at the plant as another product line and expansion of production is now possible with the added facilities schrock said he gets calls all the time from non amish dairy farmers with 20 cows or 35 cows who are having a hard time finding anyone who wants to pick up their milk and he sympathizes with them it s possible that down the road salemville may join with other amish communities who are selling their milk into commodity markets and leaving 4 5 on the table because they ship in cans most amish dairy farmers in wisconsin still use canned milk he adds this is a model that is working it wasn t an overnight success and you need a committed community he says economically the hogs had to go and then the steers had to go and the chickens had to go we think this is a way to keep dairy farming a viable part of the amish community the retail cheese store at the front of the factory schrock said has been a profit center and has been part of the facility from the start despite its location on a fairly remote country crossroads there was a steady stream of retail cheese shoppers during our visit on a windy winter day during the summer the cheese store is a stop on organized tours of the local amish businesses and is especially busy when gardeners are out in the country buying plants from nearby amish run greenhouses during the summer months four nearby campgrounds are full and many of those campers stop in for cheese
california does not levy a gift tax however the federal government does that tax rate can climb to as high as 40 still there are plenty of ways you can minimize the hit or avoid it all together for 2024 you can give up to 18 000 to any individual without triggering a gift tax which is up from 17 000 in 2023 but even if you go over the limit you may just need to file some extra paperwork come tax time you won t owe an actual tax until you exceed your lifetime gift and estate tax exemption we ll explain how that works and how you can give without ever setting off a gift tax but first let s define what a gift really is in the eyes of the irs smartasset s free matching tool can help you find a financial advisor to help you with gift giving strategies what counts as a gift in california the irs defines a gift as virtually any movement of cash or property to another individual or entity without expecting something of equal or lesser value in return this may include the following financial accounts such as bank retirement or brokerage funds assets such as stocks and bonds jewelry property such as a home or a car no or low interest loans as you can see the definition can get a little vague suppose you made a loan to a friend with zero interest if it was was large enough to buy a home the irs would consider it a taxable gift it would also deem it a gift if you made that loan with an interest rate that falls below the irs federal rates limits selling property below market value may also affect your gift tax limits suppose you sell someone a home valued at 300 000 for 100 000 the irs sees you made a gift of 200 000 however you may still avoid paying a gift tax if you go above the annual exclusion limit of 18 000 for 2024 or 17 000 for 2023 what is the annual gift tax exclusion every year the irs sets an annual gift tax exclusion for 2024 the annual gift tax exclusion sits at 18 000 which applies per individual that means you can give 18 000 in cash or property to your hypothetical son daughter and granddaughter each without worrying about a gift tax if you and your spouse make a gift jointly the exclusion is 36 000 which is double the individual exclusion for 2023 the limit is 17 000 making the couples version 34 000 for 2023 but if you go over that limit for any individual or entity you would need to report it on the irs form 709 officially it s called the u s gift and generation skipping transfer tax return remember filling this out doesn t necessarily mean you have to pay a tax on the gift the government made this rule in order to keep track of how you use up your lifetime gift and estate tax exemption once your total lifetime gifts exceed that threshold the irs requires you to pay an actual gift tax how does the lifetime gift and estate tax exemption work remember the annual gift tax exclusion for 2024 stands at 18 000 and 17 000 in 2023 so you can feel free to transfer gifts valued in this amount to any number of individuals each without worrying about taxes but if you go above that threshold for a particular person you begin to reduce your lifetime gift and estate tax exemption of 13 61 million for 2024 or 12 92 million for 2023 think of the annual exclusion and lifetime exemption as buckets of water if you fill one up annual exclusion it runs over into the next one lifetime exemption once you fill the latter that s when uncle sam steps in the irs can levy a federal gift tax on what spills out of that lifetime exclusion bucket the gift tax rate can climb to 40 depending on how much of that money exceeds your lifetime exemption how does the california estate tax work fortunately there is no california estate tax however the federal government enforces its own if the property you left behind to your heirs exceeds your lifetime gift and estate tax exemption of 13 61 million in 2024 or 12 92 million for 2023 you d owe a federal estate tax on the portion that exceeds those thresholds the estate tax rate can climb to as high as 40 but with help from a qualified financial advisor and attorney a married couple can shield about twice as much from the federal government in addition there are ways you can steer clear of a potential estate tax hit by taking some important steps reducing the size of your estate in a nutshell the federal government levies an estate tax on very large estates so if you re worried about facing a potential hit it may behoove you to reduce the size of the estate you leave behind this may ensure your loved ones take full advantage of what you leave behind for them one path you can take is establishing an irrevocable trust and naming your choice of beneficiaries assets in an irrevocable trust can be passed on to your beneficiaries after your death but while you re transferring money or property into the irrevocable trust those assets technically leave your ownership thus they effectively reduce the size of your taxable estate plus you can build a trust with virtually anything of value for example you can invest in mutual funds and other securities this means the money can grow over time before it reaches your beneficiaries this strategy may help prevent you from eating into your lifetime gift and estate tax exemption as long as what you transfer toward the trust each year doesn t exceed the annual gift tax exclusion at the time you can steer from reducing your lifetime exemption when it comes to strategizing your estate planning and avoiding the gift tax in general that s your primary goal gifting in moderation each year without exceeding the annual exclusion helps you avoid breaching the lifetime exemption but trusts and estate planning strategies can get extremely complicated this is why the guidance of an experienced financial advisor and tax professional is crucial in these situations nonetheless there are some instances where you can give as much as you want and it won t count as a gift what doesn t count toward the gift tax below we cover some of the individuals and entities you can give as much as you want to without triggering a gift tax this means these gifts won t reduce your lifetime gift and estate tax exemption spouse you can transfer any amount of cash and property to your spouse tax free as long as he or she is a u s citizen if your spouse is not the irs sets an annual limit to what you can give tax free charity if you donate toward a registered non profit organization the irs may not treat it as a taxable gift check with a financial advisor or tax professional to see which organizations count for the exemption as this may vary across states medical institution if you cover someone else s bill for qualified medical expenses it may be a non taxable event however you have to send the payment directly to the caregiver if you re planning on doing this you should seek the guidance of a tax professional educational institution suppose you want to cover your child s tuition bill as long as you send the payment directly to the school you won t cut into your gift tax lifetime exclusion but you may if you send it directly to the student also keep in mind this applies to only tuition nonetheless you can use a 529 college savings plan to save for other qualified educational expenses such as books these savings vehicles also enjoy their own gift tax exemptions the 529 plan gift tax exemption if you re investing in a 529 plan toward a beneficiary such as your son or daughter you re technically making gifts however the irs allows you to contribute up to 90 000 without cutting into your annual exclusion as long as you agree to not make any more contributions toward a 529 plan for the same beneficiary in the next five years in essence the irs lets you use five years worth of annual exclusions for this beneficiary at once as long as it goes toward a 529 plan for 2024 that s 18 000 multiplied by 5 or 90 000 if you choose to contribute less than five years it s pro rated so if you contribute 36 000 18 000 x 2 you ve used up two years of your annual exclusion and therefore you can t contribute toward the plan for the next two years instead of five the great thing is that the move would not eat into your lifetime exemption or whatever the amount is at any given time if you simply gave the beneficiary 90 000 you would reduce your lifetime exemption because you gave an individual more than the 2024 exclusion of 18 000 in one year but what if your son or daughter is in college and you don t have an active 529 plan in their name you can always send money directly to the school to cover tuition plus you can send up to 18 000 directly to each student to cover other educational expenses neither move requires you to report it to the irs and neither lowers your lifetime exemption bottom line california doesn t enforce a gift tax but you may owe a federal one however you can give up to 18 000 in cash or property during the 2024 tax year and up to 17 000 in the 2023 tax year without triggering a gift tax return if you gave more than 13 61 million in 2024 or give more than 12 92 million in 2023 you d owe a gift tax the tax rate can climb to 40 on the portion that exceeds that limit but there are plenty of steps you can take to avoid gift and estate taxes tips on avoiding gift tax a financial advisor can help you build a financial plan that

during the first week of her new job as a representative from new york alexandria ocasio cortez proposed a top statutory tax rate of 70 percent her stated goal is to raise revenue to fund what she calls the green new deal an effort to transition the u s economy to fully renewable energy in ten years ocasio cortez has yet to release the specifics of her new plan however her comments imply that she wants to add an eighth tax bracket of 70 percent on incomes over 10 million what this means is that if you are a very high earner such as a successful actor musician or business owner you would need to pay 70 cents for every dollar you report in taxable income over 10 million it s not clear yet whether it would apply only to earned income or if it would apply to all income including capital gains dividends and business income however given her stated goal it is likely the latter for sure there is a lot of money earned by the roughly 16 000 tax filers with incomes over 10 million irs data show that this group reported more than 482 billion in adjusted gross income in 2016 the washington post recently estimated that on a purely static basis not accounting for any behavioral changes the federal government could raise more than 700 billion in additional revenue over the next ten years if the federal government enacted a top tax rate of 70 percent unfortunately for the congresswoman estimates that show a significant increase in revenue from a 70 percent tax rate on incomes over 10 million are unrealistic this is because individuals and their accountants would react to the new 70 percent rate by finding ways to report less income they would save 70 cents for every dollar not reported above that threshold according to the irs about 46 percent of all income reported by those earning more than 10 million is made up of capital gains meaning income from the sale of assets such as stocks under current law capital gains are taxed only when they are realized that is when the assets are sold not every time they gain value this means that individuals can effectively choose when to pay the tax and individuals who hold on to assets until death can have their gains completely erased through what is called step up in basis researchers at the joint committee on taxation found that there is a strong negative relationship between the tax rate on capital gains and realizations they found that over the long run a 10 percent increase in the tax rate on capital gains reduces realizations by around 7 percent this implies that the revenue maximizing capital gains rate is around 29 percent a rate approaching 70 percent would likely reduce federal revenue from changes in capital gains behavior overall it is unlikely that ocasio cortez s plan would see anywhere near the 700 billion the washington post estimated leaving aside whether this policy would ultimately help the congresswoman fund her priorities proponents have defended this new top rate with two arguments first they argue this is an increase in the top marginal rate so it won t increase the tax burden that significantly even for a very rich individual only the sliver of income over the 10 million threshold would be taxed at 70 percent second they argue that high marginal rates like this were commonplace before the 1980s shortly after world war ii and until 1964 the united states levied a top marginal tax rate over 90 percent and from the early 60s to 1982 the top rate was 70 percent if the united states was able to fund priorities and prosper during this time why wouldn t it be able to do it again fortunately knowledge of tax policy has evolved and improved over the past 50 years research by economists and tax analysts has convinced lawmakers throughout the world that high marginal tax rates are a poor way to raise revenue high marginal tax rates discourage individuals from working additional hours and discourage businesses from making productivity enhancing investments as a result tax reform across the globe has moved tax systems away from high marginal tax rates with narrow bases to lower marginal rates and broad bases the u s is not the only country that greatly reduced marginal tax rates over the past 50 years according to the organisation for economic cooperation and development the simple average top statutory tax rate has declined from 57 1 percent to 35 8 percent among the group s member nations at the same time revenue collections remained stable or rose as these same countries enacted broad based taxes such as value added taxes payroll taxes and broader individual income taxes overall lawmakers such as ocasio cortez who want to see the government raise a much larger share of revenue as a percent of gdp to fund their priorities need to get more serious about tax policy yes it is possible to raise additional revenue by raising taxes on high earners through eliminating tax expenditures reforming capital taxation and raising rates but there is a limit any proposal that raises a significant amount of revenue will have to do so through broad based taxes on all americans not just the highest earners if we look across the atlantic at countries with significant revenue collections as a percent of gdp taxes are generally high for everyone denmark sweden and finland all raise more than 40 percent of gdp in tax revenue these countries have broad based value added taxes over 20 percent and high payroll taxes their income taxes have high marginal tax rates but they apply to much more personal income than what ocasio cortez is proposing for example in 2015 denmark s top marginal tax rate of 60 percent started applying at 1 2 times the average income if that were enacted here all taxable income over 56 500 would face a 60 percent tax rate broad based taxes would be a better way to raise significant revenue for the federal government however the need to raise revenue from everyone not just the highest earners increases the burden of proof on proponents of new government programs if they are to get voters behind a middle class tax increase they need to convince the public that their new policies are worth it simply claiming that someone else will pay for it is not enough the design of a tax matters for how it affects incentives and how much revenue it raises a sharply higher top marginal tax rate would ultimately fail to accomplish the congresswoman s goal more from national review

tick tock 4 0l i have a 99 jeep cherokee xj with a 4 0l engine 4 5 inch rubicon express lift 33 inch tires and 4 56 axle gears with eaton detroit truetrac limited slip differentials it performs great the jeep has roughly 205 000 miles on it and the engine is getting pretty noisy i m not sure if it s a lifter tick or worse i don t only go off road with my jeep it s fully street legal and i used to drive it all over the place on 2 to 3 hour road trips but lately the engine noise has me wondering how reliable it really is what are the first steps in diagnosing what the noise is i ve had one mechanic say it sounds like a normal 4 0l and another mechanic that i work with is very concerned with the noise what are your thoughts advertisement jesse chism via email the 4 0l jeep engines are nearly bulletproof if properly maintained they can easily hit 250 000 miles unfortunately sometimes they still have issues it s difficult to identify an internal engine noise via email but there are a few things you can check the first thing to remember is that the 4 0l engines were never all that quiet to begin with the 4 0l engine was based on a 50 year old design having said that it s also not uncommon for a 4 0l lifter to have issues i think you should first inspect the oil pressure the typical oil pressure rule for older engines like your 4 0l is to look for 10 psi for every 1 000 rpm if it s dipping below this you could have a failing oil pump or worn bearings in the engine although some 4 0l engines will run for years on minimal oil pressure regardless excessively worn or damaged engine bearings will be easy to diagnose when inspecting the engine oil if there are lots of metal flakes in the oil you likely have a bigger internal issue and a teardown might be required i d recommend getting your hands on a mechanic s stethoscope these can be purchased inexpensively through companies such as harbor freight harborfreight com carefully poke around the engine to pinpoint where the noise is coming from also be sure to check carefully around the exhaust manifold and collector it is not at all uncommon for the tick of an exhaust leak to be mistaken as an internal engine problem unfortunately the 4 0l is well known for having exhaust leaks there are a number of aftermarket headers available to cure a leaky oe cast iron exhaust manifold if you do find this is the cause of the ticking flatfender tech what did you use for a transmission mount on the garage project gpw i am thinking of swapping an sm465 or sm420 in front of the spicer 18 in my willys i want that low first gear also what does your jeep feel like with coilovers phillywilly46 via instagram cappaworks advertisement over the years i ve tried using the stock flatfender transmission crossmember and mount and several different custom crossmembers that i ve fabricated the result was pretty much always the same while the transmission and transfer case were securely held in place i was never happy with the ground clearance or the skidplating that protected the vulnerable spicer 18 oil pan i decided to solve these problems on the garage project gpw for this jeep i fabricated a one piece skidplate crossmember similar to the stamped steel skidplate you can find underneath a yj or tj only much of mine is made from 1 4 inch thick steel plate a transmission mount pad is built into the skidplate it utilizes a daystar daystarweb com urethane gm transmission mount that attaches to the foot of the transfer case adapter the skidplate attaches to the frame via six 3 8 inch bolts and ruffstuff specialties ruffstuffspecialties com threaded weld washers i also raised the transfer case several inches for more ground clearance the transmission tunnel needed to be cut and modified to accommodate the new raised transfer case location so far i m really happy with it eventually i ll extend the skidplate forward to protect the engine oil pan too the sm465 and sm420 are both great transmissions the sm465 offers a 6 55 1 ratio first gear and the sm420 offers an ultra low 7 05 1 ratio first gear however both transmissions have their drawbacks first and foremost is that they are essentially three speed transmissions when you are driving on the street you generally will never find much use for the low first gear on the pavement the gaps between the three gears on both transmissions can make for quirky driving on the street something else to consider is that the sm420 is old and it is getting harder to find parts for also with some adapters the front driveshaft clearance can be a problem on the sm420 when used with a spicer 18 the sm465 while much newer and easier to find parts for is massive and hangs down several inches below the framerails you should check the actual dimensions before pulling the trigger on an sm465 swap in a small jeep if you are set on a four speed manual truck transmission you might want to consider a t 18 transmission the t 18 is extremely adaptable readily available you can find them with a 6 32 1 first gear and it s pretty compact for its strength and durability in some areas a good swappable version of the t 18 can be difficult and expensive to locate but herm the overdrive guy hermtheoverdriveguy com offers several versions of the t 18 rebuilt with an adapter for a very reasonable price the company has other low geared rebuilt truck transmissions available too if you decide to go a different route for years i dealt with the drawbacks of leaf springs on my other flatfenders i was regularly bending and breaking leaf springs axlewrap was also a real issue to the tune of having destroyed several driveshafts yokes and a transmission case on the gpw i wanted to eliminate these problems adapting the land rover radius arms and fox ridefox com coilover shocks eliminated the problems i had with the leaf springs but it s a comparatively complicated suspension design that requires a bit more thinking and fabrication it s much easier to hang a set of leaf springs not having any axlewrap has been the biggest advantage of my suspension selection although it does ride very smooth i ve since increased the spring rates slightly i started with 200 in lb springs all around but they did not support the weight and ride height i wanted to maintain without excessive coilover preload i later switched to 200 over 275 coils up front and 200 over 250 coils in the rear i run about 1 inch of preload solid steering conversion i had a quick question about the power steering mount you fabricated for the garage project gpw you said you used dom boss tubing is that tubing a specialty item that you ordered online or are you able to easily source it from local places the easy to get to places near my house are not much more than hardware stores and they don t seem to have the right diameter or thickness any ideas where i can buy boss tubing i like the idea of building my own mount on the last conversion i did i used the common prefabbed mount i had to cut and grind a ton to get around the front crossmember i m running full width wagoneer axles one thing i did that i haven t seen before is that i cut and replaced all of the crossmembers widening the frame to match the front axle spring pad widths this kept me from having to narrow the axles or outboard the spring hangers macdamike advertisement via instagram cappaworks the dom boss tubing isn t anything special it s simply heavy wall dom tubing i purchased inexpensive remnants from the local industrial metal supply industrialmetalsupply com the company keeps short sections of various diameters and wall thicknesses on hand if you can t find the tubing locally you can buy it online from companies like speedy metals speedymetals com the company sells the heavy wall dom tubing in 1 inch increments or you can purchase pieces in 12 18 24 36 48 and 60 inch lengths you ll need around 20 24 inches to fabricate the four boss style mounts needed for a traditional saginaw steering box i used 7 8 inch 0 499 wall for three of the mounts and 1 inch 0 250 wall tube for one of the mounts i needed a bit more diameter on the upper forward mount to make contact with the frame for welding this tubing essentially has a 1 2 inch hole and the steering box mounting bolts are 7 16 inch the bolts are a loose fit so they don t corrode and become stuck and the box will not wobble around in the mounts the larger bolt hole gives you some room for error and warpage when welding you could very easily use thinner tubing with something like a 0 120 wall thickness but you ll need to fabricate additional brackets to attach the bosses to the frame i wanted to keep it simple even if it added a bit more weight you can purchase the premade cast steel steering box mount from advanced adapters advanceadapters com it simplifies locating the steering box on the frame but as you noted it often causes clearance issues with other components it s a great bracket to start with but it often needs to be modified or spaced for proper steering box fitment the dom boss mounting method spreads the load across the frame better than the cast bracket if properly done the dom bosses are less likely to cause the frame to crack widening the frame is one way to accommodate the wider spring perch mounts on the wagoneer axles it s certainly a lot more work than outboarding the springs with mounts from companies such as dave s customs unlimited davescustomsunlimited com m o r e mountainoffroad com and poison spyder poisonspyder com the advantage to going the route you did is that it will provide more room between the framerails this will be a huge benefit when installing the exhaust system and steering shaft with a standard width frame it s usually an incredibly tight fit to keep the exhaust inboard for better ground clearance you should be able to very easily run the exhaust inside the framerails the wider frame also opens up transfer case options besides the smallish spicer 18 dana 20 and dana 300 pretty much everything that sits between the framerails will be much easier to locate and mount during your build dos jeeps i have two questions the first is about my 17 two door jk i read an article about an aev bracket style lift it uses brackets spacers and all stock suspension parts i like the idea of using stock suspension parts my jeep is a daily driven commuter vehicle so ease of parts availability is key what are the long term thoughts on this type of lift advertisement my second question is about my 76 cj 7 with the t 18 transmission i ve heard bad things about this particular year t 18 i m not positive of the year of mine because the jeep was a conglomeration of parts when i bought it 25 years ago it has the numbers 13 01 097 901 cast in behind the shifter on the driver s side below the shifter is a stamped riveted tag with t 18 1b on it below that tag is a cast in wg div what exactly do i have and what are the shortcomings and positives vinny eckes via facebook com johncappa4x4 when a jk is lifted with the stock length control arms the front axle moves rearward and the steering caster decreases this causes a slightly rougher ride and poor handling most suspension lift companies offer longer lower control arms to correct the caster but this does little to combat the slightly rougher ride caused by the control arms located at more of an angle most of the suspension lift kits from aev aev conversions com are bracket lifts rather than replace the factory control arms with longer adjustable arms the control arm mounting points are relocated lower on the frame with drop brackets and the factory control arms are retained this design has several benefits the drop brackets correct the caster retain the factory ride and reuse many of the oe suspension components the only real disadvantage is the loss of ground clearance under the lower control arms and their mounts if you don t plan on extreme wheeling over rocks and logs the bracket style lift is a great way to go so for a daily driver where ground clearance is less of a concern this is probably one of the best lift kit options as for your cj the t 18 is the best manual transmission ever offered in the 76 86 cj model it s a heavy duty truck transmission of course it s not particularly fast shifting but it s incredibly durable especially when put into a small jeep versions of the t 18 transmission can be found in v 8 powered 1 ton trucks of the same era so you know it s overkill in a cj most 72 75 cj t 18 transmissions feature the slightly less desirable 4 02 1 ratio first gear and a front cast iron adapter plate that mates to the amc bellhousing the 76 model was a crossover year for the jeep cj t 18 so your jeep could have the t 18 with either the 4 02 1 or the more desirable 6 32 1 first gear and no front adapter all 77 79 jeep cjs with the t 18 came with the wide ratio version that features the 6 32 1 ratio first gear no front adapter plate is present on these models the 13 01 097 901 casting stamp on your t 18 transmission indicates that it originated in a 76 78 cj it could have the 4 02 1 or the 6 32 1 first gear ultimately if your first gear is already plenty low for the type of off roading you do then there is no need make a change there is absolutely nothing wrong with the t 18 with the 4 02 1 ratio first gear it s only undesirable if you need more low range gearing off road advertisement jk sponge brake i bought a 07 jeep wrangler unlimited rubicon with 80 000 miles on the odometer in 2014 i got it at or below wholesale according to a friend i called before buying who owns a used auto business it already had a fabfours lifestyle front winch bumper with a warn 9000 pound winch and 17x9 american eagle wheels with 285 70r17 bfg km2 tires on the initial test drive to the shop to have it checked out i noticed the brakes were spongy not knowing when it was last fully serviced and knowing few people ever change the brake fluid i had all the fluids changed figuring hoping that new brake fluid and a good bleeding would solve the spongy pedal problem unfortunately this was not the case after three more bleeding attempts it was close to right i took it in for a final try while getting some other minor work done but i eventually decided to leave it as it was since it was so close to feeling right the mechanics wanted to try to get it where we felt it should be only to make it worse again i ve had everything but the calipers replaced the jeep even has a new master cylinder i later went with a brake upgrade featuring larger rotors and braided stainless steel lines the lines were my idea i ve put more than 250 000 miles on motorcycles braided stainless steel lines are always the first thing i change on a bike to eliminate hose expansion the jeep still has a spongy brake pedal in all of the columns i ve read in jp regarding this specific year and model jk unlimited rubicon i ve never seen any mention of this problem with your project vehicles most that i ve talked to say it s normal for this year wrangler even the local dealer do you have any ideas on what the root of the problem may be i never experienced any vehicle with this problem that couldn t be fixed in all the years i worked as a mechanic and i did an extensive amount of brake work i ve wondered what difference there is in the parts between these early jk unlimiteds and the 12 18 models since the later versions do not appear to have this problem from what i have heard any insight or info that might give a solution would be appreciated my brakes are not confidence inspiring in emergency braking situations gary grimes via email advertisement unfortunately none of the 07 18 jeep jk wrangler models have noteworthy braking performance this problem is exacerbated with the installation of heavier larger diameter tires and wheels contrary to your belief your 07 jk unlimited rubicon uses exactly the same master cylinder part number as every other jk model all the way up through 2018 in fact all of the jk models share the same brake calipers rotors and pads too fortunately there are a few companies with easy to install upgrade kits dynatrac dynatrac com is one of them and offers its pro grip brake system that bolts on to all 07 18 jeep wrangler jk models it features larger uniquely vented rotors for the front 13 50 inch and rear 14 25 inch as well as performance front and rear brake pad linings the increased rear braking power provides more balanced braking reducing nose dive and it improves the control of the vehicle in mild and hard braking conditions compared to upgrades that only address the front brakes with the system installed you ll instantly notice a more inspiring brake pedal feel and that less brake pedal pressure is required to make stops stopping distances are said to improve by up to 30 percent compared to stock brakes on a jeep jk outfitted with a 4 inch lift and 37 inch tall tires perhaps the biggest advantage of the dynatrac pro grip brake system is that it does not require the hydraulic system to be cracked open messing with the hydraulics is something that often leads to other brake issues for most shade tree mechanics

amazon ceo jeff bezos and his wife mackenzie bezos arrive for the axel springer award ceremony on april 24 2018 on jan 9 2019 it was announced that bezos and his wife will divorce after 25 years jorge carstensen dpa zuma press tns jorg carstensen zuma press 2018 amazon ceo jeff bezos and his wife mackenzie are divorcing ending a 25 year marriage that played a role in the creation of an e commerce company that made bezos one of the world s wealthiest people the decision to divorce comes after a trial separation according to a statement posted wednesday on jeff bezos twitter account he and his wife both signed the announcement which ended with a vow to remain cherished friends if we had known we would separate after 25 years we would do it all again the couple said advertisement article continues below this ad left unanswered was one of the biggest sticking points in any divorce how the assets amassed during the marriage will be divided jeff bezos is ranked at the top of most lists of the world s wealthiest people and his fortune currently hovers around 137 billion according to estimates by both forbes and bloomberg virtually all of that is tied up in the nearly 79 million shares of amazon stock currently worth about 130 billion that bezos owns translating into a 16 percent stake in the seattle company bezos 54 also owns rocket ship maker blue origin and the washington post which he bought for 250 million in 2013 because the pair were married before amazon was founded it s likely that mackenzie bezos a 48 year old novelist holds a large claim to that fortune though details hinge on where the couple files for divorce and if they had a prenuptial agreement king county wash where their home is located confirmed on twitter wednesday that the bezoses had not filed for divorce in court the couple own a home in a wealthy seattle suburb in the county jeff bezos also bought a mansion in a swanky washington neighborhood last year for 23 million the bezoses have four children advertisement article continues below this ad the property acquired during the marriage is common property said jennifer payseno a family lawyer at the firm mckinley irvin in seattle that includes stock ownership although amazon has not filed any regulatory documents to suggest bezos stake in the company has changed amazon didn t respond to inquiries about how the divorce may affect that stake the bezoses will almost certainly settle the divorce outside of court if they haven t already said jacqueline newman a manhattan divorce lawyer and managing partner at berkman bottger newman rodd for the most part they re going to want to keep things private and quiet she said especially in the case of a public company they re not going to want information to leak because it could ultimately affect stock prices amazon s stock edged up 2 84 wednesday to close at 1 659 42 that left amazon with a market value of 811 billion more than any other publicly traded u s company advertisement article continues below this ad the amicable tenor of the bezoses announcement makes it highly likely that the couple already has reached an agreement on how to divide their assets payseno said jeff bezos tremendous wealth has magnified the focus on him although his divorce seems unlikely to enthrall the public like high profile breakups involving movie stars such as brad pitt and angelina jolie or even those of other billionaires such as donald trump s tabloid fodder split with his first wife ivana in the early 1990s but the bezos divorce seems likely to attract more attention than when google co founder sergey brin currently worth 49 billion divorced anne wojcicki in 2015

denver jan 9 2019 prnewswire vista gold corp tsx nyse american vgz vista or the company today announced that recent high pressure grinding roll hpgr crusher and ore sorting tests on high grade samples confirm previous test results the company also announced its plans to complete fine grinding and leaching tests in the 1st quarter of 2019 and to follow these results with updated preliminary feasibility study pfs economics in the 2nd quarter of 2019 interim met testing results confirm benefits of ore sorting additional hpgr and ore sorting tests were completed on two 2 5 tonne samples from mt todd s batman deposit containing 1 39 and 1 70 grams of gold per tonne g au t respectively this testing program confirmed two important results hpgr crushing followed by screening results in increased concentration of gold in the fine fraction and the small amount of gold lost in the rejected material is proportionally lower when sorting higher grade material as with previous tests the samples were hpgr crushed at the facilities of thyssen krupp industries in germany and screened at 16 millimeters mm approximately 5 8 inches the coarse fraction 16mm was sent to the facilities of tomra sorting solutions in germany where 2 stage x ray transmission and laser sorting tests were completed using production sized and commercially available equipment the following table summarizes the results of the testing program for each of the samples and compares these results to previous bulk tests on low grade samples sample g au t sorter feed 16mm sorter product sorter reject gold loss

commented these tests confirm the value adding benefit of ore sorting for the mt todd gold project and demonstrate lower gold losses with higher grade crusher feed we attribute these results to the favorable characteristics of the batman deposit simply stated the gold containing sulfide minerals and quartz calcite veining are more easily broken into small particles than the non mineralized host rock where this breakage does not result in clean separation from the host rock in the first pass of hpgr crushing the gold bearing minerals are easily identified and separated in the ore sorting circuit these results complement our previously announced fine grinding and leaching test results please refer to our august 2 2018 press release and we expect that these results will support additional improvements in the economics of the mt todd gold project when we complete the pfs economics expected in the 2nd quarter of this year met testing and pfs update schedule the crushed and sorted samples have been transported to the facilities of resource development inc where sample preparation has been completed for assaying and additional fine grinding leaching and tailings characterization tests samples are being sent to core metallurgy pty ltd to obtain additional fine grinding data simulating grinding in the horizontal isamill and to the flsmidth minerals testing and research center to obtain data simulating grinding in the vertical vpx mill both tests will target a final product size of 38 45 microns and will generate a sufficient volume of material for subsequent leach tests the fine grinding and leach tests are expected to be completed in the 1st quarter of 2019 with final results expected to be available in the 2nd quarter of 2019 the company has completed additional tailings characterization tests and concluded that no material design changes are required to proceed to the economic analysis using a final grind size of 38 45 microns at this time the company anticipates announcing the results of an updated pfs in the 2nd quarter of 2019 mr earnest added we expect the combination of the recently improved gold prices weaker australian dollar and improved gold recovery to have a positive impact on the economics of the mt todd gold project we anticipate that the planned testing programs will confirm our ability to achieve a nearly

amazon founder jeff bezos and his wife of 25 years mackenzie s bezos announced their pending divorce wednesday it s not clear if the couple ever bothered with a prenuptial agreement back in the early 1990s but if mrs bezos were to receive even a third of her husband s current 137 2 billion net worth she d immediately become the wealthiest woman in the word a one third bezos stake worth 45 7 billion would vault her ahead of l oreal heiress francoise bettencourt meyers worth 45 6 billion and walmart heiress alice walton worth 43 6 billion according to the bloomberg billionaires index even better for mackenzie bezos the 48 year old would likely get half of her 54 year old husband s estimated wealth or around 69 billion because of washington state s status as a community property state meaning all property acquired during a marriage is owned equally by both partners and is to be divided in a manner that is fair and equitable it appears obviously they have significant assets and with a long term marriage obviously she will be receiving division of assets that i am sure will be significant given both of their circumstances said seattle based family attorney jennifer payseno amazon s origins trace back to a road trip that the bezoses took together not long after they met in new york while working at hedge fund d e shaw they got married just six months after they began dating according to jeff bezos not long after that he quit his job at shaw and started an online bookstore while his wife did the cross country driving bezos wrote a business plan on the way to seattle chosen for its abundance of tech talent by july 1995 amazon was operating out of a garage with mackenzie bezos lending a hand i was there when he wrote the business plan and i worked with him and many others represented in the converted garage the basement warehouse closet the barbecue scented offices the christmas rush distribution centers and the door desk filled conference rooms in the early years of amazon s history she recalled in 2013 mr bezos on wednesday tweeted a joint statement saying in part we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends we feel incredibly lucky to have found each other and deeply grateful for every one of the years we have been married to each other if we had known we would separate after 25 years we would do it all again that last sentence suggests no prenup according to new york matrimonial lawyer michael calogero they were married 25 years ago and at that point they were relatively young and early in their careers calogero said a lot of people don t have a prenup at that point but a postnuptial agreement or postnup drafted after the couple was married could be in place especially if they experienced separations or counseling over the years it would work much the same as a prenup the only difference is it happened after the parties were married calogero said it could outline spousal support and the duration of it and how assets would be distributed in the event of the divorce divorce lawyers speculate based on the tone of wednesday s announcement that the couple has likely already negotiated a separation agreement that s the way you would typically have handled this circumstance and because the announcement came they most likely have been working on the framework of the settlement payseno said ultimately they ll seek a divorce decree stating that the couple s property will be divided according to the agreement the terms will likely not be disclosed anywhere publicly she added questions loom over how mr bezos 16 percent stake in the amazon will be divided among the future former spouses the company s stock price closed at 1 659 42 a share wednesday giving amazon a total market value of 811 billion higher than any public company on the planet that 16 percent stake will be valued and subject to some sort of division predicted kelly frawley a partner at kasowitz benson torres based in new york they will have to come up with some sort of valuation for the business and figure out what amount of that value his wife should be paid out mrs bezos a princeton graduate is a novelist whose undergraduate work was praised by one of her professors the writer toni morrison who called her one of the best students i ve ever had in my creative writing classes really one of the best according to vogue magazine she s also an anti bullying advocate who in 2014 founded bystander revolution an online resource that offers crowdsourced solutions to defusing bullying monica lewinsky in 2015 joined as a strategic advisor to the organization the couple has four children the associated press contributed to this report

sources u s geological survey global total metals focus world gold council country totals when you take in the table to the left it inspires little beyond a shrug until you consider the policies toward gold of the countries involved china for example is the world s top gold producer but its production is essentially sequestered i e it stays in the country and winds up at the central bank as part of its monetary reserves russia the world s third largest producer also channels its production into central bank reserves thus 23 700 tonnes of the world s gold production in 2017 did not see the light of day on international markets of the top ten producers that still make their production available to the rest of the world production is level for two the united states and australia of the three countries experiencing production growth canada russia and china only one canada makes its production available in international markets in short the world is a different place now than it was prior to the 2008 financial crisis in terms of gold production should physical demand soar once again as did in the 2009 2013 period we could get the same price response we did then even as it is substantially less metal is reaching the marketplace at a time when central banks have become net buyers of the metal and investor demand though presently in a lull is generally on the rise the trends now favor strong handed long term gold investors holding for asset preservation purposes and capable of weathering the market s ups and downs as for the official sector the trend toward building gold reserves is likely to continue more and more emerging countries are likely to see diversification as in their best interest while established states are likely to hold close the gold reserves they already own wild market swings will give seasick investors opportunity to jump ship gold is enjoying a run of positive forecasts of late and acquisition recommendations from various financiers blackrock one of the world s largest hedge funds came out in gold s favor at the start of the year we re constructive on gold portfolio manager russ koesterich told bloomberg on friday we think it s going to be a valuable portfolio hedge we re multi asset investors we think about its effect on the entire portfolio and what we see value in right now is gold s value as a diversifier metals focus the london based market analyst reflected the prevailing opinion on gold as we start the year for much of 2018 said the firm investors tended to focus on other higher yielding asset classes but we do expect this position to gradually change especially during the latter part of 2019 a slowdown in the us economy will encourage the fed to adopt a far more dovish stance towards its interest rate policy metals focus went on to say that a bull market in gold emerge from late 2019 onwards and that uptrend will then remain in place for two to three years one of europe s biggest banks the netherlands abn amro weighs in on gold for 2019 with a ringing endorsement for the future it sees gold at 1400 by year end resulting from a confluence of factors covered briefly at the link above we are of the view that the us dollar and us treasury yields have peaked says georgette boele precious metals and forex strategist at the bank we also expect that us economic growth will peak this quarter during the next two years we expect lower us economic growth and lower 2y and 10y us treasury yields we expect the fed to hike in december 2018 and one more time in 2019 some time during the first half going forward the 2y us treasury yields will probably rise in tandem with inflation expectations so real yields will likely not rise all these factors support our view that the us dollar has peaked and will weaken in 2019 and 2020 therefore we expect gold prices to rally in 2019 gold finished 2018 down 1 6 but ended the year on an optimistic note up 2 1 for the month of december the mostly sideways performance for the year aside gold has been a steady performer since the turn of the 21st century registering gains in fourteen of the first eighteen years as we begin the new year the word change superimposes itself over our new year thinking change that likely will present challenges and test our skills in the year ahead gillian tett the financial times columnist recently made an attempt to explain the wild swings in financial markets in doing so she passes along an interesting observation from seth klarman founder of the blaupost hedge fund in 2008 he says we had massive disguised leverage now we have less financial leverage but there is psychological leverage he goes on to warn about algorithmic leverage and computer herding problems we have written about on these pages for years ms tett who has written with distinction about the financial markets ends with the observation that the propensity toward wild swings rather than a sudden full out crash gives seasick investors opportunity to jump ship that is a course of action worth pondering as we head into the start of what could be another eventful year jumping ship we will point out is one thing establishing a solid portfolio hedge is another the first without the second may turn out to be an empty exercise link to gillian tett s editorial one for the history buffs 730 years of a strong british pound ends in 1931 with gold standard exit the st louis federal reserve recently released this interesting chart on consumer prices from 1209 to present we added the price of gold to the chart to show the direct relationship between declining purchasing power in the british pound and the sterling price of gold after 1931 the year britain departed the gold standard prior to 1931 there was an occasional minor bump higher in the price of gold but for the most part it followed along the same flat line as consumer prices it was only after britain separated the pound from gold in 1931 that the price began to move radically higher in terms of the currency it gained significant momentum after 1971 when the bretton woods agreement was abolished currencies and gold were then allowed to move freely in international markets though interesting from an historical perspective the real lesson in this chart is that when a nation state goes from gold backed to fiat money gold coins and bullion become a logical and worthwhile alternative for citizen investors even after 730 years of relative price stability sources bank of england ice benchmark administration limited st louis federal reserve the naughty boy who blurts out unpleasant truths in the first place the classic writers without neglecting other cases reasoned primarily in terms of an unfettered international gold standard there were several reasons for this but one of them merits our attention in particular an unfettered international gold standard will keep normally foreign exchange rates within specie points and impose an automatic link between national price levels and interest rates the modern mind dislikes this automatism as much for political as for economic reasons it dislikes the fetters this automatism clasps on government management of the economic process dislikes gold the naughty boy who blurts out unpleasant truths but most of the economists of the period under survey liked it for precisely the same reasons though they compromised in practice as in theory and though they admitted central bank management the automatism a phrase beloved by lord overstone was for them who are neither nationalists nor etatistes a moral as well as an economic ideal joseph schumpeter history of economic analysis 1954 published posthumously editor s note to dr schumpeter s well considered discourse on the practical merits of the gold standard i will add a simple thought of my own absent the gold standard the prudent investor who stores gold benefits in concert with the blurting out those unpleasant truths if you have an interest in the kind of analysis you are now reading you might appreciate our live daily newsletter news opinion and analysis as it happens always timely and posted for gold and silver owners or for those thinking about owning it the world s biggest hedge fund is getting whacked the snb swiss national bank writes dollar collapse s john rubino loaded up on big tech like apple amazon and microsoft and rode them to massive profits which enriched both the swiss people and the snb s stockholders in another departure it s a publicly traded company as well as a central bank but live by the sword die by the sword turning your central bank into the world s biggest hedge fund means outsized profits in good times but potentially serious losses if those aggressive bets go wrong there was a time when gold was the centerpiece of the swiss international banking enterprise it seems as rubino points out the snb has departed from its original impeccable standards to mixed results will high volatility lead the gold market higher as it has in the past high volatility in the past has preceded the upward movement in the gold price in a recent article under the headline wild days return to stock market as vix surges like never before bloomberg points out that volatility is now running at levels not seen since the 2008 2009 breakdown and in fact the biggest annual surge on record as you can see in the chart below there was a lag in gold s response to the early phases of the 2008 2009 financial crisis its move upward came once investors realized the full extent of the crisis from there gold pushed to its all time highs did we learn anything from the last crisis at this point the prevailing view holds that qe worked writes credit bubble bulletin s doug noland moreover central banks are seen ready and willing to call upon money printing operations as need the great virtue of this policy course many believe is that there is essentially no limit to the scope and duration of qe infinity the ft quoted mario draghi is permanent and may be usable in contingencies that the governing council will assess in its independence melvyn krauss from the hoover institution captured conventional thinking no one willingly walks into a room from which there is no exit because qe proved temporary because it worked and because it has ended it is likely to be used again when we read of the credit bubble inflated in the form of collateralized loan obligations clos as explicitly identified recently by former fed chair janet yellen one wonders if we learned anything at all from the credit crisis of 2008 and its aftermath we subsequently learned that japanese banks were at risk for over 1 trillion in sliced diced and reconstituted clos noland s concerns are well considered in fact as the highly respected hedge fund manager henry druckenmiller recently pointed out we ve tripled doubled down on what caused that crisis and we tripled down on it globally clos in the contemporary context are today what mortgage backed securities were to financial markets in 2007 and to a great degree the general public is not even aware such a thing exists noland s remarks in full are highly recommended gold s provided a real rate of return in twelve of the last eighteen years since the turn of the new century gold consistently provided a real rate of return on investment when measured against inflation in fact it provided a real rate of return in twelve of the eighteen years represented on the chart the period was one of subdued inflation gold s performance as a result took many analysts and professional money managers by surprise and altered the perception among money managers that the precious metal is solely an inflation hedge 2018 ends in sea of red amidst a sea of red for 2018 stock market volatility comes out the clear winner in what many will see as appropriate for a year that will be remembered as one that most would like to forget bitcoin came out at the bottom of the list down 43 65 gold in a victory of sorts finished down only 4 21 on the year silver by contrast was down 11 82 and the dow jones industrial average was down 6 53 notable quotable problems are likely to continue in emerging markets compounded by rising interest rates and the us fed s monetary policy which has drained global dollar liquidity we have already seen the impact on the turkish and argentinian currencies we remain concerned about geo political problems including brexit north korea and the middle east at a time when populism is spreading globally the resolution of these problems in this unpredictable era will surely be difficult in 9 11 and in the 2008 financial crisis the powers of the world worked together with a common approach co operation today is proving much more difficult this puts at risk the post war economic and security order in the circumstances our policy is to maintain our limited exposure to quoted equities and to enter into new commitments with great caution lord jacob rothschild rit capital partners half yearly financial report june 30 2018 at this stage of an ageing economic cycle investors have good reason for concern as they try to work out whether the rout in equity and credit markets represents a final correction in this cycle or the start of lengthy decline we have not begun a new year in such a glum mood since the start of 2009 and before that 1999 michael mackenzie financial times as the unwind continues financial assets inflated by the free money effects of qe are still finding new equilibrium valuations markets will remain volatile tech change and supply fundamentals will continue to shock us look at oil prices for an example turning a good year for oil and energy into a question mark or look at how iphone sales in india have fallen off a cliff as people buy cheaper phones that do the same commoditisation the thing that scares me most is liquidity the lack of it bill blain blain s morning porridge alan greenspan says the party s over on wall street the former federal reserve chairman who famously warned more than two decades ago about irrational exuberance in the stock market doesn t see equity prices going any higher than they are now it would be very surprising to see it sort of stabilize here and then take off greenspan said in an interview with cnn anchor julia chatterley he added that markets could still go up further but warned investors that the correction would be painful at the end of that run run for cover donna borak cnbc editor s note greenspan over the years has consistently advocated gold ownership as a means to hedging the next financial crisis europe has brought us a depression worse than 1929 it has led to entire peoples being broken and humiliated like the greeks all for the sake of preserving the infernal instrument of the euro this whole disaster has been adorned by a chain of lies shouted ever louder because they are afraid that the colossal damage they have done will be discovered claudio borghi catholic university of milan nobody knows what would happen if britain s lch or germany s eurex clearing came under stress they have thin layers of capital compared to banks before the 2008 crisis most derivatives were cleared by trading parties in direct dealings the g20 shift has lifted the share of ccps for interest rate derivatives from 20 to 60 percent the effect is to concentrate risk the bis warns that the system may encourage a rush for the exit in events of extreme stress the international monetary fund has also flagged the dangers it warned this year that ccps increase the risk of a failure of the infrastructure itself and could lead to a catastrophe if all the layers of defense were overrun by a big default it would be like the failure of the maginot line ambrose evans pritchard bis warns of seizure at heart of financial clearing system for we have reached a critical point in a sense it is true that the mists are lifting we can at least see clearly the gulf to which our present path is leading few of us doubt that we must without much more delay find an effective means to raise world prices or we must expect the progressive breakdown of the existing structure of contract and instruments of indebtedness accompanied by the utter discredit of orthodox leadership in finance and government with what outcome we cannot predict john maynard keynes the means to prosperity 1933 i m fond of saying how crazy things get near the end of bubbles convinced this is history s greatest bubble i ve been anticipating a pretty astonishing variety of crazy watching this all unfold with increasing trepidation i sense an important line has been crossed it s time to retire crazy find a replacement that conjures up something more foreboding more disturbing and markets well they re seemingly fine with it all at times almost giddy and that s the fundamental problem dysfunctional markets continue to promote

as of november 14 2018 vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer thank you dan good morning everyone ricky and i would like to make a few comments and then we will answer your questions our results for the first quarter were solid despite continuing inflationary cost pressures we took several actions in the quarter to address these cost issues including price increases and productivity improvements further our top line growth this quarter continued our long trend of outperforming the overall growth rates of the markets we serve while diluted earnings per share grew 17 to 1 98 a first quarter record i know many of you have already seen have seen our results and ricky will provide more detail later in the call but i d like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the first quarter of 2019 our net sales for the first quarter were a record 933 million an increase of 11 compared with the year ago period reported operating profit was 116 4 million compared with 120 2 million in the year ago period reported diluted earnings per share was 1 98 compared with 1 70 in the year ago period there were adjustments in both quarters for certain special items as well as certain other add backs necessary for our results to be comparable between periods as ricky will explain later in the call in adding back these items one can see adjusted operating profit for the first quarter of 2019 was 134 1 million compared with adjusted operating profit of 135 5 million in the year ago period a slight decrease of 1 adjusted operating profit margin was 14 4 a decrease of 170 basis points compared with the margin reported in the prior year adjusted diluted earnings per share was 2 32 a first quarter record up 20 from the year ago period net cash provided by operating activities was a solid 132 million this quarter while our cash position at the end of the quarter grew to 215 million even after repurchasing 25 million of the company s stock during the quarter leaving us with plenty of liquidity to execute our growth strategies looking at some specific details for the quarter net sales increased almost 11 over the year ago period overall net sales volume grew approximately 11 while price mix of products sold was essentially flat this quarter acquisitions net of divestitures added about one point to our growth which was essentially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency and the adoption of the new accounting standard asc 606 our significant growth in net sales this quarter was due in large part because of continued efforts to expand our customer base and the introduction of new products and solutions we also believe our net sales were favorably impacted somewhat this quarter by customers accelerating orders in advance of the effective dates for announced price increases overall we experienced solid growth in net sales in most channels and geographies as well as most product categories the largest contributors to the increase in net sales volume were due to greater demand for our atrius based luminaires and lighting control solutions as well as several building management solutions created by our distech team and greater shipments of certain high volume more basic lesser featured led fixtures primarily for applications on smaller and mid sized commercial projects as well as our infrastructure and utility products solutions sold through our independent sales network which serves the c i utility and building management channels grew 10 this quarter compared with the year ago period this network comprises approximately 70 of our total net sales this growth was impacted somewhat by continued weak demand for larger nonresidential lighting projects as well as continued product substitution to lower priced alternatives for certain lighting products during the quarter we announced two price increases to recover higher costs for both component and other input items due to inflation as well as the impact of government tariffs enacted on certain china sourced finished goods and components as noted earlier we believe some of the increase in net sales this quarter was due in part to customers buying products this quarter in advance of the effective dates of the announced price increases it is impossible to quantify the exact impact this had on our sales growth is quarter we expect this to have a small dampening effect on our growth rate in the second quarter historically our lowest net sales quarter in any given year due to seasonality though again it is impossible to quantify the impact as you all know changes in price mix have been a headwind each quarter for the last few years so to experience a very slight favorability call it neutral this quarter was a welcome change while it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of changes in the price and mix of products sold we estimate the neutral impact of price mix this quarter was primarily due to changes in channel mix mostly offset by both product price and mix which included substitutions to lower priced alternatives primarily for more basic lesser featured led luminaires sold in certain channels as well as a modest decline in shipments for larger commercial projects as noted earlier lastly while we believe the price increases we ve put in place will be realized much of the sales in the first quarter were at pre increased levels due to both the timing of price increases implemented in various channels as well as shipments of orders at pre increased prices were previously committed projects as part of the company s backlog based on the information from various data collection and forecasting organizations we believe the overall growth rate in the first quarter as measured at dollars for the lighting market in north america was up low single digits reflecting continued improvement in demand reversing the sluggish trend over the last several quarters our net sales growth rate of approximately 11 even excluding any potential pull forward of sales due to the announced price increases stands in stark contrast of the overall goal growth rate of the luminaire market in north america we believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new more innovative and holistic lighting and building management solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to continue to gain overall share in the north american market this quarter our profitability measures for the first quarter were solid given overall market conditions they were impacted mostly by significantly higher costs particularly for certain commodities and components as well as freight and wages which i will address in a moment and to a lesser degree continued product substitution to lower priced alternatives as well as weakness for larger commercial projects our adjusted operating profit for the quarter was 134 million down approximately 1 compared with the year ago period while adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 14 4 down about 170 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year ago period the decrease in adjusted operating profit margin was primarily due to the decline in adjusted gross profit margin adjusted gross profit margin for the first quarter was 39 5 a decrease of about 200 basis points compared with the year ago period it is very important to understand the underlying factors that drove the decline in our margins this quarter and the actions we took to counter those factors as well as the timing of financial impact of those actions adjusted gross profit increased 19 million this quarter over the year ago period driven primarily by higher sales volume and productivity improvements partially offset by higher input costs our adjusted gross profit and margin were negatively impacted by higher input costs for certain items including electronic and oil based components freight and certain other commodity related items such as steel many of these items experienced dramatic increases in price over the last half of our fiscal 2018 due to several economic factors including new tariffs and wage inflation caused by tight labor markets we estimate the inflationary impact of these items reduced our gross profit this quarter by approximately 16 million and lowered our gross profit margin by approximately 170 basis points as noted earlier we took significant actions this quarter that we believe both help and will continue to help offset these and other cost increases including wage inflation as well as the impact of currently enacted increases in tariffs these actions included announced price increases and other measures to improve productivity and reduce costs we believe that due to the timing of price increases they had limited positive benefit on our first quarter results we believe these price increases will begin to offset higher input costs including recently enacted tariffs in our second quarter and beyond it is important to note that our adjusted gross profit margin increased 60 basis points on a sequential basis this quarter from the fourth quarter of 2018 on lower revenues primarily due to the improvement in sales channel mix and actions to improve our cost structure next our adjusted sda expenses were up approximately 20 million compared with the year ago period adjusted sda expense as a percentage of net sales was 25 2 in the first quarter a decrease of 20 basis points from the year ago period demonstrating the leverage of our sda investment as our net sales volume grows the increase in adjusted sda expense was primarily due to higher freight and commission costs to support the increase in net sales greater employee related cost and to a lesser degree added expenses from recent acquisitions partially offset by actions taken in prior periods to streamline the organization excluding the impact of higher freight and commission expense due to the increase in net sales volume more than half of the increase in sda expense compared with prior periods was due to greater employee related costs while our salaried headcount remained essentially flat year over year even after acquisitions we expect that employee related costs will continue to rise in fiscal 2019 as markets for certain skills remain tight contributing to a rise in wage inflation our adjusted diluted eps was a first quarter record of 2 32 compared with 1 94 reported in the year ago period an increase of 20 the increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of the new tax law and the lower average shares outstanding due to stock repurchases during the past year partially offset by a slight decline in operating profit in the quarter as i noted earlier we believe the year over year increases in certain input costs reduced our gross profit by approximately 16 million in the quarter and obviously negatively impact our diluted earnings per share before i turn the call over to ricky i would like to comment on a few important accomplishments this past quarter on the strategic and technology front we continue to make great strides setting the stage for what we believe will be strong revenue growth and profitability over the long term we continue to gain market share in many important product categories and sales channels our tier 3 and 4 solutions were up over 25 this quarter from a commercial perspective we continue to accelerate a number of atrius enabled deployments and increased active programs with several of the largest u s based retailers our atrius based iot luminaires and solutions are becoming the industry standard in the retail segment additionally we continue to expand these solutions into other channels as awareness by customer grows as they come to recognize the full benefits of these solutions including superior visual comfort and energy savings as well as the capabilities of our iot solutions providing them with the opportunity to transform their spaces from nothing more than an expense item into a strategic asset as i mentioned in prior earnings calls it is clear that certain chinese based lighting companies many obviously being subsidized in some form are influencing pricing for certain basic lesser featured fixtures sold in certain channels we will not yield this space for many strategic reasons as such we continued to aggressively expand our contractor select portfolio to profitably compete in this portion of the market also as i mentioned last quarter we introduced in late 2018 the next generation of our industry leading lighting control system nlight air a wireless control system with a wide range of options and functionality for which there was strong customer demand this quarter we believe acuity has the most comprehensive and feature rich wired and wireless lighting control systems available in the nonresidential construction market and importantly they are connected to our growing bms solutions lastly we initiated many actions last year to further streamline our operations to reduce costs and improve our productivity we believe these initiatives both enhanced our performance this quarter and will continue to benefit our operating and financial performance in the future as well as allow us to accelerate investments in areas with higher growth opportunities ricky will have additional comments on this in a moment we ve been able to create these capabilities while providing industry leading results because of the dedication resolve of our many associates who are maniacally focused on serving solving and supporting the needs of our customers i will talk more about our expectations for the balance of 2019 later in the call i would like to now turn the call over to ricky ricky ricky reece executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you vern and good morning everyone as vern mentioned earlier we had some adjustments to the gaap results in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 which we find useful to add back in order for the results to be comparable in our earnings release and form 10 q we provide a detailed reconciliation of non gaap measures for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and 2018 adjusted results exclude the impact of acquisition related items amortization expense for acquired intangible assets share based payment expense and special charges for streamlining activities we believe adjusting for these items and providing these non gaap measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations we think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we recognized a pre tax special charge of 1 million primarily related to move costs associated with the previously announced transfer of activities from a planned facility closure in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year we recorded a pre tax special charge of 200 000 we expect to continue to incur additional costs primarily attributed to early lease termination and moving costs in future periods associated with the closing of certain facilities related to the streamlining actions announced in fiscal year 2018 fiscal 2019 first quarter results were impacted by the adoption of accounting standards codification 606 revenues from contracts with customers which negatively impacted current period revenues by 2 4 million gross profit by 1 1 million and operating profit by 1 2 million as compared with the prior year period additionally fiscal 2018 results were restated to reflect the impact of adopting a new accounting standard regarding retirement benefits which resulted in an increase in operating profit of 1 6 million with an equal offsetting increase in other expenses resulting in no impact on fiscal 2018 reported net income or eps please refer to note 4 and 5 to our financial statements included in our form 10 q filed earlier today for additional details of the impact of the adoption of new accounting standards on both the income statement and balance sheet as part of adopting asc 606 you can see in our form 10 q filed today that we are providing disaggregated revenues by the major sales channels of one independent sales network which includes c i agencies infrastructure utility agencies system integrators and showrooms two direct sales network three retail network which includes home centers and digital retail four corporate accounts and five all other which is primarily oem international and catalog the effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was 25 2 compared with 35 5 in the prior year quarter the effective income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was significantly impacted by the provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act which was enacted during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 we currently estimate that our blended effective income tax rate before discrete items will approximate 24 to 26 for fiscal 2019 we generated 132 million of net cash flow provided by operating activities during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with 140 million for the year ago period operating working capital defined as receivables plus inventory less payables decreased 31 million during the first three months of fiscal 2019 this decrease is largely due to reduced account receivable balance our operating working capital days increased 10 days to 60 days primarily due to higher inventory at november 30 2018 compared to august 31 2018 at november 30 2018 we added cash and cash equivalent balance of 215 million an increase of 86 million since august 31 2018 this increase was due primarily to cash flow from operations partially offset by cash used to repurchase common stock to invest in plant and equipment and to pay dividends we repurchased 200 000 shares for 25 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 in addition we have repurchased an additional 200 000 shares for 24 million since the end of our first quarter we have 4 8 million shares remaining under our current share repurchase board authorization our investment in capital expenditures was 14 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 an increase of almost 4 million compared with the prior year period we currently expect to invest approximately 1 5 of net sales in capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 on june 29 2018 we entered into a new credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides us with a 400 million five year unsecured revolving credit facility and a 400 million unsecured delayed draw five year term loan facility our total debt outstanding was 357 million at november 30 2018 our debt to capitalization at august 31 2018 was 16 9 and net debt to capital was 7 5 we had additional borrowing capacity of 795 million at november 30 2018 under our new credit and term loan facilities which do not expire until june 2023 we clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility to support our growth opportunities which may include acquisitions and we will continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value thank you and i ll turn the call back over to vern vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer thank you ricky while current market conditions in the lighting industry continue to be challenging we continue to be optimistic regarding our long term future we believe our many actions to improve our market reach enhance our customer solutions and capabilities and to drive companywide productivity will help optimize our financial performance in the future while affording us the opportunity to continue to invest in areas we believe have high growth potential over the long term our robust sales growth significant cash flow and upper quartile return on invested capital are reflective of our strong operating performance despite some of these current industry headwinds our views on overall market demand for the lighting market and items influencing costs have not really changed over the last quarter so let me reiterate some of those key items that could influence our performance for the balance of fiscal 2019 many independent third party forecasts continue to suggest the overall construction market as measured in dollars will grow in the low to mid single digit range we still believe the lighting industry will lag the overall growth rate of construction market somewhat primarily due to continued product substitution to lower priced alternatives for certain products sold through certain channels though recent industry pricing actions should have a favorable impact on growth as measured in dollars additionally we expect that labor shortages in certain markets could continue to negatively impact growth rates for both construction and lighting while the u s government delayed the implementation of increased tariffs to 25 from the current 10 for certain imported chinese made finished goods until march 1 we believe the outcome of the entire tariff situation could have a dampening effect on overall demand due to higher component cost and finished good prices further it is evident that the global trade issues have certainly created greater volatility in demand in our various end markets and we expect that to continue as previously mentioned we believe the announced price increases and other actions taken will in time offset the increases in cost for various items noted earlier while increases in some input costs such as steel have leveled off for now we expect other costs and expenses such as imported electrical components and finished goods freight and wages will continue to rise these potential cost increases questions and answers operator thank you matt mccall from seaport global securities you may go ahead matt mccall seaport global securities analyst thanks good morning guys so vern maybe start with the comment you made about expanding contractor select to profitably compete in that market can you talk about the just the trends since the reinvigoration or reintroduction of that product the trends in the profitability in recent quarters and then expectations just trying to understand what you were referencing when you made that specific comment vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer sure well just to further make a comment i wasn t able to finish the prepared remarks so there are probably some other important things that i ll touch on as we get toward the end of the call but matt let me begin to address your questions yes contractor select was a relaunch of a product portfolio that was directed at if you will lesser featured more value oriented products and what we did is we had a number of products branded maybe under lithonia but we created recreated if you will a contractor select to have a more fulsome portfolio directed specifically at that market with new products that had better cost structures for us better price points some of those products continue to be manufactured both in asia as well as in our north american manufacturing footprint so our margins in those have improved and we continue to see growth contractor select is designed to serve both the home center channel as well as the electrical distribution channel and then to a lesser degree showrooms and our digital retail capability so we continue to see growth in those in that portfolio and it did have or has had some positive impact on our margins as we said in the quarter which was really exciting for us price mix overall was very slightly favorable let s just call it neutral which is the first time we ve experienced that geez ricky in probably in the last two to three years so part of that benefit has been due to actions taken like the introduction of contractor select matt mccall seaport global securities analyst ok thank you and maybe continuing on that thought the you mentioned some of the product comes from asia your manufacturing part of it i guess i m trying to understand the impact on your gross contribution margin do you still get the same leverage opportunities from that sourced product and will that i m really thinking about the substitution effect of just the product coming in out of asia do you sacrifice some maybe leverage opportunity but you benefit from lower costs i m assuming or i m sure just help me understand the impact in how we should think about gross contribution margin from just pure volume just given the shifts in substitution or trends with substitution dan smith senior vice president treasurer and secretary sure so as we stated in our 10 k approximately 20 of our total sales are produced by others about 15 ricky is produced in asia ricky reece executive vice president and chief financial officer correct 15 yes vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer i think that was the number so that s up a little bit from say prior years we obviously have a very strong supply chain in asia when you say we lose a little bit of leverage sure when you re not manufacturing in your own facilities increases in volume you re not able to really leverage that across your fixed cost base but we like the margin profile of our portfolio and contractor select and as we think about product substitution again this quarter it was essentially awash price mix was essential awash which again first time in a long time so the efforts that we re putting in to products like contractor select not just contractor select allowed us to again have price mix be awashed i would tell you that product substitution it will continue and the way we are attacking that to offset product substitution and what that simply means is that we are moving from a product that has one price point to something that has a lower price point it s entirely possible that the gross profit margin on the lower price point item is actually higher as a percentage of the sale than on the higher price point so we continue to push our mix as a company into those areas that we realize both higher profit dollars as well as higher profit margin a good example of that is in our controls business our controls overall business and it s impossible to call it a separate business because so much of our controls are embedded into our luminaires but we re seeing great uplift as we continue to introduce new products and solutions such as nlight air into the marketplace with great demand so that benefit of that price mix was also because of the introduction of products like that matt mccall seaport global securities analyst ok very helpful thank you vern operator thank you and our next question comes from jeffrey sprague from vertical research partners you may go ahead sir jeffrey sprague vertical research partners analyst thank you good morning everyone hey two from me first on substitution i wonder if you have a sense of how much is happening kind of at the front end relative to the initial bid versus a response to price cost dynamics in the project later in the construction process and a need to get costs out given other inflationary pressures that may have arisen during the project itself is there is a discernible difference there vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer well let me take a cut at it and then ricky can take a cut product substitution is occurring in two key areas and it s just it s interesting it s trends of how people want to if you will use light the shift from certain 2 by 2 2 by 4 1 by 4 fixtures to flat panels for example is a trend that has been in the marketplace for a while so as acuity ramps up its capabilities in the flat panel business and i believe that today we are the largest seller of flat panels in the north american market at least that s what our data would suggest and that s over the last call it less than 18 months that that s occurred well that product is replacing certain other form factors and those other form factors were simply at higher prices and so that s an example another example is slim form wafers replacing certain types of down lighting again profitability off of those products for us is from a margin percentage is favorable but yet just pure dollars because the physical construct of that product is meaningfully different than something that it is substituting in certain applications so it is both upfront but it s also in our stock business it s also being sold through whether it s electrical distribution channel or whether it s being sold through the home center or the showroom or our digital retail capabilities for what i ll call renovation projects it s just people looking at different choices that they have in terms of how they want their space to look and how they want it to operate and so that product substitution or that shift is having some change on top line if you will dollars units are obviously up higher but dollars tend to be lower and this is again why for me it s very exciting for us to show an almost an 11 top line growth while all of this is going on jeffrey sprague vertical research partners analyst and also just on tier 3 tier 4 you continue to see good growth in units can you give us a little update though in terms of actually turning the capabilities on what s happening there service revenues associated with it etc vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes we re seeing nice growth but off of an incredibly small base and so what we ve learned in this process is that people who deploy our atrius based luminaires are looking for some level of critical mass within their own facilities or number of facilities so as they install they re now beginning to experiment use we have certain customers that are much further along than others and they are now actually starting to use apps within their space we re helping them do that that obviously creates an increase in if you will revenue stream for acuity but the tier 4 saas revenues are still really small but growing i mean they re doubling so we re very very excited about the prospects of what that saas revenue looks like particularly as customers start to use the solutions or use the capabilities of the solutions that they purchased and so as expected it s now starting to ramp and you re seeing that multiplier effect occur but again against the 3 8 billion acuity brands it really does not move the needle just yet but it will it s moving the needle by the way in us selling iot enabled luminaires in a very significant way the part of our growth is because of our enterprise solutions capability which is selling virtually all iot enabled luminaires and that piece of our business continues to grow nicely jeffrey sprague vertical research partners analyst right thanks operator thank you our next question comes from john walsh with credit suisse you may go ahead sir john walsh credit suisse analyst hi good morning vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer good morning john walsh credit suisse analyst so i m going to apologize because i don t know if i fully understood the answer to jeff s question but maybe i can just ask it again in a little different way as we think about the product substitution is that when the project first starts so when the initial bid happens or are you seeing the general contractors actually break the spec later in the construction process and then seeing the substitution happening there where you have to go and fight what the contractor is trying to do to the spec just trying to understand that dynamic a little bit better vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes that s a great question so generally speaking for projects products like this are spec ed in but the normal cycle of just general contracting capabilities is that they may spec something else and this has happened historically for years for decades you get down to now at the end of the project because lighting is some of the last stuff in someone may say listen i need to alter the specification to a degree because i m out of budget and i need to be in budget so some of these products provide great alternatives but their features and benefits are not the same as what may have been spec ed in so you can have a combination of both but for acuity again if you go back to more traditional lighting acuity never participated in the lamp ballast replacement business today we have a product portfolio that is amply suited for replacement of existing luminaires so when we sell these types of products through certain channels very often they are for renovation projects which we have said for a long time is a growth rich opportunity for acuity or they may be part of smaller projects where there is not a specification and the builder is saying hey this product looks like it s a fantastic opportunity or the owner says this is something that i like flat panels as a form factor are becoming very popular and so again that product substitution is because that product category is growing significantly because people like those form factors it s simply displacing other types of product that may have had a higher price point and they re willing to accept any feature or benefit difference should there be any so it can be both but generally speaking someone is not using that flat panel to break a spec they re using it as something that they have specified in and acuity will be introducing a spec grade product or a flat panel family which is a whole different opportunity but no i would say that it s part of the normal course of business and these features and benefits that these products have are attractive at those price points john walsh credit suisse analyst ok thank you and then just thinking about this potential or the prebuy impact ahead of the price increases obviously very difficult to parse that out but you did say you thought there could be some dampening impact in the next quarter i mean is that to think a couple of points is that kind of the order of magnitude that you have in your head when you use the word dampening or is there a more specific range that you would point us to vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes i would say to the extent because it s impossible for us to precisely quantify it i would say that to the extent we assume there was some and we ve seen some evidence but to quantify that and say ok here is a number we just we didn t even try because it wouldn t have been worth that effort but to the extent that there was some it would have been generally speaking a pull primarily from q2 into q1 we can t estimate it ricky any other thoughts on that ricky reece executive vice president and chief financial officer no i mean we ve looked at it in a lot of different ways some of the pull forward was within the same quarter so obviously it has no impact on our quarterly results so it s pretty hard to put a bread basket around it john walsh credit suisse analyst ok i appreciate it thank you ricky reece executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you the next question comes from tim wojs from baird you may go ahead sir tim wojs robert w baird co analyst hey guys good morning vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer good morning tim wojs robert w baird co analyst just on i m just curious just if you could give us a little bit of color on just what you re seeing around pricing traction in the marketplace i know there s a lot of variabilities between price and mix but if you just look at like for like pricing and based on some of the increases that you ve put in the market is there any sort of estimate you could give or what you re seeing in terms of how much of those price increases are starting to stick vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer ricky do you want to tackle that ricky reece executive vice president and chief financial officer yes in the quarter is as vern said in his prepared remarks very little impact in this first quarter most of the price increases were implemented mid quarter and we protected certain channels as well as the delay due to projects as vern mentioned that were in our backlog but we are committed to the price increase and do see evidence that in most of the channels it is sticking it is coming in at different time lines in different channels but we are continuing to be pretty firm in our resolve with the increases because they were real cost increases inflationary as well as the tariffs that we re needing to offset and we are holding firm most of the major competitors have announced similar if not identical price increases to us so that is encouraging but as we always see in price increases it varies by geography it will vary by channel somewhat as to how quickly they get implemented and to what extent but we still are very committed to the announced increases we put out vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer and ricky if i could just pile on a little bit two thirds of our total business is bid business and so and that hasn t changed we have experienced real cost increases we will continue to aggressively look to recover those both through price increases that we ve announced as well as productivity improvements we look at every project and decide whether that s something a piece of business that we re after as ricky pointed out different channels have different contractual obligations so we are implementing our price increases because these cost increases are real to us and we re evaluating as we always do what our product portfolio looks like relative to how we serve and support our customer base relative to how we make money and so we are aggressively focused on pushing through price generally speaking the industry is pretty disciplined when cost increases come about of putting those into the marketplace and to the extent that those things ebb and flow yes on the bid business we look to optimize our profitability by all measures so we have seen our price increases be implemented into the marketplace and we re pleased with the progress that we ve made so far tim wojs robert w baird co analyst great great and then just thinking about seasonality and just trying to make sure we re all on the same page the second quarter is typically your weakest revenue quarter so while i think price would probably have a little bit of a sequential impact you d also lose some leverage so is it fair to assume that the gross margin sequentially are down some from q1 just in line with historical seasonality before seeing a more market improvement in the stronger months in your fiscal year vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes i would say that this seasonality is normal we ve had this for forever and you re absolutely correct in assuming that the leverage of volume does have an impact we are looking to recover some of the cost increases that we ve through price again as we said earlier the timing of some of these things depending on the channel the contracts that you have with the customer but no our expectation is that as we enter into q2 it will not be materially different than other q2s as it relates to the seasonality i do have well we are optimistic we re seeing positive signs within the construction market we continue to see some of the volatility in demand that is caused by people s concerns around tariffs and what s going to happen in trade negotiations i wish i could tell you differently we have a positive view of the overall market but it s still tempered by what happens intra quarter from one quarter to the next because someone says hey i m going to wait to see what happens with this trade policy it s just it s frustrating for us because we believe that there is momentum out there and there is a real need if i look at all of the demographics of rising employment vacancy rates going down rental rates going up absorption of real estate these are all favorable signs and longer term bullish signs for nonresidential construction so it s a bit of a dr jekyll and hyde kind of thing but overall we re net positive in what we see going forward tim wojs robert w baird co analyst thanks for the comments good luck operator thank you our next question comes from ryan merkel with william blair you may go ahead sir ryan merkel william blair analyst hey thanks i just want to follow up on the gross margin question so do you think that you re going to recover the 170 basis points of price cost in the fiscal second quarter or might it take a little longer vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer so as ricky and i said the price increases that have been enacted some of those take time to roll in because of contractual obligations because of our backlog i think we will make good progress on recapturing those costs we don t give guidance on that entirely i don t want to comment completely on that but our price increases and our resolve around capturing those price increases are important for us to recover our costs ricky reece executive vice president and chief financial officer and i would just comment brian that and vern had it in his prepared remarks we are still seeing inflationary cost increases beyond what we ve historic what are in our first quarter results so wage inflation is alive and well our merit increases went into effect mid or second last third of our first quarter so all of that impact will be in our second quarter so we will continue to have some inflationary cost increases we need to offset all the reason why these price increases were so necessary ryan merkel william blair analyst got it so it sounds like you expect to make progress that we shouldn t expect you can recover the full amount in the fiscal second quarter vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer we don t give guidance ryan merkel william blair analyst ok fair enough all right and then back to the issue of pull forward maybe just comment on the order rate in december potentially that could tell us a little bit about what s going on and what the pull forward could be vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes we have not seen a meaningful change compared to the prior year in our order rates again my concern is less around the pull forward and more around just how do people release projects how are people feeling about their businesses it is becoming more and more evident to us that labor shortages in large markets are having a dampening effect on construction in general and then lighting to a lesser degree so we are looking at the overall demand and why are people doing things we continue to see strength in smaller and midsized projects which may not be as impacted by labor shortages as larger projects so we can continue to see this dynamic going on it gets exacerbated to a degree or the fluctuation volatility to a degree because of q2 weather related things but no we continue to see what we would call normal trend so again that s why it s impossible for us to say oh gosh it s this percent that will impact first quarter versus second quarter ricky reece executive vice president and chief financial officer i would just mention while not directly part of your question another uncertainty out there is this potentially next round of tariff increases on finished goods coming from china march 1 is the date the administration said those would become effective which is obviously the end of our second quarter will those go forward what impact may that have on demand but also on potential pull forward because we ve indicated as others that we re going to have a price increase contemporaneous with that tariff increase so that s another uncertainty we re looking at here in the second quarter it could have an impact on order rates depending on whether that tariff increase goes forward or not ryan merkel william blair analyst very helpful guys i ll pass it on thanks operator thank you our next question comes from rich kwas with wells fargo securities deepa raghavan wells fargo securities analyst good morning this is deepa for rich kwas hope you re well two quick questions for me first one is can you comment on the state of nonres cycle and what you re hearing from the field especially commercial versus institutional large commercial softness obviously you continue to mention that in your project commentary but do you think that is cycle driven or is that more like a short term impact from all the headline uncertainty tariffs etc that we see vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer so on the nonres piece for small medium projects i think that again the portfolio of solutions that acuity and to a degree others have to offer are favorable energy saving so good returns on investments so i think that people continue to move those along particularly to the extent that they have access to electricians in their local market so i see that as being favorable larger projects all of the big indicators rental rates rental vacancy absorption of real estate employment all of those are usually leading indicators of construction particularly around medium and larger projects without getting into the specific verticals of nonresidential construction we still have favorable but our favorability or optimism is somewhat tempered by again in some of these key markets the availability of electricians to do some of these projects and by the way what we re talking about here is growth right all of these folks have good backlogs they have projects out there whether they re the electrical distributor or the electrical contractor it s just that if their workforce is a limiting factor to their ability to grow and again in the lighting space we continue to experience a bit of deflation for the reasons we ve all articulated i think that there should be legs there in terms of what s going to happen in nonresidential construction but we have to solve some of these labor issues deepa raghavan wells fargo securities analyst got it can you comment on your residential piece of business i mean what was your resi growth in the quarter and have you seen any deceleration or stability in that piece of your business vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes so we don t measure it exactly as residential because we sell product that has residential applications and or light commercial applications through multiple channels we would sell those products through the home center channel we would sell them through the electrical distribution channel we would sell them through the showroom channel those products or those channels as ricky pointed out earlier are network sales for us that represents about 70 of our business which would have some resi in there it was up about 10 on the retail channel ricky which would also be resi and light commercial we saw favorability there so we continue to see favorable movements i know that residential construction has kind of moved sideways here a little bit but i think that that is just temporary i mean you look at the number of workers the population continues to grow rental rates continue to increase i just i m still bullish over the long term on residential construction and capabilities and i think acuity is well positioned to play there deepa raghavan wells fargo securities analyst got it final one for me so just given all the prebuy and all the due to the price increases can you comment on the state of inventory in the channel should we be concerned at all i mean you talked about some pull forward but just curious on the inventory in the channel vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes i don t know that i m saying that there s inventory in the channel i think that the channel manages its inventory pretty well both on residential and nonresidential but from our perspective our inventories are up a bit because we have extended some of our supply chain to asia that s increased a little bit adding a little bit more inventory into the system but we also continue to grow in certain markets pick our enterprise solution market where as that business grows we re required to maintain certain levels of inventory to support store renovation construction and so that s caused us to have to carry a little bit more inventory but i think that the channel of the electrical distribution the channel of the home center so on and so forth all those inventory levels seem to be appropriate given the economic activity that s out there operator thank you and our final question comes from christopher glynn with oppenheimer you may go ahead sir christopher glynn oppenheimer holdings analyst thanks good morning guys vern did i catch that someone out there may be thought you should tighten your prepared comments i guess so vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer thank you chris i think that was you and by the way all the questions that folks asked that was in my prepared remarks christopher glynn oppenheimer holdings analyst i m sure so your volume outgrowth was pretty profound in the second half of last year i m wondering how to think about those comparison run rates there in the absence of guidance how would you advise we consider that and maybe part of that context is if you could describe the trend with the building breadth of customers now creating critical tier 3 mass for themselves pursuant to entering the tier 4 base vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes our business continues to diversify both in terms of within channels so if you look at the home center business we continue to diversify our customer base there also looking to evaluate our portfolio in some of those things so there s a little bit of ebbing and flowing going on i love what we re doing in our enterprise solutions capabilities this is really where we re selling our iot and atrius enabled luminaires into retail and other segments specifically on how they purchase well those the acceptance of those products are significant but the problem not the problem the opportunity is that that s very lumpy i mean when someone says hey look we don t want you in our retail stores from the beginning of november until the kind of middle of january you could appreciate that s when they make most of their money in terms of a lot of these retailers so anyway i expect our growth to continue to outpace the overall growth rate of the markets that we serve we ve had a good track record of doing that some of the influences that we ve had here over the last couple of quarters as we mentioned we expanded our customer base in certain channels which caused us to have a bit of call it load in of certain things some of those things will come back to normal volume and activity so it may not be quite to the level because you don t have those load ins happening every quarter that we experienced in fourth and first quarter but again i think that we will we have a long track record of outperforming the overall growth rates of the markets that we serve and i think that that s probably a pretty good indicator as you think about your models of how did we grow last year how do you think the markets going to grow where do you think acuity is going to be i think you can get yourself into a reasonable range around that christopher glynn oppenheimer holdings analyst yes that works and then just the inventory is up on the magnitude of a quarter year over year just wondering if you could comment on the strategic aspects of that inventory build versus whatever working capital execution factors and the free cash flow conversion outlook for the year vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer sure so we continue to have good cash flow conversion our inventory levels as we bring on whether it be through enterprise solutions or customers in certain other channels we are working that into our business but our expectations would be that we would improve our inventory turns as our business processes to support that those growing aspects of our business come into both focus as well as we get our processes honed out said simply we have too much inventory right now relative to the service levels it s just getting those processes honed between ourselves and the customers their pos their store increases some of the projects that we have worked on within our utility channel our utility business continues to grow significantly well there are requirements for inventory until we get that pipeline really smoothed out we ve added inventory to support the service levels so our expectation as a company and it s really critical to us to get our inventory turns back to where they should be with levels of service that are commensurate with customers expectations so i believe that by the end of the year you will see our inventory turns and our inventory levels improve relative to the it s days on hand that s important and it s service that s important it s not the dollars that are important so we want to get those metrics back to where we think we ought to be operating christopher glynn oppenheimer holdings analyst thanks have a good one operator thank you i would like to turn the call back over to mr vernon nagel for closing remarks vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer folks thank you so much yes some of my remarks were cut off a bit but i think we answered some of the things i would have said during the q a so again i d like to thank you for your time this morning again we strongly believe we are focusing on the right objectives deploying the proper strategies and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that have the potential over the longer term to deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders our future is bright thank you for your support operator duration 65 minutes call participants dan smith senior vice president treasurer and secretary

couple who has been married for 25 years has decided to go separate ways as our family and close friends know after a long period of loving exploration and trial separation we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends the 54 year old wrote on twitter the post suggests the split was on good terms with jeff noting we feel incredibly lucky to have found each other and deeply grateful for every one of the years we have been married to each other if we had known we would separate after 25 years we would do it all again the couple who share three sons and a daughter they adopted from china has received a lot of support on social media with many crediting them for such an amicable split life of the world s richest power couple jeff bezos is currently the richest man alive he and his soon to be ex wife mackenzie 48 have an estimated net worth of more than us136 billion a189 billion according to forbes mostly thanks to his holdings in amazon the pair first met at d e shaw co an investment management firm in new york jeff was a vice president and was the first person to interview mackenzie a fellow princeton graduate at the firm where she went on to work as a research associate after she got the gig they became office neighbours and friends all day long i listened to that fabulous laugh she told voguein 2013 how could you not fall in love with that laugh jeff meanwhile described her as resourceful smart brainy and hot saying he knew from the beginning that he wanted to marry her mackenzie made the first move according to a business insider profile of their marriage the pair married in 1993 six months after she first asked him out to lunch a year later they moved to seattle and founded amazon mackenzie said that while she was not a business person she felt the passion in his voice when he spoke about the idea in the company s early stages she worked as an accountant they ve come a long way since their early days jeff would go on to become the world s richest man surpassing microsoft co founder bill gates three months ago he s also the first person in modern history to amass a fortune of more than us100 billion 136 billion he founded space company blue origin in 2000 and is funnelling us1 billion a year of his own fortune into pulling it out of start up mode and into production meanwhile mackenzie armed with an english degree from princeton took a creative writing course with nobel laureate toni morrison who called her one of the best students i ve ever had in my creative writing classes really one of the best she eventually became a novelist winning an american book award for her 2005 debut novel the testing of luther albright for her second book traps she chose not to share her work with her husband until it was finished she said it took her roughly a decade to write her first book in part because she wanted to spend more time with her children jeff was immensely supportive of his wife s work he has been known to take an entire day off to read her finished manuscripts in one uninterrupted sitting jeff is my best reader she told vogue in 2013 the bezos family life is surprisingly low key the pair described themselves as a case of opposites attract with mackenzie telling vogue his outgoing and sociable personality complimented her shyness he likes to meet people he s a very social guy she said cocktail parties for me can be nerve racking the brevity of conversations the number of them it s not my sweet spot despite their astronomical wealth the bezos family are notoriously low key with the businessman famously washing the dishes each night and his wife dropped him off at work in their honda accord after they took their four kids to school every day until 2013 danny hillis a close family friend told vogue that the bezoses were such a normal close knit family it s almost abnormal even though his work oversees amazon and its more than half a million employees jeff never schedules early morning meetings so that he can spend time with his family often making breakfast for his four children the new york postreported last year he also insists on getting eight hours of sleep every night and enjoys washing dishes after family dinners i m pretty convinced it s the sexiest thing i do he once told an interviewer jeff and mackenzie are ending their marriage after 25 years over their 25 years together the pair has undergone a major style transition photos of the amazon ceo from the late 1990s showed him in geek chic pleated khaki pants baggy button up shirts and heavy suits this photo of jeff from 1997 shows him in head to toe geek chic today he s known for his tight shirts and toned physique and is often compared to actor vin diesel in the media today with his shaved head and toned figure the billionaire is barely recognisable from how he looked in the 1990s he looked a little pasty and rumpled after the 90s and now he s clearly working out every day brad stone author of the everything store jeff bezos and the age of amazon told mail online last april by august the new york times was describing jeff as a fully fledged style icon mackenzie underwent a similar fashion transition in the early years of their marriage she was photographed in casual tracksuits and t shirts and sported a shorter sportier haircut these days she rocks a more glamorous wardrobe regularly rocking floor length designer gowns on red carpets according to jeff she s a real fashion lover and he would often buy her surprise gifts sometimes i call her and say what s your such and such size and she says why and i say none of your business he told vogue it delights her mackenzie has undergone a major style transition both jeff and mackenzie have a far more glamorous look than they did 20 years ago although the family has collectively amassed a huge fortune the bezos family foundation gave out only us23 480 257 au32 077 467 in contributions mostly to schools and universities across the country in 2016 according to the latest available federal tax filings the non profit s directors include parents jacklyn and miguel their children jeff christina and mark in addition to mackenzie mark s wife lisa and christina s husband stephen poore last september jeff took to twitter to announce that he and mackenzie were setting aside us2 billion au2 7 billion to finance a new non profit the day one families fund which would help the homeless and set up a network of montessori schools in impoverished communities what will the separation mean for mackenzie the details of the couple s divorce settlements are unknown but legal experts agree it s unlikely to impact amazon or turn bitter it s unclear whether the couple had a prenuptial agreement but according to usa today it s unlikely people get prenuptial agreements when they have assets to protect said stuart slotnick chairman of the matrimonial department of law firm buchanan ingersoll rooney in new york city in this case they had no real assets vis à vis amazon because when they got married amazon did not exist whatever the agreement he said it most likely would not impact amazon s operations particularly considering the amicable nature of the split wendy crew a family law specialist in alabama said the pair may have gotten a postnuptial agreement instead given they had significant earning potential but she agrees that the wording of their statement suggests future proceedings won t be a nasty process they are successful in their lives crew said so most likely they are going to be able to be successful co parenting together the separation is unlikely to impact amazon legal experts say according to reuters the divorce should have no material impact on the company and its shares with refinitiv eikon data showing mackenzie does not hold any amazon shares directly liat sadler a san francisco matrimonial lawyer noted that spouses owe a fiduciary duty to one another they have duties not to waste or devalue marital resources and to keep the value of marital property as high as possible she told the outlet i don t think there is an issue of concern for shareholders as to what will happen to amazon because of the divorce ms sadler said the main options facing the couple regarding amazon stock were for jeff to buy out his wife or for mackenzie to retain shares if she trusts that he would manage amazon well either he should pay her for her share of the stock or they could enter a more complicated agreement where she keeps stock and he keeps voting rights she said while the pair are separating the wording of their announcement suggests there is still room for them to work together on future projects we also see wonderful futures ahead as parents friends partners in ventures and projects and as individuals pursuing ventures and adventures originally published as amazon founder jeff bezos and wife mackenzie announce divorce on twitter

china s president xi jinping l and u s president donald trump attend a welcome ceremony at the great hall of the people in beijing nov 9 2017 a reader comments on the the trade war between the u s and china fred dufour afp getty images for months president donald trump s economic advisers have cheered chinese economic suffering celebrating every sign of weakness in stock markets manufacturing retail sales investment since it surely means china is on the verge of a humiliating capitulation to trump s demands now might be a good time to put the schadenfreude to rest not only because it s a bit gauche as is becoming increasingly clear there s also a self interest reason to stop rooting for the world s second largest economy to falter when china sneezes the rest of the world can catch a cold including perhaps the united states advertisement article continues below this ad there are multiple avenues through which the u s china trade war has already harmed the united states first are the tariffs that the president has placed on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of chinese products which sounds like it would only hurt china except that most chinese imports targeted by trump are inputs that u s firms need to manufacture their own products some of those chinese goods have no alternative sourcing noted syracuse university economics professor mary e lovely even when workarounds from other countries are available they are often not perfect substitutes and lead to higher pricing for u s companies and ultimately u s consumers then there are the tit for tat tariffs that china has placed on american products these retaliatory duties have foreclosed new market opportunities and destroyed relationships cultivated over decades by u s farmers manufacturers and other entrepreneurs advertisement article continues below this ad then there s the continued uncertainty surrounding the future of our trading relationship with china this has complicated investment and hiring decisions not to mention firms access to equity based financing while trump blames the federal reserve and democrats for stock market volatility the damage his trade wars has wrought is large and quantifiable trade policy news has triggered major daily jumps in u s stock prices swings of at least 2 5 percent four times since march for context that happened only seven times before total over the previous 118 years according to university of chicago professor steven j davis in a forthcoming paper with scott r baker nicholas bloom and kyle kost davis has constructed a new equity market volatility index based on keywords in news stories about stock market movements the index finds that trade policy uncertainty over trade policy was flagged in 26 percent of articles related to equity market volatility since march compared with just 2 7 percent between 1985 and 2015 finally there s the issue of the chinese economy itself advertisement article continues below this ad depending on whom you ask china may have been overdue for a sharp slowdown or even a recession long before the trade war began given its structural problems but the trade war could tip the balance it might lead investors to suddenly re evaluate china s long term growth prospects cornell university professor eswar prasad told me the global fallout from a chinese recession would be devastating it would harm many of our closest allies in east asia including south korea and japan which count china as one of their most important export markets and of course there is the fallout for u s firms that do business in china last week apple slashed its revenue forecast noting that falling sales in china were responsible for more than 100 percent of its global revenue decline not because apple had been directly hit by tariffs but because the chinese economy was slowing it s not going to be just apple white house council of economic advisers chairman kevin hassett said the following day i think that there are a heck of a lot of u s companies that have a lot of sales in china that are basically going to be watching their earnings be downgraded next year until we get a deal with china advertisement article continues below this ad markets as expected plummeted this was a dunderheaded thing to say out loud but hassett was right apple isn t the only u s company at risk in a china slowdown ford and general motors for instance have also seen their chinese sales plummet maybe as hassett and others argue the prospect of a chinese recession would be so unbearable to beijing that its leaders have no choice but to give trump everything he wants i remain skeptical in part because trump can t decide what he wants in the meantime team trump should be careful what it wishes for
amazon is worth over 120b kroll says really the only other assets he has are the washington post and his blue origin and he finally started to sell some of his shares to earmark for philanthropy but nearly almost all of it is tied up in amazon when asked if mackenzie will get shares in the company kroll tells e news she s going to have to get shares in the company i would imagine again because almost all of his net worth is tied up in the amazon stock so the question is just how much will she get and my prediction is that he will probably still be voting them so he will still control them but they will be in her name kroll also says that it s not known whether the exes had a prenup or if there was a postnup what we do know is that they met when they were very young kroll says they meet at de shaw which is a hedge fund in new york so they actually drove cross country together they ve been married 25 years and he started amazon after they were married

bloomberg just a few weeks ago 2019 was being touted as the biggest year for flashy public market debuts in a decade nine days into the year the u s government shutdown could ruin the fun before it even gets started uber technologies inc and lyft inc both of which have filed confidentially with regulators for initial public offerings believe the shutdown could slow the timeline of their listings according to people familiar with the matter while the final outcome depends on how long it takes for the securities and exchanges commission to reopen and how substantial the feedback is when it does neither company has gotten any comments from the agency said the people who asked not to be identified as the details aren t public uber and lyft had been targeting their ipos for the first half of the year spokesmen for each company declined to comment the ride sharing giants among the year s most hotly anticipated ipos aren t the only ones likely to face delays with thousands of sec employees furloughed until the shutdown ends the agency can perform only the most basic of market functions with limited staff available to respond to emergency situations involving market integrity and investor protection according to a notice on its website bond trading platform tradeweb markets llc has also filed confidentially for an ipo that could value it at more than 4 billion but the timing may be delayed by the shutdown people with knowledge of the matter said wednesday meanwhile some companies involved in active mergers and acquisitions have signaled to investors that their pending takeovers could drag on serious delays another couple weeks and you ll have serious ipo delays said carter mack the president and co founder of jmp group llc even if the shutdown ends and the sec gets back to work there s going to be a backlog of deals filed in the interim that haven t been assigned to examiners after the market volatility that marked the end of 2018 some companies had been waiting to see whether 2019 would start with a rebound mack said normally you d see companies taking advantage now but they re not he said in an emailed statement the sec wrote prior to the shutdown taking effect we encouraged filers to reach out to us to ask for acceleration of the effectiveness of pending registration statements and we declared approximately a dozen registration statements effective the shutdown leaves jay clayton the wall street deals lawyer picked by trump to run the sec hamstrung in fulfilling two of the president s pro business priorities to soften rules and entice more companies to go public as more firms blame the shuttered sec for delaying their plans to raise capital evidence is growing that the shutdown is starting to take a toll on corporate america an ominous sign for a president who relishes touting economic growth as evidence his policies are working story continues boosting ipos while trump is known for publicly lambasting and praising officials he s nominated for jobs clayton has largely stayed off the president s radar but when clayton interviewed for the sec job trump made no secret about what he thought the independent agency should focus on boosting ipos during a meeting more than two years ago at trump s mar a lago resort in florida the then president elect cited statistics showing that u s stock sales had fallen off a cliff people familiar with their discussion said at the time clayton had come to trump s attention because the former sullivan cromwell law partner had written a policy paper for the incoming president s transition team arguing that smaller companies should be exempt from some rules when they go public when trump nominated clayton in january 2017 he said he would play an important role in unleashing the job creating power of our economy by encouraging investment in american companies confidential filings during clayton s tenure ipos have started to reverse a two decade decline the ability for any company to file documents confidentially as used by uber lyft tradeweb and others was one of the key changes clayton has made giving executives a chance to get feedback from the agency and iron out any issues before publicly announcing a stock sale now there s no one at work to provide that feedback the president has been a strong advocate for and made significant progress in improving our capital formation regulatory regime white house spokeswoman lindsay walters said in a statement so far there is no evidence that the shutdown has had a material impact on ipos critical time david hirschmann president of the u s chamber of commerce s center for capital markets competitiveness said the lobbying group has started to hear from companies concerned about delayed ipos timing is everything and these are issues that for particular companies come at a critical time said hirschmann whose group called on congress and the trump administration to end the shutdown this week you need government to work with no end to the shutdown in sight companies still aiming to list in the first quarter of will likely be marking one key date in their diaries feb 14 that s the deadline to price an ipo without having to provide updated financial information based on a 2018 audit said david goldschmidt global head of capital markets at skadden arps slate meagher flom llp if people aren t able to do their deals by then there s a chance we could lose a good part of the first quarter for ipos he said with assistance from nabila ahmed drew singer and margaret talev to contact the reporters on

jjgervasi thinkstock federal reserve officials expressed increasing worries when they met last month as they grappled with volatile stock markets trade tensions and uncertain global growth the threats they said made the future path of interest rate hikes less clear according to minutes of the fed s december gathering released wednesday officials believed that with inflation still muted the central bank could afford to be patient about future rate hikes while the fed did approve a fourth rate increase for the year the minutes show that a few fed officials argued against hiking rates at the meeting the fed trimmed its projection of possible rate hikes in 2019 from three down to two but many private economists think the central bank may end up raising rates just once this year if the economy slows significantly analysts read the minutes as confirmation that the central bank will likely hit the pause button at the beginning of this year to assess the impact of the rate hikes they have already delivered policy is likely on pause for a while and will be highly influenced by the economic data and evolution of key risks notably those affecting financial markets and global growth said sal guatieri senior economist at bmo capital markets the minutes said that based on current developments fed officials judged that a relatively limited amount of additional tightening would likely be appropriate the minutes covered the dec 18 19 meeting at which the central bank raised its benchmark rate for the fourth time in 2018 pushing the policy rate to a range of 2 25 to 2 5 financial markets were not pleased and stocks falling sharply the drop was blamed in part on comments federal reserve chairman jerome powell made at a news conference following the announcement in which he seemed to emphasize the strength of the economy more than possible downside risks however in an appearance last friday powell struck a somewhat different tone stressing that with inflation remaining muted the fed could afford to be patient in determining when to hike rates this year the minutes delivered a similar message powell is scheduled to speak again on thursday before the economic club of washington in remarks that will be closely watched for further clues about the fed s current thinking there is no pre set path for policy powell said in his atlanta comments which helped to send the market up by 746 points last friday with the muted inflation readings we have seen coming in we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves the minutes made no reference to any of the attacks president donald trump has levelled at powell and the fed for the series of rate hikes which trump has blamed for pushing the stock market down the minutes cited rising concern among business contacts about the impact of trump s get tough trade policies which have imposed punitive tariffs on imports from china and other nations in an effort to trim america s huge trade deficit the minutes were released with the usual customary three week lag since the meeting

health fitness shingles vaccine is in short supply what should you do finding a place to get your first shot of the shingles vaccine or second required dose is getting as difficult as scoring hamilton tickets in south florida alone many pharmacy outlets at chains like publix and walgreens and at uhealth have reported problems obtaining vaccines and waiting lists are growing the vaccine s manufacturer glaxosmithkline acknowledged in november that demand has exceeded supply but that there have been no manufacturing issues the shortage problem for the shingrix vaccine is nationwide reports healthline the shortage of shingrix appears to be due largely to an unprecedented demand for the drug the health website said the vaccine is a two step process the first shot then a second shot two to six months later shingrix is recommended for adults 50 and over to prevent shingles aka herpes zoster according to the centers for disease control and prevention shingrix is more than 90 percent effective in preventing shingles the cdc said shingrix is the preferred drug to help prevent shingles which is characterized by a painful rash and is caused by a reactivation of the varicella zoster virus the same virus that causes chickenpox people who are most susceptible are those who have had chickenpox and it s more common in people over 50 but children can develop shingles too according to the cdc almost 1 out of 3 people in the united states will develop shingles at some point there are an estimated 1 million cases of shingles every year in the u s though there has been some difficulty obtaining shingrix there is no significant upshot or epidemic in cases still many people want the vaccine especially those who got the first dose in the summer of 2018 and are now overdue due to high levels of demand for the gsk s shingrix vaccine gsk has implemented order limits and providers have experienced shipping delays said kristen nordlund spokeswoman for the cdc the forecast isn t especially glowing either it is anticipated order limits and shipping delays will continue throughout 2019 nordlund said in response gsk increased the u s supply for 2018 and plans to make even more doses available in the u s in 2019 the cdc added additionally gsk will continue to release doses to all customer types on a consistent and predictable schedule during 2019 gsk spokesman sean clements told healthline that the pharmaceutical company plans to ship large volumes of the vaccine twice monthly to providers and is planning on bringing significantly more doses to the united states for 2019 compared to 2018 gsk said about seven million doses of shingrix were administered globally since 2017 and nearly two thirds or 70 percent of the recipients completed both recommended dosages shingrix has been met by unprecedented demand by healthcare providers and patients clements told healthline providers are immunizing patients at a rate several times what was previously seen for shingles because of this demand patients may find their provider or pharmacy is temporarily out of stock they should check back often or ask the pharmacy to contact them when they are restocked that bit of news is welcomed by publix the lakeland based grocery store chain is a major provider of medications including the elusive shingrix a publix supermarket pharmacy in pinecrest has been advertising the shingles vaccination for months through 2018 but still hasn t been able to obtain sufficient supplies to give shots to customers who want or need them howard cohen hcohen miamiherald com signs at many publix pharmacies right by the cash registers beckon beware shingles beware recommended for all adults over 50 let s make life easy but it s not been that easy publix pharmacy operations is distributing the vaccine to stores as soon as it s received from the manufacturer and our pharmacy managers are calling customers on the waiting lists as the vaccine supply is received at the store said nicole krauss publix super markets community relations manager for the miami division the university of miami has taken to prioritizing shots at its uhealth clinics there is a nationwide shortage of the shingles vaccine shingrix primarily due to unprecedented demand like all health providers we receive our allocation of the shingles vaccine from the manufacturer glaxosmithkline because of the limited supply we are prioritizing our dosages for those patients who would be most seriously impacted by a case of shingles at this time several of the uhealth clinics at walgreens across south florida have vaccine doses each patient should check with their healthcare provider for availability uhealth said in a statement so what do you do while you wait try to chill health officials say and keep tapping that shingrix vaccine finder site on the internet to see when your provider received a shipment you should make every effort to get the second dose of shingrix between two and six months after you got the first dose the cdc s nordlund said if your doctor or pharmacist is out of shingrix you can use the vaccine finder to help find other providers who have shingrix you can also contact pharmacies in your area and request to be put on a waiting list for shingrix if they do not have the vaccine in stock though that second dose is necessary to make that first shot fully effective don t despair and don t give up the cdc said if it s been more than six months since you got the first dose you should get the second dose as soon as possible nordlund said you don t need to restart the vaccine series publix plans to remain diligent krauss said we continue to look to the cdc for the latest regarding dosage guidelines and encourage customers patients to follow their recommendation she said we are committed to getting the vaccine out to customers as readily as it becomes available who should get the shingles vaccine the centers for disease control and prevention recommends that people age 50 and older receive two doses of the shingrix shingles vaccine the cdc recommends the administration of two doses of shingrix within a two to six month period or a single dose of zostavax another vaccine for shingles that has been promoted for people 60 and older the cdc and health experts say shingrix is preferred over zostavax people who have had an adverse reaction to a previous dose of shingrix are advised not to get the vaccine or can consider the zostavax vaccine which has been approved since 2006 shingrix was not studied on pregnant or nursing women so some healthcare providers may not recommend they get the vaccine effectiveness according to the cdc in adults 50 to 69 years old who received two doses shingrix was 97 percent effective in preventing shingles among adults 70 years and older shingrix was 91 percent effective protection from the shingrix vaccine lasts about four years and five years for the zostavax vaccine according to the cdc shingles symptoms people usually have tingling itching and pain in the area where the rash will develop one to five days before a shingles rash develops the cdc says the rash most often forms in a single vertical stripe on the right or left side of the body sometimes the rash forms on the face and can affect the eye and cause vision loss symptoms can also present themselves through an upset stomach headache fever and chills transmission the shingles rash consists of blisters that typically scab over in seven to 10 days and clears up within two to four weeks according to the cdc shingles which some have described as a burning sensation can t be spread from one person to another the cdc says however the virus that causes shingles the varicella zoster virus can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox in such a case the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox but they would not develop shingles the cdc says the virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the blisters but is only spread when the rash is in the blister phase shingles is not contagious before the blisters appear or once the rash crusts or scabs over shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and covering the rash minimizes the risk of transmission side effects of the vaccine shingrix side effects can include pain redness and swelling at the injection site also muscle pain tiredness headache shivering fever and upset stomach tell your healthcare provider if you are pregnant plan to become pregnant or are breastfeeding if you have shingles keep the rash covered avoid touching or scratching the rash even if tempted avoid contact with pregnant women who have never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine or premature or low birth weight infants or people with weakened immune systems shingrix vaccine locator you can type in your location and this shingrix com site will advise you about the availability of the shingrix vaccine in your area visit the vaccine locator but there is no guarantee that the site updated weekly will be accurate some of the listed locations may still be out of stock so you ought to call

assistance program or tefap the usda buys food and ships it to states for distribution based on unemployment and poverty in 2017 new york received 22 6 million in tefap funding we get a lot of food from that program quandt said advertisement article continues below this ad but under the shutdown food banks can t make new orders for food meaning organizations like quandt s are left in limbo as lawmakers remain split on a spending bill that would reopen the government what was supposed to be in the pipeline down the road is at a minimum delayed quandt said nobody knows exactly what the long term impact is going to be the regional food bank of northeastern new york receives the food from usda and then distributes it to local food pantries across the capital region and while directors of several local food pantries said they haven t yet seen a tangible impact from the shutdown that could change quickly if funding for snap dries up advertisement article continues below this ad the bulk of the food we get we purchase from the regional food bank so if our donations don t match our service increases we d have to look at making changes said angela warner the director of st vincent de paul s food pantry in albany if somehow we re impacted because the economy is slowing or people have lost their snap benefits then we d have to figure out how we can meet that additional need on top of what we re already serving warner said others echoed the sentiments and said without snap benefits pantries could have their food supply depleted along with a regional food bank unable to provide more food in the interim we purchase food from the regional food bank and rely heavily on donations from local civic groups and churches if there s an increase in people coming then our supply will be depleted said katie powers of the concerns u food pantry in rensselaer we obviously don t want that advertisement article continues below this ad federal workers and others affected by the shutdown can contact the food pantries for the capital district a coalition of the area s food pantries at 518 458 1167 or visit the thefoodpantries org to get referrals and find their local food pantry we are definitely concerned natasha pernicka executive director of the food pantries for the capital district said about the shutdown we don t know exactly what s going to happen but we are prepared to work collaboratively with members to come up with solutions pernicka said the coalition would seek public donations should snap benefits expire for capital region residents and demand for food pantries increases but quandt said he simply wants to see the government reopen because the debate over funding primarily held up by the political battle over construction of a border wall is affecting things

pay day is everyone s favorite day of the week but imagine not getting paid that s the situation ahead for federal workers as the partial government shutdown continues for its 19th day the partial shutdown affects nine federal departments starting friday many of them will miss a paycheck if you were to be in a similar situation how prepared would you be todd bury of bury financial said the government shutdown underscores the importance of having an emergency fund to pay for expenses like food medicine and housing you gotta make sure you have funds available should you all of a sudden not have a paycheck for a month or two months he said bury recommends staying away from long term funds such as 401ks and iras some have loan provisions but using them should be a low priority you could establish a home equity line of credit at a bank assuming you have some equity in your home some of my clients have a home equity line of credit established for years and they never even use it but if an emergency does come up and they do need it they all of a sudden have a place they can go and get some quick money he said the united states office of personnel management is providing sample letters which workers can send creditors and mortgage companies to explain their situation it s important to communicate with your bank whether you re furloughed or fired be careful if you consider getting financial help from a family member it could cause conflict if you can t pay him or her back quickly bury warns emotions are strong when making important money decisions don t compound your mistakes such as tapping that 401k paying penalties taxes and getting less money because the stock market is down hopefully the situation will be short which is exactly what an emergency fund should cover just be disciplined about it you re still working you re still employed but now you see what others are going through let this be a lesson and say i need to set up an emergency fund right away bury said everyone has a different comfort level of how much an emergency fund should cover three months six months more or less bury says discipline is the key one paycheck at a time

as market dynamics continue to push oil prices along the rollercoaster of volatility global e p spending could rise 8 this year to an estimated 414 5 billion according to a report released this week by barclays but more spending likely won t be seen everywhere and growth in some regions won t be as robust as in the past the growth mix is poised to reverse in 2019 as north america slows while international markets accelerate barclays said in the report analysts added that north america spending is exposed to more downside risk given the recent oil price collapse which is not fully reflected in budgets oil prices collapsed toward year end 2018 a barrel of west texas intermediate wti crude plummeted to less than 47 by the last week of december down from more than 75 in june 2018 it was trading for about 51 per barrel early jan 9 still spending is forecast to rise in north america where lush u s shale plays sent oil production to record highs but the year is expected to bring double digit spending growth in some international regions such as latin america and africa the report released jan 8 was based on a survey conducted of more than 200 oil and gas companies worldwide from nov 19 to dec 28 information from other sources such as press releases presentations public commentary and discussion with corporate executives on planned upstream spending was also used it remains to be seen how much companies plan to spend as many north american e ps and others have not unveiled their 2019 budgets more news is expected in february iocs take permian spotlight barclays forecasts e p spending in north america to be just over an estimated 128 billion up 9 the spending growth is down from the more than 18 seen in 2018 according to the report commentary and guidance all point to further spending restraint by large e ps in 2019 if anything the recent pullback in wti further validated this newfound capital discipline barclays said large u s e ps which include eog resources inc nyse eog occidental petroleum corp nyse oxy and anadarko petroleum corp nyse apc are forecast to increase e p budgets by 5 to about 38 8 billion according to the report spending is expected to stay within cash flow for a second straight year as e ps maintain fiscal discipline in line with investors demands international oil companies ioc will be the biggest spenders in north america doling out about 45 5 billion according to barclays analysts anticipate 2019 will be the year of ioc expansion in the permian basin e ps get all the headlines but iocs have been building out supply chain and infrastructure to support large multi well pad developments in the permian the report said iocs plan to increase spending 15 this year with limited commodity price sensitivity signs are already evident chevron corp nyse cvx said in december its upstream budget includes 3 6 billion for the permian and 1 6 billion for other shale and tight investments barclays pointed out that chevron is already trending a full year of guidance provided in march 2018 which called for 500 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day boe d by year end 2020 the company s permian production jumped more than 80 to 338 000 boe d in third quarter 2018 compared to a year earlier of the eight iocs highlighted in the barclays report chevron has the highest estimated e p capex in north america followed by royal dutch shell nyse rds a exxon mobil corp nyse xom and bp plc nyse bp which completed its 10 5 billion purchase of bhp billiton s u s onshore assets in october analysts expect more spending from smaller e ps a group that includes parsley energy inc nyse pe antero resources corp nyse ar and cimarex energy co nyse xec in 2019 too barclays forecast u s small and mid e ps to spend about 21 9 billion an 11 increase this is up from an 8 spending growth in 2018 such companies are expected to spend 120 of discretionary cash flow in 2019 despite the capital discipline mantra heard across the industry due to needs to keep drilling hbp acreage to hold assets create a mature production base and shift to development among other reasons barclays said looking abroad barclays said it expects spending growth of at least 8 from almost every region with the exception being russia fsu international spending is forecast to reach 286 billion in 2019 the middle east is expected to lead international spending up 8 to about 43 billion spending grew only 2 in 2018 the report said we expect most of the middle east nocs to increase spend 5 10 in 2019 as activity continues to ramp up despite the recent oil price decline and dec 6 decision to reduce production by 1 2 mmbbl d barclays said in the report at about 18 4 billion most of the estimated spend will come from saudi aramco which awarded several notable oilfield services contracts in 2018 for onshore and offshore rigs and unconventional gas stimulation services according to the report the amount is more than twice that of the second highest spender abu dhabi national oil co latin america is expected to see spending growth of 11 rising to an estimated 34 billion this is up from a decline of 6 in 2018 the report showed brazil s petrobras and mexico s pemex are the top latin american spenders at 13 2 billion 19 and 10 5 billion 15 respectively for petrobras approximately 56 of e p capital is expected to go toward presalt while the balance will go to post salt the report said 70 of e p spending is expected to be for production development with the remaining 30 for exploration infrastructure r d barclays said a 4 billion jump in forecasted exploration investment drove petrobras capex increase goals set by mexican president andrés manuel lopez obrador to increase production to 2 624 million barrels per day by year end 2024 are partly behind state run pemex s spending increase the government plans on signing two contracts one for offshore production infrastructure on jan 15 and the other for a massive drilling push on jan 30 barclays said the project would cover the drilling of 73 offshore wells and 44 onshore wells like latin america double digit spending growth is also on the horizon for africa the report shows 12 spending growth for 2019 to about 18 billion compared to 1 spending growth in 2018 here barclays said growth is driven by algeria s sonatrach the nigerian national petroleum corp and angola s sonangol along with tullow oil and kosmos energy ltd nyse kos barclays also reported that international upstream spending by nocs and european iocs are both expected to rise by 8 spending growth from the european iocs come after international upstream spending fell by 4 in 2018 iocs generally try to keep one eye on longer term fundamentals and another on replacing production but only after shoring up balance sheets and ensuring they can maintain dividends the report said most have shored up balance sheets and protected the dividend especially after generating significant cash flow in 2018 and have shown an increased willingness to spend albeit modestly velda addison can be reached at vaddison hartenergy com
