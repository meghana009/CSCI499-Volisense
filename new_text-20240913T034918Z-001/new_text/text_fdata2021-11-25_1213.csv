after a meeting led by president xi jinping in august 2021 china s communist party released a media summary that spoke in part to the idea of common prosperity little is new in the communique itself which reiterated the message that ensuring the broad sharing of china s wealth among the chinese people is critical to the party s lasting rule it acknowledged that sharing prosperity is a long term difficult and complex task and only gradual progress can be expected and it alluded to some public spending policies benefiting the poor and middle class but merely urged sub national governments to experiment with such policies while committing to no new national measures yet common prosperity has grabbed news headlines in the west in recent months commentators claim that china is cracking down on the rich clamping down on capital and shifting political priorities from economic growth to redistribution the business media has gone into overdrive trying to decipher what xi s supposed populism means for investors in chinese stocks the spectacle of tamed tech giants like alibaba and tencent pledging to donate tens of billions to government common prosperity funds seems to offer proof of xi s ideological turn tax revenues reveal the truth yet these prognoses are belied by china s fiscal realities consider the evolution of the ratio of tax revenue to gross domestic product gdp in china this statistic is important because to pursue redistributive policies whether poverty alleviation creating a social safety net or supporting economic mobility a government must raise tax revenue what is xi jinping s record in tax collection china s tax to gdp ratio enjoyed a sustained rise from 1996 to 2012 but has stagnated since then precisely during the xi jinping era if tax revenue had continued to climb as it before 2012 china would have a lot more resources for redistribution than now instead xi s rule has so far yielded the most sustained and largest tax cuts in china since 1994 many of these tax cuts delivered extraordinary benefits to china s urban affluent the 2018 amendment of the personal income tax pit law for example dramatically raised exemptions broadened rate brackets and introduced generous deductions the result is that many who comfortably belong to china s top one per cent of income earners would still face a marginal tax rate of merely 10 per cent the 2018 pit cut completely wiped out the gains in the pit s share of total revenue that had accrued in the previous six years note that 2018 was after xi entrenched his power at the 19th party congress and centralized much economic policy making this means the pit cut cannot be pinned on anybody else the decision to slash taxes for the rich was made by the small group of political leaders led by xi baked in benefits when reporting that xi has launched a common prosperity campaign the western media sometimes refers to the possible introduction of a property tax on personal residences in reality even this proposed measure for taxing the rich has benefits for the rich baked in property tax proposals discussed in the past decade all exempt primary residences but there is something even more interesting china s large pit cut favoured the rich in 2018 the chinese government has made large corporate income tax cuts since 2019 it repeatedly cut value added tax vat rates from 2016 to 2019 and it made a big payroll tax cut in 2020 chances are not many outside china are aware that these tax cuts even happened how then do we know so much about china s tentative property tax increase to see how odd this is imagine joe biden s proposal to raise taxes in the united states being greeted with lavish attention with scant mention that donald trump had significantly slashed those same taxes the explanation of this lopsided coverage is that public information about redistribution in china has come to depend on two highly unreliable sources the first is media catering to the affluent any possible tax increase will fuel debate tax cuts or policies that contribute to inequality by contrast aren t as likely to be reported on the second source of course is the chinese government in 2021 these two sources are amplifying each other when xi claims to be interested in greater redistribution regardless of whether he actually does media for both china s economic elite and the global investor class will talk it up chinese tech is lucrative after all global financiers are enamoured with the outsized profits of chinese tech companies any government intervention that threatens to take away such windfalls is sensationalized to geopolitical proportions much of the media hype about common prosperity therefore is not about redistributive policy in china at all it might however reflect a search for narratives that would rationalize the chinese government s regulatory actions against some of its large publicly listed companies the force most responsible for lifting hundreds of millions of chinese citizens out of poverty is probably globalization which also reduced global inequality but exacerbated inequities in some advanced economies discontent arising from the china shock the economic impact of rising chinese exports on the west has led to a political backlash in the u s there is broad bipartisan agreement that china s economic rise represents a threat to america lost in the heat of this sentiment however is the recognition that the welfare of 1 4 billion chinese people may also hinge on china s economic might in reality china s poor and middle class want the very same things as citizens in rich countries like the u s and canada cheaper housing and child care more even distributions of education resources and help for the unemployed sick and elderly yet such chinese desires are viewed with suspicion in the west a public clamouring for such policies is more often portrayed as a challenge to china s autocrats than a worthy demand for progress xi s egalitarian credentials are much weaker than the west pretends but if china s have nots nurture hopes for a better future they have no one else to look to author wei cui professor of law university of

the climate change conference that was recently organized by the united nations in glasgow scotland is a reminder to world leaders and indeed everyone that unless a concerted systematic global action is adopted to stop negative human activities that destroy our planet human survival could be at risk rising desert conditions and extreme heat waves greenhouse emissions dying water bodies landslides and recurrent flooding that is pummeling various parts of the world at such a ferocious rate is a timely signal to humanity to refurbish the planet today not tomorrow or face extinction but whereas many individuals and organizations are only recently waking up to the looming climate change crisis confronting mankind an indigenous ghanaian agribusiness company has actively pursued and modeled its business operations on climate change adaptation agro forestry and biodiversity for over 17 years with incredible results b bovid an acronym for building business on values integrity and dignity is a social enterprise founded by issa ouedraogo in takoradi in 2004 as a professional who worked in the united nations system for several years mr ouedraogo s life centered around traveling from one conference to the other attending workshops on poverty reduction food security climate change millennium development goals sustainable agriculture wealth and job creation among others these workshops and conferences took him to washington dc new york new delhi oslo bonn tunis praia nairobi dar es salam addis ababa pretoria johannesburg cape town accra abuja kampala and several other countries however according to mr ouedraogo these workshops proposed beautiful concepts and theories that failed to directly impact the poor rural farmer in any sustainable way i enjoyed my work in development cooperation and was happy with the six figure salary i earned nonetheless i had no real satisfaction with the outcomes of most these conferences because the concept of sustainability and poverty reduction which was propounded by the experts posed several implementation headaches for the poor farmers particularly in africa and asia there was a huge gap between the theories on the one hand and the reality of implementation on the other hand b bovid was my own strategic initiative to provide direct benefit to poor rural farmers by bridging the gap between the theory and practice of sustainable agriculture he said b bovid was founded in 2004 at angu and pretsia nkwanta a suburb of sekondi takoradi in the shama ahanta district of the western region mr ouedraogo has consequently become a household name associated with the modernization of agriculture in ghana by virtue of his unique social enterprise project the first of its kind in ghana the b bovid unique model the company practices a socially inclusive model of agriculture that incorporates agro forestry techniques mechanization alternative livelihood enhancement eco diversity ecological tourism research and marketing rain harvesting technology that enables farming throughout the year to ensure food security coupled with an intensive program for youth training and empowerment as its core mandate as a socially inclusive initiative b bovid maintains over 2000 small holder farmers in its value chain who feed the company s palm oil processing mills with over 20 000 tonnes of palm fruits annually these farmers are beneficiaries of the company s mechanization and training facilities and receive very generous and competitive prices for their produce b bovid currently controls a little over 3 of total palm oil production in ghana supplying palm oil and palm kernel to clients in ghana togo nigeria and other countries within the sub region key components of this socially inclusive community led agricultural

although cineplex stock looks like one of the cheapest stocks to buy on the tsx today these two recovery stocks offer far more potential although 2022 is already just weeks away the pandemic continues to impact our lives every day there are still plenty of opportunities for investors to find recovery stocks on the tsx that are worth a buy today such as cineplex tsx cgx for example prior to the pandemic cineplex had built a strong business and was diversifying its operations it was even set to be bought out at 34 a share the fact that the stock trades around 13 today means that cineplex stock certainly offers investors a decent opportunity in fact i d even recommend it as a better recovery stock than air canada today at its recent earnings release cineplex reported an incredible recovery in sales through the summer however it still faces some significant headwinds that other companies don t face or are less impacted by so if you re looking at buying a recovery stock on the tsx today here are two that could offer even more potential a top value stock with more potential than cineplex on the tsx today if you re looking to buy a recovery stock on the tsx today one of the best opportunities has to be boston pizza royalties tsx bpf un boston pizza which is canada s number one casual dining chain has over 350 restaurants across canada dine in restaurants were as we all know one of the hardest hit industries by the pandemic so boston pizza has always naturally offered investors recovery potential with restaurants seeing a massive impact due to capacity restrictions boston pizza has earned a lot less revenue and therefore had to trim its dividend recently though with capacity restrictions being eased and through the summer season with warmer patio weather boston pizza has begun to make an impressive recovery and unlike cineplex stock because it s collecting a royalty payment from the restaurants and not relying on them to make a profit the royalty fund is itself earning a profit and able to return a large chunk of its income to investors as of the third quarter boston pizza s sales have almost recovered fully coming in just 3 shy of its revenue in the third quarter of 2019 meanwhile the stock is paying out just 74 of what it did to investors before the pandemic so in addition to the recovery potential of boston pizza s units there is also more room for the dividend which already yields an impressive 6 5 to be increased making it one of the best recovery stocks to buy on the tsx today cineplex stock has traded rangebound for months now and investors who have been patiently waiting and holding the stock haven t earned anything boston pizza is in a similar boat because capacity restrictions are the biggest headwind it faces however at least the stock is profitable and able to pay investors while we wait for a full recovery a high quality recovery stock to buy while it s still cheap corus entertainment tsx cjr b is another stock on that tsx today that hasn t fully recovered however while the stock price hasn t recovered the company s operations have been profitable lately it s also been earning tonnes of free cash flow paying down debt and like boston pizza pays a dividend to investors while they patiently wait for a recovery right now corus entertainment is in far better shape than cineplex stock yet still offers investors an incredible discount cineplex currently trades at a forward enterprise value ev sales ratio of 1 8 times and a forward ev ebitda ratio of 6 4 times in comparison corus trades at a forward ev sales ratio of 1 7 times and a forward ev ebitda of five times both of which are cheaper than cineplex stock in addition corus also trades at a forward price to earnings ratio of six times cineplex however may not even earn a profit over the next 12 months so for now while corus remains one of the cheapest stocks on the tsx it s one of the best recovery stocks to buy today therefore rather than buying and holding cineplex stock waiting for a recovery i d consider a stock like boston pizza or corus which will pay you to wait

cory witherill owns the g force chassis that he and indy regency racing used to qualify for his only indianapolis 500 start in 2001 the car sits in a columbus ohio shop with a paint scheme different than its racing colors witherill would like to give it a retro look as part of a larger plan that day in may 2001 witherill became the first and still only full blooded native american driver to qualify for the 500 now 20 years in the rear view mirror los angeles native witherill still hopes that achievement can inspire others one idea is to showcase the car in its indy livery at either the navajo nation museum in window rock arizona or the eiteljorg museum of american indians and western art in indianapolis presenting it in november which is national native american heritage month would be a bonus it s still complete witherill said of what was then the no 16 car i was using it as a show car for my kids program back in the day with hemelgarn racing so it painted purple and white no 92 hemelgarn colors qualifying for the 500 continues to be the most celebrated moment in witherill s motorsports career photographs hanging in his garage in redondo beach california are reminders of how an indy lights team earned a place in the most prestigious of indycar series fields witherill was a product of motocross and off road racing building an open wheel career through various lower divisions before joining cart s indy lights series in 1998 he was 29 with only one indy racing league start that coming less than a month prior to the 500 at atlanta motor speedway when he was collected in the large turn 4 accident early in the race witherill s heritage drew a fair amount of attention at indianapolis motor speedway but he was focused on earning a starting position finally at 5 02 p m on bump day with an oldsmobile engine provided by john menard witherill rolled off for what became a four lap run averaging 221 621 mph good for the inside of row 11 witherill credited two time 500 winner arie luyendyk whose garage was next to his for offering advice and answering the questions of a rookie indy regency had competed in several 500s and was led by sal incandela a former formula one mechanic who was part of two grand prix world championships james hunt in 1976 and nelson piquet in 1983 but it was the engine offered by menard that likely was the difference in the team making the race what stands out about qualifying pretty much everything said witherill who became the last indy regency driver to compete at indy i don t know if it s different than anyone else it s being there and knowing the whole history of the 500 and being part of it i always knew i could qualify for it but when you re an indy lights team and you show up for the biggest race in the world with one car and you re under budgeted you re at a disadvantage witherill completed 187 laps in the 86th running finishing 19th he said his 500 run often comes up in conversation with friends although while neighbors on either side of him didn t know of his indy accomplishment despite each having attending the race years ago and being indycar series fans interestingly a trophy won in the 2003 infiniti pro series generally gets people talking about witherill s racing past hanging in the living room of his southern california home is a custom made gibson guitar he received for winning that year s race at nashville superspeedway people see it and say you play the guitar he said laughing i m like no i don t but it makes for good conversation i explain it by saying next to the borg warner trophy it s probably the trophy all of the drivers wanted to win back then we all wanted to win at nashville while qualifying at indy remains the signature moment of witherill s career he said the inaugural freedom 100 in 2003 at ims ranks near the top of his highlights ed carpenter then 22 and a week removed from college graduation dominated the race winning by nearly 14 seconds but witherill mark taylor and jeff simmons spent much of the race in a fierce battle for second witherill had the position at the finish i remember we were going down the front straightaway beginning lap 28 and i had a good run on simmons witherill said he was trying to go around the outside of taylor and i tried to go to the inside of taylor all of a sudden we were going three wide in turn 1 i was hoping the tires would stick and i thought i don t want to be the one on the outside but we all got around the corner witherill and taylor had an even closer moment in turn 3 a few laps later combining indy lights and the infiniti pro series witherill made 54 starts over seven seasons winning once and finishing second four times he also made the occasional arca and asa starts in stock cars before stepping away from competitive racing following the 2004 season witherill who turns 50 next month and works in real estate has returned to ims a few times over the years mostly for a pair of sportscar vintage racing association events and 500 legends day autographs sessions for former drivers he is hopeful the end of the pandemic allows for a proper annual celebration of indy s past next may in 2001 witherill earned his place in that history

republicans ridiculed president biden s energy secretary on wednesday after she admitted she did not know how many barrels of oil were consumed each day in the united states how incompetent is the biden administration asked ronna mcdaniel chair of the republican national committee biden s energy secretary doesn t even have a rough idea of how many barrels of oil the u s uses in a day a day earlier jennifer granholm appeared in the white house briefing room to trumpet the administration s moves to release 50 million barrels of oil from the nation s strategic reserve as it sought to ease crippling gas prices but biden s energy secretary was stumped by a simple question cbs news reporter ed o keefe asked i m curious if you know how many barrels of oil does the us consume per day granholm replied i don t have that number in front of me sorry energy secretary jennifer granholm was forced to admit she did not know how many barrels of oil were consumed in the u s every day an embarrassing flub for an official addressing journalists about how the administration was releasing oil reserves to bring down gas prices the white house on tuesday said it had ordered 50 million barrels of oil released from strategic reserve to bring down energy costs for consumers struggling with rising prices the result was a wave of ridicule from republicans who delighted in highlighting the gaffe at a time when the white house is under pressure to explain whether its actions will make any difference to rising prices at the pumps the result was ridicule embarrassing tweeted sen marsha blackburn biden s own secretary of energy doesn t know how many barrels of oil the u s consumes per day it s 18m the average price of gasoline recently breached a seven year high and now costs 3 409 per gallon according to aaa in california residents have reported paying up to 4 84 a gallon the consumer price index is up 6 2 per cent over last year and rose 0 9 per cent in october alone tanking public trust in the president as a result the administration said its release of 50 million barrels would help consumers by making gas more affordable prices for a gallon of gas are highest in west coast states and in the north east according to aaa they are lowest in south central states like florida louisiana and mississippi where prices range from 2 97 3 15 gas prices are surging nationwide reaching some of the highest levels in california a chevron stations shows a gallon of gas at 5 09 in visalia california on november 16 left and a seveneleven shows the price per gallon at 3 33 in miami florida on november 22 right but even democrats have questioned whether that is enough to make a real difference and some republicans suggested granholm may have had reason to avoid giving a straight answer when asked about daily consumption omri ceren an adviser to sen ted cruz r tex tweeted the energy dept where sec granholm is the secretary estimates that in 2020 the us consumed avg of about 18 19 million barrels of petroleum per day she wouldn t want to say that though bc it would show biden admin s announcement is a meaningless comms play democratic senator joe manchin chairman of the energy and natural resources committee slammed the move as a band aid for rising gas prices but does not solve for the self inflicted wound that shortsighted energy policy is having on our nation
geisha kowlessar alonzo the recent statement by the imf press confirms what is already know that the t t economy is out of balance on both external and internal accounts exacerbated by the necessary response to the covid 19 shock says economist dr terrence farrell on friday november 19 the international monetary fund imf concluded its two week annual visit to this country and published its independent assessment in the concluding statement of the imf s 2021 article iv mission to t t the washington dc based institution said the domestic economy is expected to grow by 5 7 per cent in real terms in 2022 the growth next year will be reinforced by the continued policy support and the anticipated recovery in oil and gas production the imf statement also said the government acted decisively to contain the pandemic meanwhile in may 2020 in the midst of the pandemic and in a context of wreckages in the oil and gas markets moody s had put a negative outlook to t t s credit rating this was mainly based on covid related fiscal slippages recently moody s announced that it downgraded t t s outlook and in response to moody s downgrade finance minister colm imbert argued this decision by moody s collides with the policy advice we have received from all international organisations to protect our country and support the recovery in the current circumstances according to farrell although the reports came almost simultaneously the two organisations have foci he explained that the imf is concerned with the country s external and internal fiscal balances and its obligations under the imf articles while moody s is concerned with the country s external debt profile and its ability to meet its obligations to creditors over the medium and long term neither organisation is expert in development policy and what is required to engineer growth in an economy like ours farrell said he noted that the imf staff who are enjoined to be positive about member countries and not to be overtly and publicly critical see gradual improvement in the near term due to improved production and prices in the energy sector further he said it is also obliged to accept the government s promises about what it will do to restore balance on the external and fiscal accounts even if past experience suggests otherwise for example farrell said improvements in tax administration have been proposed for several years now in order to reduce avoidance and evasion and which in his view are necessary but even the watered down revenue authority proposals could be derailed and even if implemented will take several years to bear fruit same with the vexed question of transfers and subsidies and with the size of the public sector the obstacle to implementation in those areas is almost entirely political farrell said he added that without tough action to address public revenue and expenditure and by suppressing forex demand and with a deliberate avoidance of using the exchange rate to help restore external balance we are stuck hoping and praying that oil and gas prices will remain high and that gas production will rebound hope and prayer are important even essential but need to be adduced in aid of sensibly crafted macro economic and development policies not as a substitute for such policies farrell said meanwhile the former deputy governor of the central bank said because moody s was chastised for its conduct leading up to the financial crisis it is very aggressive in ensuring that its rating decisions cannot be seen as compromised while s p farrell added in the face of rising debt levels may have been assured somewhat by the implicit mortgaging of the hsf and hence encouraged to settle for a negative outlook and not to downgrade moodys is clearly not assured and sees a weaker credit profile even with a rebound in growth over the next couple of years farrell said however the findings of neither report help t t with the growth and development policies it needs to formulate and implement nor should the country be looking to those institutions for help in that regard farrell explained but we know or ought to know what we need to do farrell said he suggested the country increase the investment rate on which there is no data to direct investment to the right areas that is activities which address the global marketplace and can generate foreign exchange earnings and those activities have to leverage resources that t t has agricultural location cultural but also utilise knowledge innovatively to produce goods and services to sell to the world further farrell emphasised t t has to put twice three times as much effort time and resources into economic diversification as it does on the energy sector additionally he suggested this country needs to engender a climate in which the private sector can be productive emphasising that means inter alia reducing crime and making the country safe improve infrastructure water telecommunications payments systems roads and public transportation root out corruption and disrespect and weed out the culture of dependency and entitlement which is a drag on productivity this requires hard sustained disciplined work over many years without the deadweight of internecine conflict which has poisoned our politics and driven many right thinking citizens to the edge of despair moody s and the imf can t do any of that for us we have to do it for ourselves farrell added according to economist dr roger hosein the imf s growth projection for 2022 of 5 7 per cent is very welcome news and could help the economy to pay some of its bills and reduce its debt to gdp ratio note though that given that parts of the economy in 2020 and 2021 were closed because of covid 19 restrictions one would expect for the fy 2022 once we are fully reopened the growth performance would be higher than the years in which we closed thus part of the growth is the opening back up of the economy growth hosein explained he cited that even with this growth predicted by the imf for 2022 the economy would still be smaller than in 2019 and of course significantly smaller than in 2015 according to hosein a closer look at the data also indicated that the majority of the growth is coming from the energy sector but he questioned whether this is the growth the country wants after the extent of economic stagnation this economy underwent in 2009 to 2021 and the depression from 2016 to 2021 that growth from anywhere is good and should be celebrated however we also have to be wary as it is this same energy sector that played a significant role in causing the economy to be in its current stifled position hosein explained further he said these numbers also mean the structure of the economy drifts more towards a greater level of dependence on the energy sector policy makers hosein advised would also have to now monitor the inflation rate as well which according to the imf report is expected to move north he added that rising prices and a decline in nominal per capita gdp comparing 2016 and 2022 only are not a good combination indeed the imf report also carefully points out that the central government primary balance remains in deficit and even more the non energy aspect of the primary balance widens not good at all hosein said continued on page 9 further he noted that a careful look at the data presented by the imf also showed that for fy 2022 budgetary revenues are set to increase but the budgetary revenues are set to improve mainly because of the energy revenue component which rises from 8 4 per cent in fy 2021 to a projected 10 6 per cent in fy 2022 capital expenditure is set to remain at 2 1 per cent of gdp for fy 2022 the same as in fy 2021 very worryingly the concluding statement shows that by the time fy 2022 has elapsed the external debt would have climbed to a level 41 per cent higher than in 2017 and basically equal to the stock of reserves which at the end of fy2022 is expected to stand at around us 5 7bn hosein further cited he also noted that the stock of reserves in fy 2022 is projected to be 32 per cent less than in 2017 or 50 per cent of the 2014 level all of the derivations by the imf are premised on a price of natural gas price of us 3 50 per mmbtu and if for some reason the actual price of natural gas were to fall below that level then all of the numbers above would need to be adjusted downwards hosein added t t s debt capacity in the last six years the economy declined by 16 6 per cent and stacked up a fiscal deficit of over 61 billion according to economist dr vaalmikki arjoon he said this deficit didn t allow t t to save having entered the pandemic with already high debt levels of 75 5 per cent of gdp ballooning to a current value of 87 per cent given the financial stress of covid 19 according to arjoon t t is now deemed even riskier by the global community for meeting its debt repayment obligations having been further downgraded in the speculative grade category to ba2 in the recent ratings exercise by moody s he explained this rating was anticipated as last year s rating of ba1 carried a negative outlook the outlook generally predicts the likely outcome of the next year s rating exercise with a negative outlook suggesting an expected downgrade positive and stable outlooks predicts an upgrade and no change to the ratings respectively arjoon said noting that t t s capacity to carry this debt level is very slim arjoon suggested the only solution is to ensure the economy not only achieves positive growth but this growth must be significant and consistent to bring about revenues that will be able to cover the debt with much left to spend on meaningful development at this point our economic performance in terms of gdp is close to 2005 levels he said further arjoon said while the imf has forecasted a growth of 5 7 per cent next year t t s gdp will still be worse than where it was over 2006 to 2019 he added that in 2022 increased oil and gas production together with energy derivative commodities such as methanol will bring the economy back to positive growth however arjoon outlined the extent of the growth depends on the nature of the pandemic and the infection rates adding that the country is still a long way from achieving herd immunity having only 45 4 per cent of the population fully vaccinated additionally he said higher energy prices are likely to persist well into 2022 and this will augur well for t t s revenue earnings bringing the deficit down to approximately 9 billion these persistent deficits arjoon identified are generally financed by debt suggesting that the debt burden will continue to pile up and higher energy prices he said also mean the state will be placing more funds into the hsf as the legislation governing the fund requires that a minimum of 60 per cent of excess energy revenues must be deposited in the fund global energy prices are currently much higher than prices which the budget is predicated on an oil price of 65 and a gas price of 3 75 a key downside risk is the continuing global supply chain issues and shipping costs that continue to drive up costs in the private sector the us is our largest trading partner and is currently facing a 6 7 per cent inflation rate the highest in the last thirty years arjoon also noted he said given t t s degree of imports coupled with the persistently high shipping costs from asia and the higher prices of raw materials from foreign suppliers this country will continue to experience price increases well into the third quarter of 2022 and while inflation is projected by the imf to be an average of 2 4 per cent in 2022 it is likely to be higher than this in the first half of the year arjoon added he also advised that given the surge in international spending activities globally from the pandemic pent up demand it is imperative that local manufacturers are better poised to take full advantage of it the exim bank has provided much forex support to the sector but it is commercial bank that supplements activities of the banks arjoon advised therefore that authorised dealers increase the provision of forex to these manufacturers to facilitate their increased production and exports adding that this will contribute to healthy growth next year as already several entities in the private sector have shut down operations owing to the financial stress of the pandemic lockdowns and their inability to afford the higher prices from their supplier and shipping costs further he said as the imf would have recommended it is also imperative the state advance its tax collection which will help to close the fiscal gap and if successful the ttra can generate approximately 12 billion in uncollected taxes arjoon noted additionally he advised it is also essential government aggressively push capital expenditure projects that were stalled due to the pandemic and other impediments including bureaucratic delays in the public sector

double the amount expended in 2020 further enriching the super wealthy investors and giant financial institutions which predominantly own deere s stock the company is projecting that profits for 2022 will again break records reaching somewhere between 6 5 7 0 billion despite continued supply chain disruptions and labor shortages looking ahead we expect demand for farm and construction equipment to continue benefiting from positive fundamentals including favorable crop prices economic growth and increased investment in infrastructure deere ceo john may said in a press release while the impact of the strike was not fully reflected in the fourth quarter report since the last 17 days of the walkout fell after the reporting period ended wall street nevertheless expressed its enthusiasm for the results sending the company s share price surging as much as 6 percent as the call with investors took place deere s blowout earnings demonstrate once and for all that both management and uaw were lying through their teeth when they claimed there was not enough money to meet workers demands for larger wage increases the restoration of retiree health care and other major improvements to working conditions reacting to the results a worker at one of deere s parts depots told the wsws autoworker newsletter i knew it was all about deere and its shareholders i honestly believe our leadership sold us out he said the uaw did nothing to keep us in the light about where things stood and they pushed the scare tactics with deere that s horrific a worker in ottumwa iowa said the majority pretty well knew there was money still there hard to get it when the union isn t willing to go after it pretty sure we could have gotten the whole package if the union and company weren t in how did they call it an amiable relationship it s all very disappointing and very disgusting he added what else would you expect from the banksters and their wannabes in the uaw international the supposed ratification of the contract last wednesday with the uaw claiming 61 percent voting in favor was the illegitimate outcome of a negotiations process conducted in bad faith by union officials from the start both parties in the talks management and uaw officials alike worked to ensure the final agreement would be as favorable as possible to the company s shareholders after workers voted down a second tentative agreement between deere and the uaw on november 2 multimillionaire executives such as chief administrative officer marc howze went on a media blitz asserting there was no more money for workers to some degree because we were able to come to a resolution as quickly as we were i think there s some folks who believe there must be some more available howze said at the time the uaw far from countering deere s propaganda repeated and amplified it telling workers the company had to remain competitive that they would be replaced and lose support if the strike continued and that the offer was groundbreaking despite it still falling short of the wages and benefits of 25 years ago a week and a half after the second contract rejection the uaw suddenly announced it would be putting the same deal with only modest modifications to a vote in a show of contempt for workers democratic will the uaw then proceeded to an all out campaign to intimidate workers into voting yes the uaw elections chair at local 281 in davenport phil gonterman threatened to use his position as an inspector to retaliate against those opposing the deal while officials in waterloo told workers planning to reject the contract that they were losers and their votes wouldn t matter anyway under such conditions of blatant voter intimidation and clear bias by those running the balloting there is no way that the contract should be considered legally binding earnings call points to plans for speedup during the conference call with investors and financial analysts from the major global banks deere executives sought to mitigate any concerns that the new agreement might significantly impact its bottom line the deal will entail a price tag of only 250 300 million a year said cory j reed deere s president of production and precision agriculture to put this in perspective 300 million accounts for just 4 percent of deere s estimated profits next year and is less than 10 percent of what the company spent on dividends and share buybacks for its big investors this year at the same time deere executives stated repeatedly that they would ramp up production in the coming months referring to plans for higher line rates in december and january and their intention to set a clear new global benchmark in both productivity and efficiency in other words deere will seek to implement even more grueling levels of speedup and mandatory overtime as it attempts to make up for the production lost during the strike and its equipment remains in high demand reed noted several times that the company s order books are full or near full for large ag products in 2022 stating demand has been strong since the beginning of 2021 and overall that doesn t look like it s going to let up in 2022 while the corporate executives acknowledged they expected a dip in margins for the first quarter of 2022 they attributed this primarily to one time factors such as the contract ratification bonuses and said they expected margins to recover as the year went on indeed the company is forecasting an extremely robust operating margin of 20 21 percent in its production and precision ag segment for 2022 even though wall street has signaled it is satisfied the agreement will allow it to continue extracting huge sums of money from deere workers there are nevertheless growing concerns in ruling circles about the broader implications of the strike last week the wall street journal editorial board published an opinion john deere inflation bellwether indicating its nervousness over the modest improvements workers were able to achieve stating that cola quarterly raises loosely tied to inflation in particular should raise alarm bells cost of living raises were a feature of the 1970s economy but faded as inflation was brought under control the editorial board wrote the longer inflation stays high today the more workers will demand colas putting employers on the hook for long term costs they can t control what the journal describes misleadingly as inflation being brought under control was in fact a brutal and deliberate class policy in which the corporations with the crucial assistance of the union bureaucracies clawed back one gain after another over the last 40 years entailing massive pay cuts for new hires attacks on pensions and health care and the almost universal elimination of cola and the eight hour day meanwhile stock market values and the personal fortunes of super rich speculators were inflated through endless injections of cheap credit by the us federal reserve the editorial continued once colas are embedded into labor contracts they become hard to wring out this is how you get a wage price spiral and durable inflation this is the fear of the capitalists inspired by the deere strike more workers will demand major raises and protection from inflation which will be more difficult to wring out once they are agreed to their concern is not so much inflation in basic consumer goods as such but a widespread push for higher wages by workers which would threaten to blow apart the massive speculative bubble that has been built up with the support of the federal reserve and other central banks internationally the report of deere s enormous earnings confirms once again what the wsws has repeatedly stressed the uaw functions as a representative of management firmly dedicated to defending corporate profits at the expense of its members living standards to carry out a struggle for workers interests in the period ahead new rank and file organizations at every plant and warehouse are needed linking up with the deere workers rank and file committee which fought independently of the uaw for a strategy to mobilize workers to expand and win the strike such rank and file organizations must proceed from what workers need not what the company and uaw falsely claim is affordable deere workers join the deere workers rank and file committee to carry forward the fight email deerewrfc gmail com or text 484 514 9797 to find out more about getting involved

as the roster of charitable causes in the age of gofundme increases seemingly exponentially and the need to involve young adults grows more imperative smart organizations look for reliable new ways to engage new donors jewish federation of northern new jersey a leader in identifying strategic growth opportunities recently announced a new forward looking policy that will make them more accessible to members of the millennial young adults ages 24 40 and gen z teens and young adults ages 20 23 cohorts starting in late november the jewish federation started accepting cryptocurrency for contributions bennet pittel a junior at george washington university in washington d c whose family lives in norwood new jersey has been involved as a volunteer at the federation since 2012 he praised this new move and understands its value well he has been purchasing cryptocurrency since 2018 and currently invests in it as pittel explained to the jewish link cryptocurrency is digital currency that is decentralized in every way and not a fiat currency with a value backed by a central government he pointed out that bitcoin specifically is a scarce commodity which adds to their value in a recent article in forbes com by national philanthropy leader kristen jaarda she noted the growth of cryptocurrency the market cap for the top 10 cryptocurrencies exceeds 1 trillion and there are over 100 million active cryptocurrency users pittel said that the jewish federation s new policy is a smart move millennials and gen z ers will get more involved because of the ease of giving this is due to the ability to avoid capital gains taxes by donating cryptocurrency directly to the federation as opposed to selling and donating the proceeds as well as the ability to write off the current market value of the cryptocurrency at the time of the donation on their taxes pittel plans to contribute cryptocurrency to the jewish federation and forecasts that others will as well laura freeman marketing director of the jewish federation of northern nj shared that according to their research 49 of millennials have cryptocurrency so this policy move made a lot of sense she said that the jewish federation will be working with givingblock com a respected online broker and currency trader to accept cryptocurrency contributions and to promptly convert them into cash she added that federation is also prepared to use their partnership with givingblock com to assist other jewish nonprofits in their area in accepting cryptocurrency incoming jewish federation president daniel shlufman explained some of the thinking behind federation s decision to accept cryptocurrency jewish federation has always accepted appreciated stock as payment for donations accepting cryptocurrency for donations is really just an extension of that payment option it also is an acknowledgment of the acceptance of cryptocurrency as a mainstream investment for many of our donors especially both younger ones and those donors who have portfolios that include a more aggressive investment strategy who may be looking for tax advantaged ways to lock in some of the large and recent gains there are two significant and unique aspects of cryptocurrency that makes it enticing for both federation to accept and for the donors to use this to pay their gifts the first is that over the past two years the cryptocurrency market has exploded in both market size and value of the various coins so there are more people who own it now which makes jewish federation of northern new jersey s decision relevant and forward thinking for a charity as only two other federations accept it as of this time shlufman continued also anyone who has invested in it more than a year ago which is the capital gains holding requirement anyway even if it was a small sum is holding appreciated assets depending on which coins they have and exactly when they bought them of anywhere from three to 100 times their original investment amount in this short period of time as such if the donors sell the crypto as opposed to donating it there will be large capital gains tax if they donate the crypto they will avoid the tax which will increase the value of each gift by 20 automatically with a full deduction to the donor on the appreciated amount the other unique nature of the cryptocurrency is its extreme volatility shlufman added since it is now at its highest point ever donors have the opportunity to both i save on the capital gains taxes as noted above but also ii take part of their very large gains before there is an inevitable correction in this market and make a donation potentially a bigger one now the owners of this currency can share the upside of this tremendous appreciation with jewish federation as well as avoid any possible future downturns in this market on the money that gets donated federation s overall mission is to meet the community where they are said jason shames ceo of jewish federation of northern nj this is why we have programs and services for community members of all ages accepting cryptocurrency for donations is an extension of that cryptocurrency has clearly become a viable form of currency that is widely accepted in the world of philanthropy and i am proud that federation is establishing itself as a leader in this arena accepting crypto will be very meaningful to our younger donors as well as donors who have a diverse and broad financial portfolio for more information on jewish federation of northern nj see www jfnnj org harry glazer welcomes feedback on his news coverage

commentary bad news travels faster than good this ancient phrase seems like our present reality one conversation at the water cooler or in passing with your neighbor is enough to remind you that people are upset scared depressed or hurting one trip to the gas station can cause financial panic for the average american right now one attempt to stock the shelves of your shop can leave wondering if your business will survive another week and who among us isn t aware that depression and anxiety have been on the rise during the pandemic not simply because the experts tell us so but because we have a family member we can think of who is struggling at this very moment it s hard to escape bad news right now how could we possibly celebrate thanksgiving with gratitude not with earthly platitudes that fail to warm a broken heart stripped of all hope we need more than that so where do we turn the apostle paul provides a solution in essence he tells us to stop and recognize that jesus reigns supreme when we do we can be assured that regardless of what is swirling around us god is all powerful and is actively watching for opportunities to help us as paul was suffering an unjust arrest in a prison cell he wrote to remind christians that the entire universe is held together by jesus christ who is before all things and in him all things hold together colossians 1 17 close colossians 1 17 he existed before anything else and he holds all creation together open verse in bible nlt jesus is how the oceans stay within their borders how atoms join to make molecules how the milky way hangs in the heavens whether we realize it or not jesus the living word is holding our world together and he does this out of love for us if we can trust jesus to keep the earth rotating then we can trust him with every detail of our lives while suffering severe persecution peter wrote cast all your cares upon him for he cares for you 1 peter 5 7 close 1 peter 5 7 give all your worries and cares to god for he cares about you open verse in bible nlt when life is hard or we feel defeated it s time for an important paradigm shift we are not victims of circumstance we are victors through jesus who loves us jesus is sitting in a place of authority and blessing and god raised us up and seated us with jesus ephesians 2 6 close ephesians 2 6 for he raised us from the dead along with christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms because we are united with christ jesus open verse in bible nlt paul added since you have been raised with christ set your hearts on things above where christ is seated at the right hand of god colossians 3 1 close colossians 3 1 since you have been raised to new life with christ set your sights on the realities of heaven where christ sits in the place of honor at god s right hand open verse in bible nlt how do you look to things above this may seem obvious but go to your bible each biblical hero did not live through a cute story with a happy ending but extreme circumstances that almost annihilated each one and yet god was faithful to pull them through a desperate moses ran out of water for two million people in the desert a depressed elijah thought he was the only one left in the world who served god a devastated job suffered the loss of his family and the ridicule of his friends a despairing david ran for three years from an enraged insane king saul a dislocated daniel suffered deportation and a political plot that led to a lion s den a deserted paul suffered loneliness in the midst of his darkest hours in prison paul wrote set your minds on things above not on earthly things colossians 3 2 close colossians 3 2 think about the things of heaven not the things of earth open verse in bible nlt can you imagine having that peace of mind from a jail cell well the reality is that we can because we have access to the same father son and holy spirit that paul did let me give you some basics to stir your heart toward a thanksgiving of gratitude when you sit down at the thanksgiving table you can read these right out of psalm chapter 103 here s a sample of the benefits god has for you and me right at this very moment he forgives your iniquities he heals your diseases he redeems you from destruction he crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies he executes righteousness and judgment for the oppressed he is merciful and gracious slow to anger and quick to love he does not deal with us according to our sins his righteousness is to our children s children his kingdom rules over all when the headlines get you down meditate instead on things above jesus is your hero of heroes your lord of lords your king of kings maybe this thanksgiving when there s plenty to be anxious about is when the

article to print this article all you need is to be registered or login on mondaq com overview of corporate tax work over the last year types of corporate tax work m a in comparison to 2019 which reported a transaction value amounting to usd 127bn 2020 was quite an unusual year due to the global pandemic accompanied by the uncertainty of the economic impact caused by covid 19 as such the uncertainty and the waves of the pandemic emerging globally resulted in a significant drop of total deal value by around 50 to approx usd 56bn almost three quarters of that amount was attributable to the 10 largest mergers and acquisitions m a these were driven primarily by the two largest transactions in terms of deal value the public takeover of sunrise communications ag the second largest telecommunications provider in switzerland after swisscom and the acquisition of cpa global limited a leader in the development of intellectual property and legal support services notably swiss companies acquired significantly more foreign companies than vice versa outbound transactions amounted to 42 154 transactions whereas there were only 23 inbound transactions 84 transactions the impacts of covid 19 were low or at least lower than expected in the m a market the associated physical absence broke or accelerated new grounds such as a shift from physical signings and closings the recent developments required adjustments and facilitated the dealmaking process tax litigation in addition to traditional tax litigation matters international requests for exchange of information remain a highly prolific ground for tax litigations in switzerland switzerland continues to receive a large number of requests for assistance under the double tax treaties dtts and agreements on the exchange of information and the multilateral convention on mutual administrative assistance 2020 was switzerland s record year with 46 requests to foreign tax authorities 1 most of the 2 112 requests from foreign authorities received by switzerland were from israel france south korea germany and austria most court cases usually deal with procedural aspects of the administrative assistance requests such as the possibility to use information in respect of third persons provision of information in respect of third persons which is a common concern when for example the data in respect of bank account transactions is provided and the obligation of the swiss federal tax administration sfta to inform third persons ex officio and provide them with a possibility to object to the disclosure of information by way of administrative assistance the fact that the decisions of the swiss federal supreme court often reverse the decisions of the swiss federal administrative court shows that there are still many aspects of the administrative assistance practice that remain uncertain in 2020 the federal supreme court made several leading decisions in administrative assistance cases of which two are particularly noteworthy in july 2020 the federal supreme court ruled in a case that third parties whose identification characteristics are exceptionally not redacted do not need not be informed about the contemplated data transfer 2 a reservation applies to so called evidently entitled appellants however the vague wording indicates that there is room for interpretation as a result data transfer of third parties might be processed without the third party having a possibility to appeal against it according to another decision dated the same day 3 the recipient state shall not be allowed to use information obtained through administrative assistance procedures against third parties this restriction is referred to as the principle of personal specialty in the context of the previous practice the latter decision deserves special mention since the federal supreme court overruled the organisation for economic co operation and development s oecd s view on the use of obtained information through administrative assistance although this seems to provide better protection of affected parties potential violations of the principle of speciality by the recipient state following the oecd s view and corresponding prosecutions however cannot be prevented therefore there is a reasonable expectation that the trend of increasing disputes in the context of administrative assistance proceedings will continue financing transactions and liquidity enhancement measures with the swiss economy feeling the impact of the covid 19 pandemic 2020 highlighted an increase in financing and re financing transactions as well as other measures aimed at liquidity management of the balance sheet situation the accompanied types of work range from the issuance of straight bonds and conclusion of credit facility agreements to equity issuances and issuance of convertible bonds or a combination of all of the above in addition new forms of debt financing emerged for example in september 2020 novartis issued a eur 1 85bn sustainability linked bond which is the first of its kind in the healthcare industry and the first sustainability linked bond incorporating social targets for liquidity reasons or because of the requirements for emergency loans from the federal government companies may have to waive the distribution of already declared dividends or change the purpose of the share buybacks for example by placing the treasury shares on the market or distributing them as dividend in kind all such measures require a careful tax analysis to avoid adverse tax consequences ipos during 2020 only two companies ina invest holding ag and v zug ag were listed on the swiss stock exchange these were not classic ipos but spin offs the small number of ipos was a consequence of the uncertainty caused not only by the covid 19 pandemic but also the us presidential elections there is expectation or at least hope that the vaccinations and cures will bring the current environment one step closer to a little or more economic stability on 29 april 2021 switzerland s first ipo was launched polypeptide group ag a company from the life sciences sector and a global leader in peptide development and manufacturing listed its shares on the swiss stock exchange with a market capitalisation of chf 2 4bn the second ipo is montana aerospace ag a leading manufacturer and supplier of

register for a 30 day comment period no later than 30 days after the close of the public comment period epa will make a final determination as to whether the label should be changed and publish its

do so the pesticide product or active ingredient shall be immediately and permanently canceled by operation of law and without further proceedings if a pesticide product or active ingredient is responsible for ten or more farmworker incidents of any type or three or more incidents resulting in death and the pesticide product or active ingredient has not received a final determination regarding a registration review during the preceding 15 year period epa will immediately suspend the pesticide product or active ingredient until a final determination is made regarding the registration review of the pesticide authority to bring civil action the bill would amend fifra section 16 to allow any person to bring a civil action where there is an alleged failure of epa to comply with any of its provisions the u s district courts would have exclusive jurisdiction over such actions employee protection the bill would amend fifra to add a section regarding employee protection employers would be prohibited from discharging or discriminating against an employee because the employee has commenced or is about to commence a proceeding under the act has testified in a proceeding or has assisted or participated in a proceeding employees would have 30 days from the date of the alleged violation to file a complaint with the secretary of labor and the secretary would have 30 days to conduct an investigation commentary this bill is unlikely to become law any time soon this legislation or anything like it in terms of its presumption that pesticides approved by epa under current law are fundamentally flawed would present a radical change to current epa authority and procedures advocates of such change believe otherwise and point to the fact that fifra has not been amended for 25 years whether this is sufficient to garner broad support of national environmental and consumer advocacy groups is unclear assuming it gains the support of at least a handful of democrats in the senate along with a likely house companion bill this legislation lays the groundwork for advocating eventual changes to fifra this approach takes a page from the toxic substances control act tsca reform playbook certain members of congress and tsca stakeholders established policy positions for reform five or more years before reauthorization occurred similar to tsca the legislation is premised on the view that fifra is fundamentally flawed a widely held view with tsca reform this view is not widely shared with regard to fifra however critics of this proposed legislation will argue that epa has been effective at implementing fifra driven by the requirements of the 1996 food quality protection act amendments following a rigorous scientific process with various required safety factors to determine that pesticides used on food meet a reasonable certainty of no harm standard in that view this bill may be a solution in search of a problem if this legislation is indeed used as a starting point for reform there will be many more years before any common ground is found and common ground likely will be essential for any kind of meaningful fifra modernization
the new york city reit s business is bouncing back but is that enough to make this landlord a buy the 2020 pandemic hit was particularly hard on landlords with properties located in big cities you don t get much bigger than manhattan which is where empire state realty trust esrt 2 75 calls home as 2021 has progressed the real estate investment trust s reit s portfolio performance has started to improve but there s more to understand here before you make the decision to jump in coming back to life when the coronavirus first started to spread around the globe it was clear that it spread most easily in group settings people started working from home and many basically fled big cities to find refuge in more suburban environments it was tough on office focused reit empire state realty but as vaccines rolled out and efforts to reopen the economy progressed things have gotten better for example in the third quarter empire state realty s adjusted funds from operations ffo came in at 0 20 per share that s up from adjusted ffo of 0 12 per share in the same quarter of 2020 a huge 67 increase although occupancy numbers are still kind of weak not shocking given the company s focus on office properties the revenue it generates from the observation deck of its trophy empire state building property has started to rebound that s helped to buoy the reit s overall results and provides anecdotal evidence that the big apple is starting to come back to life overall the reit s business trends are actually not so terrible and it seems that empire state realty has learned a lesson from the pandemic as it just agreed to buy two apartments in a diversification move that sounds great but it actually highlights the deeper problem with empire state realty too much focus the first thing to note about this reit is right up front in its name it is heavily reliant on new york city and its surrounding suburbs how reliant basically 100 of its business comes from nyc that s a big bet on just one region furthermore almost all of its rents come from office properties the two apartment acquisitions still have yet to close only about 7 of rents come from retail tenants but even there those businesses are operating in the street level space at office properties put that number together with the 75 of rents directly tied to new york city offices and manhattan despite its splendor desirability and size makes up a massive 82 of rents adding to the risk here just six properties out of a portfolio of 14 at the time represented nearly 75 of the company s rents in 2020 that s not even a full picture of the concentration either given that the empire state building alone accounted for nearly a third of the reit s overall rents this is a very concentrated bet on new york city this brings up the empire state building observation deck which generated around 130 million in revenue in 2018 and 2019 rounding that was roughly 18 of each year s revenues that s a pretty big number for a business that is highly dependent on tourism in 2020 amid the pandemic the observation deck brought in just 29 million in the third quarter despite notable improvement the observation deck s revenues were 12 8 million or an annual run rate of a bit more than 50 million it s nice to see things working back to normal but it just highlights the importance of this unique new york centric asset to the reit s overall business and then there s the recent move into the apartment space which is basically just a statement about how empire state realty s business is too focused while it s nice to see management taking action on this issue there s more that needs to be done before conservative investors should feel comfortable owning this reit not bad just a leveraged bet this isn t to suggest that empire state realty trust is a bad reit in fact it owns some pretty incredible buildings you know like the globally iconic empire state building however it is a leveraged play on new york city in fact even after it diversifies by acquiring a pair of new york city based apartments it will still be a leveraged play on new york city most investors should probably look elsewhere unless you can stomach the concentration risk that is inherent in empire state realty trust s business model while that might be exactly what some investors want as the city works back from the pandemic hit it took it could still cause some sleepless nights for more risk averse types

photo credit encierro shutterstock agriculture has historically been one of the most important industries in the u s but the sector has become less prominent over time farms have become more productive thanks to improved technology which has changed farms needs for labor simultaneously economic opportunities in more urbanized areas have grown at a much greater rate and attracted workers away from agricultural life as a result the demographic profiles of u s farmers are changing most notably farm producers a person who is involved in making decisions for the farm have been getting older on average according to the 2017 census of agriculture nearly one third of the 3 4 million producers in the u s are 65 or older and an additional 950 000 are aged 55 to 64 and fewer young people are taking their place with only 284 000 producers under the age of 34 but one area where the ranks of farmers are growing is female farmers from 2012 to 2017 the number of female farm producers in the u s grew by more than 250 000 while the number of male producers declined by about 40 000 over the same span collectively females today farm 388 million acres of u s farmland and are responsible for a total of 148 billion in agricultural sales as with other sectors of the economy however there is a difference in the earning power of farmers by sex female operated farms tend to be smaller in scale and therefore earn less than their male operated counterparts in 2017 the most recent year for which data was available 50 of female operated farms earned less than 5 000 in sales and government payments compared to 43 of male operated farms at the other end of the spectrum only 19 of female operated farms earn more than 50 000 compared to 26 of male operated establishments part of the reason for this disparity is related to historical and cultural factors agricultural professions have historically been seen as men s work so opportunities for women to lead in farm operations have been more scarce the data bears this out male farmers are almost three times more likely than female farmers to manage a farm on which they are the only producer women on the other hand are more likely to share management roles with others especially other male producers male and female farmers also differ in where they are located female farmers and female operated farms are most common in the west and northeast but these locations tend to have lower agricultural productivity these states and counties also have a lower number of farms overall in contrast major farming areas including the upper midwest and the southeast have much lower proportions of female farms and farmers which likely contributes to the gap in earnings as well the data used in this analysis is from the u s department of agriculture to determine the states with the most female farmers researchers at commodity com calculated the percentage of producers that are female for each state in the event of a tie the state with the greater number of total female producers was ranked higher researchers also included statistics on the number of farms with at least one female producer and the total number of farms here are the

good evening folks let me shout out happy thanksgiving right at the top it s a great american holiday we will discuss later in the show why we must not let the woke progressives demean or destroy both the holiday and the meaning of this great holiday so much of it should be about gratitude and abundance for we have been endowed by our creator with the greatest country in the history of history now to me the biggest story today is a series of massive blowout economic releases in the spirit of thanksgiving i rate this a three gobble story gobble gobble gobble first the lowest number of unemployment claims declining to just 199k the lowest since 1969 one leading wall street firm called it a game changer also continuing unemployment claims in all programs including pandemic emergency compensation has collapsed in fact since the federal plus up benefits ran out in early september nearly 9 million people have stopped receiving unemployment benefits fed prepared to raise interest rates as inflation weighs on americans this will translate into very big job numbers in the months ahead just as we ve had in the last couple months if we quit paying people to stay home then guess what they ll go back to work it s the american way and wage rates are strong and work inducing in fact there are virtually no more lay offs in the american economy on top of that we had a big consumer spending number real personal consumer spending is now up nearly 7 over the past year and nominal spending pre inflation up an incredible 12 what s more wage and salary income up nearly 10 over the past year virginia dem says biden owns rising prices the buck stops with the president and the fed s inflation target called the pce deflator jumped six tenths in october and is now 5 above a year ago the atlanta fed s gdp now has moved up to 8 6 for q 4 ending december an extrapolating 5 inflation which may well be higher in november and december nominal gdp could be up 15 or 16 in that quarter you may recall i first started talking about this blowout a couple of weeks ago when soaring retail sales were published but there s still more a revised gdp report for the last quarter now shows a massive increase in profits overall profits up 21 in the past year and core profits domestic non financial profits up 25 for the last four quarters of course profits are the mother s milk of stocks and the lifeblood of the economy left wing progressives hate profits but you can t have more jobs at higher wages unless businesses are generating big profits the trouble with the progressives is they love employment they just don t like employers it s like my dear friend and mentor the late jack kemp who used to argue that you can t have capitalism without capital fed s inflation gauge hits another 31 year high as prices continue to soar and of course not only is uncle joe biden slamming businesses left and right attacking excess profits blaming business for higher gasoline prices and inflation overall nearly all of his reckless tax hikes are aimed at destroying capital profits investment and therefore assaulting jobs wages and average family incomes but whatever joe says profits are booming the economy is strong and regrettably inflation continues to rise that s why i call these numbers a blowout and let me add economic growth by itself does not cause inflation more people successfully working does not cause inflation the fundamental cause of inflation is when the federal reserve creates too much money chasing too few goods and the fed keeps pouring new money into the economy even though the economy doesn t really need it or want it and biden policy with a 5 trillion budget that is being financed by our central bank with for example a 13 increase in m2 on a yearly basis a 12 jump in u s bank deposits therefore continuing to create money and inflation that people do not want get fox business on the go by clicking here and then of course the biden tax hikes are damaging growth incentives to invest and work thereby shrinking the supply side of the economy so that s why we have too much demand too much money behind the demand and too few goods now that is not the case this moment on the supply side damage but if the bankrupt benefits bureaucracy bill passes that will be the story right now we re in a boom rising profits falling unemployment and zero interest rate free money i fear that unless the 5 trillion budget is paused for another year at least and unless the fed wakes up and starts fighting inflation instead of climate change or other wokeisms this story is not going to end well please don t get me wrong i love prosperity i love abundance click here to read more on fox business in fact years ago i wrote a book called american abundance but in order to maximize growth we need to minimize government the biden gang does not understand this and that s our challenge on thanksgiving eve so save america kill the bill gobble gobble gobble and that s my riff this article is adapted from larry kudlow s opening commentary on the november 24 2021 edition of kudlow

we will generate non operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the trust account and unrealized gains or losses related to the change in fair value of our warrant liabilities we will incur expenses as a result of being a public company for legal financial reporting accounting and auditing compliance as well as for due diligence expenses for the period

of funds held outside the trust account in the event that our business combination does not close we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts up to 1 500 000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of 1 00 per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor the terms of such loans if any have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a

operations is based on our unaudited condensed financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with u s gaap the preparation of these unaudited condensed financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and judgments including those related to fair value of financial instruments and accrued expenses we base our estimates on historical experience known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions there have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies as discussed in the form 8 k and the final prospectus filed by us with the sec on october 25 2021 and october 18 2021 respectively recent accounting standards in august

the buildup of russian troops along the border with ukraine and on the crimean peninsula annexed by russia in 2014 is prompting an intense debate among american and european policymakers about how to respond say western officials they are split over why russian president vladimir putin is amassing troops they are also wrestling with their options for deterring him from making any dramatic military moves on ukraine and separately for responding if putin does order his forces to seize more ukrainian territory most likely mariupol on the coast of the sea of azov and its surroundings nato secretary general jens stoltenberg cautioned moscow last week against any further provocation or aggressive actions after u s officials warned that russia might be preparing a winter offensive in ukraine ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy says russia has amassed about 100 000 soldiers near ukraine s border washington has warned european allies that the kremlin may be attempting to rehash 2014 when it annexed ukraine s crimean peninsula and russia backed separatists seized a large part of the donbass region in eastern ukraine bordering russia accusations against kyiv kremlin officials maintain that russia is not getting ready to invade ukraine and accuse ukrainians of mobilizing military units along their shared border kyiv is itself building up its forces kyiv is being helped to build up its forces kyiv is being supplied with a significant number of weapons including modern high tech weapons kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters monday in moscow some former u s diplomats and officials believe washington and its european allies should be ready to supply ukraine with more high tech weaponry and sooner rather than later they see the kremlin s anxiety over supplies of western high tech weapons as the best policy option to deter any kremlin adventurism the question u s and european policymakers must answer is whether they are going to help ukraine with the weapons and the training it needs to defend itself said daniel fried a former american diplomat who served as assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs and was the u s ambassador to poland from 1997 to 2000 fried now an analyst at the atlantic council a new york based research group ticks off a list of equipment that could be sent including more javelin anti tank missiles air defense and electronic warfare systems artillery pieces and radars that kind of stuff he said ukrainians know how to use them and i think the equipment needs to be delivered either now to deter the russians or in the pipelines so the russians know it can arrive very quickly he said his preference would be for the equipment to arrive sooner rather than later interesting lesson if you look at the military history of the russo georgian war in 2008 the georgians gave the russians quite a bit of trouble when they used israeli weapons that tbilisi had purchased he told voa the russians had trouble combating them and their casualties were pretty significant the georgians didn t have enough of the israeli weaponry they were just overwhelmed but it was an interesting lesson the russians are used to their own weapons they may find the u s weapons much harder to deal with the biden administration has sent more weapons to ukraine but far short of what it could dispatch two refitted former u s coast guard patrol boats arrived saturday and the ukrainians received a large consignment of u s ammunition earlier this year including some javelin anti tank missiles prompting criticism from moscow the administration is mulling sending more officials say republican lawmakers have been urging a significant step up in american military support but some u s and european policymakers are anxious and counseling caution they fear that sending more arms supplies could backfire escalate tensions and force putin into a full blown confrontation when all along he may have just wanted to taunt and goad others fear a limp response from the west risks emboldening putin who might see it as an indication that washington and western european capitals will do nothing but wring their hands if he is more aggressive when we call on putin to be more transparent what we are trying to convey to the russians is that unpredictability increases the chances of inadvertent miscalculation a european diplomat based in brussels told voa speaking on the condition of anonymity we are left in a quandary logically moscow can ill afford the economic costs of an incursion and there seems no popular support in russia for military action and a high casualty toll would likely go down badly but you could have said similar things in 2008 and 2014 few predicted the war with georgia or the moves on ukraine he said that makes deciding on our policy options especially challenging expanding sanctions aside from what to do to deter russia western policymakers are also wrestling with how to respond if moscow does take aggressive action some analysts argue the west has little room to add new sanctions on top of those imposed on russia in the wake of the seizure of crimea and others imposed after the poisoning of kremlin critic alexey navalny which the west blamed on the kremlin but former ambassador fried said he thought there was significant room for escalating sanctions especially in the financial sector we can go after russian banks we can sanction russia s metals and mining industries he said the russia sanctions that are currently in effect while costly for the russian economy are far below the level that could be imposed fried added while some in europe and the united states have argued that there is little room to escalate these measures there is in fact still a lot of space to do so his list would include targeting russian state owned banks such as vtb and gazprombank especially their investment arms neither bank has been sanctioned before the subsidiaries and capital market financing of energy giants gazprom and rosneft could also be blocked russia s mining and metals sector which has been mostly untouched in the current sanctions could also be hit fried and others highlight the steel company evraz controlled by oligarch roman abramovich and alrosa a state controlled diamond concern on monday russia s stock market saw the biggest sell off since august plunging by 3 58 traders and market analysts cited geopolitical risks as one of the key drivers rattling investors the possibility of expanded sanctions has also prompted alarm in some european quarters objections include the impact they may have on ordinary russians sanctions also wouldn t be cost free for europeans the kremlin could retaliate by cutting off or heavily reducing natural gas supplies to europe which is already struggling with an unprecedented energy squeeze british prime minister boris johnson focused on that worry last week chiding germany and others in a speech in london for being so dependent on russian energy supplies saying they should stop mainlining russian hydrocarbons in a warning to european countries heavily dependent on russian gas he suggested putin could indeed be serious about restricting supplies from pipelines running through eastern europe if the west sought to defend ukraine we hope that our friends may recognize that a choice is shortly coming between mainlining ever more russian hydrocarbons in giant new pipelines and sticking up for ukraine and championing the cause of peace and stability let me put it that way he said in the speech what would west do how much appetite european countries will have for a strong response in the event of a russian incursion is a key question for policymakers and independent analysts putin and the kremlin are likely expecting european weakness that may play into putin s calculations said benjamin haddad senior director of the europe center at the atlantic council putin may think this is the right moment to act with germany going through a political transition and france heading towards an election but i do think that would be a miscalculation haddad said he expected the new center left german government led by olaf scholz a social democrat would want to show it can be a good transatlantic partner and regarding france he noted that president emmanuel macron spoke to putin last week about ukraine and the messaging was pretty clear on french support for ukrainian territorial integrity

lasted ten minutes and by lunchtime the index was up 15 before drifting back in the afternoon market on close orders were to the sell side otherwise the index would have closed flat take out the impact of a jump in oil prices overnight and what appeared a bit of a dull session belied a 1 3 gain in the energy sector spilling over to utilities 1 0 which countered smallish falls in every other

surging inflation and fed cash rate at zero surely it cannot be so for much longer wall street had recovered from early falls before the minutes of the november fed meeting were released in the afternoon as dow jones reports federal officials expressed greater worries about a big surge in us inflation at the meeting and raised the possibility of ending bond purchases sooner than they planned if high prices persisted ie speeding up the taper most senior officials at the central bank still expect price rises to slow next year but they also acknowledged inflation pressures could take longer

sounds offensive watch florida students say black friday should be renamed because it sounds racist only to change their tune when told the history behind it university of florida students change their minds on renaming black friday after learning it has nothing to do with race the term black friday was first used after the financial crisis following the crash of the market in 1869 it was named in honor of retailers earning a profit and going into the black on the day after thanksgiving after a year of loss and being in the red black friday has become a consumer driven holiday known for shopping deals and bargains university of florida students who said they supported changing the name black friday because of possible racial connotations with one even saying it sounded offensive changed their minds after they were told it has nothing to do with race students at the gainesville campus were asked by a student reporter with campus reform whether they supported renaming black friday the day after thanksgiving that is seen as a commercially driven day of consumerism their responses were recorded on video black friday was named in honor of retailers earning a profit and

would not noting its deep rooted connections to capitalism and consumerism jacobson went out to see if students were willing to change the name and how far they would take cancel culture the survey by campus reform was formed in response to the chicago tribune s article questioning whether black friday should be renamed so it is not discriminating and profiling against black people a university of florida student told a student reporter that she would not be participating in black friday this year another university of florida student said black friday perpetuates just this consumerism black friday should be renamed so it is not discriminating and profiling against black people read the headline the name of the shopping day after thanksgiving should not be called by the name of a nationality read the opinion piece the author s name does not appear black friday should be called holiday buying day spending day charge card day green backs or something other than black which is discriminating and profiling against black people jacobson asked several uf students whether they supported renaming the day black friday honestly i m down to rename that one student responded i don t like the name black friday i never really have since i was small whenever i would go to stores everything would be jammed packed and i would see workers kind of it sounds wrong but they would lean more toward the lighter skinned people like they would assist them i think that equality s important another student said i mean i think it s definitely a valid opinion another student said i kind of agree it should be changed just because black friday sounds offensive jacobson spoke to one student who said changing the name isn t going to help actual black people the term black friday has nothing to do with race jacobson the campus reform reporter informed the students in the video should we still change it no one student said if it s not about skin color then i don t see that there s a problem another student responded if you want to just rename it to like spare the feelings then that s not helpful it s just a word like it s a color another student said everything will be found offensive at one point said another another student told the campus reporter that he is in favor of renaming black friday the university of florida is in gainesville florida with nearly 52 000 students the university sits on the border of florida and georgia as students debate hot topics one student said they participated in charges at the same time with black friday but understood the timeline i just think it really will be you you be participating in black friday this year um no capitalism isn t really my big favorite thing probably not i just think that it really perpetuates just this consumerism and just exploiting labor for our personal needs and wants 5 possibly not i feel like sometimes the priorities are being inflated on purpose i just think it perpetuates this consumerism and just exploiting labor for our own needs and wants but once students learned the origins of their day they had it situated capitalism isn t really my big favorite thing probably not i

remember when we were told that president joe biden would see a bump in the polls after the infrastructure bill passed well despite that happening earlier this month with biden signing it into law several days later that does not look to be the case townhall has been covering how polls continue to look bad for the president and sure enough a poll released on wednesday shows a new low for that poll according to the npr marist poll biden has a 42 percent approval rating and a 50 percent disapproval rating just 3 percent of republicans approve of biden s job performance while 81 percent of democrats approve both are low for the npr marist poll but a graph included by domenico montanaro noted in his write up for npr shows that the decline is particularly significant for democrats biden s approval rating among independents went up however and is at 44 percent the poll particularly hones in on how voters view biden s handling of the economy as montanaro wrote and just 42 approve of how biden is handling the economy while a majority 52 disapproves his worst marks on the issue since taking office his rating has dropped 6 points since september and is off from his high of 54 in april a slim majority of independents 51 now disapproves of his handling of the economy as well it s a key group and one biden won in the 2020 presidential election when asked what their top economic concern was a plurality of respondents at 39 percent said inflation was their top concern this was also a top concern for republicans 58 percent and independents 42 percent as well the next highest concern was wages at 18 percent which was a top concern for democrats at 31 percent other concerns included labor shortages 11 percent housing costs unemployment and gas prices with the latter tied at 9 percent regardless of strong job numbers or the soaring stock market americans are worried about the economy and the reason is inflation said lee miringoff director of the marist institute for public opinion who is quoted in montanaro s write up this finding that americans are concerned with inflation and thus give biden low marks is consistent with other polls as leah also reported on wednesday in reference to a yahoo news yougov poll according to a new yahoo news yougov survey 77 percent of americans say inflation is affecting them as the holiday season kicks off worse for the administration a majority 57 percent place the blame squarely on president biden seventeen percent of respondents said inflation was the most important issue facing america higher than other issues including covid 19 the dnc war room may want to keep abreast of the polls when it comes to sending out such emails this was a wednesday inbox message btw pic twitter com zvycqv5u1s rebecca downs rebeccarosegold november 24 2021 according to the realclearpolitics rcp average on biden s approval rating on the economy the president is down to a 37 9 percent approval rating with 55 7 percent disapproving on the issue the poll does show democrats with an edge in congressional races for next year s midterm election by 46 percent to republicans 41 percent but this appears to be an outlier other polls have shown republicans with such an advantage including a washington post abc news poll which showed an advantage by 10 percentage points as guy highlighted montanaro also acknowledges that by 43 to 41 percent respondents give republicans a slight edge as to which party would handle the economy better the npr marist poll was conducted november 16 19 with 1 048 adults including 969 registered voters the margin of error was plus or minus 4 2 percentage points and 4 3 percentage points for registered voters
