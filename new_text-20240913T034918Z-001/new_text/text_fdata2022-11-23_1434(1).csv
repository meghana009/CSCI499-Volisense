photo credit billion photos shutterstock after decades of declining power and influence organized labor in the u s is making a comeback the covid 19 pandemic has set off a number of shifts in the labor market that have given workers more power labor participation rates fell sharply early in the pandemic and still have not recovered to pre pandemic levels the great resignation saw millions of workers leave their jobs in search of better pay or working conditions with the labor market still tight employers have struggled to recruit and retain employees in this context workers have been organizing at rates not seen in decades one of the most high profile examples is the union drive at starbucks stores across the u s over the last year around 250 starbucks locations have voted to unionize since the first starbucks union formed in buffalo ny late in 2021 employees at other major companies have also attempted unionization including retail and factory workers at apple and amazon and the trend extends to white collar industries like tech academia and media where unionization has historically been limited according to the national labor relations board 1 522 votes on unionization have taken place so far in 2022 this is the highest number of union elections since 2015 and an increase of more than 50 over 2021 the recent uptick in unionization could begin to reverse a decades long decline in union membership rates the peak of union membership over the last 50 years was in 1979 when 24 1 of american workers were union members that figure has since fallen by more than half with only 10 3 of workers in a union as of 2021 in raw numbers there are nearly 7 million fewer union members in the u s now than there were in the late 1970s recent trends in unionization are significant to bother workers and employers unionization and collective bargaining materially affect the compensation and working conditions that workers experience for better or for worse in turn these factors can affect employers ability to staff their businesses and the overhead costs they must pay to operate compensation is one of the most notable differences between unionized and non unionized workers as unions are often able to negotiate for higher wages and as unions influence has declined over time so too has the gap in compensation between union and non union employee wages at the height of unionization in the late 1970s and early 1980s union members made over 30 more per hour than their non union counterparts today union members continue to earn more than non union workers but the gap between the two is just 11 the new growth in union membership is unlikely to return the u s to historic levels of unionization and union representation will continue to be stronger in some industries than others certain sectors of the economy have significantly higher rates of union membership than others including transportation utilities public administration and education at the highest end some industries have union membership rates greater than 50 the data used in this analysis is from unionstats com researchers at smartest dollar calculated the union membership rate for

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure firms with a fee only as opposed to fee based compensation structure are ranked higher these stats are updated annually and accurate as of may 25 2023 this list may include firms that have a business relationship with smartasset in which smartasset is compensated for lead referrals such relationships have no impact on our rankings and firms are included and ranked based strictly on the above criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

on november 15 ethiopia s leader prime minister abiy ahmed ali addressed parliamentarians about the recent agreement to end the civil war in tigray and the state of the country s economy which has been restrained by that war just three years ago the brookings institution think tank in washington d c had declared ethiopia one of africa s best economic performers this was not long after abiy came to power promising economic and other reforms expected to accelerate what already had been more than a decade of growth after his november 15 speech abiy tweeted some further boasts about the economy including ethiopia s economy held up under pressure reached 127 6 b demonstrating that our economy is unbreakable will continue to grow the per capita income reached 1 212 pointedly he also took issue with a world bank report on ethiopia s economy saying it wasn t positive enough according to the world bank the economy has risen to 1st in east africa 3rd in sub saharan africa however we do not agree with the report in its entirety because ethiopia has both formal and informal economic activity we believe it has achieved greater growth than the report indicates abiy may well have something to cheer about economy wise but his per capita income figure is 26 percent higher than the 960 claimed by the world bank then there s the matter of inflation a chronic problem in ethiopia that has dramatically eroded income growth under abiy s tenure in all abiy s rosy outlook comes off as uncertain moreover big questions loom about the recent truce disarmament and the long term political solution with the tigray people s liberation front tplf militant group there s little doubt that the conflict over tigray has put a huge yoke around abiy s economy in september the associated press reported he ethiopian economic association s meeting this month made clear the country is hurting while international mediators urgently seek progress on talks to end the fighting because of internal conflicts the destruction of infrastructure and uncontrolled spending are hurting the economy while ordinary ethiopians face weakening incomes and rising poverty economist alemayehu seyoum told the meeting the finance ministry now pleads with the public and ethiopia s large diaspora to contribute to a national cause for war reconstruction and aid ethiopia s national bank introduced changes to give the government all possible access to foreign currency including requiring foreign residents to convert all in their possession upon entry thanks to the cease fire humanitarian aid began flowing again into conflict zone on the same day abiy addressed parliamentarians the truce ended two years of fighting in which researchers say 400 000 to 600 000 civilians might have died most from hunger or lack of medical care ethiopia s inflation rate hit 27 in 2021 according to world bank data since 2018 when abiy came to power inflation has averaged 20 percent a year the imf puts average inflation for 2022 at 33 6 percent in ethiopia in its east africa economic outlook this month the africa development bank said ethiopia s inflation will be highest among 13 countries in the region with the exception of sudan overall prices are forecast to rise by a third in 2022 and another 27 percent next year this past summer ethiopia faced record food prices that surged 40 percent higher in february the united states department of agriculture s foreign agricultural service said the african development bank projects ethiopia s economy will grow by 4 8 next year still that s slower than rwanda uganda kenya seychelles djibouti and tanzania this leaves a far more middling picture than abiy s on november 15 he projected 7 5 gdp growth by the end of ethiopia s budget year next july although that was down from a prior estimate of 9 2 gdp stands for gross domestic product a country s total economic output all east african countries face some broad economic headwinds the world bank s outlook noted the russia ukraine war has increased global food and energy prices and heightened inflationary pressures in east africa its continuation could weigh heavily on the region s commodity importing countries and exacerbate food insecurity similarly several east african ea countries including ethiopia kenya and uganda could face rising risks of debt distress this month s cease fire is not the first agreement to stop fighting back in march the tplf and abiy s government reached a humanitarian deal that only held for a few months writing about the first agreement in march susan stigant africa programs director at the u s institute of peace outlined the tangled history of the tigray conflict and why the economy was then one of the biggest potential obstacles to reaching a permanent political solution this war has braked what was one of africa s fastest growing economies this country of 117 million africa s second most populous is struggling to meet basic needs even some middle class families now can t afford three meals a day people can t eat a truce declaration so a significant timely injection of funds will be necessary eight months later many of those challenges remain abiy s tweet contends that ethiopia s economy is stronger than official estimates because of informal economic activity in fact the concept of an informal economy is well known but it s not clear that this helps abiy s case the international monetary fund describes the informal economy this way the informal economy consists of activities that have market value but are not formally registered the informal economy embraces professions as diverse as minibus drivers in africa the market stands in latin america and the hawkers found at traffic lights all over the world in advanced economies examples can range from gig and construction workers through domestic workers to registered firms that engage in informal activities the international labor organization estimates that about 2 billion workers or over 60 percent of the world s adult labor force operate in the informal sector at least part time according to the world bank a large informal economy doesn t correlate with economic strength just the opposite high levels of informality generally means weaker development outcomes countries with larger informal sectors have lower per capita incomes greater poverty greater income inequality less developed financial markets and weaker investment and are farther away from achieving the goals of sustainable development in a comprehensive report published last year the long shadow of informality the world bank said the sector constitutes more than 70 percent of total employment in countries and roughly one third of output government revenues tend to be lower in countries with above average levels of informality in the economy the report said in ethiopia the report said informal economic activity accounted for a smaller share of the economy less than 30 percent than some other sub saharan countries including nigeria tanzania angola uganda and rwanda
opinion the recent midterms may not have yielded the results that many in the gop expected but if there s a consistent message across voter polling it s that the american people remain deeply concerned about two things jobs and china in response lawmakers in the next congress must address china s rise particularly china s stealthy use of american financial markets to subsidize its military and industrial growth unfortunately many in the gop have long been devoted to free trade and some republicans still invoke president ronald reagan when pushing for new trade agreements but reagan s loyalty was always with heartland america as he wisely noted in 1985 when governments subsidize their manufacturers and farmers so that they can dump goods in other markets it is no longer free trade i will not stand by and watch american workers lose their jobs because other nations do not play by the rules it s time for the gop to follow reagan s advice particularly when china s authoritarian regime represents exactly the sort of evil empire that reagan considered a threat to global peace and prosperity essentially the gop must pursue a commonsense approach to china that includes elements of both reagan s peace through strength policy and the america first goals of the recent trump administration that starts with recognizing how normalized trade with beijing failed to produce the prosperity democratic values and open society in china that many free traders had promised in fact beijing s egregious treatment of uyghurs and other minorities including more than 80 000 uyghurs sent to forced labor between 2017 and 2019 alone makes clear that beijing isn t interested in greater freedom the united nations recently confirmed china s crimes against humanity including uyghur slave labor but if such human rights abuses don t pique the concerns of lawmakers there s also china s military posture toward taiwan as well as its expanding presence in the pacific and latin america to counter this congress must tackle beijing s access to u s financial markets including passive investment products such as exchange traded funds etfs and mutual funds this is a key means by which beijing continually funnels billions of american investment dollars to chinese companies it s now a national security issue that wall street continues to trade funds that have significant exposure to companies owned or controlled by the chinese communist party ccp particularly concerning is the federal employee thrift savings plan tsp which contains at least 22 china only funds to counter this congress must pass legislation that will instruct the federal retirement thrift investment board frtib to remove adversarial chinese firms from the investments of federal workers military families veterans and even members of congress unfortunately there are plenty of other loopholes in u s sanctions policy since federal agencies often work at cross purposes when identifying bad actors in china sanctions harmonization legislation is urgently needed to ensure that when a federal department or agency identifies a particular chinese entity it triggers meaningful action including reviews by other departments and agencies in order to compel divestment congress must also draft legislation regarding a shares to remove chinese companies from etfs and other financial products adding robust requirements for transparency disclosure and investor protection means that u s investors will know where their money is actually going similarly congress must aggressively oversee the implementation of the holding foreign companies accountable act hfcaa to expand the protocols required for publicly listed chinese companies beijing s human rights violations must be addressed as well congress should expand on the work begun in december 2020 to identify corporate bad actors and link them to capital market sanctions specifically republicans should press for a chinese corporate human rights abusers bill to increase the number of chinese companies sanctioned under u s law the gop must stop thinking of china as a market opportunity with endless capital flowing to the ccp this is reckless and shortsighted particularly given beijing s aggressive posture toward taiwan and america s excessive dependence on high tech imports the bottom line is that congress must work to end u s investor funding of chinese companies particularly those tied to beijing s military agenda this is what the american people want and the gop should no longer be seen as the party that talks tough on military strategy but actually profits from investment in china robby stephany saunders is the national security adviser at the coalition for a prosperous america she has previously served as a senior adviser in the state department the house of representatives and the senate
halifax canada even after russian forces retreat from ukraine western governments should expect higher defense budgets and to continue to contribute to ukraine s defensive capabilities to ward off another russian invasion military and government officials said at the recent halifax international security forum they should also invest more in renewable energy to blunt the economic impact of using less russian oil and gas sen chris coons d del told defense one that the united states will still need to deter a defeated russia a critical part of ending the war and beginning reconstruction is ensuring that we are providing for ukraine s security going forward coons said if you look back at the example of the american revolution we signed a peace treaty in 1783 but we were back at war with great britain in less than 20 years every ukrainian you talk to expresses his concern that even if the fighting stops even if they reach a ceasefire even if they reach a peace treaty they will be concerned about the prospects that putin will restart the war i think they deserve investments in their future defense capabilities one of the biggest lessons of the war particularly for european nato members is that the military and security threat posed by autocratic governments like russia and china is larger than what many were prepared for belgium germany sweden romania italy poland and norway have all vowed to increase their defense spending since february but for some of those countries including germany that came after years of up and down spending and less stockpiling of things like artillery shells ammunition and rockets that s why there is growing concern about getting ukraine enough weapons to win the war said royal netherlands navy adm rob bauer who leads nato s military committee this is about sort of going to a warlike economy in peacetime he said bauer said nato member states must budget more for weapons both to replace their own stocks and to continue to support ukraine and western leaders will have to have a frank discussion with their populations about the future costs of defense and security he said this is an effort of the whole nation of all the nations because it s not just the minister of defense ordering more stuff the industry this is about having a discussion on how we ramp up production bauer said the weak links in the arms supply chain aren t just a result of low government spending but also of social attitudes and bias on the part of financial institutions to invest in defense companies he said the defense industry in western europe and in my own nation there was a discussion that it was not ethical to invest in the defense industry and therefore large financial investment investment groups like pension funds for example did not invest in defense but bauer cautioned that fixing the problem will take more than handing money over to defense contractors it s an issue before the ukraine war because we wanted more security that s why we had the 2 discussion he said referring to the 2006 pledge from nato members to devote at least 2 of their individual gdps to defense spending people started to order extra capabilities extra ammunition but the industry did not increase the production capacity in accordance with the budget and therefore the prices went up he called this ridiculous but a wartime footing doesn t just mean more defense spending it also means investing in renewable energy to sap russia of the leverage it gains by supplying the world with oil and gas yuliya kovaliv ukraine s ambassador to canada said we are on the edge of this sixth package of european sanctions banning russian oil and the price cap is under the discussion it is important to deprive russia from these huge revenues kovaliv added that russia has deliberately targeted her country s renewable energy supplies when russia invaded into ukraine the first thing they actually destroyed in ukraine is 90 percent of the wind farms and 50 percent of the solar farms very intentionally understanding that we were moving to diversification of the energy she said

children with sr agvhd and are a cornerstone of the company s bla resubmission to the fda for approval of remestemcel l in the treatment of children with sr agvhd the lack of any approved treatments for children under 12 means that there is an urgent need for a therapy that improves the dismal survival outcomes in children we are at a pivotal juncture we believe we have appropriately addressed

the dismal survival outcomes in children the lack of any approved treatments for children under 12 means that there is an urgent need for a therapy that improves the dismal survival outcomes in children in light of the unmet need remestemcel l has been granted fast track designation and bla priority review from the fda a major milestone in the company s complete response to the fda was the submission at the end of the last quarter of substantial new information on clinical and potency assay items to the investigational new drug ind file for remestemcel l in the treatment of children with sr agvhd as guided by fda mesoblast has optimized a potency assay that was in place at the time of the phase 3 trial and which demonstrates a relationship between the product s activity in vitro and its effects on survival in the phase 3 trial additionally mesoblast has now generated data from the expanded access program eap 275 of 241 children which confirm the ability of the in vitro potency assay to measure product activity relevant to survival outcomes today mesoblast provided new results from a four year observational survival study performed by the center for international blood and marrow transplant research cibmtr on 51 evaluable patients with sr agvhd who were enrolled in mesoblast s phase 3 clinical trial of remestemcel l overall survival in the remestemcel l cohort was 63 at 1 year 51 at 2 years and 49 at 4 years while across four recently published studies of children or adults with sr agvhd who received best available therapy bat or the only fda approved agent for adults survival rates of 40 49 at 1 year and 25 38 at 2 years were seen 7 10 the new long term survival data provide assurance that the short term day 28 responses and early survival through 180 days in the 54 patient phase 3 trial in children with sr agvhd previously presented to fda in the original bla submission are unlikely to have arisen by chance and are a cornerstone of the bla

ukrainians could face rolling blackouts from now through march amid frigid snowy weather because russian airstrikes have caused colossal damage to ukraine s power grid officials said to cope authorities are urging people to stock up on supplies and evacuate hard hit areas sergey kovalenko the ceo of private energy provider dtek yasno said the company is under instructions from ukraine s state grid operator to resume emergency blackouts in the areas it covers including the capital kyiv and the eastern dnipropetrovsk region although there are fewer blackouts now i want everyone to understand most likely ukrainians will have to live with blackouts until at least the end of march kovalenko warned on facebook we need to be prepared for different options even the worst ones stock up on warm clothes and blankets think about what will help you wait out a long shutdown he told ukrainian residents russia has launched six massive aerial attacks against ukraine s power grid and other infrastructure since oct 10 as the war approaches its nine month milestone that targeted onslaught has caused widespread blackouts and deprived millions of ukrainians of electricity heat and water ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy says russian missile strikes have damaged more than half of the country s energy facilities temperatures commonly stay below freezing in ukraine in the winter and snow has already fallen in many areas including kyiv ukrainian authorities have started evacuating civilians from recently liberated sections of the southern kherson and mykolaiv regions out of fear that the winter will be too hard to survive heeding the call women and children including a little red headed boy whose shirt read in english made with love carried their limited belongings along with dogs and cats onto trains departing from the newly liberated city of kherson we are leaving now because it s scary to sleep at night departing resident tetyana stadnik said on a cramped night sleeper train monday as a dog wandered around shells are flying over our heads and exploding it s too much we will wait until the situation gets better and then we will come back home another resident said leaving was the right thing to do to help the country no one wants to leave their homes but they re even advising to leave they d have to warm us up when it s needed for other people if we have an opportunity to leave we can at least help ukraine with something alexandra barzenkova said as she sat on a train bunk bed more hardship was in store for those remaining kovalenko said even if no more russian airstrikes occur a highly unlikely situation scheduled outages will be needed to ensure that power is evenly distributed the repeated russian attacks with the most severe on nov 15 involving 100 heavy rockets have damaged practically every thermal and hydroelectric power plant in the country and the scale of destruction is colossal volodymyr kudrytskyi the ceo of ukrenergo the state owned power grid operator said tuesday in addition electric substations have been damaged while nuclear power plants have largely been spared he said kyiv regional authorities said

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of

s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

rose bond yields slipped as fed minutes reaffirm slowing of hikes stocks jumped and bond yields slid after the minutes from the last federal reserve policy meeting were less hawkish than investors feared and reaffirmed the slowing of rate hikes it s largely as expected i think the fed is saying they re going to slow the pace it s about the terminal rate and i generally don t think they know exactly where the terminal rate is going to lie said greg faranello of amerivet securities they ll notch up another 50 in december and we ll see how the data goes in 2023 a basis point equals 0 01 of a percentage point the market expects a terminal rate or end point for fed rate hikes at about 5 the minutes showed that a majority of fed officials believe a slowing in the pace of rate hikes would soon be appropriate the market has been anticipating a 50 basis point hike in december following four hikes of 75 basis points each the minutes also noted that a slower pace would allow the fed to assess whether it is making progress toward its goals of maximum employment and price stability not particularly surprising but with several officials seeing increased risks from rapid rate hikes the committee is clearly acknowledging that the hiking campaign is not going to be without consequence for the real economy wrote ian lyngen head of rates strategy at bmo patti domm investors can reasonably assume a 50 basis point hike in december says lpl financial s roach the federal reserve s november meeting minutes should confirm to investors that a smaller rate hike is coming next month

target to 85 per share which still presents an upside of about 9 1 she said in a note to clients half what hurt the company s performance in its most recent quarter was due to broader economic conditions while the other half was due to issues within the business the health technology company beat analyst expectations for per share earnings while missing on revenue according to its tuesday

supply chain staffing and china the company also lowered expectations for 2023 while saying it thinks it can get expenses controlled by the second quarter however wuensch said it s still getting

old playbook sectors should lead us out of this rout oil stocks may cap off 2022 as the clear market winners in this year s market shakeup but investors should prepare for financials and industrial stocks to take the reigns in 2023 said dcla s sarat sethi they re still going to do well but i don t think they re going to lead us out of there he told cnbc s squawk on the street on wednesday i think financials could lead us out of there as could certain industrials to be sure sethi expects oil and gas companies to remain in leadership positions but sees untapped value in many old playbook companies sethi did not offer specific stock picks but broadly said some industrial companies offer strong pricing power and continue to optimize their balance sheets and create operating leverage companies in the commodities space may also perform well as demand for certain metals outweighs supply the playbook is different and i think investors have to look at specific sectors specific

children with the most common life threatening complication after bone marrow transplantation said dr silviu itescu chief executive of mesoblast these new long term survival data reaffirm the potential significance of remestemcel l as a life saving therapy for children with sr agvhd and are a cornerstone of the company s bla resubmission to the fda for approval of remestemcel l in the treatment of children with sr agvhd the lack of any approved treatments for children under 12 means that there is an urgent need for a therapy that improves the dismal survival outcomes in children we

refractory graft versus host disease sr agvhd survival outcomes have not improved over the past two decades for children or adults with the most severe forms of sr agvhd 3 6 the lack of any approved treatments for children under 12 means that there is an urgent need for a therapy that improves the dismal survival outcomes in children the lack of any approved treatments for children under 12 means that there is an urgent need for a therapy that improves the dismal survival outcomes in children in light of the unmet need remestemcel l has been granted fast track designation and bla priority review from the fda a major milestone in the company s complete response to the fda was the submission at the end of the last quarter of substantial new information on clinical and potency assay items to the investigational new drug ind file for remestemcel l in the treatment of children with sr agvhd as guided by fda mesoblast has optimized a potency assay that was in place at the time of the phase 3 trial and which demonstrates a relationship between the product s activity in vitro and its effects on survival in the phase 3 trial additionally mesoblast has now generated data from the expanded access program eap 275 of 241 children which confirm the ability of the in vitro potency assay to measure product activity relevant to survival outcomes today mesoblast provided new results from a four year observational survival study performed by the center for international blood and marrow transplant research cibmtr on 51 evaluable patients with sr agvhd who were enrolled in mesoblast s phase 3 clinical trial of remestemcel l overall survival in the remestemcel l cohort was 63 at 1 year 51 at 2 years and 49 at 4 years while across four recently published studies of children or adults with sr agvhd who received best available therapy bat or the only fda approved agent for adults survival rates of 40 49 at 1 year and 25 38 at 2 years were seen 7 10 the new long term survival data provide assurance that the short term day 28 responses and early survival through 180 days in the 54 patient phase 3 trial in children with sr agvhd previously presented to fda in the original bla submission are unlikely to have arisen by chance and are a cornerstone of the bla resubmission mesoblast is working towards a potential us approval for remestemcel l and first product

newark n j nov 22 2022 globe newswire their nomadic lifestyle and ravenous raiding have taken army ants dorylinae to most continents on earth but a rare fossil discovery is now offering first evidence that the infamous predators once swarmed a land they are strikingly absent from today europe in the journal biology letters researchers at new jersey institute of technology and colorado state university have reported the discovery of the oldest army ant on record preserved in baltic amber dating to the eocene 35 million years ago the eyeless specimen dissimulodorylus perseus d perseus named after the mythical greek hero perseus who famously defeated medusa with the limited use of sight marks just the second fossil army ant species ever described and the first army ant fossil recovered from the eastern hemisphere sized at roughly 3 millimeters in length researchers say the ant fossil brings to light previously unknown army ant lineages that would have existed across continental europe before undergoing extinction in the past 50 million years remarkably the fossil had been kept in obscurity for nearly 100 years in the museum of comparative zoology at harvard university before being identified by the paper s lead author and njit ph d candidate christine sosiak the museum houses hundreds of drawers full of insect fossils but i happened to come across a tiny specimen labeled as a common type of ant while gathering data for another project said sosiak once i put the ant under the microscope i immediately realized the label was inaccurate i thought this is something really different this amber would have been excavated around or before the 1930s so to now learn it contained a rare army ant is surprising enough much less one that demonstrates these ants roamed europe said phillip barden assistant professor of biology at njit and senior author of the paper from everything we know about army ants living today there s no hint of such extinct diversity with this fossil now out of obscurity we ve gained a rare paleontological porthole into the history of these unique predators a paleontological porthole into a unique predator s history today there are about 270 army ant species living in the eastern hemisphere and roughly 150 across north and south america based on x ray and ct scan analysis of the fossil the njit team gathered phylogenetic and morphological data that places d perseus as a close relative to eyeless species of army ants currently found in africa and southern asia called dorylus at the time the fossil formed europe was hotter and wetter than it is today and may have provided an ideal habitat for ancient army ants said barden europe underwent several cooling cycles over tens of millions of years since the eocene however which may have been inhospitable to these tropical adapted species the team s analysis further revealed that the ant possessed an enlarged antibiotic gland typically found in other army ants for sustaining life underground suggesting the long lost european army ant lineage was similarly suited to subterranean living it s a factor sosiak says makes this fossil and other fossil army ants a rarity only one definitive fossil had been recorded until now unearthed from the caribbean 16 ma this was an incredibly lucky find because this ant was probably subterranean like most army ants today it was much less likely to come into contact with tree resin that forms such fossils said sosiak we have a very small window into the history of life on our planet and unusual fossils such as this provide fresh insight sosiak says d perseus anatomical traits including its sharply pointed mandibles and lack of eyes help classify the specimen as a worker ant in its colony which would have been involved in carrying its queen s larvae and raiding for food with soldier ants when it was alive army ant workers participate in raiding swarms hunting other insects and even vertebrates because these army ants are blind they use chemical communication to stay coordinated with one another to take down large prey explained sosiak this worker may have strayed too far from its fellow hunters and into sticky tree resin which eventually solidified and encased the ant as we see it today army ants distinct combination of behavior and traits is so unusual in the ant world that it s warranted its own name army ant syndrome in contrast with other ant lineages army ants have wingless queens capable of laying millions of eggs a day while their nomadic colonies temporarily occupy nests between phases of travel that take the shape of bivouacs sometimes involving millions of ants stretching for 100m the carnivores are perhaps best known for their highly coordinated foraging that can involve consuming upwards of 500 000 prey a day barden says army ant syndrome is a case of convergent evolution that would have occurred twice once in the neotropics and once in the afrotropics the discovery is the first physical evidence of the army ant syndrome in the eocene establishing that hallmarks of these specialized predators were in place even before the ancestors of certain army ants like dorylus said barden for now the newly identified fossil joins just eight fossil species within the ant subfamily that army ants belong to called dorylinae five from dominican amber 16 ma and three species known from baltic amber 34 ma d perseus will remain deposited at the museum of comparative zoology at harvard university for future study sosiak ce borowiec ml barden p 2022 an eocene army ant

vending machines are being installed in cities and towns across the us that dispense narcan nasal spray the antidote to fentanyl overdoses as opioid deaths across the country continue to spiral in 2021 around 71 000 americans died as a result of fentanyl overdoses this year 75 000 americans have already died from the lethal drug the high number of fentanyl deaths is exacerbated by the fact that users don t know the fatal drug is laced into various other substances including cocaine and methamphetamine the purpose of the vending machines which are largely being paid for by non profits is to allow users themselves to gain access to narcan in most cases users are given a code from a local non profit to use on the machine in september it was reported that the police chief of vine grove kentucky kenneth mattingly had to refill the narcan dispenser he put outside of his police station seven times in just one month the town has a population of around 7 000 mattingly told the wall street journal on november 9 that he has personally administered narcan at least twice fentanyl related deaths in the us continue to spiral out of control in september it was widely reported that the town of vine grove in kentucky s police chief kenneth mattingly was regularly refilling the narcan dispenser he put outside of his police statio when asked about the reasoning behind the installing the vending machines mattingly said for my agency a death investigation is taxing a 2021 study by the university of washington found that 94 percent of cases where narcan is administered the administration is done by users according to the wall street journal the journal s report also mentions that vending machines stocking narcan also stock free snacks condoms and socks most narcan kits include a single dose of naloxone instructions for use and a referral to treatment for substance use disorder the machines hold up to 300 naloxone kits and is free for the public to access julie burgess with the wittern group a 90 year old vending machine company at the forefront of narcan distribution told wsj they re putting them in fire stations jails churches places that are public burgess also said that the company is in contact with around 100 different groups that supply free narcan across the country funding for narcan vending machines was included in the biden administration s 30 million hhs harm reduction grant program which was unveiled in february this year earlier this month a joint effort between the southwest washington accountable community of health and beacon behavioral health funded a narcan vending machine project to the tune of 165 000 in southwest washington the above graph show the cdc estimates for the number of deaths triggered by drug overdoses per year drug users are given a code by local charities to use on the machine fentanyl binds to opioid receptors in areas of the brain that control pain and emotions during an overdose the brain is starved of oxygen which kills off neurons in october a vending machine in a jail lobby in wayne county indiana saved the life of deputy brandon creech creech became ill after encountering fentanyl on a suspect other local deputies and other first responders all intervened to rush to creech s aide the frail county trooper was then injected with three doses of narcan which local authorities said stabilized his condition medical experts assure the public that it is highly unlikely that someone can overdose on fentanyl by coming into contact with it the drug is the most dangerous when ingested or snorted through the nose but there is no known cases of overdose being caused the skin fentanyl binds to opioid receptors in areas of the brain that control pain and emotions during an overdose the brain is starved of oxygen which kills off neurons what is fentanyl and why is it so dangerous fentanyl was originally developed in belgium in the 1950s to aid cancer patients with their pain management given its extreme potency it has become popular amongst recreational drug users overdose deaths linked to synthetic opioids like fentanyl jumped from nearly 10 000 in 2015 to nearly 20 000 in 2016 surpassing common opioid painkillers and heroin for the first time and drug overdoses killed more than 72 000 people in the us in 2017 a record driven by fentanyl it is often added to heroin because it creates the same high as the drug with the effects biologically identical but it can be up to 50 times more potent than heroin according to officials in the us in the us fentanyl is classified as a schedule ii drug indicating it has some medical use but it has a strong potential to be abused and can create psychological and physical dependence advertisement the narcotic was developed as a painkiller to be used in hospitals but its cheap manufacturing costs and high potency has made it a favorable cutting agent for drug dealers meth cocaine and street xanax are just some of the drugs that are being laced with fentanyl just 2milligrams the equivalent of five grains of salt of fentanyl is enough to cause an overdose america is currently in the midst of a fentanyl epidemic with around 200 americans dying from the synthetic opioid every day to put that in context covid is currently responsible for around 290 deaths per day according to most recent official data researchers at the university of michigan found that a man that doused his hands in fentanyl for a long period of time had no signs of an overdose later meanwhile in march the recent case of six west point cadets who overdosed on fentanyl laced cocaine during spring break in florida put the dangers and pervasiveness of the fentanyl crisis back in the spotlight the chemical precursors to the drugs are being shipped largely from china to mexico where much of the illicit fentanyl supply is produced in labs before being smuggled into the u s in november reports that a new vaccine was being developed emerged it may be able to totally block the effects of fentanyl potentially saving thousands of americans from overdoses each year researchers at the university of houston in texas developed a shot that was able to stop the extremely potent drug from entering the brains of rats the shot was able to block the drug from entering the brain without affecting other painkillers like morphine meaning a vaccinated person could still be treated with other drugs if needed the vaccine works by stimulating t cells in the immune system to create antibodies which bind to fentanyl in the bloodstream these immune proteins catch the drug as it enters the body and prevent it from spreading further and causing harm it then gets processed in the kidney and flushed from the body researchers told dailymail com the vaccine could be used by people suffering from opioid use disorder or college students who experiment with illicit substances
people on both sides of the political aisle have expressed concerns about president biden s mental acuity but the new york times says no worries age is more than a number reporter sheryl gay stolberg wrote the puff piece for sunday s edition president biden is turning 80 experts say age is more than a number president biden has said it is a legitimate question to ask anybody over 70 years old whether or not they re fit to serve in the white house to those who question his fitness he has a stock answer watch me left unsaid is that mr biden would be 86 at the end of a second term should he run in 2024 and win a fact that his critics have seized upon and that gives even some democrats pause but while the risk of life threatening diseases dementia and death rises faster with each passing decade of a person s life experts in geriatrics say that people in their 80s who are active engaged and have a sense of purpose can remain productive and healthy and that wisdom and experience are important factors to consider wisdom eh the new york times spoke to 10 experts in aging to paint a picture of what the next six years might look like for a person of the president s age mr biden these experts agreed has a lot going in his favor he is highly educated has plenty of social interaction a stimulating job that requires a lot of thinking is married and has a strong family network stolberg rounded up excuses for biden s miscues including searching an audience for a congresswoman who had died the previous month as common in older people this was the red flag that wasn t mr biden did not undergo cognitive screening during his last physical and experts are divided about its necessity for older adults stolberg concluded with this stunner as to whether age should matter in any election dr nir barzilai who is leading a study of centenarians and directs the institute for aging research at the albert einstein college of medicine put it simply age he said is not something to consider on its own compare that incuriosity about biden s failure to get a cognitive screening with the unforgiving times editorial of may 4 2008 demanding then republican presidential candidate sen john mccain release even more detail about his bouts with melanoma senator john mccain is 71 years old a survivor of an aggressive form of skin cancer if elected he would be the oldest man to become president these factors are not disqualifying but they impose on mr mccain a larger duty than usual to provide detailed timely disclosure about his health so far he has failed to meet this obligation to voters even though he is now the presumed republican nominee even after mccain opened up his medical records to the press the editorial page was still not satisfied complaining on october 21 2008 that reporters were not allowed to photocopy any documents making it harder for them to ask other experts what the medical findings might imply there s an interesting sidelight about then sen biden regarding his past surgery for potentially life threatening aneurysms in the brain a possible ongoing health concern ignored by stolberg s current story at the times only senior citizen republican presidential candidates are suspect while significantly older democratic candidates get soft age is more than a number scrutiny

meet the rideshare professor thanksgiving strike nationwide thanksgiving strike uber lyft uber eats doordash grubhub postmates instacart and amazon flex drivers go on a 3 day thanksgiving strike and are switching their apps off uber and lyft drivers are striking and we call on all passengers to join us during this thanksgiving boycott rideshare professor los angeles california united states november 22 2022 einpresswire com uber doordash ola bolt uber eats grubhub postmates instacart and amazon flex drivers strike over thanksgiving weekend from november 23 to november 26 2022 â app based workers are fed up with exploitation from big tech companies â said torsten kunert also known as the rideshare professor on youtube â without drivers there is no uber â without drivers there is no lyft and the companies need to understand that the thanksgiving strike is led by rideshare drivers and food delivery drivers fighting back and saying enough is enough â this is beyond greed uber has placed its workforce in very dangerous circumstances and the result is driver overwork declining mental health and families in great distress drivers implore the government to dismiss the uber and lyft spin and urgently intervene to enforce the law against what are increasingly out of control companies â said kunert uber and lyft have introduced â upfrontâ pricing in recent years showing passengers the estimated cost of a trip to avoid the surprise fares that could accompany pricing that surges with demand but unlike a traditional taxi meter system which pays drivers a set portion of the passenger fare drivers are instead paid according to time and mileage regardless of the rideâ s price leading to consternation about the gulf between the companiesâ cut and theirs the attitude toward those drivers who had chosen not to strike was not one of condemnation â itâ s because they canâ t afford to take the day off â said kunert the rideshare professor has called on the top youtubers such as the rideshare guy dustin is driving rideshare hub gig nation real rideshare stories pedro doordash santiago show me the money club ride along with bri averlyn browne eddie doyle and many other gig youtubers to participate and publish youtube videos promoting the thanksgiving strike collectively we have over one million subscribers drivers can easily shut them down for three days the strike was spearheaded by rideshare professor who also called upon all unions and rideshare organizations to join in and promote the strike he reached out to unions in the usa and internationally adcu a uk based association and rideshare drivers united a los angeles based association of drivers were asked to support rideshare drivers food delivery drivers and passengers using the gig apps â itâ s really hard to figure out how much youâ re actually making at the end of the day especially after all your expenses transparency is gone for riders and drivers technology has long promised to bring more transparency but the algorithms that decide how much drivers are paid have increased opaqueness over their income uber and lyft you canâ t hideâ we can see your greedy side â says andrew a los angeles uber driver the strikes could still have an impact on passenger fares and wait times in some cities and airports the strikes were expected to span 96 hours from november 23 to november 26 depending elsewhere organizers advised passengers to boycott the apps between certain hours in solidarity and many drivers have put in long hours already this week to help make up the hours the rideshare professor channel urges all rideshare food delivery taxi and limo drivers to participate the message drivers and riders need better safety features in the app and drivers need immediate increase in pay assistance at the gas pump a proper review of wrongful deactivations and a substantial investment into transparency drivers demand that ceos such as uber s dara khosrowshahi lyft s logan green doordash s tony xu start listening to driver s needs and wants when it comes to safety in rideshare vehicles drivers are doing what they can to protect themselves some are avoiding nights some only pick up passengers from the airports and others have taken to wearing bulletproof vests some safety tips for riders and drivers the combination of dashcams rider id photos real names new enhancements within the app for safety and people being aware of their surroundings and making sure they re getting into the right vehicle are very important safety precautions daily car jackings assaults rapes stabbings shootings have put drivers on edge many are too afraid to switch on their apps and be the next victim surely these ceos must realize that daily negative press is influencing the public perception of these gig companies and can not be good for their image and stock price it comes as no surprise to me that these gig company stocks are at an all time low not many people have faith in the future in these gig companies especially after they have seen their fares skyrocket and read the daily negative news still the companies refuse to listen or address the main issues that face drivers worldwidesome interesting gig facts the rideshare professor was one of the top driver recruiters for both uber and lyft companies in over 600 cities he then became an advocate for drivers after uber and lyft wiped out 950 000 of his unpaid referrals they owed in 2019 today rideshare professor works with 11 law firms and class action attorneys unions and driver associations worldwide to help drivers have a say at the table and get the settlements they deserve torsten kunert founded rideshare professor in 2015 and gigrocket in 2021 to help boost the potential of drivers and show them

completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net

portland ore ktvz drivers fueling up ahead of thanksgiving will find falling pump prices in all 50 states unfortunately gas prices will be the most expensive ever for the holiday aaa oregon idaho reported tuesday for the week the national average for regular tumbles 12 cents to 3 76 a gallon the oregon average plunges 17 cents to 4 77 the fifth largest weekly drop for a state in the nation aaa projects 54 6 million americans 16 4 of the population will travel 50 miles or more from home for the thanksgiving holiday up 1 5 from 2021 this year is expected to be the third busiest for thanksgiving travel since aaa started tracking in 2000 only behind 2005 and 2019 about 777 000 oregonians will head over the river and through the woods for turkey and all the trimmings find details and tips for travelers in the aaa thanksgiving news release gas prices have never been more expensive for thanksgiving with the national and oregon averages at their highest prices ever for the holiday those who hit the road for thanksgiving will find gas prices that are as much as 90 cents a gallon more expensive than last year says marie dodds public affairs director for aaa oregon idaho still we can be thankful that pump prices are moving in the right direction for now crude oil prices are at their lowest prices in 10 months and that s helping to put downward pressure on pump prices crude prices remained in a fairly tight range between about 85 and 93 per barrel for several weeks until this week when prices fell to 80 as markets focused on a potential slowdown for global economies driven by the seemingly increasing covid 19 outbreak in china crude oil prices climbed above 90 briefly earlier this month crude reached a recent high of 122 11 per barrel on june 8 and ranged from about 94 to 110 per barrel in july in august crude prices ranged between about 86 and 97 in september crude prices ranged between about 76 and 88 per barrel in october crude ranged between 82 and 92 per barrel crude prices rose dramatically leading up to and in the first few months of russia s invasion of ukraine russia is one of the world s top oil producers and its involvement in a war causes market volatility and sanctions imposed on russia by the u s and other western nations resulted in tighter global oil supplies oil supplies were already tight around the world as demand for oil increased as pandemic restrictions eased a year ago crude was around 77 per barrel compared to 81 today crude oil is the main ingredient in gasoline and diesel so pump prices are impacted by crude prices on the global markets on average about 56 of what we pay for in a gallon of gasoline is for the price of crude oil 20 is refining 11 distribution and marketing and 14 are taxes according to the u s energy information administration demand for gasoline in the u s fell from 9 01 million to 8 74 million b d for the week ending november 11 this compares to 9 24 million b d at this time last year rose by nearly 2 2 million bbl to 207 9 million bbl increasing supply and falling demand have helped to push pump prices lower as demand remains low and stocks grow drivers will likely see pump prices dip through the thanksgiving holiday quick stats pump prices are lower this week in all 50 states and the district of columbia wisconsin 24 cents has the largest weekly drop hawaii 1 cent has the smallest weekly decline california 5 12 has the most expensive gas in the country for the 11th week in a row california and hawaii 5 20 are the only two states with averages at or above 5 a gallon this week nine states including oregon have averages at or above 4 and 41 states and the district of columbia have averages in the 3 range the cheapest gas in the nation is in texas 2 98 and georgia 3 09 for the 98th week in a row no state has an average below 2 a gallon the difference between the most expensive and least expensive states is 2 23 which continues to be stark oregon is one of 39 states and the district of columbia with lower prices now than a month ago the national average is 17 cents less and the oregon average is 51 cents less than a month ago oregon has the third largest monthly decrease in the nation california 58 cents and alaska 55 cents have the largest monthly declines maine 22 cents has the largest month over month increase oregon is one of 47 states and the district of columbia with higher prices now than a year ago the national average is 23 cents more and the oregon average is 82 cents more than a year ago this is the fourth largest year over year increase in the nation alaska 87 cents and hawaii 86 cents have the largest yearly gains georgia 14 cents has the biggest year over year decline west coast the west coast region continues to have the most expensive pump prices in the nation with all seven states in the top 10 this is typical for the west coast as this region tends to consistently have fairly tight supplies consuming about as much gasoline as is produced in addition this region is located relatively far from parts of the country where oil drilling production and refining occurs so transportation costs are higher and environmental programs in this region add to the cost of production storage and distribution refinery issues in california in september and october exacerbated the situation creating extremely tight supplies and causing pump prices in this region to skyrocket rank region price on 11 22 22 1 california 5 21 2 hawaii 5 20 3 nevada 4 83 4 washington 4 64 5 oregon 4 60 6 alaska 4 60 7 idaho 4 18 8 arizona 4 17 9 pennsylvania 4 01 10 utah 3 97 as mentioned above california is the most expensive state for the 11th consecutive week with hawaii nevada washington oregon and alaska rounding out the top six arizona is eighth oregon is fifth most expensive for the second week in a row all of the west coast states are seeing weekly drops california 22 cents has the largest in the region hawaii 1 cent has the smallest the refinery utilization rate on the west coast rose from 90 1 to 92 7 for the week ending november 11 this is the highest rate in the last year according to eia s latest weekly report total gas stocks in the region increased from 27 19 million bbl to 27 99 million bbl oil market dynamics although crude prices jumped at the end of the week due to a weakening dollar prices dropped earlier in the week after the eia reported that total domestic commercial crude stocks increased dramatically by 4 million bbl the inventory rise could mean that demand is falling due to growing economic concerns in the market for this week market concerns that economic growth will stall or reverses course leading to lower crude demand could push prices lower at the close of friday s formal trading session wti decreased by 1 56 to settle at 80 08 at the close of monday s formal trading session wti lost 35 cents to close at 79 73 the first time wti closed below 80 a barrel since

loses seven cents to 5 29 a gallon the record high is 5 816 set on june 19 the oregon average falls a nickel to 5 51 the record high is 6 47 set on july 3 a year ago the national average for diesel was 3 64 and the oregon average was 3 80 diesel supplies are tight in parts of the u s especially in parts of the eastern u s however recent reports that the u s has less than a month worth of diesel aren t accurate while the u s energy information administration shows the u s has 26 6 days worth of supply of diesel for the week ending november 11 this number actually measures supply if no more diesel would be produced in the u s or imported from other countries supplies of diesel have slowly been rising up from 25 4 days of diesel supply for the week ending oct 14 in 2019 diesel supplies were also very tight with the eia reporting a low of 26 5 days diesel supplies have been impacted by the same factors that have caused supply and demand issues in other industries including the pandemic and the russian invasion of ukraine tight supplies could result in climbing prices for diesel but there have not been significant increases yet earlier story gasbuddy analyst says prices are expected to keep falling chicago ktvz average gasoline prices in oregon have fallen 15 4 cents per gallon in the last week averaging 4 62 g monday according to gasbuddy s survey of 1 307 stations in

in more states than last week i didn t expect every single state to hop on the bandwagon so quickly but it s terrific news as motorists prepare for thanksgiving travel with tens of thousands of stations under 3 per gallon and thousands more to join in the next few weeks barring a dramatic turnaround said patrick de haan head of petroleum analysis at gasbuddy everyone will be seeing relief at the pump this week with even more substantial declines on the way as oil prices plummeted last week to briefly trade under 80 per barrel it s not impossible that if oil markets hold here we could see a national average of 2 99 around christmas certainly the gift that every motorist is hoping for drivers shouldn t be in a rush to fill up as prices will come down nearly coast to coast into the

tsx and otcqx mpvd toronto and new york nov 23 2022 prnewswire mountain province diamonds inc mountain province the company tsx mpvd otc mpvd today announces positive exploration results for its 100 held kennady north project the kennady north project includes over 113 000 hectares of claims and leases that completely surround the gahcho kué diamond mine the 2022 exploration program focused on new discoveries through a detailed analysis of both new and historic geophysical geological and kimberlite indicator mineral kim data interim results for the winter program that focused on geophysical surveys and drilling of lake based anomalies were reported previously see news release may 17 2022 the summer program focused on drilling land accessible geophysical targets and on follow up till sampling over kim anomalies generated from the 2021 till sampling program the combined exploration results for 2022 are summarized in this news release including the new discovery of the hearn northwest extension at the gahcho kué joint venture as previously announced highlights of the 2022 kennady north exploration program the new ke kimberlite area discovered new and distinct occurrence that is located roughly 450 meters east of the kelvin kimberlite defined by three drillholes that have confirmed a series of hypabyssal kimberlite sheets hk with a maximum hk intersect of 2 13 meters that appear to be new and distinct from the nearby kelvin deposit further drilling of the ke kimberlite is currently planned for the 2023 exploration program over 5 000m of exploration drilling 25 of 35 exploration drillholes intersected kimberlite eight volcaniclastic kimberlite intersections on the north anomaly geophysical surveys 1 291 line km of airborne magnetics and electromagnetics 189 line km of high resolution resistivity arrt data 30 line km of ground magnetics 3 139 ground gravity and 161 bathymetry measurements historic hlem and magnetics identified the ke kimberlite kimberlite indicator minerals over 600 strategic till samples processed and assessed from 2021 over 300 follow up till samples in 2022 confirming the 2021 sampling strategies positive kim dispersals identified new areas for geophysics and drilling metals exploration intersection of a hydrothermal breccia with quartz veining and sulfides which remains under review glacial sediment geochemistry identified areas of interest a new claim block was added after a detailed review of historical drill logs was conducted and determined that a drill hole was logged in the early 1990 s as an intersection from 108 to 176 meters of granite quartz syenite with magnetite veinlets throughout the interval and 2 molybdenite based on visual estimations exploration drilling a total of 5 355 9 meters of exploration drilling was completed over the 2022 programs with 25 of 35 drillholes intersecting kimberlite the ke kimberlite is a new and distinct occurrence that is located roughly 450 meters east of the kelvin kimberlite the ke discovery resulted from a review of historical horizontal loop electromagnetic hlem and magnetic geophysical data and was drilled at the end of the summer program the ke kimberlite is defined by three drillholes that have confirmed a series of hypabyssal kimberlite sheets hk with a maximum hk intersect of 2 13 meters further drilling of the ke kimberlite is planned for the 2023 exploration program drilling on the north south ks g6 a003 and p1 anomalies was guided by results from the winter arrt and ground gravity surveys kimberlite was intersected at all but the g6 a003 and p1 areas see the map on the following page thirteen of fifteen drillholes completed at the north anomaly have identified depth extensive zones of hk mixed with highly altered country rock up to 6 93m in thickness vk intersects mixed with hk up to 7 05m in thickness have been intersected in eight drillholes with 3d modeling of the drilling indicating lateral continuity for the vk at the kelvin and

hydrothermal breccia two drillholes testing a near land gravity and arrt anomaly intersected hydrothermal breccia with associated sulfide mineralization that has not been previously observed in this region the veining is clearly hydrothermal with quartz exhibiting both massive and vuggy textures that are intimately associated with pyrite the veins run from a few centimeters up to 4 23 meters in continuous thickness and are associated with hydrothermally altered granite and diabase up to 60m in thickness initial whole rock and trace element data for 14 core samples of both the veins and altered country rock have not revealed any anomalous levels of base or precious metals further sampling of the hydrothermal breccia for geochemical analysis is presently underway with results expected in early 2023 selected images of the p1 core are provided in the second image geophysics the target areas of interest aoi were selected from recently compiled studies of glacial geology and kimberlite indicator mineral kim dispersions over the project area additional target aoi were selected following a review of historical geophysical data for kennady north these datasets were reviewed in several in house workshops held in late 2021 and early 2022 with final ranking of sixteen aoi completed in a joint workshop held with de beers in february 2022 the sixteen aoi were scheduled for arrt and ground gravity surveys during the winter program with a total of 188 8 line km of arrt and 3 139 gravity stations completed over the targets arrt is a proprietary land based resistivity system developed by aurora geoscience yellowknife nt that aided in the discovery of kimberlite at the na sa and ks anomalies as described above arrt is a high resolution ground resistivity system developed by aurora geoscience ltd yellowknife nt that recognizes the physical contrast between competent country rock versus country rock that is broken and altered from emplacement of the adjacent kimberlite in addition to the ground geophysical surveys an airborne magnetic electromagnetic survey was conducted over an area located immediately southeast of gahcho kué for which no historical geophysical data existed a total of 1 291 line km of data were collected over the area one area that lies within the palmer p13 kim area of interest was surveyed with ground magnetics and gravity the two anomalies identified on the new survey are indicated as red circles on the third and fourth images the discovery of the ke kimberlite resulted from an ongoing re interpretation of our historic hlem and magnetic data that has identified an additional 13 drill ready target areas within the core area of the kennady north project these are included in the red circles in the fifth image many of the anomalies lie near or within palmer p aoi that are defined by kim dispersions these new anomalies are presently under review with the intent to drill in winter of 2023 kimberlite indicator minerals over 600 till samples were collected over the project area in 2021 with half of those covering the recently staked kennady east claims the results have identified a ubiquitous dispersion of chromite on the kennady east claims based on morphology and surface features the chromite is believed to be non kimberlitic and is eroded from metavolcanics and metasediments that dominate the geology of these claims non kimberlitic olivine is also present and is likely derived from the same sources as the chromite within the background chromite on kennady east two separate kim anomalies are defined by pyrope and by chrome diopside and follow up sampling was conducted in 2022 to fill in these anomalies on the western claims the 2022 infill sampling has also confirmed the presence of a strong kim train in the southwest of the project area with 29 pyrope in one sample at the suspected head of one of the dispersions results for the remaining samples collected in 2022 are expected in early 2023 and will further resolve these early results all of the samples were treated at the src diamond lab saskatoon sk for kim recovery the distribution of 2021 till sample results is shown in the sixth image with blue arrows indicating pyrope and chrome diopside anomalies on the kennady east claims and the orange arrow showing the location of the sample containing 29 pyrope metals exploration an extensive geochemical and drilling database exists over the kennady north project area in 2019 a due diligence review of historical drilling and glacial sediment geochemical data was started to ensure that both diamonds and metals discovery potential was not overlooked historic drillhole mpv 97 021c that was logged from 108 to 176 meters was reported as granite quartz syenite with magnetite veinlets throughout the interval and 2 molybdenite based on visual estimations consequently five claims were secured over rocks of interest associated with this drillhole the western extension claims are noted on the seventh image which also shows the distribution of glacial sediment geochemistry samples for the project area about the company mountain province diamonds is a 49 participant with de

in the press finding the top financial advisor in the united states means choosing between thousands of options whether you re looking for help with retirement wealth management or tax planning the u s is home to thousands of advisors that can meet your specific needs based on the methodology outlined below smartasset identified these financial advisor firms as among the top 5 financial advisor firms in the u s rank financial advisor assets managed 1 714 587 898 072 2 173 418 270 044 3 46 803 858 104 4 94 617 046 882 5 19 851 537 239 methodology to find the top financial advisors in the u s we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure firms with a fee only as opposed to fee based compensation structure are ranked higher these stats are updated annually and accurate as of may 25 2023 this list may include firms that have a business relationship with smartasset in which smartasset is compensated for lead referrals such relationships have no impact on our rankings and firms are included and ranked based strictly on the above criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please carefully review the methodologies employed in the vanguard whitepaper to receive a copy of the whitepaper please contact compliance smartasset com the value of professional investment advice is only

the need for a skilled information technology and cybersecurity workforce is an issue raised at almost every gathering of federal agencies and industry leaders the need for a skilled information technology and cybersecurity workforce is an issue raised at almost every gathering of federal agencies and industry leaders the overarching conversation may be about the latest zero trust mandates or the most recent guidance from the office of management and budget but a key underlying element remains the need for skilled cybersecurity staff a secure cyber ecosystem is as much about people as it is about technology noted the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency in its 2023 2025 strategic plan which focuses on reducing risk and building resilience to cyber and physical threats facing the nation s infrastructure the plan also strives to cultivate and grow cisa s high performing workforce as one of cisa s primary objectives cyber resilience starts with people recruiting retaining and developing cyber talent is a challenge for most federal agencies as they seek to build cyber resilience currently more than 714 000 cybersecurity jobs are open nationwide with nearly 39 000 unfilled cybersecurity positions in the public sector according to cyberseek additionally the department of labor projects a 14 increase in the need for information security analysts in the federal government through 2030 as cybersecurity is an imperative for bolstering national resilience of course many workers feel called to serve their country or support the mission of a specific department but the government struggles to recruit the volume of workers that it needs just over 7 of all permanent full time federal employees are under the age of 30 compared to more than 19 7 of all private sector employees the federal workforce includes 16 times more workers over the age of 50 than under the age of 30 federal agencies cannot lure the next generation workers with perks that private sector firms can offer higher salaries unlimited paid time off free lunches stock options company sponsored trips and more but agencies can be creative in their recruiting and retention techniques in other ways ensuring that talented cybersecurity personnel are prioritized accordingly as part of the government s greater cyber resilience strategy loan forgiveness consider president joe biden s recent student loan forgiveness program which targets individuals making less than 125 000 or households making less than 250 000 it will help 43 million people according to the white house this program is life changing for many borrowers taking this idea further could be revolutionary for the federal government imagine this scenario the federal government offers one year of loan forgiveness for each year of cybersecurity service such a program would be an amazing recruiting tool enabling agencies to better compete with the perks at silicon valley startups and tech giants in exchange for four years of work students could be free of their student loan debt an existing program provides 10 000 a year in student loan forgiveness up to a lifetime maximum of 60 000 for cyber employees in the federal government this is a great start but it might not be a sufficient incentive for someone with larger loans the average annual tuition at a private four year college is 38 185 and most borrowers incur charges for room and board on top of that imagine if just 0 5 of the 43 million people now eligible for federal student loan forgiveness applied for federal cybersecurity jobs in exchange for four years of college loan forgiveness that would give the government 215 000 people to choose for their cybersecurity vacancies even if only a fraction of selected workers stayed past their four year term the government would still benefit tremendously from their contributions a loan forgiveness program like the one outlined above would enable federal agencies to behave more like the private sector and perhaps even give them a recruiting advantage against private sector tech organizations while the federal government s retirement benefits are a silver lining at the end of a career loan forgiveness could be the pot of gold that entices a new wave of workers to serve their country now and some of them will sign on for the long haul build recruitment into your cyber strategy the fact of the matter is that cyberattacks are growing more frequent expensive and devastating the federal government has a responsibility to improve resilience to cyberattacks to protect critical infrastructure and data this starts with having enough skilled workers to develop and implement the best possible strategies loan forgiveness is just one idea to make this a reality consider what would incentivize new talent to join your agency our national cyber resilience depends on it gary barlet is federal chief technology officer at illumio copyright 2024 federal news network all

photo credit billion photos shutterstock after decades of declining power and influence organized labor in the u s is making a comeback the covid 19 pandemic has set off a number of shifts in the labor market that have given workers more power labor participation rates fell sharply early in the pandemic and still have not recovered to pre pandemic levels the great resignation saw millions of workers leave their jobs in search of better pay or working conditions with the labor market still tight employers have struggled to recruit and retain employees in this context workers have been organizing at rates not seen in decades one of the most high profile examples is the union drive at starbucks stores across the u s over the last year around 250 starbucks locations have voted to unionize since the first starbucks union formed in buffalo ny late in 2021 employees at other major companies have also attempted unionization including retail and factory workers at apple and amazon and the trend extends to white collar industries like tech academia and media where unionization has historically been limited according to the national labor relations board 1 522 votes on unionization have taken place so far in 2022 this is the highest number of union elections since 2015 and an increase of more than 50 over 2021 the recent uptick in unionization could begin to reverse a decades long decline in union membership rates the peak of union membership over the last 50 years was in 1979 when 24 1 of american workers were union members that figure has since fallen by more than half with only 10 3 of workers in a union as of 2021 in raw numbers there are nearly 7 million fewer union members in the u s now than there were in the late 1970s recent trends in unionization are significant to bother workers and employers unionization and collective bargaining materially affect the compensation and working conditions that workers experience for better or for worse in turn these factors can affect employers ability to staff their businesses and the overhead costs they must pay to operate compensation is one of the most notable differences between unionized and non unionized workers as unions are often able to negotiate for higher wages and as unions influence has declined over time so too has the gap in compensation between union and non union employee wages at the height of unionization in the late 1970s and early 1980s union members made over 30 more per hour than their non union counterparts today union members continue to earn more than non union workers but the gap between the two is just 11 the new growth in union membership is unlikely to return the u s to historic levels of unionization and union representation will continue to be stronger in some industries than others certain sectors of the economy have significantly higher rates of union membership than others including transportation utilities public administration and education at the highest end some industries have union membership rates greater than 50 the data used in this analysis is from unionstats com researchers at smartest dollar calculated the union membership rate for

property the property or carangas was commissioned by new pacific metals corp new pacific or the company a company incorporated under the laws of the province of british columbia and listed on the toronto stock exchange tsx under the symbol nuag and the nyse american nysea under the symbol newp to disclose information on the property this report was prepared and authored by donald j birak registered member 260700 of the society of mining metallurgy and exploration sme fellow 209622 of the australasian institute for mining and metallurgy ausimm and independent consultant to the company the qualified person information cited herein is current as of june 16 2022 being the effective date of this report the effective date 1 1 location description and ownership carangas is located in western bolivia figure 1 1 in the cordillera occidental geomorphic province the property is easily accessed by paved and well maintained gravel roads 180 km west southwest of oruro the capital of the department of oruro driving time is approximately four hours between the property and oruro carangas project technical report 2022 9 figure 1 1 location of carangas in western bolivia source new pacific 2022 the property is currently held by minera granville srl granville a private bolivian company via two prospecting and exploration licenses each a pel and together the pels granted by the bolivian jurisdictional administrative mining authority ajam the pels total 6 25 km2 in area figure 4 1 pursuant to bolivian law foreign entities i e persons and or companies are not permitted to hold land within 50 km of bolivia s international borders the exclusion zone as the property is located within the exclusion zone bordering chile the company has entered into a joint venture the joint venture with granville to develop mining activities at the property pursuant to the terms of a mining association agreement between the company and granville the mining association agreement section 4 granville remains the holder of all licenses permits and rights granted to it by bolivian authorities carangas project technical report 2022 10 1 2 property description and mineral rights mineral rights to carangas are administered by the bolivian government the property is held via the pels which are held by granville 1 3 geology and mineralization carangas sits within a large tertiary aged caldera located in the cordillera occidental near its eastern margin with the altiplano of western bolivia mineralization dated at 15 ma is hosted in veins veinlet breccias and porous volcanic rocks and is believed to be epithermal in character grading into intrusive related mineralization in porphyry intrusion s and the cupola of a deeper intrusion at depth 1 4 status of exploration development and operations carangas is an exploration stage project in western bolivia exploration on the property has progressed since the involvement of the company in 2021 through the joint venture as of the effective date the joint venture was using four core drills to explore the area around the west dome of the property the west dome the central valley of the property the central valley and the east dome of the property the east dome as at the effective date over 23 800 m of core with 56 drill holes had been completed some assay data is pending section 10 1 5 data verification the qualified person believes the data reported herein are adequate for the purpose of this report and for use in future mineral resource estimation 1 6 mineral resources and mineral reserves estimates at this stage in its development no mineral resources or mineral reserves have been estimated for the property 1 7 qualified person s conclusions and recommendations section 4 the qualified person believes that the size of the pels is sufficient to support the current level of activities at carangas but additional rights and land will be needed if the deposit continues to grow in size and to support technical and economic studies that may be disclosed in a preliminary economic assessment pea prefeasibility study s or feasibility study s the qualified person is not aware of any other significant factors or risks other than those disclosed in section 4 which may affect the company s access title or the right or ability to perform work on the property section 5 the qualified person recognizes that current water rights are sufficient for the current level of activities at carangas but believes additional water will be necessary to support a mine and material processing operations that may be justified with prefeasibility and feasibility level studies carangas project technical report 2022 11 the qualified peron believes that the size of the pels section 4 at 6 25 km2 is sufficient to contain the limits of the near surface mineralization known as of the effective date however extensions at depth or laterally will likely require additions to the rights to facilitate further exploration and future ancillary facilities section 6 neither the qualified person nor the company have validated the historic drill results and it is not known if core from the historical holes still exists if found the qualified person recommends that the company resurvey the historic holes relog the core and either resample and assay it and or reassay any historic pulps and or coarse rejects the qualified person recommends that historic drill results should not be used in mineral resource estimation unless they can be validated section 7 the qualified person believes that the working model of mineralization at carangas is supported by observations in the field and in drill core and that drilling has been largely well defined based on those observations some of the east west trending mineralization at east dome should be evaluated with drill holes oriented more perpendicular to that trend the qualified person also recommends that company s geologists prepare a selection of rock types type lithologies typical of those in the property see figure 7 3 to be used as a guide for logging by staff at the property section 9 the qualified person believes that the exploration work conducted as of the effective date is appropriate to find and evaluate mineralization within the working model of an epithermal precious metal system a near surface silver rich horizon grading into a more gold rich horizon figure 8 2 the deeper cu and au rich intrusive hosted root or core of the epithermal system has only been evaluated with a few core holes as of the effective date as of the effective date one deep hole dcar0039 intersected several felsic to intermediate intrusions but no porphyry deep penetrating geophysical surveys such as csamt and or titan dcip may help validate the deep potential section 10 the qualified person viewed all aspects of sample collection including drilling placing core in core boxes geologic logging geotechnical data collection sample length selection core photographing core splitting bagging of core samples for geochemical analyses and delivery of samples to the independent commercial laboratory for analyses and found them to be generally industry standard methods the qualified person also reviewed the company s written protocols while core recoveries and quality are generally good examples of poorer core recovery and quality appear to be limited to deeper intercepts under the central valley the company should keep track of where instances of poor recovery occur to assess their impact on future estimation of mineral resources possible methods to minimize this impact including more large diameter core twin drilling and potentially deep reverse circulation drilling with core tails in the horizon of interest should be considered in concert with efforts to emphasize the need for good recoveries and rock quality designation rqd with the contract drilling company overall the drill sample process is carefully executed by the drillers and the staff with no apparent deficiencies that could give rise to systemic bias and impact the reliability of the analytical results carangas project technical report 2022 12 the qualified person believes that while vein and veinlet hosted precious metal mineralization is evident in outcrop adit and core mineralization also occurs in bulk tonnage material such as the breccia that caps west dome and wall rock surrounding the veins veinlets the qualified person believes the core sampling intervals referenced in this section serve to minimize the effect of structurally controlled higher precious metal grades on sampling composites and on future estimation of mineral resources the qualified person recommends that the company s geologists review the company s protocols for calculating core recovery and rqd to ensure reliable data ahead of any mining technical studies focusing especially on core recovery calculations furthermore the qualified person believes a selection of type lithologic and mineralogic specimens should be collected and used to ensure consistency in geologic logging and that a working stratigraphic section be prepared to help define the sequence of lithologic units section 11 the qualified person is satisfied with the company s sample collection preparation handling and quality assurance and quality control qaqc protocols and the security measures implemented by the company and believes that the analytical results are sufficiently reliable and representative of the in situ mineralization to allow for use of the analyses in future mineral resource estimation prior to conducting the mineral resource estimate for carragas the qualified person recommends that the company resurvey several but not more that 10 of the drill hole collars mentioned in this report section 12 the qualified person believes the data reported herein are generally adequate for the purpose of this report and for use in future mineral resource estimation prior to conducting a mineral resource estimate the qualified person reommends that the company resurvey the collar locations of several but not more than 10 of the drill holes to be used in the estimation section 13 the qualified person recommends that future metallurgical tests be performed on each of the major mineral zones defined both in plan view and in section where results have suggested at least three styles of mineralization an upper ag rich zone an intermediate au and ag zone and a deeper au and cu zone section 24 the qualified person is not aware of any additional information necessary to make this report more understandable and not misleading at this early stage in the development of the property the qualified person believes that the acquisition of more land to allow for exploration to extend the current deposit limits is justified given the generally favorable exploration results section 25 the qualified person believes that the company s experience in bolivia on its other properties notably the company s silver sand property silver sand coupled with relatively recent changes in government policies and regulations justifies continuation of work by the joint venture to evaluate the working model of vertically zoned precious and base metal mineralization hosted in extrusive and intrusive rocks the qualified person believes that additional exploration work and efforts to expand mineral rights is justified and should be followed by work leading to the estimation of mineral carangas project technical report 2022 13 resources the qualified person believes there are reasonable expectations for the definition of mineral resources in surface minable configurations to capture the near surface ag and au mineralization the deeper au and base metal mineralization may require additional land rights among other technical factors to support potential pit and or underground mine configurations section 26 based on the results available as at the effective date the qualified person recommends that the remaining 2022 program not already completed as at the effective date should be completed this amounts to about 17 000 m of new core 40 of the budget actual costs for the remaining drilling and work is estimated at us 3 3 million the qualified person believes the unit costs in table 26 1 are reasonable as they compare well to 2021 actual costs but notes that unit costs per meter of drilling may increase through the remainder of 2022 as more deeper core hole are drilled given the results presented herein the qualified person does not see the need to conduct the planned work in phases and recommends that the 2022 budgeted program continue as designed taking into account recommendations in this report section 1 for 2023 the qualified person recommends the following budget preliminary 2023 exploration budget exploration work 2023 budget unit m and samples budget drilling 30 000 to 40 000 us 3 5 to us 4 7 million assaying samples at 1 25 m sample 24 000 to 32 000 us 1 2 to us 1 5 million support equipment us 0 1 million reporting and metallurgy tests us 0 3 million camp hse and travel us 0 2

progress of activities to ajam pay the corresponding mining patent fees every year in advance according to applicable bolivian laws obtain the required environmental license before conducting prospecting and exploration activities in the area and not breach the prohibition to exploit minerals in the area carangas project technical report 2022 18 4 3 process to convert pel to amcs granville has the preferential right to apply to convert the pels at any time to amcs granville has commenced the process to convert the pels to amcs the applicable procedure of signing an amc when the preferential right is exercised is as follows exercising the preferential right does not imply or involve a procedure of migration from a pel to an amc it simply consists of having priority for requesting the signing of an amc over other requests of such nature that may exist or have interest in the same area the procedure for signing the amc once the preferential right is exercised and validated by ajam is subject to the existing procedure for the signing of new amcs in consequence it s necessary to consider that before the amc is deemed to be valid effective and registered by ajam it must have complied with carrying out deliberative meetings of prior consultation with the communities where the requested mining areas are located for its approval and consent the bolivian plurinational legislative assembly approves the amc once ajam has sent the entire file including the administrative resolution that authorizes the signing of the amc 4 4 terms of the joint venture the

the community of carangas and the current facilities at the property though power outages are not uncommon three phase industrial power is available about 8 km to the south off the property near the community of la rivera carangas project technical report 2022 22 5 6 sufficiency of surface rights the qualified peron believes the size of the pels section 4 at 6 25 km2 is sufficient to contain the limits of the near surface mineralization known today however extensions at depth or laterally will likely require additions to the rights to facilitate further exploration and future ancillary facilities carangas project technical report 2022 23 section 6 history the history of the property dates back to the spanish colonial times of the mid 1500s 6 1 prior ownership and historical operators lopez montaño 2019 reported colonial vintage mining activity in the carangas the following historical information was reported by lopez montaño the carangas silver and lead mine was intensively worked by the spaniards who probably mined the oxidized zones with cerargyrite and some native silver towards the end of the 19th century 30 cm wide veins with tennantite and ruby silver were exploited later ownership passed to peruvian and chilean companies in 1926 it was purchased by josé dominguez who carried out rehabilitation and exploration work through a large investment in mechanized equipment compañia minera del sur s a comsur was active in the area in the 1980s other than as disclosed in this section 6 no other owners are known 6 2 historical exploration work very

on the west dome spanish carangas aka orkho thunkho west and san josé adits producing an unknown but likely small amounts of silver copper and lead as evidenced by the small size of the working and nearby dumps the diggings carangas silver mine oruro bolivia lopez montaño 2019 reported that production data is non existent until 1952 when 20 000 tons of slag dumps were sold to private companies it is estimated that approximately 1 5 million tons were extracted from the mine in profitable times ahlfeld 1964 reported similar tonnages of past production as follows en carangas se han explotado más de 1 millón de toneladas de mineral bruto en un sector de 26 extensión reducida la explotación profundizo por unos 30 metros debajo del nivel del rio english translation at carangas more than 1 million gross tonnes of mineral were produced in a small extension exploitation extended to some 30 meters below river level the qualified person is not aware of any other historical production conducted within the limits of the joint venture s property section 4 6 6 qualified persons comments neither the qualified person nor the company have validated the historic drill results and it is not known if core from the historical holes still exists if found the qualified person recommends that the company resurvey the historic holes relog the core and either resample and assay it and or

stratigraphic column of the carangas area source new pacific 2022 jimenez 2020 reports an early miocene date for the carangas formation the following description of the carangas volcanic field rocks was excerpted and modified from lopez montaño 2019 the caldera evolution spans late oligocene to early miocene epochs the rock sequence includes lava flows large volumes of pyroclastic rocks with different degrees of welding and volcano sedimentary rocks upper oligocene to lower miocene volcanic rocks formed in an explosive and extrusive volcanic environment locally associated with events of caldera formation the contact limit is not well defined and it is be presumed that it lies with angular unconformity over a sedimentary sequence of pre neogene age and an underlying precambrian basement the carangas volcanic sequence consists of a variety of pyroclastic rocks with a variable degree of welding lava flows of rhyolitic to andesitic basaltic composition and deposits of volcano sedimentary origin lahars and debris flows carangas project technical report 2022 29 the volcanic rocks with the carangas caldera have a lower sequence known as the negrillos formation mainly exposed around negrillos village it is a 280 m thick and monotonous series made up of volcanic breccia toward the upper part there is an alternation with thick beds of ash flow tuff which include pumice lithic and crystal clasts the intermediate part is called the carangas formation which crops out in the vicinity of carangas village in general it is formed by beds of ash flow tuffs ash fall tuffs pyroclastic surges of rhyolitic composition and variable degrees of welding which intercalate with porphyritic lava flows and volcanic breccia of an andesitic basaltic composition a horizon of ash flow tuffs within this sequence has been dated to 21 7 0 7 ma early miocene by the k ar method intrusive subvolcanic bodies or volcanic domes were emplaced in these rocks possibly related to the

carangas area is dominated by two prominent but relatively low relief hills called west dome and east dome figure 7 4 they are situated in the central to south central part of the carangas caldera the limits of which extend well beyond the limits of the pels a smaller low elevation hill called south dome is about 500 m south of west dome historically west and east domes were known as espiritu santo hill and san antonio respectively a series of west northwest to north northwest and east west trending veinlets and veinlet swarms are exposed on both west dome and east dome figure 7 3 and host ag and au mineralization another example of the veinlets was examined in the san josé adit at the north side of west dome figure 8 1 megaw 2022 describes the west dome area as being dominated by a multi stage rhyolite rhyodacite complex marked by highly heterolithic breccia figure 7 5 is a photograph of the top of west dome showing the heterolithic breccia and small adit carangas project technical report 2022 31 figure 7 5 heterolithic breccia with intercalated tuff west dome crest birak 2022 field visit the outcrop consists of two breccia bodies on top of and below a thinly bedded tuffaceous unit note the depression of the bedded unit at the base of the upper breccia body suggesting deposition of the upper breccia into a soft unlithified tuff or scouring of the tuff figure 7 5 there is no similar breccia on top of east dome the two domes are separately by a northeast southwest trending valley the central valley and the carangas river figure 7 4 the central valley is postulated to be fault controlled by the company s geologists and megaw 2022 mentions that the inferred fault runs through the breccia pipe and that there are features on surface and in core that suggest one can see at least a 900 m vertical section through a highly active multi stage rhyolitic flow dome complex ranging from the uppermost subaqueous subaerial zones down into the hypabyssal throat of the system 7 3 mineralogy ore minerals and gangue the mineralogy of the carangas mineral zone consists of a diverse suite of ore or metallic and gangue minerals occurring as fracture and vein veinlet fillings and disseminations malahoff et al 2021 cited the following mineralogy noted in outcrop and adit exposures carangas project technical report 2022 32 metallic minerals native silver and native gold ruby

time there are at least two main mineralized zones on the property and a third inferred from limited deep drilling as of the effective date figure 8 2 the zones have been described by zhang 2022 as follows upper zone zone 1 formed in a low t p environment with silver and lead but low to no zinc the zone is exposed on the top of west dome hosted in what is interpreted to be maar sediments of unlithified sandy layers intercalated with heterolithic breccia and hydrothermal breccia the heterolithic breccia is comprised of clasts of various lithology and matrix of fine debris of similar lithology as the clasts hydrothermal breccia typically consists of altered rhyolitic clasts which are cemented by chalcedony when the chalcedony looks grey or dark color it hosts silver up locally over 1 000 ppm but when the chalcedony is white silver grades are generally low the grey or dark color of chalcedony may be caused by very fine grained disseminated silver sulfides the heterolilthic breccia generally does not carry high grade silver due to erosion the current thickness of the maar sediments horizon is from few meters to 50 m thick middle zone zone 2 below the maar is volcanic lithic tuff of dacitic composition which is cut by roughly east west northwest west and some east northeast striking fractures filled with sulfides of silver lead and zinc local tectonic breccia may be developed when dense fractures of different orientations crosscut each other with sulfides filled between carangas project technical report 2022 33 breccia clasts the sulfides include pyrite galena and sphalerite and silver minerals there are two types of sphalerite dark sphalerite disseminated in lithic tuff and yellow sphalerite in veins this middle zone of mineralization is normally 200 to 250 m thick below the upper zone and formed in a higher t p environment compared to the upper zone lower zone zone 3 below the middle zone with higher t p grades of silver drop quickly but gold mineralization occurs and increases in grade with depth common mineralization in this zone is disseminated pyrite in strongly argillic to sericite altered tuff or ignimbrite which is cut by veins of pyrite chalcopyrite sphalerite drusy quartz siderite the upper zone was exploited via historic adits at west dome the presence of a deeper au base metal zone was tested in 2022 figures 7 6 7 7 7 8 and 7 9 cross sections through west dome central valley and east dome show the relationships between host rock and mineralization typical of the upper silver and lower gold and silver zones the deeper inferred gold and base metal zone is depicted in figure 8 2 down hole rock types are shown on the right side of each drill hole trace while down hole assays are on the left side on all cross sections composited precious and base metal assays are shown with annotated red brackets while the dominant mineral trends are west northwest and northwest there are some occurrences of east northeast striking mineralized features figure 7 4 the majority of carangas drilling was planned to intersect the dominant mineral trends as near to perpendicular as possible due to the configuration of relatively flat lying near surface mineralization at west dome drilling at that target has been variable in azimuth and inclination carangas project technical report 2022 34 figure 7 6 cross section through west dome

assays and logged rock types at west dome ag central valley ag and au and east dome ag respectively au values are not plotted on either the west dome nor east dome cross sections as those values initially determined by icp ms are very low and were not followed up carangas project technical report 2022 38 with fire assay methods au icp ms analyses on central valley drill samples are more significant and were followed up with fire assaying core sections of no recovery are also plotted mineralization at west dome is ag dominant with base metals hosted in principally in tuff and breccia figure 7 6 a photograph of the breccia exposed in the upper part of west dome is shown in figure 7 5 mineralization at central valley potentially the core of the carangas mineral system grades from and upper ag dominant style figure 7 7 to a deeper zone with more au figure 7 8 central valley mineralization is hosted in tuff and felsic intermediate and mafic composition intrusives interpreted to be dikes similar to west dome mineralization at east dome is also ag dominant figure 7 9 with base metals hosted in tuffs and intermediate to mafic composition intrusions interpreted to be dikes malahoff et al 2021 mentioned that dikes do not host mineralization though the drill data shown on the cross sections in this section 7 suggest differently 7 5 qualified person s comments the qualified person believes the working model of mineralization at carangas is supported by observations in the field and in drill core and that drilling has been largely well defined based on those observations some of the east west trending mineralization at east dome should be evaluated with drill holes oriented more perpendicular to that trend the qualified person also recommends that company geologists prepare a selection of rock types type lithologies typical of those at the property figure 7 3 to be used as a guide for logging by the staff carangas project technical report 2022 39 section 8 deposit types the current model for mineralization at carangas is epithermal in character with silver in veins veinlets breccias and disseminations hosted in porous tertiary aged volcanic and volcaniclastic host rocks of the carangas formation on surface the veins veinlets strike west northwest and dip vertically to steeply to the south soutwest figure 8 1 smaller scale vein sets trend more northerly and east northeast west southwest figure 7 2 the breccia body showing both matrix and clast supported textures that caps west dome is mineralized figure 7 5 figure 8 1 ag bearing veins and veinlets west dome birak 2022 field visit manganese oxide mineralization is common in veins veinlets breccias and on fracture and joint surfaces especially in the upper oxidized portions of the deposit figure 8 1 lopez montaño 2019 referred to the carangas mineral system as epithermal in character and described them as follows the deposits in the carangas district are typified as epithermal mainly of vein type although dissemination and stockwork types also occur mineralization occurs as open space fillings veins and veinlets and displays a typical drusic banded and or crustified texture variably crystallized euhedral to anhedral ore minerals are silver bearing galena light coloured sphalerite pyrite and chalcopyrite accessory minerals lead zinc and silver sulfosalts silver bearing tennantite and tetrahedrite enargite pyrargyrite polybasite cerargyrite and stephanite native silver is also present and locally native gold appears in a gangue of quartz chalcedony iron and or manganese carbonates siderite and rhodochrosite barite and alunite carangas project technical report 2022 40 hydrothermal alteration occurs as halos surrounding veins and veinlets the width of the altered zones is proportional to the fracture density from several hundred meters to a few tens of meters or less the most common alteration assemblage is argillization that changes into sericitization and finally to propillitization outwards silicification is limited to the vein selvages and sinter deposits whereas advanced argillization is restricted to local zones malahoff et al 2021 suggested that carangas mineralization is low sulfidation epithermal in character arce 2009 suggests the presence of drusy banded and crustiform vein textures and the presences of locally abundant base metals may indicate an intermediate sulfidation style of mineralization for carangas arce 2009 more recently megaw 2022 noted the change from the upper silver rich zone with zinc and lead changing to more gold rich style at carangas and he drew a comparison to the sediment and intrusion hosted metates deposit chesapeake gold 2021 in durango mexico another analogy may be the volcanic hosted ag and au rochester deposit in nevada pascoe et al 2020 finally recent drilling results released by the company july 13 2022 press release which reported in addition to the near surface silver dominant mineralization wide zones of gold dominant mineralization these and other results from 2022 lead to the hypothesis of an intrusion or porphyry affinity for carangas a blended

mineralization consumed the magnetic minerals in the formation of sulfides a process known as sulfidation evident in core this model lends credence to the company s model in figure 8 2 and suggests that the center of the hydrothermal system the large magnetic low blue to green colors in figure 9 1 lies below the central valley however there are other low magnetic responses that bear further investigation including a more diffuse anomaly north of the village megaw 2022 postulated the potential for additional mineralization in that north magnetic anomaly 9 2 qualified person s comments on exploration work the qualified person inspected underground workings and outcrops which had been sampled by the company and believes the methods employed as of the effective date continous chip sampling across the visibly mineralized structure veins bodies was appropriate to find and evaluate mineralization within the working model of an epithermal precious metal system a near surface silver rich horizon grading into a more gold rich horizon figure 8 2 at depth the deeper cu and au rich intrusive hosted root or core of the epithermal system has only been evaluated with a few core holes as

log the cores for rock type mineralization alteration and structures core recovery and rqd measurements are collected by the geologist according to a separate set of protocols entitled procedures for core recovery and rqd measurements geologists determine sample intervals and mark each interval and diamond saw cut lines the sampling interval ranges from 1 0 to 1 5 core length based on natural geologic breaks photos of wet and dry core are taken prior to cutting protocols for photographing the core have been established in a separate document procedures of core photography and samples are collected every 10 to 20 m for density measurements dry and immersed in water inspection of core at the joint venture s sample logging and processing facility in the carangas village revealed a wide range of recoveries and rqd figure 10 2a and 10 2b figure 10 2a show examples of good core recovery and quality in hole dcar0031 boxes 89 90 and 91 changing down hole to poorer recovery and quality in the same drill hole boxes 128 and 131 figure 10 2b these three core intervals were selected for the qualified person s qaqc sampling as presented in section 13 examination of the company s core recovery and rqd data shows the following statistic for approximately 7 900 measurements total intervals measured 7 984 core recovery range 0 to 120 average core recovery 95 6 number of intervals with 100 recovery 1 358 or 17 recovery standard deviation 18 6 core recoveries in excess of 100 are not uncommon and can be due to a variety of reasons such as incorrect placement of core blocks in the core boxes and down hole accumulation of core fragments especially in low rqd sections see figure 10 2b no other drilling sampling or recovery factors are known other than those mentioned in this section 10 that could have affected the reliability of the results carangas project technical report 2022 45 figure 10 2a example of high core recovery and quality hole dcar0031 boxes 89 90 91 birak

sampling lengths used at carangas vary between 1 and 1 5 m of core in sections of low core recovery sample lengths may be longer to allow for collection of sufficient sample weight the sampling approach minimizes emphasis on thin visually strongly mineralized intervals on composites which may bias future estimation of mineral resources 10 5 effect of higher grades on sample grades in many hydrothermal deposits it is common to have higher grade mineralization hosted in veins veinlets and favorable structures and lower grade mineralization or even no mineralization in the wall rock as shown in figure 8 1 there are narrow high grade veins and veinlets at carangas but the surrounding porous volcanic rock is also mineralized this is especially true for the porous hydrothermal breccia that caps west dome 10 6 qualified person s comments the qualified person viewed all aspects of sample collection including drilling placing core in core boxes geologic logging geotechnical data collection sample length selection core photographing core splitting bagging of core samples for geochemical analyses and delivery of samples to the independent commercial laboratory for analyses and found them to be generally industry standard methods the qualified person also reviewed the company s written protocols while core recoveries and quality are generally quite good examples of poorer core recovery and quality appear to be limited to deeper intercepts under the central valley the company should keep track of where instances of poor recovery occur to assess their impact on future estimation of mineral resources possible methods to minimize this impact including more large diameter core twin drilling and potentially deep reverse circulation drilling with core tails in the horizon of interest should be considered in concert with efforts to emphasize the need for good recoveries and rqd with the contract drilling company overall the drill sample process is carefully executed carangas project technical report 2022 51 by the drillers and the staff with no apparent deficiencies that could give rise to systemic bias and impact the reliability of the analytical results the qualified person believes that while vein and veinlet hosted precious metal mineralization is evident in outcrop adit and core mineralization also occurs in bulk tonnage material such as the breccia that caps west dome and wall rock surrounding the veins veinlets the qualified person believes the core sampling intervals referenced in this section should minimize the effect of structurally controlled higher precious metal grades on sampling composites and on future estimation of mineral resources the qualified person recommends that the company s geologists review company protocols for calculating core recovery and rqd to ensure reliable data ahead of any mining technical studies focusing especially on core recovery calculations carangas project technical report 2022

facilities in lima peru no sample preparation is performed by the company s staff except for preparation of coarse blank material used to check sample preparation procedures used by the certified laboratory 11 2 company qaqc protocols the qualified person viewed the company s qaqc protocols during the site visit the qaqc process starts after core cutting aand sampling nd is summarized as follows core is cut with diamond impregnated saws parallel to the core axis where core rqd is poor such as in figure 10 2b company staff separate the core for assaying by a with a trowel and a scope half of the core is bagged plastic sacks for each individual 1 0 to 1 5 m core sample interval the company has prepared booklets of pre numbered sample tags one tag is fastened to the portion of the core box corresponding the sample interval one tag is inserted into plastic sample bag and one tag is retained in the sample tag booklet which is kept in the carangas field office standards and blanks are inserted into the sample stream according to the company s protocols in total of a normal run of 100 samples for assay 2 will be twin samples 2 will be coarse duplicates 3 will be coarse blanks 2 will be pulp duplicates 5 will be commercial standards certified reference material or crm 2 will be fine blanks and 5 will be umpire lab checks for a total of 21 figure 11 1 full sample bags are sealed and stored in a locked secured facility in the village of carangas prior shipment by company staff to the certified commercial laboratory reject samples and pulps returned from the commercial laboratory are kept in a locked building in the village carangas project technical report 2022 53 figure 11 1 carangas qaqc sample insertion rate source new pacific qaqc procedures 2021 11 3 qaqc results blanks blanks are used by the company to check the sample preparation step of the assay process the following graphs figure 11 2 and 11 3 show the performance of gold analyses by fire assay in coarse blanks and silver by icp in coarse blanks respectively only gold is analyzed by fire assay at carangas all other elements are determined by icp methods all images in this section 11 were sourced from the company s internal qaqc reports figure 11 2 blank au by fire assay figure 11 3 blank ag by icp carangas project technical report 2022 54 the black lines in the two graphs is the mean average value of all the blanks au or ag the blue dashed line the warning line is the mean 0 1 ppm for au and 1 0 ppm for ag and the red dashed line the control line is the mean 0 2 ppm for au and 2 0 ppm for ag any value outside of the limits of the control line require action by the carangas team to either accept or reject the values and request another analysis the company established the plotting limits the qualified person believes this method to assess blank assay quality is acceptable but has also noted that a plot of the mean value which may be a certified value and plots of or 1 standard deviation for the warning line and of 2 standard deviations from the mean for the control line common in the mineral exploration industry overall au and ag blanks at carangas show good precision a measure of how close values are to each other and accuracy a measure of close values are to a true value 11 4 qaqc results duplicates coarse pulp and ¼ core the company has used three types of duplicate qaqc samples coarse pulps and ¼ core the following graphs figures 11 4 11 5 and 11 6 illustrate the performance of the three types of duplicates for ag as of the effective date similar plots are prepared for au which is a minor component in the upper reaches of the carangas mineral system and the base metals cu pb and zn the base metals vary across the mineral system with pb and zn being more common ag and cu with au figure 11 4 coarse duplicate ag carangas project technical report 2022 55 figure 11 5 pulp duplicate ag figure 11 6 quarter core duplicate ag the three plots show the one to one correlation line black line and or 10 of the one to one correlation line blue lines and or 20 red lines coarse duplicates serve to assess variability within the first stage of sample preparation crushed product but not pulverized samples the coarse duplicate comparison graph shows good correlation in silver between the original coarse ½ split and the residual duplicate ½ split carangas project technical report 2022 56 pulp duplicates serve to assess variability within the second phase of sample preparation pulverized product and the icp analysis method the pulp duplicate comparison graph shows very good reproducibility in ag lending confidence to the pulverization and analysis processes quarter ¼ core duplicates serve to assess variability in the two parts of the same core run in this case ½ of the ½ or ¼ core while the splitting cutting process is not perfect in any process this method helps assess the natural grade variability in the rock the quarter core duplicate comparison graph shows the base line geologic variability in the core and shows the most variability 11 5 qaqc results standards crms the company uses rocklabs software to plot analyses of certified reference materials crms purchased from cdn research laboratories in langley british columbia five crms are used by the company to check ag assayed by icp and au by fire assay the certified values for of the five metals ag au cu pb and zn are shown in table 11 1 results for crm me 1902 for ag and au are shown in figures 11 7 and 11 8 respectively crm_me 1902 was also used by the qualified person in the independent qaqc sampling conducted during the site visit figure 11 7 performance chart of cdn certified ag standard values icp carangas project technical report 2022 57 figure 11 8 performance chart of cdn certified au standard values fire overall the crms performed well with only few values outside of the process limits defined by the red lines in figures 11 7 and 11 8 the company had used icp for au analyses but the dispersion of values was deemed to be too high for final assays to be used in future mineral resource modeling so the decision was made to use fire assaying for au 11 6 qaqc results umpire checks the company has commenced use of a certified umpire laboratory alfred h knight with a facility in oruro to serve as a check on the primary laboratory as of the effective date no umpire check results were available 11 7 qualified person s qaqc checks the company provided the qualified person with certified reference materiala crms purchased from cdn research laboratories in langley british columbia the certified values for the three crms used by the qualified person are as follows table 11 1 carangas project technical report

coupled plasma analyses after digestion of the sample pulp with 4 acids hcl hno 3 aqua regia hclo 4 perchloric acid and hf hydrofluoric acid fire assaying employed standard 30 gram fusion followed by either icp or atomic absorption finish on the resultant precious metal bead for the qualified person s qaqc sampling both core and pulp checks were performed core checks were selected from the full assay data base to obtain a widely spaced set of samples sixty five 65 ¼ core samples were selected for check assay from 8 core samples in storage at the facilities in carangas results from this set of check analyses performed at als are shown in table 11 2 and figure 11 9 the qualified person pulp checks were selected from pulps from seven 7 drill holes in storage in carangas results from this set of check analyses performed at als peru are shown in table 11 3 and figure 11 10 carangas project technical report 2022 59 table 11 3 qualified person s core check assays carangas project technical report 2022 60 figure 11 9 original au versus check au 1 4 core very low au values not plotted refer to table 11 3 due to the large range of ag values by icp in table 11 3 the check and original ag values were not plotted nonetheless it can be seen from the data in table 11 13 that the comparison between the check ag data compares reasonably well to the original ag date the following table 11 4 shows the comparisons between the original assays for au ag cu pb and zn on pulps highlighted data tan shaded rows are the comparisons between the certified standard values original and the check values on the same certified standard carangas project technical report 2022 61 table 11 4 qualified person pulp check assays figure 11 10 original au vs check au pulps vertical axis is sample number carangas project technical report 2022 62 figure 11 11 original ag versus check ag pulps 11 8 qualified person s comments the qualified person comments that the purpose of a regular program of qaqc is to detect batch errors or drift in analytical results used to evaluate exploration targets and eventually estimate mineral resource estimates it is not cost effective nor advisable to attempt to detect all errors overall the qualified person is satisfied with the sample collection preparation handling company qaqc protocols and security measures implemented by the company and believes the analytical results are sufficiently reliable and representative of the in situ mineralization to allow for use of the analyses in future mineral resource estimation checks with core sample assay performed on ¼ core versus the ½ core used for the original assays show greater variability as compared to checks using the original pulps this is not unexpected given the differences in ½ and ¼ core sample volumes the qualified person believes the qaqc procedures and insertion rates are appropriate and reflect general industry practices birak and earnest 2016 the qualified person s independent qaqc sampling did not detect any significant analytical errors and believes original data is reliable for mineral resource estimation the qualified person believes security procedures employed are generally of industry standard carangas project technical report 2022 63 section 12 data verification 12 1 summary data verification procedures employed by the qualified person consisted of collecting a random set of pulp and ¼ core samples from 6 core holes spanning a wide range of ag and au analyses furthermore all data entry in to and editing of the company s digital database mxdeposit is controlled by database personnel with oversight by the mr alex zhang the company s senior vice president of exploration while the analytical data are directly downloaded from als using their webtrieve process obviating the need for hand entering of data into the company s digital database the qualified person compared assay for samples used in the independent qaqc process to the original assay certificates section 11 the qualified person inspected several drill collar locationon surface but did not personnaly survey rill collar locations nor conduct its own down hole surveys nonetheless the qualified person has no reason to doubt the reliability of such data 12 2 qualified person s comments the qualified person believes the data reported herein are generally adequate for the purpose of this report and for use in future mineral resource estimation prior to conducting a mineral resource estimate the qualified person reommends that the company resurvey the collar locations of several of the drill holes to be used in the estimation carangas project technical report 2022 64 section 13 mineral processing and metallurgical testing this section is not applicable to the property at this

2022 68 section 24 other relevant data and information the qualified person is not aware of any additional information necessary to make this report more understandable and not misleading at this early stage in the property development the qualified person believes the need to acquire more land to allow for exploration to extend the current deposit limits is justified given the generally favorable exploration results carangas project technical report 2022 69 section 25 interpretation and conclusions while mineralization at carangas has been known since colonial times and explored and mined by historic operators section 6 very little modern and comprehensive exploration work had been conducted on the property prior to involvement by the joint venture since commencement of work by the joint venture in 2021 carangas has advanced to the point that up to five core drills have been active in 2022 as of the effective date work far has been based on a model of high level low to intermediate sulfidation epithermal mineralization zoned from a surface near surface ag dominant mineral system with base and precious metals hosted in veins veinlets breccias and porous volcanic wall rocks changing to more au dominant and ultimately to a deeper au and cu mineralization hosted in the cupola of an inferred felsic porphyry and within intrusive rocks figure 8 1 in a little more than one year carangas has progressed from very limited historic work and investment to over 23 800 m of core drilling and an investment of section 26 nearly us 2 5 million with a 2022 budget of more than us 8 2 million and 40 000 m of core drilling of which a little more than 50 had been completed as of the effective date 25 1 qualified person s conclusions carangas is an evolving precious metal exploration project located in a region of bolivia known for mineral occurrences which have been worked during colonial and more recent times nonetheless the area appears to have been overlooked by modern explorers for a variety of reasons including uncertainty in government policies the qualified person is not aware of significant risks other than those discussed in this report and believes the company s experience in bolivia on its other properties notably silver sand coupled with relatively recent changes in government policies and regulations justifies continuation of work by the joint venture to evaluate the working model of vertically zoned precious and base metal mineralization hosted in extrusive and intrusive rocks the qualified person believes that additional exploration work and efforts to expand the mineral rights is justified and should be followed by work leading to the estimation of mineral resources the qualified person believes there are reasonable expectation for the definition of mineral resources in surface minable configurations to capture the near surface ag and au mineralization the deeper au and base metal mineralization may require additional land rights among other technical factors to support potential pit and or underground mine configurations carangas project technical report 2022 70 section 26 recommendations the joint venture has been operating on the property since early 2021 actual costs for 2021 and the budget for 2022 are shown in the following table 26 1 table 26 1 exploration costs for carangas 2022 and 2021 exploration work

expenditures on the property were significant in 2021 and increased by over 300 for the 2022 budget actual drilling and assaying costs in 2021 were about 70 of the total expenditures while budgeted drilling and assaying costs for 2022 are over 80 of the total budget planned unit costs for the 2022 program were estimated to be us 118 per meter drilled and us 0 24 per sample assayed as of the effective date nearly half of the planned 2022 drilling approx 19 800 m had been completed 49 accomplished with up to four diamond core drills just after the site visit a fifth core drill was added to the drill fleet carangas project technical report 2022 71 based on the currently available results the qualified person recommends the remaining 2022 program not already completed as of june 16 2022 should be completed this amounts to about 17 000 m of new core 40 of the budget actual costs for the remaining drilling and work is estimated at us 3 3 million the program recommended in table 26 2 is not phased the qualified person believes the unit costs in tables 26 1 and 26 2 are reasonable as they compare well to 2021 actual costs but notes that unit costs per meter of drilling may increase through the remainder of 2022 as more deeper core hole are drilled given the results presented herein the qualified person does not see the need to conduct the remainder of 2022 or the recommended

animal study shows effective protection of mitochondria from oxidative damage and reduced plaque vulnerability in advanced atherosclerosis following treatment with sod2 mrna nanoparticles based on altamira s semaphore technology data presented at american heart association annual scientific sessions chicago 2022 earlier this month hamilton bermuda accesswire november 22 2022 altamira therapeutics altamira or the company nasdaq cyto a company dedicated to developing therapeutics that address important unmet medical needs today announced the presentation of animal data generated by an atherosclerosis research group at the university of michigan school of medicine ann arbor mi showing effective delivery of mrna and protective effects in arteries with its semaphore delivery technology the data was presented at the prestigious american heart association annual scientific sessions chicago 2022 earlier this month the research group tested the delivery of superoxide dismutase 2 sod2 mrna with altamira s peptide based semaphore nanoparticles to boost sod2 expression in advanced atherosclerotic plaque cells in a mouse model sod2 is one of the major antioxidant defense systems against free radicals but is known to be reduced in inflammatory conditions such as atherosclerosis the group hypothesized that increasing sod2 expression would protect mitochondria from oxidative damage and preserve plaque stability atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arteries involving the formation of plaque on the walls and is the underlying cause of about 50 of all deaths in westernized society erosion or rupture of advanced atherosclerotic plaque is the leading cause of atherosclerosis complications such as heart attack and stroke treatment of mice by systemic administration of sod2 mrna nanoparticles resulted in markedly increased levels of sod2 mrna and mitochondrial sod2 in plaque macrophages p 0 01 and higher local sod activity which resulted in lower levels of mitochondrial and cellular reactive oxygen species ros and improved mitochondrial function after only four weeks of intermittent 2x wk i v mrna therapy mice treated with sod2 mrna exhibited 25 fewer inflammatory macrophages p 0 01 and 98 more smooth muscle cells p 0 001 in plaques and plaque caps which was associated with decreased plaque vulnerability p 0 05 compared to control the research group concluded using nanoparticle based mrna therapeutics to modulate plaque morphology has great potential in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis complications samuel wickline m d chief scientific officer of altamira a co author of the study suggested that the opportunity to systemically deliver potent mrna therapeutics to inflammatory pathologies such as atherosclerosis sets the stage for controlled regulation of harmful reactive oxidant species in this and other disease conditions about semaphore semaphore is a versatile platform for safe and effective delivery of mrna messenger ribonucleic acid into target cells it is based on a patented 21 amino acid peptide that can engage any type of rna in rapid self assembly into a polyplex the polyplex has a size charge and other physical features that allow it to escape hepatic clearance and thus to reach other target tissues than the liver semaphore protects the rna payload from degradation in the circulation and allows for rapid cellular uptake while enabling ph dependent nucleotide endosomal escape and cytoplasmic delivery effective delivery of mrna and positive treatment

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of

criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

sales growth expected from ultra shear technology ust tolling services we are already seeing the significant recovery expected in revenues during q4 2022 mr hollister continued with our organization

of pbi added we made the decision in early 2022 to reallocate staff and resources off of our pct and barofold platforms and to focus them almost exclusively on ust commercialization we anticipated that pct barofold revenues could be adversely affected through this transition which we unfortunately observed in the third quarter of 2022 however the fourth quarter is shaping up to be very robust

house is historic abram s point off the polpis road named after one of the last surviving native american wampanoag race abram quary like biden rubenstein grew up in a middle class blue collar family and originally started his career in government service but he left that path to form a private equity company that would make him a billionaire many times over along the way rubenstein made friends with the rich and the powerful and on both sides of the political aisle george h w bush was an adviser to his company while jimmy carter is a close friend who s also stayed at rubenstein s nantucket home and billionaire businessman has even admitted his regrets and financial loses that include turning down opportunities from mark zuckerberg to invest in facebook and from jeff bezos to invest in amazon rubenstein s company the private equity firm the carlyle group worth 293 billion has come under fire at times for its business practices but rubenstein who has a net worth of 4 5 billion

his family are expected to attend the town s christmas tree lighting on friday night as they did last year above jill biden shopping on nantucket last year biden ran for president as a symbol and representative of the middle class and has come under fire for staying at the home of rubenstein whose company the carlyle group has been subject of controversy and conspiracy theories private equity firms are companies that take struggling companies that are not traded on the stock exchange and raise cash which they then re invest in those companies with the goal of making them profitable these firms would then try to get a handsome return on their investment by either offering the company to the public which can buy shares selling the company or recapitalization rubenstein cofounded the carlyle group in 1987 with william conway jr and daniel d aniello and managed the company s advisers which included george h w bush he now serves as non executive co chairman of the company all three co founders became billionaires after building the company from the ground up they raised money from investors and used it to purchase companies early on they focused on defense companies and then sold them for profit rubenstein also indicated the rich need to pay more in taxes saying taxes in the united states are not completely fair for anyone but he s also said that taxing billionaires like himself wouldn t generate enough income to help the federal government wipe out its debt i don t think all of a sudden a wealth tax for example would solve all of our society s problems if one could ever actually be implemented rubenstein told cnbc during the 2020 presidential campaign about elizabeth warren s wealth tax proposal if you tax the upper income there aren t enough of those people to really make a wealth distribution effect that s going to be significant there just aren t enough highly wealthy people he added rubenstein now gives speeches and hosts a show for bloomberg tv he also serves as chairman of the washington economic club he chairs the kennedy center honors when it airs on cbs among his regrets rubenstein said he was once offered the opportunity to meet mark zuckerberg and invest in facebook before zuckerberg dropped out of harvard but decided against it he also said he turned down a 20 stake in amazon during the early years of the company he s also said he regrets not investing in twitter and turning down an opportunity to buy the washington post before bezos purchased the newspaper before cofounding the carlyle group rubenstein practiced law in new york between 1973 and 1975 he served as chief counsel to the u s senate judiciary committee s subcommittee on constitutional amendments rubenstein then went on to serve as an official for president jimmy carter s administration as a deputy domestic policy adviser to the president he told the new york times how he got involved in private equity i read that bill simon had done a leveraged buyout in the early 1980s where he bought gibson greeting cards and made 80 million on a 1 million investment i didn t know what a leveraged buyout was but it sounded more attractive than practicing law rubenstein s business practices have come under fire john oliver in a segment on his hbo show accused him of buying up mobile home parks and sharply increasing the rent on tenants who often can t afford the increase or the high cost to move the home he was also subject to conspiracy theories after the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the day of the attack he was attending a conference sponsored by the carlyle group in washington dc where osama bin laden s brother was also in attendance which led to unfounded gossip the compnay was somehow complicitous to calm matters rubenstein returned the bin ladens 2 million investment in the carlyle group in addition to promoting his causes rubenstein also often talks about his personal story he grew up the son of a postal worker and homemaker in baltimore earning high enough marks to attend duke university as an undergrad then the university of chicago for law school he has three children alexandra gabrielle and andrew and has said he s given them ivy league educations but did not give them trust funds he gives millions to charity including 7 5million for the repair of the washington monument after the 2011 earthquake and 4 5 million to the national zoo for its giant panda program and in 2016 he donated 25 million for a pancreatic cancer center at memorial sloan kettering cancer center and has given 100 million to his alma mater duke university he has made large gifts in recent years to washington s cultural institutions including the smithsonian institution the national archives the library of congress and the kennedy center where he is chairman david rubenstein is a billionaire businessman turned philanthropist david rubenstein pictured november 21 with nancy pelosi in d c david rubenstein and his now ex wife alice at the 2015 state dinner for chinese president president xi jinping like bill gates he is among the list of billionaires that have pledged to give at least half their money to philanthropic causes in their lifetime as part of the giving pledge a history buff he practices what he calls patriotic philanthropy to preserve historical artificats in 2014 rubenstein donated 12 3 million to restore arlington house the home of confederate general robert e lee on the grounds of arlington national cemetery in virginia the columned home originally built as a monument to george washington between 1802 and 1818 was restored to its historical appearance in 1860 before the start of the u s civil war rubenstein said the site crowns the most sacred land in america but needed major repairs the money he donated to national park foundation will also go toward fixing the grounds and slave quarters and overhauling the site s museum exhibits the goal is to remind people of american history rubenstein said at the time i think when you re restoring history you should remind people of the good and the bad in 2016 rubenstein donated 18million to fix up the lincoln memorial the money was used to fix the memorial s roof clean the marble and improve accessibility by adding a second elevator rubenstein said his admiration for lincoln drew him to this project lincoln deserves to have his memorial in tip top shape he said in a phone interview at the time in 2007 rubenstein bought a copy of the magna carta for 21 3million which he has loaned to the national archives the magna carta bears the seal of king edward i and is dated 1297 it is one of 17 known handwritten copies of the text that established a tradition for the rule of law that even the king would honour advertisement rubenstein told the times of his philanthropy in the end you have to say what is the purpose of life and what are you doing here everybody has to ask themselves that question what are you doing that makes your existence on the face of the earth justified what am i doing well maybe fixing up companies isn t such a great thing it does add to the economy you could argue but giving away the money reminding people of history is one thing that i m now a little bit focused on

25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net

biden announced he s extending the federal student loan repayment moratorium until june 30 2023 what happened shares of the one stop shop financial services company sofi technologies sofi 1 12 fell by roughly 4 7 tuesday after president joe biden said he would extend the student loan repayment moratorium again so what at the onset of the covid 19 pandemic in march 2020 the federal government paused payments on federal student loans to help ease the hardship the crisis was putting on americans now close to three years later that moratorium is still in place it was supposed to expire at the end of this year in tandem with the rollout of biden s plan to forgive up to 20 000 of federal student loan debt apiece to tens of millions of borrowers however that plan has not been able to move forward because republican governors in six states sued to block the debt relief program and several federal courts have ruled that it can t take effect until those cases play out the biden administration asked the supreme court to rule on those cases and said it was extending the pause on federal student loan payments until 60 days after the debt forgiveness program goes live 60 days after the court challenges against it are resolved or 60 days after june 30 whichever comes first however cnn citing anonymous sources reported that the moratorium could potentially end sooner if the supreme court makes a ruling sooner the extension is a tough blow for sofi which is in the business of student loan refinancing student loan refinancing has been way down since the moratorium went into effect because few borrowers have either the need or the desire to refinance debt they aren t making payments on in addition many borrowers have been waiting for clarity from biden about whether they d be eligible for some debt forgiveness before refinancing sofi originated more than 2 billion of student loans in the first quarter of 2020 in the third quarter of this year it only originated about 457 million of student loans and there have only been two quarters since q1 2020 when student loan originations have surpassed 1 billion now what the extension of the moratorium is exactly what sofi shareholders didn t want because it removes the clarity that would have helped borrowers decide whether or not they should refinance sofi could see its full year outlook impacted but biden s move will likely result in lower revenue and adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for the lender than analysts had been projecting for 2023 and given that federal borrowers won t have to make any payments until 60 days after the moratorium ends the resumption of payments could in actuality be delayed through august depending on when the supreme court rules coupled with the news monday that members of the senate banking committee were urging regulators to investigate sofi s crypto activities i definitely think this stock could be in for a tough time in the near term i d rate it as a hold for now

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of

relationship with smartasset in which smartasset is compensated for lead referrals such relationships have no impact on our rankings and firms are included and ranked based strictly on the above criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please
