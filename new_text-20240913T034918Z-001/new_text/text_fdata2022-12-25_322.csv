stock image photo by susan vineyard istock getty images plus st george news feature members of the southern utah community sometimes share their stories with st george news that includes holiday stories here are a few a christmas carol at this time of year there are a lot of christmas movies on tv i have always liked a christmas carol written by charles dickens in 1843 dickens tells the story of ebenezer scrooge scrooge we all remember him as a greedy cold hearted person who hates christmas in fact i may have met him a few times in my life but that s another story to tell so i decided i would revisit the part of the book when jacob marley came and visited scrooge in one part marley states i wear the chain i forged in life i made it link by link and yard by yard scrooge says to marley but you were always a good man of business business cried the ghost mankind was my business the common welfare was my business charity mercy forbearance and benevolence were all my business the dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business he realized that he was just like scrooge who wore the chains of bondage because of misplaced values and that his business should have been one of charity mercy forbearance and benevolence through his symbolism dickens tried to make the point that mankind should be our business there are many things to take from that and i thought that life is like a book in fact there are many books about someone s life so my question is what s in our book perhaps there are public records of our lawful existence our official transactions require identification passport and social security numbers ultimately whether we officially exist or not as citizens of a country depends on whether our names are written in its books there are however other more important things to include in our personal book shouldn t there be something that indicates mankind was our business shouldn t there be things about charity mercy forbearance and benevolence so what does the dictionary say about these words charity generosity and helpfulness especially toward the needy or suffering pure love of god mercy lenient or compassionate treatment forbearance a refraining from the enforcement of something as a debt right or obligation that is due benevolence a disposition to do good an act of kindness a generous gift these are all things we can include in our book we are the authors of our own books each chapter is a stage in our life we have an excellent opportunity to make mankind our business each day we can add to the list of those things which are important like charity mercy forbearance and benevolence santa s reindeer there i was just minding my own business in the mall recently when i felt a tug on my pants i looked down and there was this short little elf dressed in green with candy cane striped socks and jester slippers he indicated that the guy in the red suit wanted to talk to me as i approached this large man dressed in red i was expecting a smile on his face because i knew i had been nice this year but the look on his face told me otherwise i was a little embarrassed to be sitting on his lap ok i was really embarrassed to be sitting on his lap all the little kids were pointing at me and laughing what was i to do he was the one who told me to sit down on his lap he began recanting all the times that i had not left cookies and milk for him when he came to deliver presents if he knew what was best for him he could really avoid cookies and milk i tried to explain that i was not responsible for that and he needed to take that up with my wife but he would not hear of it he then began to go on a rant about me not doing the dishes i thought that s why they make dishwashers he then continued about not making the bed in the morning again i m thinking we re just going to mess it up again tonight he kept going on and on about washing the clothes and cleaning the house i soon suspected that he must have been talking to my wife i looked all over trying to figure out where she was hiding i just knew she was getting a big kick out of this he explained in no uncertain terms what he expected of me in the coming year i tried to explain to him that i had no time for such silly things because i had a tee time set up every day for the coming year he explained that no gifts were coming my way unless i changed he started to reach into his bag and i could see the lump of coal coming out immediately the past year flashed before my eyes i could see that the time had come to fess up and take responsibility with tears in my eyes i promised to do better and asked that he put that coal back into his bag as soon as i left i rushed over to kay jewelers and picked out a diamond necklace for my wife i also dropped by bed bath and beyond and picked up a cute little apron i could wear while doing the housework next year written by jim terry st george

in this article we will be taking a look at the 15 most hated companies in america to skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to see the 5 most hated companies in america in an ideal world companies would be supported by the general population after all the economy of a country defines its standard of living and the economy of a country is propped up by the major industries in the nation and these industries are defined by the companies within each industry after all companies provide innovation ideas and solutions that people need if they didn t they would soon be out of business they also provide employment to the working force of a country so why is it that most people hate corporations many corporations in the world and especially the bigger ones are disliked strongly by the general population because people believe that these companies exist for one purpose and one purpose alone to maximize profits no matter what the cost even though these companies earn billions of dollars in profits each year people believe that they do not contribute in any positive way and continue to cut costs in order to increase profit even more this ends up benefiting only a select few such as the executives of the company and shareholders meanwhile employees are sometimes overworked and underpaid not to mention made to work in harsh conditions many people also hate corporations because they believe that such companies take from the country but do not provide much in return and so they are actually a detriment 15 most hated companies in america stock asso shutterstock com advertisement advertisement you might think that this hatred would translate to a negative impact on the company s financials and hence its success but the discussion isn t as straightforward as you might believe some of the most successful companies in the world are also among the most hated primarily because of their success and yet they do genuinely make the life of customers easier for example amazon com inc nasdaq amzn has been derided time and again for its treatment of workers and considering the fact that there are 1 5 million workers in the company this is an important fact to consider however amazon com inc nasdaq amzn has made the life of consumers really easy providing instant delivery or next day delivery in many cases while also providing the cheapest price possible for many products excellent customer service and a great return policy when the lives of people are made easier they often compromise on their beliefs another reason behind companies not suffering despite widespread hatred is because there aren t many alternatives take the u s for example while there are anti trust laws established to ensure competition and there are many examples of mergers not being allowed to avoid monopolies with the attempted merger of activision blizzard inc nasdaq atvi with microsoft corporation nasdaq msft being a recent example there are effective monopolies in some industries which has led to them being the only possible solution no matter how poor their customer service is or no matter how many outrageous fees they tack on some of these companies are part of the most hated countries in america and we will discuss them in greater detail later on it is interesting to note that just because a company is among our list of the most hated companies in america it doesn t mean that it s universally hated after all maybe 10 of the population hates a specific company but maybe 30 of the population loves it since we re only focusing on the former criteria it would feature in our list even though more people love it than hate it and so being in this list doesn t mean that the company is doomed take meta platforms inc meta for example it is hated by a ton of people due to privacy concerns data leaks and its influence on everyone but it still has 2 billion active monthly users and so is nowhere near finished meanwhile financial corporations such as the goldman sachs group inc nyse gs is hated by most of the public but the company mainly deals with other companies and wealthy clients so public perception doesn t really hurt its bottom line for companies which operate on a b2b model business to business public perception doesn t matter as much as for b2c companies business to consumer of course this doesn t mean that there are no repercussions to a company if they fail the general public nowadays profits and revenue alone aren t sufficient to determine the success of the company environmental social and governance esg is just as important and is the biggest challenge for companies to overcome if they want to continue the level of success that they ve enjoyed or even increase it according to pwc itself one of the largest firms in the world mentioned that social capital is incredibly relevant to the success of a business now social capital refers to the impact of the decisions taken by a business on people according to pwc it describes the stocks of knowledge skills experience health and wellbeing within people as well as the stocks of relationships institutions shared values and norms that exist between people just like other forms of capital social capital can be increased or decreased by the flows of social capital the social impacts which result from business activity if a business operates properly with the general well being of society being a primary focus it will achieve success quickly of course this always has to be balanced with revenue and profitability but the point is that both need to go hand in hand for a business to be truly successful advertisement advertisement speaking of audit firms the audit industry has seen its fair share of criticism too especially in recent year there have been a series of high profile failures in audit which has put the industry under scrutiny with record fines administered to some audit firms which has resulted in the financial reporting council in the united kingdom to announce plans to overhaul corporate governance audit firms also see heavy workload with tight deadlines and often do not have adequate staff resulting in high pressure for employees which in turn results in a high level of turnover all of which are detrimental to the health of an employee as well as impacting their performance this is a trend in audit firms throughout the world and audit firms while taking steps in some countries should ensure more global policies to create a proper work life for employees you can also consider the pharmaceutical industry as an entire industry which is disliked by the general public conspiracy theorists have come up with the term big pharma which refers to major pharmaceutical organizations with conspiracy theories alleging that the executives of these companies collude to keep medical breakthroughs from reaching the public while also citing price hikes as a way for companies to make even higher profits at the expense of the health of the general public this reputation has seen a massive improvement in recent years as these companies worked hard to come up with a vaccine for the worst pandemic in a century helping to avert millions of deaths and tens of millions of serious illnesses across the world for our rankings of the most hated companies we polled the rankings published by various other websites including 24 7 wall street thestreet com bloomberg business insider and fast company giving precedence to companies which made multiple lists basically our article reflects the approximate consensus opinion of the financial media some of these rankings are as old as 10 years as we intentionally picked rankings that span a long period of time this way we are more likely to identify the companies that are consistently out of favor with the general public and the media so now let s take a look at the most hated companies in the america companies which need to work hard to regain public trust starting with number 15 15 american international group inc nyse aig american international group inc nyse aig earned the ire of the general public when normal people lost their life savings and employment in the 2008 recession while it was bailed out by the federal government to the tune of 180 billion and announced payments of 165 million in executive bonuses alone in a display of rare unity both democrats and republicans voiced their anger at this announcement by american international group inc nyse aig with even president obama commenting on whether such a bonus was deserved at all 14 johnson johnson nyse jnj number of times mentioned 2 advertisement advertisement johnson johnson nyse jnj is the biggest pharmaceutical company in the world by revenue but has faced significant controversy regarding its operations while johnson johnson nyse jnj received praised in 1982 for a nationwide recall of tylenol after some packages of the drug had been laced with cyanide it has garnered significant criticism based on lawsuits that its baby powder causes ovarian cancer with damages in billions of dollars being decided against the company 13 fox corporation nasdaq fox number of times mentioned 2 fox corporation nasdaq fox owns fox news which is the main basis for the hatred it receives fox corporation nasdaq fox is criticized for only providing views sympathetic to the republican party and the bias present in its coverage we believe this is a brilliant business strategy as most of the media companies stand to the left of the political spectrum number of times mentioned 2 advertisement advertisement netflix inc nasdaq nflx has been a people favorite for a long time growing massively over a short period of time however hatred for netflix inc nasdaq nflx has started to increase mainly because of price increases and the company pledging to crack down on multiple people using the same account we don t think netflix s presence in our list of the most hated companies in the us points to a negative outcome for the company or its shareholders 11 uber technologies inc nyse uber number of times mentioned 2 the ride hailing company has over 122 million monthly users but it has received criticism for its treatment of its drivers as gig workers uber technologies inc nyse uber is also disliked because of its disruption of the taxicab industry and contribution in traffic congestion we don t think uber deserves to be one of the most hated companies as its services addressed a massive problem for consumers who have trouble hailing a cab and getting almost anything to be delivered to their doors uber will probably find itself a place in an extended version of our most innovative companies article 10 comcast corporation nasdaq cmcsa number of times mentioned 2 advertisement advertisement comcast corporation nasdaq cmcsa is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world comcast corporation nasdaq cmcsa is widely criticized for its monopoly in many areas where alternates aren t present and the difficulty customers face if they want to cancel the service comcast corporation nasdaq cmcsa is also derided for extremely poor customer service the consumerist dubbed comcast corporation nasdaq cmcsa the worst company in america in 2010 and 2014 9 exxon mobil corporation nyse xom number of times mentioned 2 our list could ve consisted entirely of oil companies considering how maligned they are in the eyes of the public but we settled for just two exxon mobil corporation nyse xom has been accused of being aware of the contribution of fossil fuels to climate change but provided false information to investors to prop up its share price exxon mobil corporation nyse xom was also accused of hiring military units of the indonesian national army to provide protection to the company s assets in the country with these units being accused of human rights violations exxon mobil is also still remembered because of the exxon valdez oil spill disaster advertisement advertisement overall though we don t think xom s presence in the most hated companies lists affects its business materially as consumers don t really prefer one oil company over another 8 citigroup inc nyse c number of times mentioned 2 one of the largest banking institutions in america citigroup inc nyse c was accused of misrepresenting its exposure to enron after the collapse of the latter further citigroup inc nyse c paid 75 million in 2010 after charges were brought against the company stating that investors were misled with respect to potential losses arising from risky mortgages yes we know it is a tiny fine regulators fixed their mistake in 2014 as the bank agreed to pay 7 billion to resolve a department of justice investigation into its sale of toxic mortgage backed securities leading up to the financial crisis advertisement advertisement in 2018 citigroup also agreed to pay 1 billion to settle charges brought by the department of justice and the federal reserve that it had violated the bank secrecy act and the international emergency economic powers act by failing to properly monitor transactions that potentially violated u s sanctions 7 bp p l c nyse bp number of times mentioned 2 bp p l c nyse bp is one of the biggest oil companies in the world and in 2010 was responsible for the worst oil spill in global history in what is now known as the deepwater horizon spill while the spill ended up costing bp p l c nyse bp around 65 billion this has led to the general public hating the company the oil spill disaster affected bp s business for a few years but we don t think it is material anymore 6 walmart inc nyse wmt number of times mentioned 2 advertisement advertisement walmart inc nyse wmt is the largest private employer in the world with over 2 million employees most of whom are being accused of being treated unfairly by the largest company in the world by revenue walmart inc nyse wmt is also disliked because in many places it has swooped in and destroyed local businesses leaving customers no other options that s a consequence of the success of its business model consumers love walmart and prefer to shop there just like they love amazon com amzn even though amazon drove several competitors out of business click to continue reading and see the 5 most hated companies in

retired teacher janie morissette was living alone in montana when her st paul based daughter suggested she move closer morissette loved the idea of regular family dinners and impromptu visits from her granddaughters but moving in with her daughter felt too close for comfort so she built in the backyard instead morissette now lives in a 796 square foot home formally called an accessory dwelling unit or adu atop her daughter s garage in the lexington hamline neighborhood i giggle when i talk about it because i just absolutely love it here morissette said i live in a treehouse hers is one of 30 adus that have cropped up in the capital city in the five years since local leaders started allowing them though backyard cottages carriage houses or mother in law suites have been around for centuries the structures were edged out by restrictive single family zoning decades ago the mini homes are now back in fashion in the twin cities and across the country as communities look for ways to expand housing options and add density to spacious and popular single family neighborhoods while residents of the small homes gush about the charm and lifestyle the associated regulations and cost which can exceed 300 000 per unit have meant the concept has been slow to catch on minneapolis greenlit the structures in 2014 and 176 building permits have been issued for them suburbs including stillwater eagan roseville and bloomington have also altered city code to allow adus in single family neighborhoods and have seen a smattering built minnetonka which has permitted adus in some form since the 1980s has 61 units we are talking about building a brand new home with all the amenities and components that go into a single family home it s just on a smaller scale said minneapolis architect christopher strom who specializes in adus the reality is new construction is expensive whether it is a full sized home or an adu it isn t going to be a quick return on investment price regulations are prohibitive when homeowners do go for it it s a lifestyle choice strom said space for aging family or snowbird parents a home office or a guest house that can generate income as a short term rental are some of the most common reasons that prompt folks to invest john shannon owner of hyr building llc said he gets lots of inquiries about adus but has had plans for them fall through three times in as many years in minneapolis like many cities minneapolis has restrictions on the books that can make adus a hard sell shannon said including limitations on height and distance from the main residence most minneapolis adus must be built above garages because of the small size of city lots but regular garages can t typically support a structure above them shannon said to make it work a new garage with a supportive foundation often must be built which can get expensive for a relatively small living space he said a lot of it comes down to price per square foot for construction he said twin cities leaders say it s understood that adus will not solve the region s housing shortage but rather are one piece of a larger solution both minneapolis and st paul planners say they have repeatedly eased regulations on adus to make the process easier though interest in minneapolis has waned since the city legalized duplexes and triplexes in the lowest density residential areas in 2020 a centerpiece of our comprehensive plan is to expand the range of housing options in all neighborhoods said jason wittenberg minneapolis manager of code development it s nice to have a variety of tools in the toolbox including adus versatile structures according to city planners adus fall into three categories a detached guest house often built over a garage an attached structure built as an addition to the main home or an internal unit which includes basement or attic spaces transformed into separate living quarters because zoning rules and definitions vary by city it can be difficult to pinpoint the number of adus in the twin cities region metropolitan council data based on a voluntary survey of cities show there were 146 building permits issued for adus between 2016 and 2021 after losing their detached garage to a fire minneapolis couple michael graven and kirsten jaglo worked with architect strom to build a new garage with a second story adu the 650 square foot home includes an elevator solar panels and added insulation to reduce energy consumption they use the space as a guest house yoga and meditation area and backyard escape for dinner and movies looking ahead it s a potential future home for an aging parent or young adult child moving toward independence though the adu isn t necessarily a great financial investment graven said it s a good investment for our family and our lifestyle some of our friends joke we built our cabin in the backyard he said slow start in the suburbs adus have been slow to catch on in the suburbs despite some communities relative abundance of land and financial resources compared to the central cities some suburbs with a lot of new housing stock have seen adus built as new construction at the same time as the main home those units can cost closer to 100 000 according to lakeville planning director daryl morey who said the city has seen about 13 such units built in the last decade or so blaine city officials began allowing adus in single family zoning districts in 2021 but despite several inquiries the city hasn t issued any permits said elizabeth showalter the city s community development specialist cost is likely the reason she said and city requirements such as having a separate hvac unit and a fire wall between the two housing units drive prices up plenty of bloomington residents have called the city to figure out how they could build an adu said planning manager glen markegard then they find out how expensive new construction is and they change their plans he said the city has allowed adus since 2009 but has seen only one built markegard said most people are interested in more space for extended family so they ll opt instead for a home renovation that includes a second kitchen or extra bathroom but perhaps less privacy than an adu dakota county recently issued a guide to adus that includes specific building requirements for the cities that allow them apple valley lakeville eagan burnsville and inver grove heights the goal of the guide was to inform residents that adus are a housing option specify where they re allowed and give a snapshot of some of the rules which are nuanced for each city said jess luce program manager for the county s communities for a lifetime initiative over the last eight years about 30 adus have been built in the four cities for which data are available luce said makes sense with all these hurdles people have to jump through he said luce said the idea that adus are an affordable housing option makes him nervous the units may be comparable in cost only if a family is looking at the long term price tag of a nursing home or assisted living facility for a relative he said luce said he hopes that over time cities will adopt less restrictive adu policies as more residents want to build them i just think is going to change he said
soft finance with ayo arowolo reflections from wealth masters what does wealth mean to you is it just having a fat bank account or are there some other hidden components as we wrap up the year we just thought we should share the thoughts of some members of our league of wealth masters on what they think wealth really means and some thoughts about money too including making money managing it multiplying it and making it count please enjoy and do have a fun filled christmas professor theophilus ogunlesi professor theophilus ogunlesi 99 the first nigerian professor of medicine at the university of ibadan ui is the father of bayo ogunlesi one of the wealthy businessmen based in the united states of america he says a lot of people have a wrong interpretation of what wealth really means so they believe that being wealthy means having a lot of money in one s bank account that could be an aspect of wealth but to me real wealth means being fulfilled in the assignment god has committed into your hands and being able to put smiles on the faces of other people who are in need i am not a businessman in the nigerian sense of the word but my lifelong business has been and still is to take care of the sick promote health and prevent sickness through health education and help the poor and the needy as best as i can that to me is success that is real wealth samuel adedoyin dr samuel adedoyin is a topmost industrialist in nigeria with business interests that cut across banking real estate import and export and hospitality among others god owns the secrets to wealth this is one secret i discovered early in life and i want to say that it is responsible for the little success i have achieved at the beginning of the whole venture i did not look like someone who would succeed in fact many people including relatives and close friends wrote me off initially but i discovered this truth the secrets of making money belong to god for anyone who wishes to be successful the first step is to know god obey him serve him and praise him in everything that is what can take you into wealth health and long life when you know god and you ask him for the things you want he will give them to you mind you i did not say when you know god you will not have challenges in life you will but you will always overcome such challenges and difficulties everybody has what god has prepared for him the problem we have is that some of us are in the wrong places ask god to show you that thing which when you touch it will turn into gold femi pedro femi pedro is a banker business owner investor and politician of some sort with business interests that cut across banking real estate and hospitality money is not wealth money is not wealth but an illusion that diminishes in value while wealth is lasting and lives for many generations money disappears from those that lack the knowledge of wealth creation wealth flows from the income you generate from your wealth instruments a lot of people who have mistaken money for wealth will have themselves to blame because they will find themselves in the poverty trap sooner or later moreover people need to understand that good education intelligence and talent are not passports to wealth if one lacks the knowledge of wealth creation young people should learn this early be willing to take risks your hard earned money is not the money you take home as a salary but what you make out of your investments whoever is afraid of taking risks will never accomplish anything substantial in his lifetime you need an investment adviser between 1988 and 2002 i had two investment advisers that i relied on if you want to hedge your risks your investment adviser will tell you some stocks are called blue chips because they have been around for a long time and survived hard times and are still thriving that is why they are blue chips and their stocks are high you are not likely to lose your investments with them a lot of people that lose money in the capital market do so because they do not use experts they tried to do it alone basically investing is a vocation and habit because you must be consistent you must have passion for it to understand it and you must use experts to play in that market pat utomi professor pat utomi is a scholar political activist and boardroom guru sitting on the boards of a few companies in nigeria imagination will take you farther than money will money is the most fungible of assets that can be converted into another kind of asset it is something that can help you accelerate the pace of accomplishing something but on its own can accomplish very little in terms of real value imagination will take you farther than money will take you money is a facilitator and not an end itself there are many people who have a lot of money and live in misery invest in people investment in people is much more important than investment in stocks as any of these people creates wealth there is an increase in the pool for the whole society yes many will be ungrateful and will never come back to you but like in venture capital if it is only one that is grateful and comes back it pays for all others don t eat your profit before it is earned some people project their profit and begin to spend it in advance this is the reason you have many people who were rich yesterday but today are poor also integrity is the most important asset in business the day you lose it you ve lost everything dotun sulaiman adedotun sulaiman is a renowned management consultant and a boardroom guru with interests in close to over 20 companies i am not driven by money i never spend all my money never i also live within my means and don t indulge in consumption patterns or a lifestyle i cannot sustain consequently i don t know what it is like to be broke while i will continue to invest i do have a few indulgences like my investment in a fairly substantial art collection of mostly nigerian and african art but basically money doesn t mean that much to me money for me is a measure of the reward that you get if you do something right what it does for me apart from meeting basic needs is the confidence it provides that you can meet your needs and afford a few luxuries within reasonable limits and of course the absence of anxiety about not being able to meet them the more money you have the more you should realise that you don t really need that much to live a decent life beyond that money should be used to do good to touch the lives of the less privileged or less endowed i believe i will do well with a lot of money but will also do as well be happy and content with very little money i don t think money can ever change my essence don t invest in what you don t know one of my golden investment rules is that i do not invest in anything i don t know much about if it is too esoteric specialised and not in my area of expertise i just will not go there i invest in things that i know at least a little about my motivation for investment has never really been about money i am motivated more by a desire to use my knowledge experience contacts and relationships to help a younger person get ahead it is therefore not an accident that most of my investments are with young entrepreneurs and start ups i will give them a bit of money but more valuable than the money i give them are my time access to me and my network hand holding them and mentoring them bunmi oni bunmi oni a former managing director of cadbury plc currently lectures at the university of lagos postgraduate school you need to learn about money management my principle on money is mainly that money is a means not an end it is good to have it provided it does not have you and maintaining that balance requires discipline this is where my christian faith provides the lead you need to get your spouse involved all the way in this regard i believe i have better skills in money management than my wife even if i say so prepare for life after work i had a retirement plan but couldn t describe it as sound i left more of the savings than i should have in a current account instead of having it work for me i learned the virtues of saving long ago and tried to be guided by the principle to live on no more than 80 per cent of my income and the rest spread over other commitments retirement savings tithe contingency or the unexpected of course this wasn t always possible especially when all children were in tertiary institutions and mortgage payments had to be made managing investments was something i did not do well until i left office i later built a structure that works for us smarten up the investment and get a good spread across asset classes set a deposit that generates interest to finance day to day expenses others include planning for children s weddings i cannot claim i was caught unawares insurance medicals routine maintenance around the house and of course vacation it s good to set out all known expenses and decide precisely how each will be met while having your eye on the unexpected come to think of it we spend a third of our lives in retirement that s a long time and we must plan for the period therefore three basic questions to ask where will you live what will you live on and how will you keep mentally and physically fit on the latter it s good to do something new like learning a new language or playing the piano doing puzzles like sudoku in addition i decided to teach postgraduate courses on a part time basis oby ezekwesili obiageli oby ezekwesili a former minister of education in nigeria is an economic policy expert and political activist of some sort investment in people is it for me i see money as a means to an end i don t see it as an end i see money as an exchange to get other kinds of goods and services so i say rather than having investment in an account i would invest in what we regard in economics as translating from one form of capital to a higher form of capital one rule of investment for me is that if that money can go into somebody s education i would rather use it to invest in that human capital also money will never be my god money can never be the reason i wake up and go to bed and that s not because i have anything significant no it is because it simply has no rule over me i cannot accumulate money from unjust gain because unjust gain has its consequence neither will i have money without purpose what it means is money must be purposeful in my life it must go into serving people beyond me again i must have what is called rainy season money for emergencies and finally i must invest in myself jimi agbaje jimi agbaje a trained pharmacist is an investor business owner politician and political activist he was the governorship candidate of the opposition party in lagos state on two occasions you can be rich but not a success wealth for me is a combination of things it is not just money wealth is something that should be leveraged i believe wealth comprises a lot of things your name integrity beliefs network how much you give back to society and your money however little money without all the others does not constitute success

seventy years ago in the coastal mountains of norway near the town of sandnes kids would gather on sunday afternoons in march and april to ski to a peak overlooking the north sea once there they could rest on bare rocks and soak up the sun free from farm chores and with the darkest days of winter behind them best of all they would return to class monday morning with sun tans that was the thing said odd osland an elite amateur cross country skier who has lived in minnesota for most of the past 50 years at 81 the retired manufacturing engineer continues to impress others with his trademark kindness and relentless skiing again this winter he is returning to the starting lines of races in the united states canada and europe with amazing consistency he wins medals and trophies from races in his age group dominate the kitchen in his apple valley townhome last winter for instance he returned with four medals from the masters world cup cross country skiing championships in canmore alberta in march he ll travel to seefeld austria for the same event in a few weeks he ll compete in the sisu ski fest in ironwood mich in minnesota and wisconsin he treats as holy days the city of lakes loppet and the american birkebeiner i ll keep racing until i m 90 and then reassess osland said that is his stock answer to a question he fields endlessly another common question he gets how do you pronounce your first name that s my american problem he said i usually tell people to say ode but in norway it s pronounced just like it s spelled hence his personalized minnesota license plate declares im odd he has a wry sense of humor inside the twin cities cross country skiing community osland is known for more than his longevity in racing and strict discipline in training in a stack of papers on his kitchen table last week there was a handwritten note from someone at the loppet foundation it said odd you are actually the greatest thank you for being a rock for the loppet and the entire ski community you are amazing he has volunteered time and given money to the loppet an outdoors oriented community building organization based in golden valley for him personal interaction is the lifeblood of skiing after so many years it becomes like a family osland said the people are amazing when giving advice to new skiers of any age he ll bypass talk about the addictive atmosphere around racing and the self sacrifice required to win his core teaching about the sport is to find joy in it be persistent and enjoy winter by being outside with your friends he once wrote in a published essay as we age we face different challenges that may sideline us from time to time don t give up keep a positive attitude and remember how much fun it is to ski making a new home osland grew up the oldest of six children on a family farm about 30 miles south of stavanger a seaport since birth and still today he has battled a rare bone disorder known as mccune albright syndrome it caused lasting instability in his left femur requiring him to wear a brace and to undergo surgeries when it broke i was a weakling he said of his youth looking back that s probably what motivated me to take on the physical challenges of skiing but that didn t happen until he settled in america his three sisters and two brothers still live in scandinavia where brother per osland teaches theoretical particle physics at the university of bergen odd said he felt a calling to leave the country in his late 20s after listening to elders talk about friends and family members who struck it rich in the land of opportunity his arrival in 1970 was in cooperstown n d a tiny community northwest of fargo where cousins offered him a job on their farm a downturn in the family business left him looking for new work eventually punching a clock at a north dakota factory that made field plows it was the start of a long career in manufacturing including stops at minneapolis based graco and a stint making medical grade compressors and vacuum pumps in northbrook ill after five years in the greater chicago area osland returned to the twin cities with enough experience to work as a product designer and engineer he won a job at 3m that lasted 25 years he never obtained a college degree but he took engineering classes along the way i had a good feel for what machinery could do and how to make it he said ski racing for osland started in 1990 when he entered his first american birkebeiner in hayward wis with friends he got to know bjorn lasserud an accomplished racer and trained with him for nearly 20 years as a regular participant in the loppet nordic racing lnr training program osland also raced on loppet teams starting in 2008 he entered his first master s world cup race in mccall idaho i m not the fastest skier in my age class in the world circuit but fast enough that i m usually picked to participate on the usa age class relay teams he once said in a skiing interview i m content with that just being a part of the excitement of competing and to be with fit and like minded people jo ann wittman a close friend of osland said it s difficult for him to dwell on specific skiing accomplishments you have to pull things out of him she said he never says anything about himself according to an old magazine clipping osland finished first in his age class in the birkebeiner in both 2012 and 2013 after placing second on three separate occasions he said he likes to push himself and experience the result of it one of his skiing heroes is norwegian cross country legend oddvar bra revered in his country for overcoming a broken ski pole during a sprint to the finish line at the 1982 world championships in oslo bra was known as a man of the people who pushed himself to such extremes during races that he would hallucinate the point was not to endure the agony he would say but to enjoy it wittman sees a trace of that in osland who has suffered frostbite on his face more than once during training runs he ll say in a way it s a good thing takes off some dead skin she said but wittman said osland who has dual citizenship in the u s and norway also has a softer side he s an amateur photographer who has won ribbons in local competitions and is renowned among friends for his bread baking hobby cranberry wheat bread is one of his favorites osland and his ex wife carol raised four children tragedy struck their family in october 1997 when their only daughter kari died at age 16 in a car crash in apple valley she was a cheerleader at eastview high school she was my best friend osland said to stay fit during summers osland rides his bike and works out on roller skis he idolizes olympic gold medalist jessie diggins of afton and met her father on roller skiing training runs on the gateway state trail in washington county formerly a regular on the cross county trails at theodore wirth park in minneapolis he now bases his winter skiing at hyland hills ski area in bloomington and terrace oaks park in burnsville he s in it for the long haul even though his doctor recently ordered heart monitoring for episodes of atrial fibrillation i ve noticed it yes and they will look at all that osland said basically i think i m ok

in this article we will be taking a look at the 15 most hated companies in america to skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to see the 5 most hated companies in america in an ideal world companies would be supported by the general population after all the economy of a country defines its standard of living and the economy of a country is propped up by the major industries in the nation and these industries are defined by the companies within each industry after all companies provide innovation ideas and solutions that people need if they didn t they would soon be out of business they also provide employment to the working force of a country so why is it that most people hate corporations many corporations in the world and especially the bigger ones are disliked strongly by the general population because people believe that these companies exist for one purpose and one purpose alone to maximize profits no matter what the cost even though these companies earn billions of dollars in profits each year people believe that they do not contribute in any positive way and continue to cut costs in order to increase profit even more this ends up benefiting only a select few such as the executives of the company and shareholders meanwhile employees are sometimes overworked and underpaid not to mention made to work in harsh conditions many people also hate corporations because they believe that such companies take from the country but do not provide much in return and so they are actually a detriment you might think that this hatred would translate to a negative impact on the company s financials and hence its success but the discussion isn t as straightforward as you might believe some of the most successful companies in the world are also among the most hated primarily because of their success and yet they do genuinely make the life of customers easier for example amazon com inc nasdaq amzn has been derided time and again for its treatment of workers and considering the fact that there are 1 5 million workers in the company this is an important fact to consider however amazon com inc nasdaq amzn has made the life of consumers really easy providing instant delivery or next day delivery in many cases while also providing the cheapest price possible for many products excellent customer service and a great return policy when the lives of people are made easier they often compromise on their beliefs another reason behind companies not suffering despite widespread hatred is because there aren t many alternatives take the u s for example while there are anti trust laws established to ensure competition and there are many examples of mergers not being allowed to avoid monopolies with the attempted merger of activision blizzard inc nasdaq atvi with microsoft corporation nasdaq msft being a recent example there are effective monopolies in some industries which has led to them being the only possible solution no matter how poor their customer service is or no matter how many outrageous fees they tack on some of these companies are part of the most hated countries in america and we will discuss them in greater detail later on it is interesting to note that just because a company is among our list of the most hated companies in america it doesn t mean that it s universally hated after all maybe 10 of the population hates a specific company but maybe 30 of the population loves it since we re only focusing on the former criteria it would feature in our list even though more people love it than hate it and so being in this list doesn t mean that the company is doomed take meta platforms inc meta for example it is hated by a ton of people due to privacy concerns data leaks and its influence on everyone but it still has 2 billion active monthly users and so is nowhere near finished meanwhile financial corporations such as the goldman sachs group inc nyse gs is hated by most of the public but the company mainly deals with other companies and wealthy clients so public perception doesn t really hurt its bottom line for companies which operate on a b2b model business to business public perception doesn t matter as much as for b2c companies business to consumer of course this doesn t mean that there are no repercussions to a company if they fail the general public nowadays profits and revenue alone aren t sufficient to determine the success of the company environmental social and governance esg is just as important and is the biggest challenge for companies to overcome if they want to continue the level of success that they ve enjoyed or even increase it according to pwc itself one of the largest firms in the world mentioned that social capital is incredibly relevant to the success of a business now social capital refers to the impact of the decisions taken by a business on people according to pwc it describes the stocks of knowledge skills experience health and wellbeing within people as well as the stocks of relationships institutions shared values and norms that exist between people just like other forms of capital social capital can be increased or decreased by the flows of social capital the social impacts which result from business activity if a business operates properly with the general well being of society being a primary focus it will achieve success quickly of course this always has to be balanced with revenue and profitability but the point is that both need to go hand in hand for a business to be truly successful speaking of audit firms the audit industry has seen its fair share of criticism too especially in recent year there have been a series of high profile failures in audit which has put the industry under scrutiny with record fines administered to some audit firms which has resulted in the financial reporting council in the united kingdom to announce plans to overhaul corporate governance audit firms also see heavy workload with tight deadlines and often do not have adequate staff resulting in high pressure for employees which in turn results in a high level of turnover all of which are detrimental to the health of an employee as well as impacting their performance this is a trend in audit firms throughout the world and audit firms while taking steps in some countries should ensure more global policies to create a proper work life for employees you can also consider the pharmaceutical industry as an entire industry which is disliked by the general public conspiracy theorists have come up with the term big pharma which refers to major pharmaceutical organizations with conspiracy theories alleging that the executives of these companies collude to keep medical breakthroughs from reaching the public while also citing price hikes as a way for companies to make even higher profits at the expense of the health of the general public this reputation has seen a massive improvement in recent years as these companies worked hard to come up with a vaccine for the worst pandemic in a century helping to avert millions of deaths and tens of millions of serious illnesses across the world for our rankings of the most hated companies we polled the rankings published by various other websites including 24 7 wall street thestreet com bloomberg business insider and fast company giving precedence to companies which made multiple lists basically our article reflects the approximate consensus opinion of the financial media some of these rankings are as old as 10 years as we intentionally picked rankings that span a long period of time this way we are more likely to identify the companies that are consistently out of favor with the general public and the media so now let s take a look at the most hated companies in the america companies which need to work hard to regain public trust starting with number 15 15 american international group inc nyse aig american international group inc nyse aig earned the ire of the general public when normal people lost their life savings and employment in the 2008 recession while it was bailed out by the federal government to the tune of 180 billion and announced payments of 165 million in executive bonuses alone in a display of rare unity both democrats and republicans voiced their anger at this announcement by american international group inc nyse aig with even president obama commenting on whether such a bonus was deserved at all 14 johnson johnson nyse jnj number of times mentioned 2 johnson johnson nyse jnj is the biggest pharmaceutical company in the world by revenue but has faced significant controversy regarding its operations while johnson johnson nyse jnj received praised in 1982 for a nationwide recall of tylenol after some packages of the drug had been laced with cyanide it has garnered significant criticism based on lawsuits that its baby powder causes ovarian cancer with damages in billions of dollars being decided against the company 13 fox corporation nasdaq fox number of times mentioned 2 fox corporation nasdaq fox owns fox news which is the main basis for the hatred it receives fox corporation nasdaq fox is criticized for only providing views sympathetic to the republican party and the bias present in its coverage we believe this is a brilliant business strategy as most of the media companies stand to the left of the political spectrum number of times mentioned 2 netflix inc nasdaq nflx has been a people favorite for a long time growing massively over a short period of time however hatred for netflix inc nasdaq nflx has started to increase mainly because of price increases and the company pledging to crack down on multiple people using the same account we don t think netflix s presence in our list of the most hated companies in the us points to a negative outcome for the company or its shareholders 11 uber technologies inc nyse uber number of times mentioned 2 the ride hailing company has over 122 million monthly users but it has received criticism for its treatment of its drivers as gig workers uber technologies inc nyse uber is also disliked because of its disruption of the taxicab industry and contribution in traffic congestion we don t think uber deserves to be one of the most hated companies as its services addressed a massive problem for consumers who have trouble hailing a cab and getting almost anything to be delivered to their doors uber will probably find itself a place in an extended version of our most innovative companies article 10 comcast corporation nasdaq cmcsa number of times mentioned 2 comcast corporation nasdaq cmcsa is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world comcast corporation nasdaq cmcsa is widely criticized for its monopoly in many

oil companies considering how maligned they are in the eyes of the public but we settled for just two exxon mobil corporation nyse xom has been accused of being aware of the contribution of fossil fuels to climate change but provided false information to investors to prop up its share price exxon mobil corporation nyse xom was also accused of hiring military units of the indonesian national army to provide protection to the company s assets in the country with these units being accused of human rights violations exxon mobil is also still remembered because of the exxon valdez oil spill disaster overall though we don t think xom s presence in the most hated companies lists affects its business materially as consumers don t really prefer one oil company over another 8 citigroup inc nyse c number of times mentioned 2 one of the largest banking institutions in america citigroup inc nyse c was accused of misrepresenting its exposure to enron after the collapse of the latter further citigroup inc nyse c paid 75 million in 2010 after charges were brought against the company stating that investors were misled with respect to potential losses arising from risky mortgages yes we know it is a tiny fine regulators fixed their mistake in 2014 as the bank agreed to pay 7 billion to resolve a department of justice investigation into its sale of toxic mortgage backed securities leading up to the financial crisis in 2018 citigroup also agreed to pay 1 billion to settle charges brought by the department of justice and the federal reserve that it had violated the bank secrecy act and

one of the biggest oil companies in the world and in 2010 was responsible for the worst oil spill in global history in what is now known as the deepwater horizon spill while the spill ended up costing bp p l c nyse bp around 65 billion this has led to the general public hating the company the oil spill disaster affected bp s business for a few years but we don t think it is material anymore 6 walmart inc nyse wmt number of times mentioned 2 walmart inc nyse wmt is the largest private employer in the world with over 2 million employees most of whom are being accused of being treated unfairly by the largest company in the world by revenue walmart inc nyse wmt is also disliked because in many places it has swooped in and destroyed local businesses leaving customers no other options

legendary designer ralph gilles recently joined rob dahm for a new episode of top gear s american tuned in it the pair peruse gilles car collection before taking out one of the designer s favorite rides a very custom 1968 dodge charger with a 1 000 hp 745 kw hellephant v8 under the hood gilles is no stranger to the power of mopar products after all he s the head of design at stellantis and was largely responsible for the fifth gen dodge viper he co developed this charger with the folks from speedkore and the result is nothing short of epic under the clamshell hood which itself is a nod to the viper lies a 1 000 hp hellephant v8 mated to an eight speed zf transmission the body is built completely out of carbon fiber and the suspension and braking systems are modernized to manage the power more speedkore built this 1 000 hp 1968 dodge charger hellucination for stellantis ralph gilles we ve actually reported on the vehicle before when it was first unveiled this is the first time that we ve had the chance to see gilles himself get behind the wheel and tear up the track though before that he personally explains why it s called hellucination sure the hellephant engine plays a role but ultimately he loves how the car almost feels like a hallucination obviously this car looks like a classic charger but it performs far better than a stock classic example it s the little touches that matter too though for example the steering wheel is the same size as the original but modernized that s the whole point of it you re vibrating back and forth between the past and the future says gilles a car is so many different systems working in harmony your dream is to end up with something like this says dahm as he gets a chance behind the wheel on the track what s most satisfying though is seeing gilles take a literal spin on the skidpad this much power in something like a stock charger would be more than enough to break the tires loose and do a few donuts in the hellucination which is lighter and stiffer it s almost a prerequisite and from the video below it looks like gilles is very familiar with getting it to go sideways image top gear youtube
in this article we will be taking a look at the 30 wealthiest families in the world to skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to see the 10 wealthiest families in the world when you think about the wealthiest families in the world you can t help but think of the unequal distribution of resources which has allowed this situation to happen right now the world has enough resources to take care of its population and yet the vast majority are unable to enjoy even a decent standard of living while the rich enjoy luxurious lives that we cannot even begin to comprehend while the global gdp has quadrupled since 1980 the standard of living hasn t increased uniformly with most of this wealth being concentrated among the rich this means that while wealth is being created consistently over years and decades so is global inequality of course this doesn t mean that it s all doom and gloom after all many countries have worked hard and achieved some modicum of success in reducing extreme poverty and that s probably a result of globalization and trickle down economics however it is also important to stress that the problem is far from eradicated according to inequality org income inequality has never been as high as it is right now with the richest 1 in the world owning an astronomical 46 of the global wealth this of course means that there is much less left for the rest of the 99 to sustain themselves and so the cycle continues it is also interesting that while lack of opportunities corruption and generational wealth drives income inequality in developing nations the spread of wealth is heavily tilted in most developed economies as well with the u s being by far the worst of the bunch that is also why most of the 30 wealthiest families in the world will be found in the u s disparities between the rich and the poor have been clear to everyone for some time now but if there were any doubts the pandemic erased them all after all you can simply consider how unequal vaccine distribution was with the richer countries able to hoard more vaccines than needed while lower income countries struggled to inoculate even a small percentage of their population in mid january 2022 the number of vaccine doses administered per 100 people was 13 times higher in high income countries as compared to low income countries that s one way to look at it another point of view is that if there weren t any rich countries that are technologically advanced enough to invent a vaccine in such a short amount of time using a brand new technology the people in the lower income countries wouldn t have a single dose of the vaccine another incredible statistic is that even when job insecurity was rife and major corporations were decreasing their workforce by tens of thousands at a time billionaires enjoyed riches like never before with the collective wealth of billionaires globally increasing by 3 9 trillion from march to december 2020 at the same time earnings for workers globally decreased by 3 7 trillion as unemployment reached record levels in many countries so how do the wealthiest families in the world gain their wealth well most often one family member starts a company which experiences enormous success and leads to other members of the family generally children who then get ownership in the company and hence the wealth passes onto the family often times this wealth is then passed down from generation to generation and hence wealth continues to accumulate within the family increasing its net worth as the companies or investments continue to grow studies also show that family owned companies are more successful than regular companies mainly because family owned companies are perceived to be more trustworthy academic studies on the success of family owned companies whether family owned companies are objectively more successful than faceless corporations has been a question considered in many studies especially over the last couple of decades while considering markets in different countries from the u s to italy to vietnam according to a professor in the harvard law school forum on corporate governance investors tend to value family owned firms more highly especially if the founder is also acting as the ceo mainly because owner manager agency conflicts will be mitigated by the involvement of founding families with strong incentives to monitor there is evidence to back this as well considering that acquisitions and divestitures of family owned corporations have yielded better returns for shareholders as compared to acquisitions and divestitures of non family companies a study conducted by the family business stock index tracked the performance of family owned companies with that of non family owned companies and found out that from 1976 to 1996 the former provided a return of 16 6 while the latter s return was only 14 considering stock prices alone and not total returns the difference was even stronger with share price of family owned businesses increasing by 13 9 while non family owned businesses saw a share price increase of just 9 6 in the same period in a similar study conducted on the italian stock market in 2022 by the department of economics and management from the university of pavia family owned businesses outperformed non family owned businesses by a significant margin as well the study suggested that founding family firms are focused on a growth investing style and that companies where a member of the founding family is also the ceo performs better because of stronger motivation and long term thinking that results in a better return in the long run investing in family owned companies may not be the best strategy but it seems to outperform the market that s why we are going to bring some of the wealthiest families and the biggest family owned companies to your attention in this article most of the wealthiest people in the world are quite philanthropic often donating tens of millions of dollars and in some cases even billions of dollars the most generous givers in the billionaire community have given a combined 169 billion during their lifetimes and yet their wealth continues to increase mackenzie scott ex wife of jeff bezos the founder of amazon com inc nasdaq amzn donated 5 8 billion across hundreds of groups in 2020 and in june 2021 announced another donation of 2 7 billion putting her on track to giving away her fortune the fastest in history the wealthiest families in the world have a combined net worth of almost 1 7 trillion this doesn t include

without the argyle mine discovered in 1979 and operational since the mid 1980s the rio tinto owned and operated site located 550km southwest of darwin in the remote kimberley region of western australia produced 90 to 95 per cent of the world s pink and red diamonds before its closure in november 2020 rio tinto estimates that argyle pink diamond prices have appreciated by 500 per cent over the past 20 years overall pink prices rose 116 per cent between 2009 and 2019 yet those numbers while impressive almost seem to belie the true miraculousness and scale of the project measuring approximately 50 hectares with a depth of 600m the argyle mine was at one point the largest diamond mine on earth visible from space it nearly doubled the world s diamond output in the 1980s and 90s

of diamonds almost straight away there were claim jumpers who tried to snatch the rights to the deposit says prof kells while an estimated 72 80 per cent of argyle s 865 million carat output was brown stones branded as champagne chocolate and cognac diamonds its most enduring legacy is as the home of the world s most vivid reds and pinks which made up less than 1 per cent of its output even though

pink diamonds the volumes were extremely small a year s production would fit in a single champagne flute patrick coppens rio tinto he adds there are examples of similar colours from other mines in the world but argyle has given some connoisseurs the opportunity to own this rare specimen of earth s geology what they lack in size compared to other natural fancy colour diamonds they make up in their captivating visual allure there are other appealing aspects of these diamonds too says steve der bedrossian ceo sams group which supplies loose argyle pink diamonds as well as pink kimberley and blush pink diamonds jewellery brands argyle pink and red diamonds display unparalleled colour those strong hues and of course there is their rarity they are also ethically mined here in australia and each

argyle pink diamonds in the us lj west vice president scott west son of founder larry west tells jeweller that his father became hooked on the diamonds after purchasing his first parcel of argyle pinks around 1990 following a visit to the mine itself once back in new york larry brought the diamonds to a buyer who was a maven in rare colours larry knew from past negotiations with this customer that the person would always bring out comparable stones in order to negotiate down the price above linneys this time however the customer did not have any comparable stones west says larry could see

diamond atelier in sydney which is one of less than 40 retailers worldwide to bear the argyle select atelier designation tells jeweller argyle was the world s only reliable source of beautiful pink diamonds ever in history for those of us who have been working with them pretty much since the mine began they are also incredibly special because they are a unique australian gift to the world the

diamond supplier kunming diamonds which began stocking argyle pinks in 2011 an argyle pink is special because it gives you the experience of australia and of the argyle mine pink diamonds were the country s hidden gem up until 37 years ago and argyle has achieved the status of the pinnacle in the diamond chain ultra luxury diamonds he adds beyond their appreciation in value over the past few

analysis gia excludes petite suites and pink everlastings in the world of fancy colour diamonds pinks stand apart partially as a function of rarity and beauty but also as a result of shrewd promotion given that pink is a colour associated with love life and beauty and represents everything from a budding spring blossom to the blushing cheeks from a first kiss everything that we want to cherish for eternity it hasn t been difficult to market argyle pink and red diamonds display unparalleled colour those strong hues and of course there is their rarity they are also ethically mined here in australia steve der bedrossian sams group australia pink diamonds always seem to have a little more consumer curiosity because they are the most advertised and promoted of all the different colour diamonds explains bronstein other colour diamonds go through moments where they are commercial fads and demand ebbs and flows with promotions and designers creating new pieces he adds yellow diamonds are easily accessible and affordable in larger sizes than pinks but they have not been fully marketed to the public blue diamonds are even rarer than pinks meaning they are not affordable to most therefore they are rarely promoted or marketed except via special auctions among the exclusive pink club argyle pinks rank above all rio tinto estimates that argyle pink diamond prices have appreciated by 500 per cent over the past 20 years overall pink prices rose 116 per cent between 2009 and 2019 according to the fancy color research foundation fcrf us based fancy colour diamond supplier leibish first participated in the argyle tender in 2010 director leibish polnauer tells jeweller pink diamonds have fared better than all other fancy colours but argyle pink diamonds have had a real boom with exceptional increases the strongest price moves we noticed are in argyle red diamonds and we have a few in stock he added the money we needed to spend on the tender is about seven times higher than 10 years ago argyle diamonds were always considered rare and valuable long before the news of the mine s impending closure was announced pink diamonds were the country s hidden gem up until 37 years ago and argyle has achieved the status of the pinnacle in the diamond chain harsh maheshwari kunming diamonds although rio tinto worked exceptionally hard unearthing as many diamonds as possible demand has constantly outpaced the supply yet in the early years of argyle there was a distinct lack of awareness around pink diamonds due to the sporadic supply it is estimated less than 2 per cent of diamonds display noticeable colour and less than 1 per cent of those diamonds are pink or red construction on the argyle mine commenced around 1984 and it gradually gained attention but it wasn t until brisbane hosted the world expo in 1988 that we saw a strong increase in enquiries says calleija this six month event attracted more than 15 million visitors and fortunately argyle shared news of their pink diamond discoveries for everyone to see adds neuman in the 1980s our parent company was one of two distributors for argyle diamonds on the east coast of australia my first job was to go all around the country and try and sell pink diamonds to jewellers it was a fairly new thing and it was difficult to get most jewellers to appreciate the value in a pink diamond but as time went on it started to take off as more jewellers took up pink diamonds advertised and promoted them left to right lj west earrings and bracelet calleija ring above moussaieff above musson above moussaieff we have tender books dating back to the 90s it s amazing to see the difference in how the stones were presented then and the tiny prices we bid when purchasing them scott west lj west diamonds perhaps the most important factor in the marketing of argyle pink diamonds was the annual argyle tender introduced in 1984 with a special viewing of 33 diamonds in antwerp it has since expanded to include viewings in geneva london sydney tokyo and perth with some tenders including more than 70 stones in a 2014 gia retrospective to mark the tender s 30th anniversary authors john king dr james e shigley and claudia jannucci noted the mystique of the process argyle s tender process only adds to the excitement that surrounds these diamonds the tender is by invitation only and the list of invitees is not made public an invitation to view allows a time slot of approximately one hour in which to make bidding decisions despite this time constraint the participants are seasoned professionals who know the range of pink diamond color appearances and how they relate to value in any given city the site remains unknown until just before the viewings they wrote over the decades approximately 1 990 diamonds have been offered at the main tender of which more than 90 per cent were pink a smaller private tender for selected suppliers also takes place in march the allure of argyle pink diamonds is that the finest ones have unique hues and saturations which predominate this specific locality alan bronstein natural color diamond association reflecting on decades of tender participation west tells jeweller we have tender books dating back to the 90s it s amazing to see the difference in how the stones were presented then and the tiny prices we bid when purchasing them we participated in the very first tender from argyle and have participated in every tender subsequent says mondial s neuman we haven t always been successful in our bids but that s more a function of how we bid and everybody else we tend to purchase for stock therefore we look very carefully at the items we bid on we want them to be uniquely special stones with certain characteristics that make them stand out from even the other tender diamonds the announcement of the mine s final closure date led to a spike in demand across the board maheshwari said the announcement created hype to a different level even during the pandemic the prices and demand were not affected and they have started to appreciate drastically since mid 2020 argyle pinks have become irreplaceable and the increased connoisseurship of argyle pink diamonds has triggered a chain reaction that has sent prices for all categories into the clouds collectors and jewellery lovers were the original drivers of demand more recently the investor buyer has played a role and there have been areas of the market that catered to that ronny rosenthal rr diamonds ronny rosenthal director of diamond supplier rr diamonds shared similar observations the demand has always been strong but with the news of the mine s closure it exceeded expectations both domestically and internationally i think collectors and jewellery lovers were the original drivers of demand more recently the investor buyer has played a role and there have been areas of the market that catered to that however importantly there are also buyers that want to take part and have a piece of this unique moment in the history of australian gemstones there s a lot of pride in this product adds polnauer round stone prices reached explosive heights and it is nearly prohibitive to plan jewellery with round argyle melee diamonds as they cost more than the centre stone argyle stones over one carat are also in great demand and hardly available we bought six stones over 1 carat at the 2020 tender left to right boodles ring top gimel brooch bottom pink kimberley ring gimel brooch above cerrone above graff above debeers one could draw a parallel with the fine art market there are the buyers who purchase art for the simple love or decorative merits of the piece and others who purchase for the perceived potential store of value john glajz glajz john glajz director of singapore based pink diamond specialist supplier glajz told jeweller we noticed a substantial increase in demand in late 2019 once rio tinto made the official announcement of the mine s closure date as november 2020 we had known all along that the production would cease eventually however the announcement put a finite line in the sand he added our company has participated in argyle premium and signature tenders for more than 20 years we actually purchased the entire single premium tender of 71 diamonds in april 2020 on the eve of the covid 19 lockdowns in singapore and australia i must say that i was temporarily concerned having made such a level of financial commitment as the world was running for cover and international business suddenly ceased to exist fortunately this was only a temporary phenomenon and the demand surged shortly afterwards glajz said consumer demand in 2020 came from both jewellery collectors and investors and was amplified during the pandemic the demand from jewellery collectors was impacted by the cessation of international travel above lj west the product was strongly promoted by leading jewellers both in australia and internationally as a thing of beauty earth s treasure the ultimate collectible and an exclusive everlasting gift of love glajz explains on the investor side he notes also aggressively presented by several non jeweller companies as an asset class and even as an alternative investment in order to appeal to a wider market glajz adds one could draw a parallel with the fine art market there are the buyers who purchase art for the simple love or decorative merits of the piece and others who purchase for the perceived potential store of value and an eventual return on their investment neuman first noted the rise in investment diamond buying following the global financial crisis of 2008 according to the fcrf s analysis pink diamond prices saw the most dramatic increase between 2009 and 2014 the gfc didn t really affect australia as much as it affected the rest of the world but many people were poorly affected in terms of investments in the stock market people started to look at pink diamonds as part of the portfolio for their self managed super funds around that time 2008 2010 was the first major or boosted period of growth for pink diamonds prices neuman says he adds we ve seen a second wave in the last five years as some sellers of pink diamonds have targeted the investment angle decades of research goes into finding the right environment that actually has diamonds to discover pink diamonds like this again is highly unlikely many expect this is the last generation to experience the privilege john calleija calleija they are particularly focused on trying to highlight the growth in the cost of pink diamonds as an indicator that they would perhaps be a worthwhile alternative for people looking to channel some of their investments away from the more traditional areas given the low yield environment der bedrossian noted a definite acceleration of demand around 2010 there was more momentum at that point when there was talk of closing the mine altogether before rio tinto decided to continue mining underground today sams group sees a healthy blend of both jewellery lovers and investors purchasing pink diamonds per piece sold the demand is higher for jewellery but in terms of dollar value per item it is definitely more from the investor collector side he tells jeweller calleija puts the current demand split at 80 per cent jewellery lovers and 20 per cent investors as they say supply creates its own demand and the rarity of argyle diamonds has increased significantly with the closure of the argyle mine this has resulted in a strong increase in their value and interest among jewellery lovers and collectors he says left to right musson necklace harry winston ring pink kimberley ring pink starlet necklace above fairfax roberts above musson above lj west with the closure of the argyle mine at the end of 2020 one question remains on everyone s lips where do we go from here the last argyle tender is scheduled to take place later this year with coppens calling it a final in a lifetime event a moment in time to acquire the last production of the most special diamonds produced in the last months of an iconic mine argyle was the world s only reliable source of beautiful pink diamonds ever in history they are a unique australian gift to the world the apogee pinnacle exemplar of their kind michael neuman mondial pink diamond atelier we are excited that the argyle mine continued to produce these wonders of nature even during the final days of the mine s life including a number of very special diamonds he tells jeweller we are currently curating the final collection of diamonds for inclusion in the 2021 tender and are looking forward to showcasing them to a global audience these are earthly treasures in a league of their own and bidders will not be disappointed he adds says neuman we still have yet to see the production from that last ore being extracted from the mine in november last year that hasn t come through to the market but it is imminent that will be the last of the new argyle pink diamond material once that s done there will be the remaining stock that is already held by argyle pink diamonds authorised partners and pink diamond stock that is not in private hands and is ready to be sold that will be sold over the next 12 to 24 months he predicts glajz tells jeweller i think that the general demand will continue and gradually flatten the recent spike in prices has already created some consumer resistance but prices will most likely remain robust as existing inventories are sold down other suppliers agree that the demand for pinks is unlikely to abate soon and with supplies dropping to a tiny fraction of what they were when argyle was productive prices will inevitably rise the market is extremely strong at the moment and it s just going to get stronger says der bedrossian the prices are going to keep going up as there are simply no more stones coming from argyle i m sure there will be some stones arriving on the market from investors who want to cash out but this is not going to be a consistent supply certainly not as consistent as what argyle has spoilt us with for the last 35 plus years he adds above glajz meanwhile maheshwari explains a secondary market for argyle pinks is already in play and will take over in the next few years that will remain as a significant source parallel to that pink diamonds are being sourced from brazil russia and various african mines theoretically and historically prices jump and then only gradually appreciate over time adds west once diamonds go into private hands they re enter that market at slow rates so we think its safe to assume the supply of argyle pinks held by diamond companies will continue to decrease as time moves on and that will increase the price people want for their remaining stones bronstein observes that the industry must continue to support the pink diamond market much of the added value concept for pink diamonds has been driven by the argyle awareness this education and promotion must be maintained there are already creative marketers coming out with new ideas to capture the untapped customers he says russian mining conglomerate alrosa the world s largest diamond producer by volume has unearthed several notable pinks in recent years including the 14 83 carat fancy vivid purplish pink it named spirit of the rose it was sold in november 2020 by sotheby s for us26 6 million colour diamonds currently account for less than 0 1 per cent of alrosa s total output and most originate from the remote yakutia region in siberia like spirit of the rose lj west purchased its first yakutia pink diamond in 2020 with scott west telling jck online at the time siberia has a lower quantity but is still a somewhat consistent production because siberia is so big there is the potential to find new mines although rio tinto worked exceptionally hard unearthing as many diamonds as possible demand has constantly outpaced the supply leibish polnauer leibish in botswana mining company lucara unearthed a 4 13 carat pink at its karowe mine in 2019 and recently had its mining licence renewed by the botswana government until 2046 neighbouring lesotho has also been a source of pink diamonds with gem diamonds unearthing two large specimens a 14 09 carat and a 13 carat from the letšeng mine in 2020 however west clarifies pink diamonds are found in africa and russia but make up less than 10 per cent of the current world supply which during the peak argyle days was still not many stones african and russian pinks are also different in appearance so if a person is looking for the strong raspberry tones argyle is known for they will have to look for old argyle stock in australia lucapa and geocrystal are part of a handful of parties involved in australian diamond exploration though no pink diamonds had been unearthed at the time of publication calleija says discovering another mine to equal argyle is unlikely decades of research go into finding the right environment that actually has diamonds and then it takes many more years of investigation to find out if the area can be mined to discover pink diamonds like this again is highly unlikely many expect this is the last generation to experience the privilege of mining pink diamonds viewing the market from a holistic perspective bronstein says the closing of any mine especially one that is the major source for a particular colour has an effect on the future market while no new stones will be coming from the mine what has been extracted still gives many options to those seeking a fabulous stone there is no question that the beauty and rarity of the finest argyle pink diamonds will always be appreciated by traders collectors and connoisseurs but where the values will settle is impossible to predict as for the argyle mine itself rio tinto is currently undertaking decommissioning and rehabilitation a project it estimates will take five years there is still a long journey ahead to rehabilitate the site the final chapters of the argyle story are yet to be written and we will continue to be an important part of the east kimberley community for many years to come chris richards argyle mine closure readiness chris richards general manager closure readiness at the argyle mine tells jeweller that the company worked with traditional owners local communities and businesses as well as the west australian government to develop the closure strategy focusing on environmental impacts and economic transition while argyle ceased production at the end of 2020 there is still a long journey ahead to rehabilitate the site richards says this work will provide significant economic opportunities with our strong commitment to local content helping to ensure that the region benefits particularly the traditional owner businesses and individuals in this way the final chapters of the argyle story are yet to be written and we will continue to be an important part of the east kimberley community for many years to come he adds with the closure of argyle australia no longer has a single productive diamond mine from making australia the largest diamond producer in the world in the 1980s to becoming synonymous with the world s rarest stones there is no doubt argyle has left an indelible mark on the local and global diamond landscape its absence will be keenly felt as much as its incredible legacy is assured a tender glance argyle s breath taking treasures 3 14 carats argyle alpha 2018 tender won by glajz 2 34 carats kimberley rose

searching australia s vast interior for diamond bearing kimberlites ancient volcano pipelines filled with diamonds where none had looked before on the verge of having his funding withdrawn tyler s team finally found a diamond in a rock sample but the journey was only beginning here he reflects on the miraculous argyle story and predicts the future of diamonds in australia how does it feel to look back on the life cycle argyle project it s been a life s journey i started the search in 1969 and we found argyle in 1979 we constructed the mine and brought it to production at one stage it was producing 40 per cent of the world s natural diamonds they might not have been top quality but nevertheless we had 10 times more diamonds in a tonne of rock than the average so we were laughing really i retired from ashton mining in 1990 though i kept an involvement with argyle until 2002 it was a very very exciting time a once in a lifetime affair and really from my 45th birthday when we found the first diamond my life has never been quite the same i ve become known as the father of the australian diamond industry which is nonsense in one sense but it s right in another sense without me starting it it wouldn t have gone anywhere what is your fondest memory from the project during the 1960s 70s and 80s ewen tyler established australia s fledgling diamond industry i think the fondest memory is the discovery of the first diamond on the evening of my 45th birthday in 1973 it was nowhere near argyle but it represented a milestone in exploration we had not had any confirmation that there were any diamonds in the kimberley there had been rumours one story was that there was a chap in the 19th century who had taken some diamonds to show an abbott at a monastery but there was nothing on paper that told me that diamonds had ever been found in the kimberley before we d found a few pieces of chrome diopside a few months before but to actually find a sample not only with indicator minerals but a diamond in it showed we were on the right track it took us a long time though it was six years before we stood on the argyle site the other great day was when we crushed the first tonne of ore i sent a case of champagne to the engineering team did you ever have any doubts or any moments when it seemed like it might have all ended if we hadn t found the diamond on my birthday i was expecting to be chucked out of tanganyika holdings the following christmas i d more or less got my marching orders the money was going to dry up they were more interested in doing something in the north sea than continuing to back me that was the first major hurdle and there were a lot of hurdles there was another when people said it s no good buying australian diamonds they will all explode if you put them on the polishing wheel the press were very unkind to us if you can t sell your product and everyone is against you it s hard to keep up enthusiasm there were lots of government problems too when we first established the project and were showing alluvial diamonds the west australian government was of the opinion they were worth twice as much as they were so we paid a very substantial royalty the government also tried to tell us we couldn t do fly in fly out saying it would cost us 50 million to avoid building a town at the mine we could have walked then when was the first pink stone found at argyle it was something that came out of the alluvial production before we began mining bill leslie claims to have one of the first pink diamonds from argyle but it was not something that we recorded because pinks were a very very small percentage of the diamonds talking about the pinks made people aware that we had a mine and we only showed them once per year while it wasn t part of the equation at the start the pink diamonds have created the market and awareness of the argyle mine itself what do you think about the future of diamond mining in australia i am absolutely convinced there are more diamonds in fact i m a participant in the continuing diamond discovery about 600km south of argyle the first diamond mine we discovered was ellendale though we didn t mine it others found there was a market for ellendale yellow diamonds it s the same at merlin in the northern territory another mine we discovered and mined for a period it has been shut down but i think there is some stirring to see if it can be brought back is there any chance more pink diamonds will be found in australia i think there are and i m looking for more we ve got signs of them occurring all around merlin some signs around ellendale but not much around argyle as a nation i believe that we ve got to keep exploring it s the nature of this continent we started off with gold melbourne wouldn t exist without the 1850 gold rush it s more about finding people who are willing to join this lunatic search as they say people who look for diamonds have rocks in their heads but it s a lot of fun location of australia s three diamond mines ellendale argyle and merlin the argyle mine closed in 2020 ellendale and merlin are currently dormant read ewen tyler s account of the

envoys and allies under the new administration believe that it is a must for a head of state to travel president ferdinand bongbong marcos jr and first lady liza araneta marcos photo courtesy of malacañang and so six months into the presidency president ferdinand bongbong marcos jr has made the most out of this task by bringing to larger platforms the philippines agenda and visions even when he said he was traveling too much marcos was still compelled to acknowledge and accept invitations from fellow foreign leaders as he believed that there was no better way to communicate the country s agenda and positions on regional and international concerns than to do it in person the president is also convinced that showing up is the best way to drum up business for the country so he took it by heart and went on to visit six countries in his first six months in office indonesia the maiden foreign trip marcos made his international debut as a head of state in indonesia in september for his first ever state visit before embarking on the trip marcos repeatedly said that he wanted to first settle down as the 17th philippine president and deal with pressing domestic issues first these included assuming the role of agriculture secretary on a concurrent basis in indonesia one of his main goals was to lure investments for the agriculture sector which he achieved after getting indonesia s commitment to supply fertilizers to the philippines when he returned to the country the president revealed that he and indonesian president joko widodo discussed the delimitation of our boundaries respective to our continental shelves which i hope can become a template to resolving conflicting claims singapore and an orchid named after the marcoses marcos made it a back to back foreign trip as he flew from indonesia to singapore in september several business meetings and agreements took place during his two day visit there the highlight of this trip however was the naming of an orchid after the president and first lady liza araneta marcos dendrobium ferdinand louise marcos it is a tradition in singapore to name orchids after visiting dignitaries such as royalties heads of state and government and even celebrities the so called orchid diplomacy is a gesture of friendship to promote goodwill between singapore and other countries marcos tagged the back to back trips as fruitful and engaging as these yielded 14 36 billion or p804 78 billion in investment pledges these investments if we put it all together value 14 36 billion us dollars or 804 78 billion philippine pesos this will support our country s economic recovery efforts and create more jobs for filipinos here in our country he said upon returning to the country historic usa visit marcos visit to the united states was historic for two reasons it was his first trip there since a contempt order was issued against him by a local court and it was also the first time in 12 years that a philippine president addressed the united nations general assembly unga given his position as a head of state marcos enjoys diplomatic immunity which allowed him to travel to the us despite the contempt judgment president ferdinand bongbong marcos jr noel pabalate his visit to the us was by far the longest trip he had he stayed there for six days the president described it as successful as he was able to accomplish everything he had planned to achieve and was able to meet world leaders he wanted to including us president joseph biden japan prime minister kishida fumio and un secretary general antónio guterres one of the highlights of marcos stay in the us was ringing the closing bell of the new york stock exchange from the small balcony of the trading floor it was also during this event that he had a close encounter with protesters who later staged a lightning rally inside the asia society headquarters just minutes before marcos speech at the new york stock exchange a hopeful marcos came back to the country after this trip saying that his working visit in the united states will serve as a good start for programs and opportunities under his administration there will be i believe good news to share in the next few months particularly in terms of their plans to expand and further broaden their investment footprint in our country he said our discussion with the us business community affirms the optimism with which international investors view the philippines today he added no missed chances in cambodia marcos trip to cambodia in november was interesting as he was able to meet his fellow association of southeast asian nations asean leaders and other counterparts outside the region he concluded his participation in the 40th and 41st asean summits with no missed chances after several business meetings and bilateral talks it was also during this trip that marcos got invited by world economic forum wef founder and executive chairman klaus schwab to the wef in davos switzerland on jan 16 to 20 next year for which the president already confirmed his attendance the chief executive said upon arriving in the philippines that it was quite gratifying to see that there was very large consensus among the asean member states stressing that they are going through the same issues in food supply prices of fertilizer and surging oil prices he also said that the most important takeaway from his trip was that all member states reach a consensus that no country can do it all they must work together and help each other thailand and a secret weapon marcos visit to thailand in november for his maiden participation in the 29th asia pacific economic cooperation apec economic leaders meeting was the first time his administration made it publicly known that former president gloria macapagal arroyo was giving him legal advice particularly in his apec meetings in fact the former president accompanied marcos to his first ever bilateral meeting with chinese president xi jinping on the sidelines of apec meetings before leaving thailand marcos personally introduced arroyo to the filipino community there as his secret weapon we have an additional secret weapon who came with us former president gma marcos said in filipino i m calling her secret weapon because i am the newbie here i am the new leader so whenever she walks in the meeting when other leaders see her they recognize her as their good friend that makes the discussion easier withstanding sub zero brussels a meeting with king philippe of belgium delivering remarks at several gatherings including the asean european union commemorative summit and serving as the asean coordinator in the summits were what went down in the president s trip to belgium in december capping his foreign trips this year despite having a hoarse voice and catching cold during his stay in the european country marcos was able to amplify potential priority agendas between the two blocs he brought to the bigger platform the conversation on the effective application of unclos to address the maritime disputes and geopolitical rivalries in the indo pacific he pitched for closer economic cooperation for the two blocs and urged the international community like what he has been doing in all his overseas engagements to act against climate change now the chief executive dubbed his brussels trip as productive bringing home at least p9 8 billion investment pledge from european firms controversial singapore trip while the president had six official trips this year he also had an unannounced trip to singapore in october which he claimed was an offshoot of his singapore working trip in september and a way to drum up business they say that playing golf is the best way to drum up business but i say it s formula 1 what a productive weekend marcos then said he made clear that he was invited to meet other business friends willing to invest in the country it was fulfilling to have been invited alongside several dignitaries and to have met new business friends who showed that they are ready and willing to invest in the philippines he said the palace did not make a formal announcement about the trip and only confirmed it days after fierce on climate change aside from calling for solidarity among nations whenever he was given the chance to speak at a wider audience marcos also constantly brought up the issue of climate change he brought it up during his unga speech and became a constant part of his agenda until his belgium trip where he even asked the eu to keep extending support to asean and other vulnerable countries like the philippines he always said that climate change was a race against time that needs the effort of all nations to fight it the world must get together to fight the effects of climate change and to ensure sustainable development climate change threatens to radically transform for the worst many vulnerable asean landscapes he said in belgium there is no problem like climate change that is so global in nature that it requires immediate and united effort we need to act now we need to act together we need to get it right the president stressed billions worth of investments marcos foreign trips this year yielded 23 6 billion of investment pledges according to the department of trade and industry dti said according to dti s year end report marcos visits to indonesia singapore the united states cambodia and thailand brought billions of pesos in investments as the administration gears toward aggressively attracting more foreign businesses to come to the philippines the trade department also included in its report the recent government export registered and generated investment leads particularly with the dti board of investments boi the dti s performance report said the boi and the philippine economic zone authority peza had a combined approved investment of p402 billion which could generate some 54 217 local jobs future trips marcos has already at least three trips being lined up for next year he is expected to visit china and davos switzerland in january it has also been made known earlier that japan will also welcome the president for a state visit
tesla and spacex ceo elon musk in berlin on dec 1 2020 musk says he plays on remaining as twitter s ceo until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job musk s announcement came after millions of twitter users asked him to step down in an unscientific poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by hannibal hanschke pool photo via ap file elon musk was speechless the twitter ceo was on a live audio chat tuesday night with software engineers when one user started quizzing him about the internal workings of the company s systems musk who hours earlier said he would keep control of twitter s software systems even though he plans to relinquish the ceo role said the company s code needed a complete rewrite one of the participants asked what he meant pushing for him to explain it from top to bottom amazing wow musk said after hesitations and pauses you re a jackass what a moron the incident highlights the new reality facing musk who also runs tesla and spacex a crisis of confidence in his once unquestioned brilliance that crisis accelerated as tesla stock prices plunged nearly 20 percent this week to 123 per share on friday largely due to concerns about musk also this week roughly 58 percent of 17 million twitter accounts that responded to an unscientific poll from musk said he should step down as twitter ceo after helping create then reverse new policies that proved controversial last weekend historically he s been a pendulum between genius and reckless said gene munster managing partner at loup ventures he s on reckless right now he s way over recklessness he added it leaves people to view him as slightly less of a genius musk has built his reputation on having a midas touch with the companies he runs something many investors and experts thought he would bring to twitter when he purchased it for 44 billion in october paying nearly twice as much as it was worth by some analyst estimates he is known for sleeping on the factory floor at tesla demanding long hours and quick turnarounds from his workers he is seen as an engineering genius propelling promises of cars that can drive themselves and rockets that can take humans to mars but that image is unraveling some twitter employees who worked with musk are doubtful his management style will allow him to turn the company around and some investors in tesla by far the biggest source of his wealth have begun to see him as a liability musk s distraction has prompted questions about leadership of spacex as well though it is much less reliant on his active involvement meanwhile neuralink and boring co two companies he founded continue to lag on promises musk s net worth largely fueled by his stake in tesla which has fallen by more than half this year has plunged this year from roughly 270 billion to below 140 billion on friday according to the bloomberg billionaires index that fall has relieved him of the title of the world s richest man and called into question his ability to keep up with his billions of dollars in loans musk is repeatedly described as a man obsessed with twitter in all the wrong ways who is failing both at protecting his new investment and his previous ones according to interviews with a half dozen former twitter employees and people close to him who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution or because they were not authorized to speak publicly about company matters musk this week said twitter is in a financial hole and facing a cash crunch even as it slashed more than half of the workforce and closed offices we have an emergency fire drill on our hands musk said on twitter spaces aspirationally i m not naturally capricious musk has always been unpredictable and freewheeling with his public persona but with twitter his actions have directly affected the business turning off some of the company s users and pushing away advertisers said jo ellen pozner a management professor at santa clara university s leavey school of business it really feels destabilizing for the whole twitter community she said adding that the reputation of a ceo does affect businesses and their stock prices and could even prompt consumers to choose another vehicle musk and twitter which has disbanded most of its public relations team did not respond to requests for comment holed up in a 10th floor conference room musk who is south african and migrated to north america as a teenager first forged his image as a tech wizard by founding the company that became paypal he funneled much of his around 165 million in gains from the sale of paypal into two ventures tesla and spacex spacex went on to become the most successful private spaceflight company in history pioneering reusable rockets and launching astronauts to the international space station tesla meanwhile brought electric vehicles to the mainstream with sleek fast and competitively priced sedans and suvs that shattered the frumpy image of eco conscious cars his closest allies have held out faith even as he has missed major deadlines for selling new vehicle models and rolling out self driving technology musk has been focused almost solely on twitter since he bought it planning to reinvent the company as an engineering driven operation he immediately ousted twitter s previous executives and embarked on a campaign of harsh layoffs that cut the company in half many of musk s supporters who had followed his rise at tesla gave him the benefit of the doubt that he had a plan to transform twitter but he immediately spooked advertisers by engaging in a baseless accusation and dialed back twitter s content moderation prompting calls from civil rights groups for advertisers to suspend their marketing on the site and he had to pull back his first major product launch twitter blue verified after a day when a swarm of impersonators wreaked havoc musk appears to be struggling to grasp twitter s business the people close to him say and he demands a stance from his employees that stifles discussion of problems he doesn t see from the zoom out view at all one of the people close to musk and his team said describing him as uncovering and solving and programming all night he has been holed up in a 10th floor conference area with a staging room for visitors where they often remain for more than an hour before being called in they are instructed not to speak until musk does and when they do finally meet with him he s sometimes watching youtube videos many staffers have quickly learned they can t rely on the erratic and unpredictable musk even as he makes assurances about the various facets of the company they have raised as concerns the driving team behind project eraser which carries out functions such as deleting the user data of those who ask part of compliance with federal requirements has been gutted musk has brought in a new roster of leaders many who are loyalists when one executive met with musk and voiced concerns about the federal trade commission s consent decree musk assured that person there was nothing to worry about he said tesla had plenty of experience on privacy matters and pointed to his deep knowledge and awareness of the constraints twitter was under minutes after the meeting concluded a subordinate of musk emailed would the executive be willing to send over a copy of the consent decree they had just discussed instead of focusing on plans to make the site a competitor to youtube with video and rolling out other new features that will earn revenue he instead got sucked into the culture wars the people said that took the form of the twitter files an examination by some journalists of many of the company s actions before musk s arrival such as the blocking of a new york post story that dug into the contents of hunter biden s laptop and the ban on former president donald trump musk chose bari weiss a former new york times columnist as one of the writers invited inside the company to go through documents please give bari full access to everything at twitter musk wrote to a subordinate in a signal message viewed by the washington post no limits at all that was concerning to many inside twitter particularly those familiar with the 2011 ftc settlement after hacks of high profile accounts including that of then president barack obama staffers responsible for her onboarding pushed back and refused to grant weiss the full access musk had requested saying it would violate the settlement one former employee described that step as super unprecedented and highly inappropriate saying twitter would never have granted that level of access to an outside party who might suddenly be able to read direct messages for example the pushback however was not taken as seriously at senior levels days later musk announced deputy general counsel jim baker had been exited from the company as the ceo cited what he called his possible role in suppression of information important to the public dialogue former employees said it would have been normal for an attorney to review documents for release that same day alan rosa twitter s chief information security officer in charge of access matters was fired from the company as well employees that week found weiss s name searchable in slack the company s internal messaging service but her access was overseen by a chaperone new twitter trust and safety chief ella irwin irwin s name appeared in a watermark on the twitter files when twitter suspended more than half a dozen journalists last week over alleged violations of its rules on doxing the sharing of private information the suspensions were labeled in internal systems direction of ella musk also used internal systems to dig up an old message from his previous trust and safety head and took aim at twitter executives unleashing a swarm of criticism on employees sometimes while they were still working for twitter these guys did amazing damage one former employee said of musk s circle at twitter which included employees of his other companies and friends who lacked expertise on twitter they are basically bullying their way to getting super god access to these things all they re doing is they re witch hunting for elon so they can find people talking so they can fire them musk is running the newly private company largely on his instincts mirroring the workflows of his other major technology company tesla the electric car company the world s most valuable automaker has eschewed market research in its dominance of the electric vehicle space seeding the automotive industry with a raw and authentic expressions of musk s id tesla s stainless steel cybertruck pickup which shocked automotive analysts with its angular sci fi looks has served as a key example of that ethos at tesla employees often find out about deadlines and major product changes through tweeted edicts but they have also grown used to the ceo s shoot from the hip attitude his reliance on his gut instincts rather than the research and development arms typical of multibillion dollar corporations the unraveling but tesla s stock price has plummeted which musk frequently attributes to economic trends as bank savings account interest rates which are guaranteed start to approach stock market returns which are not guaranteed people will increasingly move their money out of stocks into cash thus causing stocks to drop he said in a tweet tuesday but analysts have pointed to problems more specific to tesla and concern with musk s time at twitter suggesting in essence that the sheen has worn off a company whose value was not rooted in its fundamentals i felt for a while he was given a pass said karl brauer executive analyst at the website iseecars oh it s elon he s midas if he s touching it it s going to be successful now a certain number of people have stopped giving him a pass on things that probably should have been looked at a little more critically or acknowledged as potential downside the crisis in confidence in his leadership accelerated when musk began making changes to twitter to address his personal problems and concerns last week he reneged on a previous commitment to keep an account on twitter that published the location of his private jet which he held up as an example of his free speech principles after abruptly suspending elonjet he suspended journalists who tweeted about it drawing ire from both sides of the political spectrum he launched a poll which on friday again directed musk to allow them back on the site the people have spoken he tweeted musk jetted around the globe to qatar for the world cup final on sunday where he was spotted alongside former trump adviser jared kusher and qatari leaders that day twitter posted a new policy it was banning the promotion of outside social media sites on its platform including facebook instagram and trump backed truth social users would no longer be able to promote outside links to those sites and others including mastodon tribel post and nostr twitter said cross posting of content would be allowed but it would no longer permit free promotion the criticism was swift and even loyalists expressed concern musk apologized going forward there will be a vote for major policy changes he tweeted my apologies won t happen again then musk launched a new poll should i step down as head of twitter he wrote in a tweet i will abide by the results of this poll by monday morning the result was clear that musk should step down he went silent on the platform for much of the day one of his longer stretches as a prolific tweeter to his more than 120 million followers he responded to a few tweets later in the day calling the results into question on tuesday he said he would resign with caveats i will resign as ceo as soon as i find someone foolish enough to take the job he wrote in a tweet after that i will just run the software servers teams the washington post s gerrit de vynck and cat zakrzewski contributed to this report

bloomberg bloomberg for all the ink spilled over its horrors the 2022 stock market will go into the books as an undistinguished one in the history of bad years for traders who lived through it though certain things have made it feel worse than top line alone numbers justify a potential impediment to a quick recovery while the 25 peak to trough drop in the s p 500 ranks in the lower range of bear market wipeouts it took a particularly jagged route to get there at 2 3 days the average duration of declines is the worst since 1977 throw in three separate bounces of 10 or more and it was a market

king dollar is facing a revolt tired of a too strong and newly weaponized greenback some of the world s biggest economies are exploring ways to circumvent the u s currency smaller nations including at least a dozen in asia are also experimenting with de dollarization and corporates around the world are selling an unprecedented portion of their debt in local currencies wary of further dollar strength no one is saying the greenback will be dethroned anytime soon from its reign as the principal medium of exchange calls for peak dollar have many times proven premature but not too long ago it was almost unthinkable for countries to explore payment mechanisms that bypassed the u s currency or the swift network that underpins the global financial system now the sheer strength of the dollar its use under president joe biden to enforce sanctions on russia this year and new technological innovations are together encouraging nations to start chipping away at its hegemony treasury officials declined to comment on these developments this will simply intensify the efforts in russia and china to try to manage their part of the world economy without the dollar said paul tucker a former deputy governor of the bank of england in a bloomberg podcast writing in a newsletter last week john mauldin an investment strategist and president of millennium wave advisors with more than three decades of markets experience said the biden administration made an error in weaponizing the u s dollar and the global payment system that will force non u s investors and nations to diversify their holdings outside of the traditional safe haven of the u s said mauldin plans already underway in russia and china to promote their currencies for international payments including through the use of blockchain technologies accelerated rapidly after the invasion of ukraine russia for example began seeking remuneration for energy supplies in rubles soon the likes of bangladesh kazakhstan and laos were also stepping up negotiations with china to boost their use of the yuan india began talking up more loudly the internationalization of the rupee and just this month started securing a bilateral payment mechanism with the united arab emirates progress however appears to be slow yuan accounts haven t gained traction in bangladesh for example due to the nation s wide trade deficit with china bangladesh has tried to pursue de dollarization in trade with china but the flow is almost one sided said salim afzal shawon head of research at dhaka based brac epl stock brokerage ltd a major driver of those plans was the move by the u s and europe to cut off russia from the global financial messaging system known as swift the action described as a financial nuclear weapon by the french left most major russian banks estranged from a network that facilitates tens of millions of transactions every day forcing them to lean on their own much smaller version instead that had two implications first the u s sanctions on russia stoked concern that the dollar could more permanently become an overt political tool a concern shared especially by china but also beyond beijing and moscow india for example has been developing its own homegrown payments system that would partly mimic swift second the u s decision to use the currency as part of a more aggressive form of economic statecraft puts extra pressure on economies in asia to choose sides without any alternative payments system they d run the risk of being compelled into compliance with or enforcement of sanctions they may not agree with and losing out on trade with key partners the complicating factor in this cycle is the wave of sanctions and seizures on u s d holdings said taimur baig managing director and chief economist at dbs group research in singapore given this backdrop regional steps to reduce u s d reliance are unsurprising just as officials across asia are loath to pick a winner in u s china tussles and would prefer to keep relations with both the u s penalties on russia are pushing governments to go their own way sometimes the action takes a political or nationalist tone including resentment of western pressure to adopt sanctions on russia moscow looked to convince india to use an alternative system to keep transactions moving myanmar s junta spokesman said the dollar was being used to to bully smaller nations and southeast asian countries pointed to the episode as a reason to trade more in local currencies sanctions make it more difficult by design for countries and companies to remain neutral in geopolitical confrontations said jonathan wood head of global risk analysis at control risks countries will continue to weigh economic and strategic relationships companies are caught more than ever in the crossfire and face ever more complex compliance obligations and other conflicting pressures it s not just the sanctions helping to accelerate the de dollarization trend the u s currency s rampant gains have also made asian officials more aggressive in their attempts at diversification the dollar has strengthened about 7 this year on track for its biggest annual advance since 2015 according to a bloomberg index of the dollar the gauge reached a record high in september as dollar appreciation sent everything from the british pound to the indian rupee to historic lows the dollar s strength is a huge headache for asian nations who ve seen prices of food purchases soar debt repayment burdens worsen and poverty deepen sri lanka is a case in point defaulting on its dollar debt for the first time ever as a soaring greenback crippled the nation s ability to pay up vietnamese officials at one point blamed dollar appreciation for fuel supply struggles hence moves such as india s deal with the uae which accelerates a long running campaign to transact more in the rupee and to set up trade settlement agreements that bypass the u s currency meanwhile dollar denominated bond sales by non financial companies have dropped to a record low 37 of the global total in 2022 they ve accounted for more than 50 of debt sold in any one year on several occasions in the past decade while all these measures may have a limited market impact short term the end result may be an eventual weakening of demand for the dollar the canadian dollar and chinese yuan s shares of all currency trades for instance are already slowly edging higher technological progress is another factor facilitating efforts at moving away from the greenback several economies are chipping away at dollar use as a by product of efforts to build new payment networks a campaign that pre dates the surging greenback malaysia indonesia singapore and thailand have set up systems for transactions between each another in their local currencies rather than the dollar taiwanese can pay with a qr code system that s linked with japan all in the efforts are driving momentum further away from a west led system that s been the bedrock for global finance for more than half a century what s emerging is a three tier structure with the dollar still very much on top but increasing bilateral payment routes and alternative spheres such as the yuan that seek to seize on any potential u s overreach and for all the agitation and action afoot it s unlikely the dollar s dominant position will be challenged anytime soon the strength and size of the u s economy remains unchallenged treasuries are still one of the safest ways to store capital and the dollar makes up the lion s share of foreign exchange reserves the renminbi s share of all foreign exchange trades for example may have climbed to 7 but the dollar still makes up one side of 88 of such transactions it s very hard to compete on the fiat front we have the russians doing that by forcing the use of rubles and there s wariness with the yuan as well said george boubouras three decade markets veteran and head of research at hedge fund k2 asset management in melbourne at the end of the day investors still prefer liquid assets and in this sense nothing can replace the dollar nevertheless the combination of moves away from the dollar are a challenge to what then french finance minister valéry giscard d estaing famously described as the exorbitant privilege enjoyed by the u s the term which he coined in the 1960s describes how the greenback s hegemony shields the u s from exchange rate risk and projects the nation s economic might and they may ultimately test the entire bretton woods model a system that established the dollar as a leader in the monetary order which was negotiated at a hotel in a sleepy new hampshire town at the close of world war ii the latest efforts do indicate that the global trade and settlement platform that we ve been using for decades may be beginning to fracture said homin lee asia macro strategist at lombard odier in hong kong whose firm oversees the equivalent of 66 billion this entire network that was born out of the bretton woods system the eurodollar market in the 1970s and then the financial deregulation and the floating rates regime in the 1980s this platform that we have developed so far may be beginning to shift in a more fundamental sense lee said the net result king dollar may still reign supreme for decades to come but the building momentum for transactions in alternate currencies shows no sign of slowing particularly if geopolitical wild cards continue to convince officials to go their own way and the u s government s willingness to use its currency in geopolitical fights could ironically weaken its ability to pursue such methods as effectively in the future the war in ukraine and the sanctions on russia will provide a very valuable lesson indonesian finance minister sri mulyani indrawati said last month at the bloomberg ceo forum on the sidelines of the g 20 meetings in bali many countries feel they can do transactions directly bilaterally using their local currencies which i think is good for the world to have a much more balanced use of currencies and payment systems bloomberg s shruti srivastava sudhi ranjan sen adrija

new delhi dec 25 chinese officials estimate about 250 million people 18 per cent of the population were infected with covid 19 in the first 20 days of december as beijing abruptly dismantled restrictions that had contained the disease for almost three years the estimates including 37 million people 2 6 per cent of the population who were infected on tuesday alone were revealed by sun yang deputy director of the chinese center for disease control and prevention in a wednesday health briefing said two people familiar with the matter sun said that the rate of covid s spread in the country was still rising and estimated that more than half of the population in beijing and sichuan were already infected the people briefed on the meeting said financial times reported the explosion in cases followed beijing s decision this month to abandon its zero covid policy which kept the virus at bay through mass testing mandatory quarantine and draconian lockdowns sun s figures which were provided in a closed door meeting contrast with data put out by the national health commission which reported 62 592 symptomatic covid cases over the same period last week china stopped publicly trying to tally the total number of infections after authorities curtailed covid testing the lack of information made public by china on its covid wave has led washington and the world health organization to push beijing to be more transparent about case counts disease severity hospital admission figures and other health statistics that have been made widely available by other countries financial times reported in china s capital and other cities the wave of covid infections has overwhelmed hospitals with an influx of elderly bedridden patients and left emergency rooms and intensive care units with fewer available beds the nhc s official account of the wednesday event provided little detail on what the country s top health officials discussed but in the meeting ma xiaowei director of the nhc demanded hospitals sort out their overflowing emergency rooms and move patients into inpatient departments said one of the people who participated in the meeting he also urged midsize and large hospitals to take in more patients with severe symptoms and promised regulators would not hold them accountable for rising fatality rates financial times reported fever medicine in short supply hospitals and emergency services swamped an acute blood shortage in many cities the death toll soaring among the elderly and morgues and funeral parlours overwhelmed with bodies in a word china is woefully under prepared for the chaos that is inevitably unfolding since the controls were lifted as seen in other countries wang xiangwei wrote in south china morning post there are similar horror stories all over chinese social media one influencer has started a daily death count highlighting that prominent peking university professors in their late 70s and early 80s have been dying at an abnormal rate the scmp article said as has been widely reported china did an about face on its zero covid policy lifting almost all controls because of mass protests in late november but the protests were just the trigger the underlying issue is that china s leaders have finally comprehended the magnitude of the devastating impact of the policy on the economy the acute shortage of fever medicine is also a situation of beijing s own making strict rules have for the past three years discouraged people from buying such medicine over the counter with the aim of sending anyone infected with the virus to quarantine facilities and makeshift hospitals that has meant that all pharmacies across the country have limited stocks of fever medicine and pharmaceutical firms had significantly curtailed their production of it now the authorities have asked them to ramp up production around the clock scmp reported additionally since medical resources were directed into mass testing and quarantine three years ago hospitals around the country simply don t have enough icu beds and equipment to cope with the surging coronavirus cases moreover hospitals are in dire need of qualified and trained doctors and nurses to work in those icus the authorities are now stepping up training and recruiting icu doctors and nurses but this takes time which they don t have at this critical moment the report said now as an unprecedented wave of infections rips through china its state media is deliberately ignoring scenes of crowded hospital wards and packed crematoriums unfolding at home while officials insist that by the government s own count few people are dying of covid cnn reported for nearly three years china s hardline zero covid policy shielded its population from the kind of mass deaths that haunted western nations a contrast repeatedly driven home by the communist party to illustrate the supposed superiority of its rule but as china abruptly abandoned that strategy with little warning or apparent preparation the prospect of surging deaths projected by some studies to be as high as one million has become a thorny issue for a government that staked its legitimacy on saving lives cnn reported officially china reported only eight covid deaths this month a strikingly low figure given the rapid spread of the virus and the relatively low vaccine booster rates among the vulnerable elderly the official tally has been met with disbelief and ridicule online where posts mourning loved ones dying of covid abound caixin a chinese financial magazine known for its investigative pieces reported on the deaths of two veteran state media journalists infected with covid on days the official toll stood at zero cnn reported nearly 37 million people in china may have been infected with covid 19 on a single day this week according to estimates from the government s top health authority making the country s outbreak by far the world s largest bloomberg reported as many as 248 million people or nearly 18 per cent of the population likely contracted the virus in the first 20 days of december according to minutes from an internal meeting of china s national health commission held on wednesday confirmed with people involved in the discussions if accurate the infection rate would dwarf the previous daily record of about 4 million set in january 2022 bloomberg reported chinese officials and companies are letting covid positive people return to work in a bid to keep the economy running despite a massive covid surge that could be as large as a million cases a day fortune reported officials in zhejiang province announced over the weekend that those who test positive for covid could go to work so long as they showed no symptoms then on monday chongqing one of china s largest cities and a major manufacturing hub went one step further by allowing those with mild symptoms to return to the office without testing a day later city officials in beijing said that covid positive patients in home isolation could return to work without needing to test so long as they did not have a fever previously a negative test was required to leave home isolation fortune reported directives from chinese government officials that allow people to go work sick represent a major change in tone from just weeks ago when beijing was still wedded to a tough policy of lockdowns and mass testing to completely suppress covid outbreaks now as china rapidly eases its covid controls officials are trying to reassure ordinary chinese worried about a rapid surge in cases factories are also trying to prepare their workforces for a covid wave on december 12 qin lihong president of electric car maker nio told reporters that the company had sent trucks of medicines and equipment to the factory to be well prepared some manufacturers are using closed loop systems where workers live on site with strict movement controls in order to keep infections out companies like tesla used these systems to keep factory lines running during earlier covid outbreaks and lockdowns fortune reported sanjeev sharma can be reached at sanjeev s ians in latest updates on coronavirus covid 19

the padres and angels are both seeking starting pitching with the two sides showing interest in top remaining free agent starter nathan eovaldi according to rob bradford of weei bradford adds that one other unnamed al east team is interested in eovaldi meanwhile robert murray of fansided reports that the padres are also among the teams strongly in the mix for free agent johnny cueto the angels have a fairly solid five man rotation on paper but since shohei ohtani s been around they ve tended to opt for a six man rotation as such the addition of eovaldi to stabilize the rotation makes plenty of sense ohtani and tyler anderson look set to occupy the first two spots in their rotation with reid detmers patrick sandoval and jose suarez rounding out the five that young trio has shown plenty of promise and the addition of a veteran like eovaldi would give them a very formidable group of starters to go into the 2023 season with even if they don t wind up signing eovaldi the halos are keen to add more pitching per rhett bollinger of mlb com and certainly could make a play for some of the other remaining options on the market for the padres they currently have joe musgrove yu darvish and blake snell locked in to three spots in their rotation they ve indicated that they plan to start nick martinez and new signing seth lugo in their rotation in 2023 which would make the need for a starter less obvious however lugo has been far more effective as a reliever over his career and hasn t made a start since 2020 while martinez only made ten last year so there s a little bit of uncertainty there as for the unnamed al east team the yankees would appear an unlikely suitor given their needs in left field and recent signing of carlos rodon while the blue jays signed chris bassitt and don t seem to be focused on the rotation hitters appear to be more of a pressing need for the rays who signed zach eflin earlier in the off season and have the makings of a strong rotation as things stand that leaves the orioles who have been vocal about wanting to add starting pitching this winter and a return to the red sox who have an uncertain rotation picture as the obvious options bradford s report does note that the red sox do not appear to be the front runner for eovaldi although that doesn t preclude them from being the al east team interested with most of the starting pitchers off the board eovaldi is the top remaining option mlbtr ranked him as the 23rd best free agent this winter and predicted a two year 34m contract he s shown tremendous consistency over the past three years in boston pitching to eras of 3 72 3 75 and 3 87 over 340 innings shoulder and back issues restricted him to 109 1 3 innings in 2022 but he s been a dependable starter when fit in 2022 he struck out batters at slightly above average 22 4 clip against a walk rate of 4 4 the red sox did offer eovaldi a qualifying offer at the end of the season so any team outside of boston that signed him would be giving up draft picks the padres already forfeited their second and fifth highest picks in the 2023 draft as well as 1m in international bonus money for signing xander bogaerts so if they added eovaldi they d be giving up their third and sixth highest picks in the draft as well the angels would have to forfeit their second highest pick as well as take a 500k hit in international bonus money in san diego s case it would seem to make it more likely they d go after someone like cueto who wouldn t require any draft pick forfeiture of course the padres are squarely in win now mode and may view draft picks as a necessary cost to put their team over the top but given eovaldi will surely command a multi year deal with a strong aav as well as the draft pick forfeiture and their less obvious need for rotation help it d be a surprise if they won a bidding war for the veteran s services instead cueto could make a lot of sense to deepen their starting pitching stocks cueto 37 in february tossed 158 1 3 innings of 3 35 era ball for the white sox in 2022 his best season since finishing sixth in nl cy young voting for the giants back in 2016 while his strikeout rate was the worst of his 15 year big league career cueto offset that by posting a strong 5 1 walk rate and keeping the ball in the park far more often that came after posting a 4 59 era over 194 innings over the previous three seasons it seems likely cueto will land a one year deal which could help the padres as a means to insure them against lugo and or martinez needing to be moved back to the bullpen he also brings a wealth of experience and won a world series with kansas city in 2015 that could well appeal to a san diego team determined to take the next step and win a championship

seventy years ago in the coastal mountains of norway near the town of sandnes kids would gather on sunday afternoons in march and april to ski to a peak overlooking the north sea once there they could rest on bare rocks and soak up the sun free from farm chores and with the darkest days of winter behind them best of all they would return to class monday morning with sun tans that was the thing said odd osland an elite amateur cross country skier who has lived in minnesota for most of the past 50 years at 81 the retired manufacturing engineer continues to impress others with his trademark kindness and relentless skiing again this winter he is returning to the starting lines of races in the united states canada and europe with amazing consistency he wins medals and trophies from races in his age group dominate the kitchen in his apple valley townhome last winter for instance he returned with four medals from the masters world cup cross country skiing championships in canmore alberta in march he ll travel to seefeld austria for the same event in a few weeks he ll compete in the sisu ski fest in ironwood mich in minnesota and wisconsin he treats as holy days the city of lakes loppet and the american birkebeiner i ll keep racing until i m 90 and then reassess osland said that is his stock answer to a question he fields endlessly another common question he gets how do you pronounce your first name that s my american problem he said i usually tell people to say ode but in norway it s pronounced just like it s spelled hence his personalized minnesota license plate declares im odd he has a wry sense of humor inside the twin cities cross country skiing community osland is known for more than his longevity in racing and strict discipline in training in a stack of papers on his kitchen table last week there was a handwritten note from someone at the loppet foundation it said odd you are actually the greatest thank you for being a rock for the loppet and the entire ski community you are amazing he has volunteered time and given money to the loppet an outdoors oriented community building organization based in golden valley for him personal interaction is the lifeblood of skiing after so many years it becomes like a family osland said the people are amazing when giving advice to new skiers of any age he ll bypass talk about the addictive atmosphere around racing and the self sacrifice required to win his core teaching about the sport is to find joy in it be persistent and enjoy winter by being outside with your friends he once wrote in a published essay as we age we face different challenges that may sideline us from time to time don t give up keep a positive attitude and remember how much fun it is to ski making a new home osland grew up the oldest of six children on a family farm about 30 miles south of stavanger a seaport since birth and still today he has battled a rare bone disorder known as mccune albright syndrome it caused lasting instability in his left femur requiring him to wear a brace and to undergo surgeries when it broke i was a weakling he said of his youth looking back that s probably what motivated me to take on the physical challenges of skiing but that didn t happen until he settled in america his three sisters and two brothers still live in scandinavia where brother per osland teaches theoretical particle physics at the university of bergen odd said he felt a calling to leave the country in his late 20s after listening to elders talk about friends and family members who struck it rich in the land of opportunity his arrival in 1970 was in cooperstown n d a tiny community northwest of fargo where cousins offered him a job on their farm a downturn in the family business left him looking for new work eventually punching a clock at a north dakota factory that made field plows it was the start of a long career in manufacturing including stops at minneapolis based graco and a stint making medical grade compressors and vacuum pumps in northbrook ill after five years in the greater chicago area osland returned to the twin cities with enough experience to work as a product designer and engineer he won a job at 3m that lasted 25 years he never obtained a college degree but he took engineering classes along the way i had a good feel for what machinery could do and how to make it he said ski racing for osland started in 1990 when he entered his first american birkebeiner in hayward wis with friends he got to know bjorn lasserud an accomplished racer and trained with him for nearly 20 years as a regular participant in the loppet nordic racing lnr training program osland also raced on loppet teams starting in 2008 he entered his first master s world cup race in mccall idaho i m not the fastest skier in my age class in the world circuit but fast enough that i m usually picked to participate on the usa age class relay teams he once said in a skiing interview i m content with that just being a part of the excitement of competing and to be with fit and like minded people jo ann wittman a close friend of osland said it s difficult for him to dwell on specific skiing accomplishments you have to pull things out of him she said he never says anything about himself according to an old magazine clipping osland finished first in his age class in the birkebeiner in both 2012 and 2013 after placing second on three separate occasions he said he likes to push himself and experience the result of it one of his skiing heroes is norwegian cross country legend oddvar bra revered in his country for overcoming a broken ski pole during a sprint to the finish line at the 1982 world championships in oslo bra was known as a man of the people who pushed himself to such extremes during races that he would hallucinate the point was not to endure the agony he would say but to enjoy it wittman sees a trace of that in osland who has suffered frostbite on his face more than once during training runs he ll say in a way it s a good thing takes off some dead skin she said but wittman said osland who has dual citizenship in the u s and norway also has a softer side he s an amateur photographer who has won ribbons in local competitions and is renowned among friends for his bread baking hobby cranberry wheat bread is one of his favorites osland and his ex wife carol raised four children tragedy struck their family in october 1997 when their only daughter kari died at age 16 in a car crash in apple valley she was a cheerleader at eastview high school she was my best friend osland said to stay fit during summers osland rides his bike and works out on roller skis he idolizes olympic gold medalist jessie diggins of afton and met her father on roller skiing training runs on the gateway state trail in washington county formerly a regular on the cross county trails at theodore wirth park in minneapolis he now bases his winter skiing at hyland hills ski area in bloomington and terrace oaks park in burnsville he s in it for the long haul even though his doctor recently ordered heart monitoring for episodes of atrial fibrillation i ve noticed it yes and they will look at all that osland said basically i think i m ok

illustrated in this article which mentions the recession in 1970 73 80 90 01 and 08 were all proceeded by an inverted yield curve the yield curve did also invert in 1966 but it was not followed by a recession on average the yield curve is a good predictor of a recession a good way to look at interest rates is as a trade off for taking the risk of lending funds to a third party if the situation becomes riskier company is too leveraged or economy is about to crash the result is the same lenders require a greater reward for the risk they take as you can see from the curve illustrated in the graph above lenders see much greater risk in the short term vs the long term durable goods orders despite inflation durable goods orders were able to rise 1 in october 2022 as you can see from the graph below they have been generally positive in 2022 durable goods are those big ticket items that require a lot of labor to produce they include items like cars home appliances furniture heavy equipment and so on trading economics growing demand for durable goods is a good indicator of business confidence the more durable goods that are purchased the more business labor needed to produce those products this leading indicator is positive but may not be enough to offset the other leading indicators stock market the s p 500 has not had a good 2022 it went down from 4766 at the end of 2021 to 4019 as of dec 13 2022 ytd the s p 500 is down 15 you can see from the graph that it was not a smooth ride down the stock market tried to recover 3 times but just could not sustain it s not surprising that we have had a roller coaster of a year every week new material information hits the market inflation jobs numbers cuts to gas production and frequent war news from ukraine s p 500 seeking alpha keep in mind what the stock market is itâ s a grouping of companies and their valuations these valuations are derived from investors portfolio managers and hedge fund managers that spend all day researching companies to predict future earnings and growth rates a decline in the stock market logically means investors are seeing red flags on the horizon this leading indicator is negative manufacturing jobs an important component of employment is the manufacturing jobs you can see from the table below that the multiplier effect from manufacturing jobs is large basically the multiplier is how many spin off jobs one particular job supports durable and non durable goods manufacturing is quite high at 7x and 5x respectively economic policy institute we have been getting more signals from the federal reserve that rates are going up and will not be coming down soon the adp november jobs report published this nov 30 reports that overall 127 000 jobs were added in november those extra jobs were also accompanied with wage growth so we are in a situation where we keep adding jobs and higher wages in one area but at the same time manufacturing jobs are decreasing this robust jobs report only strengthens the case that interest rates will go up and keep pushing us closer to a recession the adp jobs report states 127 000 jobs were added to the usa economy in november of those jobs goods producing industries accounted for 16 000 in natural resource and mining 2000 in construction and unfortunately 100 000 in manufacturer the graph below shows the declining trend in new jobs filled over the last year non farm payroll growth statista building permits the real estate market is an important signal of business and consumer confidence when consumers businesses or investors feel confident in the direction of the economy they feel secure enough to make or finance large scale investments the more investments that are made not only affect the construction industry but banking as well building permits issued are a great way to gauge the demand for construction labor 6 to 9 months ahead falling demand for new homes also indicates a weakness in the resale market affecting commissions and profits of many real estate firms and salespeople we can see from the chart below that the real estate market is still heading down the number of permits still continues to fall housing permits issued united states census bureau the conference board leading economic index there are many good leading economic indicators unless you want to track each one of them yourself the conference board has three great indexes that track leading coincidence and lagging indicators all of these can be used but i prefer to look at the leading indicator this is a powerful indicator of where the economy will likely go history has shown that the leading economic index predicts corrections in the business cycle by roughly 7 months the index is composed of various leading indicators average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance manufacturersâ new orders for consumer goods and materials ism index of new orders manufacturersâ new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft orders building permits for new private housing units s p 500 index of stock prices leading credit index interest rate spread 10 year treasury bonds less federal funds rate average consumer expectations for business conditions conference board currently the index is down 3 2 percent over the last 6 months â the us lei fell for an eighth consecutive month suggesting the economy is possibly in a recession â said ataman ozyildirim senior director economics at the conference board as you can see from the graph above the index has been successful at predicting upcoming recessions as of recently we have crossed into recession territory where to invest so where do we invest in these difficult times there are traditional thoughts on investing during recessions to investment defensive stocks stocks that have a small beta a stock with a beta of 1 moves exactly with the market so if the market goes down 2 so does the stock with a beta of 1 if a stock has a beta of 0 5 and the market goes down 2 then the stock with a beta of 0 5 only goes down by 1 this works in the opposite direction as well so if we predict that the market is going down do we really want to invest in a stock that we know will not go down as much as the market but will still go down you can see from the graph below that all sectors other than energy have gone down during the last year s downturn although i like the performance of the energy sector recently i try to stay away since globally governments have made traditional energy companies public enemy number one globally traditional energy companies have been targeted with stricter regulations denied permits to drill or stopped from expanding pipelines now with healthy profits in energy progressive representatives talk about â excess profitâ taxes in my eyes traditional energy companies canâ t win in the long run yardeni iâ ve looked for companies that have grown their revenue and earnings consistently over the last few years if these consistent growers did take a hit to their revenue or earnings during covid i would want to see a quick turnaround and continued growth up to this point i also want to look for small companies that may have been overlooked by the majority of investors while a lot of stocks have been falling in the last year these stocks are still increasing in value the following 2 stocks have been able to weather the covid recession making me confident in investing in them for the upcoming recession i would also like stocks that are not similar to each other i looked for stocks in very different industries and sectors so where are the opportunities enphase energy enph zacks com data by ycharts established in 2006 enphase energy is a technology company headquartered in california

expansion of military capabilities by japan would have been unheard of just a few years back but this is the global reality we find ourselves in right now closer to home the new york times has reported â the prospect of growing military threats from both china and russia is driving bipartisan support for a surge in pentagon spendingâ the increased spending and the need to replenish

it s been a pretty good few decades for america s top tech ceos as their supposed brilliance turned them into billionaire oligarchs with cultlike followings but in 2022 things suddenly looked a bit bleaker mark zuckerberg s meta and jeff bezos s amazon reportedly cut thousands of workers elon musk once hailed as a genius has revealed a truly impressive level of incompetence at twitter elizabeth holmes was sentenced to more than a decade in prison and then there s sam bankman fried who recently became a household name for disastrous reasons in a year of nightmarish tech industry headlines an important question remains which delusional egomaniac had it worst here are the results of our investigation mark zuckerberg year in review the one time boy genius isn t looking like such a wunderkind these days in late 2021 mark zuckerberg announced facebook wasn t dystopian enough for him the company was changing its name to meta and running full speed into the metaverse an imaginary goggle dependent world where until recently people had no legs a year later while zuck has kept screaming about virtual reality meta s fortunes have plummeted in february zuck s company made history for the wrong reasons its stock price dropped by 230bn 190bn in a day a national record nine short months later zuckerberg told employees he d misjudged the fickle winds of business i got this wrong and i take responsibility for that in an admirable demonstration of such personal accountability he fired 11 000 other people february also saw meta s first drop in users and indeed opening facebook in recent years has felt like visiting the ruins of pompeii elements of a once thriving society remain perfectly preserved all but forgotten as time marches relentlessly on tiktok tiktok the bottom line yes zuck lost 30bn 25bn on that fateful february day but he might just be able to squeak by on the 44 5bn 36bn he s still got terrible year score 6 10 jeff bezos year in review zuck was far from the only tech boss to see his workforce shrink this year amazon also announced layoffs with the new york times reporting 10 000 jobs could be cut meanwhile perhaps unhappy that his ex wife was making headlines for huge charitable donations while he maintains a reputation as dr evil s closest real life analogue bezos showed up on cnn to tell everyone that he would give away the majority of his then 124bn 103bn net worth during his lifetime imagine living on less than 62bn 51bn it s a win win for bezos an apparently selfless gesture that will presumably have no discernible impact on his life one of those generous donations 100m 83m 08 of his wealth to dolly parton to donate as she pleases giving your money to the world s most beloved country star is the kind of under the radar move that says i m doing this to heal the world not to heal my image it s not the only time bezos threw himself at a universally adored celebrity this year when he flew into space in a rocket shaped like a penis he brought along captain kirk himself william shatner unfortunately for bez rather than singing the praises of space shatner later said the trip felt like a funeral comparing the vicious coldness above with the warm nurturing of earth below not an ideal advertisement for bezos s bid to colonize the galaxy in fact he s struggling to colonize your living room his own employees recently told insider that alexa the company s voice assistant was a colossal failure of imagination bezos s pet project is being gutted the bottom line a series of embarrassments haven t knocked bezos off his perch as one of the richest men in the world terrible year score 4 10 elon musk year in review in april the world s then richest man who has repeatedly demonstrated that he doesn t understand the relationship between words actions and consequences made an offer to buy twitter at 54 20 44 89 a share which you ll surely agree is hilarious because it has the number 420 in it and elon likes weed because he s a cool guy when it started to look like the sale might really happen musk decided that actually maybe he didn t want the site after all but the company wouldn t let him off the hook and after a legal battle he finally went through with the purchase leading to another of his hilarious jokes he carried an entire sink into the company building apparently risking a hernia so he could tweet let that sink in that serious and thoughtful attitude has defined his tenure at twitter so far in a bid to create a twitter 2 0 that no one asked for he has erased thousands of jobs made up new rules and then canceled them demanded that employees be extremely hardcore which may explain the beds at the office reinstated the likes of marjorie taylor greene and roger stone tried to reinstate donald trump reinstated kanye west then banned him again and banned then reinstated journalists the mayhem has shattered his reputation on the left but on the far right the cult around him seems only to be getting stronger the level headed folks over at qanon apparently now see him as one of them he topped off the year by taking a highly scientific poll of users to see if he should quit as ceo they said yes let that sink in the bottom line from the outside it looks like a catastrophe but musk shows every sign of enjoying himself terrible year score 7 10 parag agrawal year in review at the beginning of the year the future looked bright for parag agrawal he d just become twitter s new ceo after receiving the board s unanimous support then came musk though the two had a cordial relationship at first it quickly deteriorated as they clashed over musk s purchase of the platform when musk wanted to investigate the extent of twitter s bot problem agrawal explained in detail why the plan wouldn t work in another example of consummate professionalism musk then age 50 replied with an emoji depicting fecal matter musk finally followed through on his twitter purchase in october he immediately fired agrawal the bottom line agrawal lost his job but thus far he shows no clear indication of being evil and his exit may have earned him 50m 41m terrible year score 7 10 elizabeth holmes year in review 2022 was the year that the long theranos disaster finally came to a head it all started in 2003 when elizabeth holmes founded the company the next year she dropped out of stanford like so many other young students she was chasing a dream a dream to pretend to invent a really cool technology and make a billion dollars off it but almost 20 years after she founded the company holmes began this year with a conviction for defrauding investors over her company s supposedly revolutionary blood testing system maybe it really was about the friends she made along the way those include senator cory booker one of more than 130 people to send letters of support for holmes before her sentencing she s also developed a diehard fan club with supporters showing up at the trial in full holmes costume still she ended the year with an 11 year sentence so she s a shoo in for worst year right sam bankman fried year in review wrong because there s sam bankman fried who swooped in at the end of 2022 in a strong last ditch effort to claim the title his cryptocurrency exchange ftx was on top of the world a few short months ago running ads during the super bowl and proudly displaying its name on the miami heat s arena but by november the company had collapsed a few weeks later bankman fried had been arrested in the bahamas and charged with what a prosecutor called one of the biggest financial frauds in american history it was an unbelievable turn of events what could be a sounder investment than a company built on a thing few understand while others worship it with bizarre fanaticism at least bankman fried like zuckerberg is taking full responsibility i fucked up said the 30 year old who had allegedly used an encrypted group chat that was literally called wirefraud the bottom line it s hard to say whether holmes or bankman fried has had a worse year but the fact that there s any competition tells you plenty about tech and obscene wealth terrible year score 10 10 for both

here are the highlights of events related to the war in ukraine over the past 24 hours putin russia is ready to negotiate on ukraine but kyiv and its western backers refuse russia is ready to negotiate with all parties involved in the war in ukraine but kyiv and its western backers refuse to participate in talks said russian president vladimir putin in an interview broadcast today reuters reported the russian invasion of ukraine on february 24 of this year sparked europe s deadliest conflict since world war ii and is the biggest confrontation between moscow and the west since the 1962 cuban missile crisis the agency noted and so far the end of the current conflict is not in sight the kremlin says it will fight until it achieves all its goals while kyiv has said it will not rest until it expels every single russian soldier from its territory including crimea which russia annexed in 2014 we are ready to negotiate with anyone on acceptable terms but it depends on them we do not refuse to negotiate they refuse putin said in an interview with russia 1 tv cia chief william burns said earlier this month that most conflicts end with negotiations but the agency s assessment is that russia is not yet serious about genuine negotiations to end the war an adviser to the ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky meanwhile said today that putin needs to come back to reality and admit that it is russia that does not want any negotiations russia unilaterally attacked ukraine and killed its people russia does not want negotiations but is trying to escape responsibility mykhailo podoliak wrote on twitter putin said russia was acting in the right direction in ukraine as the west led by the united states sought to tear russia apart washington denies that it aims for the collapse of russia i think we are acting in the right direction we are protecting our national interests the interests of our citizens our people and we have no choice but to protect our citizens the russian president said asked if the geopolitical conflict with the west was approaching dangerous levels putin replied i don t think it s too dangerous putin said the west had started the conflict in ukraine in 2014 by ousting the pro russian president during massive protests soon after russia annexed crimea from ukraine and russian backed separatist forces began fighting ukrainian armed forces in eastern ukraine in fact the fundamental thing here is the policy of our geopolitical opponents which aims to tear apart russia historical russia putin said the pope denounced the war in his traditional vatican mass pope francis denounced the wars that are being waged around the world during his traditional christmas eve liturgy in st peter s basilica which is also the first of his christmas services dpa reported the people of the world who are hungry for power and money devour even their neighbors their brothers and sisters how many wars there are and in how many places today dignity and freedom are still being trampled the holy father was outraged although not to specifically name russia s war against ukraine notes bta st peter s basilica was packed during the service for the first time since the pandemic began with 7 000 guests attending and another 3 000 following outside from st peter s square pope francis called the weak and the poor the main victims of human greed and this christmas humanity insatiably pursuing money power and pleasure does not make room for the little ones for the many unborn poor forgotten people just as it was with jesus i think especially of the children who are swallowed up from war poverty and injustice the holy father also said the pope presided over the mass but mostly served it from a seated position at the altar because of the condition of his knee he noted that jesus was born without luxuries and comforts but thanks to this the real richness of life came to light namely interpersonal relationships of course it is not easy to leave the comfortable warmth of worldly life to enter the harsh beauty of the bethlehem cave francis said but we must remember that without the poor there is no real christmas even without them we celebrate christmas but not the christmas of jesus he added brothers sisters at christmas god is poor let charity flourish again urged the holy father zelensky on the eve of christmas slavery has an even higher price than freedom freedom comes at a high price but slavery comes at an even higher price said ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky in a defiant speech late saturday he called on his people to resist russian attacks as they celebrate christmas the bbc reported russia s missile and drone attacks have left millions of ukrainians without electricity heating and running water on december 24 russian airstrikes killed 10 people in the southern city of kherson ukrainian authorities said 68 people were injured and urged local residents to urgently donate blood describing russia

bodies and burning cars saying the world needs to see and understand what absolute evil we are fighting against kherson the only regional capital captured by russia since it launched its full scale invasion on february 24 was liberated from ukraine last month since then it has been frequently attacked by russian forces stationed on the east bank of the dnieper river the kremlin has repeatedly denied that its attacks were aimed at civilians however russian president vladimir putin recently admitted that russian forces had struck energy facilities important to ukraine three ukrainians died during mine clearing operations in the kherson region three ukrainian emergency services workers were killed yesterday in a mine explosion while demining parts of the kherson region reuters reported

explosives experts have been working there since then after president volodymyr zelensky said russian forces had detonated much of the buildings and sites there they have done this in many other areas that ukraine has been able to recapture according to reuters the us state department estimated in early december that about 100 000 square miles 160 000 square kilometers of ukrainian land needed to be screened for explosive hazards this is almost half the area of germany reuters compares we expect this to be one of the largest challenges with available landmines and unexploded ordnance since world war ii the state department said in a briefing posted on its website on saturday ukrainian authorities said a russian strike in the city of kherson killed at least 10 people and moscow blamed ukrainian forces for the attack reuters recalls russian political scientist we will go to war with kazakhstan russia will go to war with kazakhstan this was predicted by the russian political scientist yevgeny satanovsky during an appearance on the state television russia 1 we don t even mention the military biological laboratories in ukraine which are more than enough and where americans englishmen and germans work we also forget about the laboratories in kazakhstan i used to laugh at this idea kazakhstan and america how military labs however satanovsky not only convinced himself that there are laboratories supported by the west in the central asian country but also indicated their exact number two therefore in my opinion there will certainly be a clash with kazakhstan assured the expert there are american biolabs in kazakhstan that we forgot about pic twitter com scmyvsocz9 anton gerashchenko gerashchenko_en december 23 2022 for the second month in a row a russian specialist

kovalenko of course this was not enough for the russians they also destroyed the company s vineyards and much of the company s real estate in addition a significant portion of the company s real estate and vineyards have been destroyed as a result of the hostilities he added kovalenko said that russian military personnel are still occasionally on the premises of the enterprise this allowed the armed forces of ukraine to recently strike effectively against them according to him it is currently impossible to calculate the damage to the enterprise but it is tens and hundreds of millions of hryvnias it s not going to be easy to restore all this what is it like for alcohol to sit for 25 30 35 years in warehouses it can t be measured simply in money because it s a damage of such a technological nature and it s much more difficult because it takes time and considerable time notes kovalenko china s foreign minister signaled deepening ties with russia chinese foreign minister wang yi today defended his country s position on the war in ukraine and signaled that china will deepen ties with russia next year the associated press reported wang speaking via video link at a conference in the chinese capital also blamed america for the deterioration of relations between the world s two largest economies saying china firmly rejects the wrong policy of the united states toward china beijing has hit back at western pressure on trade technology human rights and its claims to a vast swath of the western pacific accusing the us of bullying china s refusal to condemn the invasion of ukraine and join other countries in imposing sanctions on russia has further soured ties with washington and fueled a nascent rift with much of europe wang said china will deepen strategic mutual trust and mutually beneficial cooperation with russia regarding the ukraine crisis we consistently uphold the basic principles of objectivity and impartiality without favoring one side or the other without adding fuel to the fire much less seeking selfish benefits from the situation the chinese foreign minister said at the same time wang yi said that china will seek to return relations with the us to normal saying that they have deteriorated because the united states stubbornly continues to view china as its main competitor and engage in a clear blockade suppression and provocations against china the eu has delivered 1 000 generators to ukraine the countries of the european union have already provided over 1000 power generators to ukraine this was announced on twitter by the eu commissioner for crisis management janez lenarcic according to him the program of the civil protection mechanism of the european union has already made it possible to deliver more than 78 thousand tons of such aid to the country according to him they are intended for residential homes and hospitals previously the united arab emirates announced that it was sending 2 500 generators with capacities from 3 5 to 8 kilowatts the first 1 200 of which will be sent through warsaw today the rest in january ukraine is in urgent need of generators due to the heavy damage russian strikes have

year the sudden and unexpected scarcity of a com modity whose abundance had previ ously been taken for granted was a profound shock as the lines persisted the initial shock began to turn into anger and the anger was focused largely at the nation s oil producers the general public by and large was convinced that the shortages were a rtificial created by an oil oligopoly in collusion with the opec cartel in order to raise prices the rapid and significant price rises accompanying the gas lines senred to further fuel public suspicions as did the loosening of supplies which occured a s prices approached the level of 1 per gallon indicate that the public was half right to a large degree the shortages were artificially created but not by the oil com panies the real culprit was the complex set of regulations promulgated by the depart m ent of energy for the allocation of petroleum supplies moreover other actions by doe seem destined to insure that there will be widespread shortages of diesel fuel in agricultural regions during peak harvest periods and short ages of heating oil in har s hest part of the winter worse yet all of this will be occuring at a time when the nation will be awash in middle distillatel according to one oil company official subsequent analyses of the situation many regions of the nation during the the tightenin g of supplies of middle distillate both for agricultural and home heating purposes can be directly linked to actions on the part of the department of energy further doe was at least partly aware of the possible consequences of its actions when it first co nsidered them late last spring a department of energy document dated june 6 1979 which was not released to the public stated diesel fuel needs for farm production range from a low of 3 percent of total demand 2 i in december and january to a peak of 15 percent in may peak occurs in september when the fall harvest is in full swing and diesel needs that month exceed 10 percent diesel require ments for spring planting summer irrigation and fall harvest conflict with the buildifg of middle distillate res e rves for the winter heating season it in other words the department of energy was aware that the pressures it was placing on refiners to retain supplies of middle distillate in primary storage could cause supply dislocations even as those pressures were being brought to bear while not formally allocating middle distillate supplies they were creating situations in which refiners would be forced to informally allocate them in spite of the fact that previous experience with price and allocation controls for gaso line had resulted in both higher prices and spot shortages another for the public the doe actions assure a winter of uncertainty should temperatures remain moderate it may be that supplies will be moved to the secondary and tertiary level before severe cold makes transport of large amounts of supply impossible finers are encouraged to begin shipments to oil jobbers and retail outl e ts immediately there may be adequate diesel on hand for the fall harvest of winter wheat on the other hand should doe remain adamant in its fixation to retain heating oil stocks in primary storage i e in the large tanks maintained by refiners at term i nals and other bulk storage facilities the present 16 million barrel shortfall at the local level where the end users are coutd expand to one amounting to as much as 40 million barrels temperatures of abnormal severity as have been experienced in some areas of the nation during the last two winters extensive unnecessary hardships would result additionally the retention of large stocks of middle distillate in primary storage could limit the build up of stocks of motor gasoline further aggravat ing w h at is alrgady forseen as a tight supply situation for the coming spring if re should a shortage of this magnitude coincide with the effect of the department of energy consultations with the 32 major refiners of middle distillate which took place early thi s spring was to create a itphantom allocation1 system through coercion refiners were presented with theoretical inventory and production plans and told in essence that should they not comply with the department s informal mandate formal refinery yield o rders could be issued the department was under considerable pressure to act the iranian oil fields had been shut down by supporters of the ayatollah khomeini our nation had just experienced an exceptionally severe winter and motor gasoline consumption w as unexpectedly high these pressures do not explain why however the department choose to ignore the evidence from its previous 1 internal department memorandum middle distillate situation june 6 2 house small business committee subcommittee on antit rust 3 petroleum industry research foundation 19 79 it experience with gasoline 3 price and allocation controls which clearly demonstrated tha such controls simply do not work and that the only way to insure adequate supplies 0f a producg would be to a llow the market to function as freely as possible moreover there is also the unanswered question of why the depart ment chose to ignore its own internal assessment of the price and allocation controls on gasoline in making its decision the experience wi th controls on gasoline as noted the only experience comparable to the present market intervention of the department of energy in middle distil late supplies is the experience over the last six years with gasoline price and allocation controls since the re is pressure mounting to impose similar controls on middle distillate it is perhaps particularly appropriate to examine just what the effect of the controls on gasoline was price and allocation controls were imposed on our nation s suppliers by the man datory petroleum price and allocation regula tions 10 cfr sections 211 and 212 under those rules the much and to whom gasoline could be sold was controlled internal doe memorandum notes the regulations freeze supplier price at which gasoline could be sold at all levels and how an aurchaser relationshias as of a 1972 monthlv base neriod recruir lng suppliers to meet the demands of their dase perioa customers the 1972 supplier purchaser relationships are thus essentially given administrative longevi ty even if a 1972 transaction was a one time only spot purchass it has been given the effect of an indefinite term contract il a similar freeze is in place regard ing the price relationships which were in effect at the time the regulations were promulga ted they are in essence geared to the market which existed on may 15 19 73 it would seem obvious that the creation of such an arbitrary and rigid framework within which to conduct the voluminous transactions normally associated with the market for gasol ine would of necessity result in the propagation of numerous and severe market imperfections of these perhaps the most onerous is that the regulations which were intended to reduce the cost of gasoline at the retail level actually resulted in higher co sts impact of the price and allocation regulations of the supplier purchaser freeze and effective elimination of competitive allocation of supply is increased costs to consumers the regulations foster inefficient allocation of resources and have arbitrar ily slowed the evolution of market trends towards according to the department of energy assessment of the the net result 4 5 department of energy office of competition memorandum on gasoline deregu lation department of energy office of competition memora ndum on the effects of the petroleum price and allocation regulations 4 i fewer and higher volume retail outlets many inefficient marketers have been protected bg the regulations at the possible expense of efficient marketers in other words the normal c ompetition on price and the normal improvements in marketing which would have resulted in savings to consumers have been hampered by regulations promulgated purportedly to insure consumers the lowest possible price overlook level and nature of investment in refining facilities to the department of energy s office of competition this inability to earn coupled with fixed profit margins acts as a disincentive to needed capital investment although consumer demand for unleaded and high octane gasoline has gre a tly increased in the past few triggered normal price and investment changes made investments in unleaded gasoline production facilities sufficient to meet increased demand because price controls prevent the profjtability 03 that product from rising with t h e changing demand i there is a certain irony in this which is difficult to the regulations have also had considerable impact on the according an adequate return on new capital investment years and continues to increase that increased demand has not i re f iners have not since the environmental protection agency has mandated the use of unleaded fuel in vehicles manufactured in the united states and for most vehicles imported into this country future demand for unleaded fuel will continue to rise gasoline a ccounted for only 13 percent of total gasoline demand in the united states by 1981 it is expected that the share of total gasoline demand accounted for by unleaded fuels will rise to 57 percent should the present situation persist and controls on moto r gasoline continue the disincentives for capital invest ment in facilities to produce this type of fuel will also continue this could mean sharply rising levels of ref ned products in addition to our normal imports of crude oil adjustment of refiners i margins on unleaded fuel address the long range problem the dffice of competition memorandum notes the defects in these kinds of regulations cannot be cured by amending them it is always possible to ascribe some perversity or market distor tion to a part icular regulation or to the fact that it appears to be out of date but this is misleading if a moving part of a machine is clamped and the machine fails to operate properly it may always appear that its performance could be improved by altering the po sition of the clamp the mgre fundamental fact that the clamp should not be there at all in 1975 unleaded nor would some this is true but it obscures ibid doe memorandum on gasoline deregulation doe memorandum on gasoline deregulation 6 7 8 petroleum res earch institute inc 9 5 regulations do truly function like a clamp a clamp on innovation on efficiency and on investment they need not be pervasive in order to do harm in fact placing controls on even one point in the marketplace causes distortio n s elsewhere so that controls must be continually added and amended without hope of full160rrection or of catching up to the dynamic in the market place in this rush to catch up there is a constant shifting of burdens subsidies and penalties which make s rational plan ning virtually impossible firms trying to function in a regula ted market need to spend inordinate time and energy attempting to anticipate what the regulator s next move will be instead of following matket trends in addition to divertin g resources it creates an atmosphere of uncertainty which inhibits the dynamic forceful action a truly competitive market requires the doe analysis of gasoline regulation noted instead of encouraging experimentation in new marketing techniques the doe we ll as retard the diffusion of the innovation itself most at odds with the competitive process the allocation controls have protected many inefficient firms that would not have survived in an uncontrolled market the need and even opportunity to bargain f or supply has been eliminated to a large extent the allocation controls together with the price controls have arbitrarily placed some firms iflvery favorable circumstances and others in untenable situations it is exactly this problem which is now develop i ng with regard to middle distillate regulations penalize the experimenter in out of pocket dollars as tee genesis of the phantom allocation to fully appreciate how an incipient shortage of middle distillates can exist in the face bf apparently abundant s u pply it is necessary to probe the events and circumstances influencing energy policy early this year to a large degree it is the responses to those events coupled with the natural tendency of bureaucracies to follow previous patterns in the search for s olutions to current problems which have given rise to this apparent paradox near panic the first effects of the shutdown of the iranian oil fields were beginning to make themselves felt in an increasing shortage of light crude at the same time a combin a tion of unusually cold weather during the first quarter of the year and unexpectedly high demand for gasoline had operated to cause a drawdown of distillate stocks to a level around 18 percent below the same period for the previous year gasoline demand had remained high and stocks dropped to extremely low levels during by april of 1979 u s energy planners were in a state of 10 ibid 11 ibid 6 late 19 78 in early 1979 refiners were producing proportion ately more gasoline and less distillate than they normally would have to rebuild stocks and cope with record demand as a result less distillate than normal was produced summer seasonal peak in demand for gasoline with its concurrent higher production of that fuel feared that the production of middle distillates would be inadequate to meet the winter s heating oil needs should this winter prove to be as harsh as the previous two have been as a result there was a general feeling that some sort of action was necessary department was coming under increasing pressure from both the public and the congress as the result of the lengthening lines at our nation s service stations the growing sense of urgency coupled with increasing pressure resulted in the department callin g together representatives of the nation s 32 largest refiners in may of 1979 energy department planners anticipating the advent of the at the same time the the 32 refiners consulted by the department of energy accounted for some 80 percent of the nation s distillate pro duction according to their own figures consultations was to convince these companies to increase their production of middle distillates and to retain that production in primary storage facilities with capacities of 50 000 barrels or more ultimate goal was to have at least 240 million barrels of middle distillates in place in primary storage by october 1 1979 later that date was pushed to october 31 that only twice in the last five years has there been such a large amount of distillate i n storage during this time period doe had each of the 32 refiners meet with representatives of the energy regulatory agency it is significant that this parti cular entity was chosen as that agency also has the power under the emergency petroleum allocati on act to mandate refinery yields the meetings therefore carried the implicit threat that sh ould the refiners not comply voluntarily the agency could force them to do so to quote from the doe account of the meetings doe discussed with each refiner a theoretical plan by which the industry as a whole and each refiner could reach the aggregate goal of 240 million barrels in the doe theoretical plan each refiner was asked to compare doe s theoretical plan with its own production and inventory plans th e inventory for each refiner was placed at nine percent above the refiner s october 1 1978 inventory level nine percent is the amount by which the entire industry would have to increase inventory levels above last year s ofzober 1 level in order to reach the 240 million barrel target the purpose of the primary storage is generally defined as their it should be noted 12 doe memorandum on middle distillates i 7 how it was that the department arrived at the nine percent figure has yet to be determined howe v er the refiners took the doe theoretical plan s goal as an informal mandate with the threat of a formal mandate lurking in the background by the doe but not made public the department noted that a number of extraordinary steps would have to be taken by refiners in order to meet their storage quotas including i some refiners indicated that they would take steps to build inventories by allocating product suppliers are also changing traditional supply arrangements with wholesalers and bulk terminal opera t ors not offering summer fill programs and withdrawing from some marketing areas to allow the buildup of distillate inventories it is in these actions that the genesis of our current problem is found i in an assessment of the middle distillate situation p repared 11 13 as inventories in primary storage began to swell they did so to a significant extent at the expense of secondary and terti ary storage secondary storage is that at the level of dealer or jobber and tertiary storage is at the end user leve l 1 e the homeowner or farmer an overview of the present situation indi cates that the problem may be far more serious than is realized the national oil jobbers council conducted a survey of its members to determine what the level of their stocks was as of june 1 19 79 the results of the survey were startling they indicated that there was severe shortfall of middle distillates at the secondary and tertiary levels specifically dealers tanks which represented 47 million barrels of storage capacity were 29 percent full on june 1 1979 as compared with being 48 percent full on june 1 19 78 their customers tanks which represent 79 million barrels of storage capacity were 51 percent full on june 1 1979 as compared with their being 60 percent ful l on june 1 1978 in a follow up survey conducted on the basis of of a more limited sample it was indicated that on september 1 1979 dealers tanks were 27 percent full as compared with their being 63 percent full on the same date in 1978 and customer s tanks were 46 percent full as compared with 76 percent the previous year committee s subcommittee on antitrust the aggregate shortfall at the secotgary and tertiary level could be as much as 40 million barrels in a memorandum to the chairman the com mittee staff states iithis shortfall at the local levels may equal as much as 21 percent 9s the total national stock held in primary inventory according to projections prepared by the house small business 13 ibid 14 house small business committee subco m mittee on antitrust 15 doe memorandum on gasoline deregulation a a in essence what has occured is that the department of energy in its zeal to insure that it could prove that the nation had enough middle distillate to provide for the winter s needs mand a ted that the fuel be kept in the only facilities it keeps records on primary storage tanks the trouble is that these are not the facilities closest to the customer the secondary and tertiary levels are but the department does not monitor storage at th e se levels as a result their policy has given rise to the paradoxical situation of having enough distillate but having it in the wrong place or precisely the type of problem which devel oped with gasoline allocation in that instance the doe s policies m anaged to turn a 5 percent crude oil shortage into a 25 percent to 30 percent shortage at the pumps in some areas the need for action as the winter months approach the need for positive action to alleviate the situation becomes increasingly urgent in se v eral fanning regions of the nation where the winter wheat harvest season begins on october 1 there is already a serious shortage of diesel fuel in regions where fuel oil is principally moved by barge supplies must frequently be in place by the end of o ctober because after that time rivers freeze over and there is no way to move adequate supplies of fuel in by land the longer the fuel oil sits in tanks in primary storage the more its price will rise to the customer there is already some sympathy in t h e congress for a plan to place a freeze on the price of home heating oil has nothing to do with the market but rather is a direct result of the policies of the department of energy should the price rise much further the temptation to reimpose price and allocation controls may become overwhelming further even though the increase in its price yet another problem which could surface as a result of the doe policy is a further aggravation of what already appears to be a tight supply situation for gasoline in the corning spring to the extent that storage capacity at refineries is filled with middle distillate gasoline stocks cannot be built up the early winter months are the time when this traditionally takes place should refiners be unable to move supples of distillate to the secondary and tertiary level until later than usual it may inhibit their ability to refine gasoline due to a lack of storage capacity this presents the unpleasant prospect of repeating the very problems which we experienced this sp ring and summer with gas lines and spot shortages worse yet as refiners moved to attempt to make up for lost time in refining gasoline yet another distillate shortage could develop in 19 80 our nation could very well find itself lurching from a shortag e of gasoline to a shortage of diesel and heating oil and back again repeatedly due solely to a misguided and ill advised policy of attempting to regulate a market which is best left unregulated tion agrees what is at issue is the inference that is drawn from those claims namely that regulation has succeeded in counter acting or of fsetting competitive problems existing in the market the doe office of competi9 not only is this inference not correct but it can be shown in almost every arising from case t hat regulation has

baghdad ap everything from the signboard outside down to the napkins bears the official emblem of the top international coffee chain but in baghdad looks are deceiving the starbucks in the iraqi capital is unlicensed real starbucks merchandise is imported from neighboring countries to stock the three cafes in the city but all are operating illegally starbucks filed a lawsuit in an attempt to shut down the trademark violation but the case was halted after the owner allegedly threatened lawyers hired by the coffee house be careful he told them and boasted of ties to militias and powerful political figures according to u s officials and iraqi legal sources i am a businessman amin makhsusi the owner of the fake branches said in a rare interview in september he denied making the threats i had this ambition to open starbucks in iraq after his requests to obtain a license from starbucks official agent in the middle east were denied i decided to do it anyway and bear the consequences in october he said he sold the business the cafes continued to operate starbucks is evaluating next steps a spokesman wrote wednesday in response to a request for comment by the associated press we have an obligation to protect our intellectual property from infringement to retain our exclusive rights to it the starbucks saga is just one example of what u s officials and companies believe is a growing problem iraq has emerged as a hub for trademark violation and piracy that cuts across sectors from retail to broadcasting and pharmaceuticals regulation is weak they say while perpetrators of intellectual property violations can continue doing business largely because they enjoy cover by powerful groups counterfeiting is compromising well known brands costing companies billions in lost revenue and even putting lives at risk according to businesses affected by the violations and u s officials following their cases qatari broadcaster bein estimated it has lost 1 2 billion to piracy in the region and said more than a third of all internet piracy of bein channels originated from companies based in northern iraq the complaint was part of a a public submission this year to the u s special 301 report which publicly lists countries that do not provide adequate ip rights iraq is seeking foreign investment away from its oil based economy and intellectual property will likely take center stage in negotiations with companies yet working to enforce laws and clamp down on the vast web of violations has historically been derailed by more urgent developments in the crisis hit country or thwarted by well connected business people as iraq endeavors to diversify its economy beyond the energy sector and attract foreign investment in knowledge based sectors it is critical that companies know their patents and intellectual property will be respected and protected by the government said steve lutes vice president of middle east affairs at the u s chamber of commerce makhsusi insists he tried the legal route but was denied a license from starbucks regional agent based in kuwait he also said he attempted to reach starbucks through contacts in the united states but these were also unsuccessful he depicts his decision to open a branch anyway as a triumph over adversity cups stir sticks and other merchandise are obtained in turkey and europe using his contacts he said the coffee everything is authentic starbucks makhususi added makhsusi said he had a session with a lawyer in baghdad to come to an understanding with the coffee company but so far we have not reached a solution the law firm recounts a different version of events confidentiality agreements prevent the firm from divulging details of the case to third parties but the ap spoke to three iraqi legal sources close to the case they spoke on condition of anonymity in order to provide details they also asked the name of the firm not be mentioned for security reasons they said that in early 2020 the firm was hired by starbucks and sent a cease and desist notice to makhsusi they said the businessman then told one of the lawyers on the case that he ought to be careful warning that he had backing from a prominent iranian backed armed group and support from iraqi political parties they decided it was too risky and they stopped the case the iraqi legal source said makhsusi denied that he threatened starbucks lawyers makhsusi said doing business in iraq requires good relations with armed groups the bulk of whom are part of the official state security apparatus i have friendly relations with everyone in iraq including the armed factions he said i am a working man i need these relationships to avoid problems especially given that the situation in iraq is not stable for business he did not name particular armed groups he was in contact with the ap contacted two groups known to have business dealings in the areas where the cafes are located and both said they had not worked with makhsusi counterfeiters and pirates have stepped up activity in iraq in the past five years particularly as gulf countries have responded to u s pressure and become more stringent regulators said a u s official in the state department speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about the trends the broadcaster bein has sent cease and desist letters to earthlink iraq s largest internet service provider earthlink offers subscribers a free streaming service shabakaty which bein alleges is composed almost entirely of pirated content iraq s communications ministry which partners with earthlink did not respond to a request for comment it s unheard of and completely outrageous said cameron andrews director of bein s anti piracy department it s a huge market so it s a great deal of commercial loss but the larger issue for bein is the piracy that originates inside iraq and bleeds into the rest of the region and the world he said after being copied by these companies bein s channels are re streamed on pirate iptv services and become accessible all over the region according to bein the company s investigation found that some iraqi operators even distribute pirated content in the u s at least two u s pharmaceutical companies have approached the u s chamber of commerce with complaints that their trademark was being used to sell counterfeit life saving medication by iraqi companies i worry if regulatory lapses or infringements in ip protection are allowed then u s companies will be deterred from doing business in iraq and quality of care could be dangerously jeopardized for iraqi patients said lutes the companies did not accept to be named in this report or detail the types of medications successive iraqi governments promised to fight graft since the 2003 u s led invasion reset iraq s political order but none has taken serious steps to dismantle the vast internal machinery that enables state sanctioned corruption intellectual property has also historically been a low priority for iraq limited bilateral talks with the u s over the issue have been on and off for the past five years the challenge is to find a clear leader in the iraqi

str afp via getty images bilateral payments huge headache valuable lesson tired of a too strong and newly weaponized greenback some of the world s biggest economies are exploring ways to circumvent the us currency smaller nations including at least a dozen in asia are also experimenting with de dollarization and corporates around the world are selling an unprecedented portion of their debt in local currencies wary of further dollar strength no one is saying the greenback will be dethroned anytime soon from its reign as the principal medium of exchange calls for peak dollar have many times proven premature butnow the sheer strength of the dollar its use under president joe biden to enforce treasury officials declined to comment on these developments in a bloomberg podcast writing in a newsletter last week john mauldin an investment strategist and president of millennium wave advisors with more than three decades of markets experience said the biden administration made an error in weaponizing the us dollar and the global payment system that will force non us investors and nations to diversify their holdings outside of the traditional safe haven of the us said mauldin plans already underway in russia and china to promote their currencies for international payments including through the use of blockchain technologies accelerated rapidly after the invasion of ukraine soon the likes ofprogress however appears to be slow yuan accounts haven t gained traction in bangladesh for example due to the nation s wide trade deficit with china bangladesh has tried to pursue de dollarization in trade with china but the flow is almost one sided said salim afzal shawon head of research at dhaka based brac epl stock brokerage ltd a major driver of those plans was the move by the us and europe to cut off russia from the global financial messaging system known as swift the action described as a financial nuclear weapon by the french left most major russian banks estranged from a network that facilitates tens of millions of transactions every day forcing them to lean on their own much smaller version instead that had two implications first the us sanctions on russia stoked concern that the dollar could more permanently become an overt political tool a concern shared especially by china but also beyond beijing and moscow second the us decision to use the currency as part of a more aggressive form of economic statecraft puts extra pressure on economies in asia to choose sides without any alternative payments system they d run the risk of being compelled into compliance with or enforcement of sanctions they may not agree with and losing out on trade with key partners the complicating factor in this cycle issaid taimur baig managing director and chief economist at dbs group research in singapore just as officials across asia are loath to pick a winner in us china tussles and would prefer to keep relations with both the sometimes the action takes a political or nationalist tone including resentment of western pressure to adopt sanctions on russia moscow looked to convince india to use an alternative system to keep transactions moving sanctions make it more difficult by design for countries and companies to remain neutral in geopolitical confrontations said jonathan wood head of global risk analysis at control risks countries will continue to weigh economic and strategic relationships companies are caught more than ever in the crossfire and face ever more complex compliance obligations and other conflicting pressures it s not just the sanctions helping to accelerate the de dollarization trend the us currency s rampant gains have also made asian officials more aggressive in their attempts at diversification the dollar has strengthened about 7 this year on track for its biggest annual advance since 2015 according to a bloomberg index of the dollar the gauge reached a record high in september as dollar appreciation sent everything from the british pound to the indian rupee to historic lows the dollar s strength is a huge headache for asian nations who ve seen prices of food purchases soar debt repayment burdens worsen and poverty deepen sri lanka is a case in point defaulting on its dollar debt for the first time ever as a soaring greenback crippled the nation s ability to pay up vietnamese officials at one point blamed dollar appreciation for fuel supply struggles hence moves such as india s deal with the uae which accelerates a long running campaign to transact more in the rupee and to set up trade settlement agreements that bypass the us currency meanwhile dollar denominated bond sales by non financial companies have dropped to a record low 37 of the global total in 2022 they ve accounted for more than 50 of debt sold in any one year on several occasions in the past decade while all these measures may have a limited market impact short term the end result may be an eventual weakening of demand for the dollar thetechnological progress is another factor facilitating efforts at moving away from the greenback several economies are chipping away at dollar use as a by product of efforts to build new payment networks a campaign that pre dates the surging greenback all in the efforts are driving momentum further away from what s emerging is a three tier structure with the dollar still very much on top but increasing bilateral payment routes and alternative spheres such as the yuan that seek to seize on any potential us overreach and for all the agitation and action afoot it s unlikely the dollar s dominant position will be challenged anytime soon the strength and size of the us economy remains unchallenged treasuries are still one of the safest ways to store capital and the dollar makes up the lion s share of foreign exchange reserves the renminbi s share of all foreign exchange trades for example may have climbed to 7 but the dollar still makes up one side of 88 of such transactions it s very hard to compete on the fiat front we have the russians doing that by forcing the use of rubles and there s wariness with the yuan as well said george boubouras three decade markets veteran and head of research at hedge fund k2 asset management in melbourne at the end of the day investors still prefer liquid assets and in this sense nothing can replace the dollar nevertheless the combination of moves away from the dollar are a challenge to what then french finance minister valéry giscard d estaing famously described asand they may ultimately test the entire bretton woods model a system that established the dollar as a leader in the monetary order which was negotiated at a hotel in a sleepy new hampshire town at the close of world war ii the latest efforts do indicate that the global trade and settlement platform that we ve been using for decades may be beginning to fracture said homin lee asia macro strategist at lombard odier in hong kong whose firm oversees the equivalent of 66 billion this entire network that was born out of the bretton woods system the eurodollar market in the 1970s and then the financial deregulation and the floating rates regime in the 1980s this platform that we have developed so far may be beginning to shift in a more fundamental sense lee said the net result king dollar may still reign supreme for decades to come but the building momentum for particularly if geopolitical wild cards continue to convince officials to go their own way to pursue such methods as effectively in the future the war in ukraine and the sanctions on russia will provide a very valuable lesson indonesian finance minister sri mulyani indrawati said last month at the bloomberg ceo forum on the sidelines of the g 20 meetings in bali many countries feel they can do transactions directly bilaterally using their local currencies which i think

because of the war in ukraine american hunters and shooters will probably see a shortage of ammunition and reloading components in 2023 an article thursday in the wall street journal titled europe is rushing arms to ukraine but running out of ammo hinted at what s coming the war in ukraine is for lack of a better term a major driver for the arms and ammo market europe is ukraine s main provider but supplying ukrainian ammo consumption translates into shortages for nato countries they need to replenish their ammo stocks in preparation for potential expansion of russian aggression as has occurred many times in the recent past resupplying nato and keeping the ukraine military armed will consume the world s supply of brass lead propellants and primers for as long as hostilities last meanwhile the branches of the u s military the u s government s paramilitary law enforcement arms state and local law enforcement must be constantly resupplied as well little will be available for hunting and recreational shooting ammo and components will be scarce for as long as this particular market fluctuation persists the article focused on the use and subsequent shortage of artillery ammunition and missiles however the article also noted that ukraine uses up to 40 000 artillery shells of the nato caliber 155 mm each month while the entire annual production of such projectiles in europe is around 300 000 according to michal strnad owner of czechoslovak group as a czech company that produces around 30 of europe s output of such munitions even if the war were to stop overnight europe would need up to 15 years to resupply its stocks at current production rates strnad said we recommend getting everything you need now because it probably won t be available in the summer creedmoor update last week we covered a shooting session with two rifles chambered in 6 5 creedmoor lisa saldivar and i managed a couple of fine shots at 200 yards with a particular reload featuring a 129 gr hornady sst bullet on thursday shooting with her husband near her home in houston texas saldivar reported superb results at 300 yards using hornady superperformance ammo featuring 120 gr sst bullets i suspected our rifles probably liked lighter bullets judging by their improved performance when we dropped from 147 gr hornady match bullets to 129 gr hornady sst hornady s eld m bullet reportedly has the best ballistic coefficient on the market but that does not necessarily mean that a particular rifle will shoot it well another issue is speed loading judiciously i could only wring about 2 450 feet per second from the 147 gr eld loads and only about 2 600 fps from the 129 gr sst loads the 120 gr sst loads list a muzzle velocity of 3 050 feet for long range shooting there is no substitute for speed the less time a bullet is in flight means a straighter more level path to the target now my assignment is to create handloads that duplicate the performance of the factory loads saldivar did some sleuthing and learned that hornady uses a blend of hornady superperformance powder and something else saldivar asked if i could experiment with some powder blends uh no i do some stuff that drives hardcore gun nuts crazy around here but i do not blend powders i said if you can find me a published load from hornady or another reputable source i ll do it but no way i m going to experiment with it why she asked because i ve lived this long despite myself i replied blending powders will probably finish me off stay tuned we re working on it
the future isn t dictated by the past but there are lessons to be learned by looking back there s a lot of pessimism among investors as we approach another new year 2022 brought the first sustained bear market in more than a decade inflation remains at the highest level in 40 years big companies are laying off workers consumers are pinching their pennies but an old saying comes to mind it s always darkest before the dawn even a cursory examination of the past shows that the stock market can quickly turn around is a bull market on the way in 2023 here s what history shows the bounce after bad year trend the s p 500 is on track to finish 2022 down close to 20 that has happened only six times since 1928 and in four of those cases the index delivered a return of more than 20 in the following year year s p 500 decline s p 500 change in the next year 1930 28 5 47 1 1931 47 1 15 2 1937 38 6 25 2 1974 29 7 31 6 2002 23 4 26 4 2008 38 5 23 5 note that the two exceptions when the s p actually declined during the year after closing down by at least 20 occurred during the early part of the great depression a lot has changed since then notably a huge increase in retail investors there s also a distinct bounce after bad year trend on an overall basis after the end of the great depression the s p 500 finished in negative territory 23 times between 1940 and 2021 in 19 cases the index was up the next year year s p 500 decline s p 500 change in the next year 1940 15 3 17 9 1941 17 9 12 4 1946 11 9 0 1 1948 0 7 10 3 1953 6 6 45 1957 14 3 38 1 1960 3 23 1 1962 11 8 18 9 1966 13 1 20 1 1969 11 4 0 1 1973 17 4 29 7 1974 29 7 31 6 1977 11 5 1 1 1981 9 7 14 8 1990 6 6 26 3 1994 1 5 34 1 2000 10 1 13 2001 13 23 4 2002 23 4 26 4 2008 38 5 23 5 2011 0 1 13 4 2015 0 7 9 5 2018 6 2 28 9 the average increase for the s p in the year after a decline is 12 8 in most cases the index went on a multi year run following a down year that was especially true during the great recession when the steep market decline lasted from late 2007 through mid 2009 stocks subsequently entered the longest bull market in history the year of a recession pattern speaking of recessions though there are widespread concerns that a recession could be on the way a whopping 98 of ceos surveyed recently by the conference board think that the u s economy will enter a recession within the next 12 to 18 months this pessimism isn t limited to top executives a bloomberg news survey conducted earlier in december found that four out of five economists expect a recession in 2023 or 2024 how has the stock market performed historically during recessions not good the following chart tells the story the periods when the u s economy was in a recession are shaded in gray the s p 500 fell during most recessions in some cases the decline was especially steep however stocks don t always sink during recessions for example the s p 500 rose during the recessions of 1980 and 1990 1991 a 2023 bull market so will there be a bull market in 2023 the historical precedents are unclear while it s true that the s p 500 does usually climb after experiencing a down year it doesn t always do so and if a recession is right around the corner the odds that the stock market will fall seem pretty high similarities between our current conditions and past periods exist for example the united states had high inflation in the 1970s and early 1980s but there are also factors in play in today s economy and the stock market that are different from those we ve seen in previous years the potential for a bull market in 2023 depends much more on how events next year unfold than on what has already happened bottom line the future isn t dictated by the past however a bull market will come sooner or later the present market decline could offer a big opportunity for patient investors
you can count on berkshire going shopping again in 2023 these two stocks should be at the top of buffett s list through the first three quarters of 2022 warren buffett s berkshire hathaway has bought 19 stocks those range from surprise picks like taiwan semiconductor to upstream oil producer occidental petroleum which has become a buffett favorite while speculating about berkshire s buys in 2023 is just that speculation one can predict that buffett will go on offense in 2023 as berkshire has historically had its best outperformance during bear markets based on some of buffett s criteria for buying a stock here are two new names that would fit well with the berkshire portfolio 1 williams sonoma a retail bargain buffett is a well known fan of big brand stocks coca cola and apple are two of berkshire s biggest holdings the berkshire chief sees brand as a key component in an economic moat especially for consumer stocks and williams sonoma wsm 2 07 has one of the best brands in home furnishings the company dates back to 1956 and today has a sprawling home furnishings empire that includes pottery barn and west elm the company has also evolved with the times establishing a strong position in e commerce as roughly 70 of its revenue now comes through the digital channel williams sonoma s latest financial results offer another indicator of its economic moat the company reported an operating margin of 15 5 better than most of its peers and the company has continued to grow in a difficult environment for home furnishings stocks as comparable sales jumped 8 1 in the quarter berkshire already owns shares of rh the former restoration hardware which is another high end home furnishings stock that offers a similar value proposition to williams sonoma finally the retail stock s price is also likely to catch the eye of a value investor like buffett currently it trades at a price to earnings ratio of just 7 and the company has been aggressively buying back stock reducing its shares outstanding by 11 over the last year it also pays a dividend yield of 2 7 with its brand strength wide operating margins and great valuation williams sonoma would fit nicely into berkshire s portfolio in 2023 2 walt disney a timeless brand giant if you re looking for an economic moat it s hard to find a better one than walt disney s dis 0 82 the company has an unrivaled library of intellectual property spanning from disney animated classics to marvel and star wars and the disney brand has represented quality family entertainment for nearly a century it has a flywheel business model that allows it to leverage that intellectual property into movies tv shows live entertainment theme park rides and consumer products like toys buffett tends to prefer straightforward business models and disney s may have gotten a bit complicated it s in the middle of a transition from a linear tv business to a streaming one which adds some risk but berkshire already owns one of its peers paramount global the parent of paramount cbs and several cable networks berkshire began buying paramount stock in the first quarter some observers have speculated that berkshire bought paramount because it expects it to get acquired by a larger media company but it also could see opportunity in the streaming industry additionally buffett places high value on smart leadership and with bob iger back in the ceo chair it s hard to fault disney in that category iger has long been one of the most respected leaders in hollywood and he reinvented disney during his earlier stint running the company from 2005 to 2020 driving acquisitions of pixar star wars marvel and 21st century fox as well as launching the disney streaming service disney stock just touched a new 52 week low even as the company said that losses in its streaming business would begin to narrow after reaching 4 billion in its just ended fiscal year the company just launched the ad tier for disney and raised prices across the board for its streaming services which should help it reach its target of break even profits by fiscal 2024 meanwhile its theme parks continue to print cash and the rest of the business should generate solid margins in a healthy economy disney stock today offers a unique combination of a low price a wide economic moat an appealing growth opportunity in streaming and smart leadership all qualities that buffett looks for with those strengths the stock looks like just the type to gain the buffett stamp of approval
today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of gilead sciences inc nasdaq gild by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today s value one way to achieve this is by employing the discounted cash flow dcf model believe it or not it s not too difficult to follow as you ll see from our example we would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and like the dcf each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the simply wall st analysis model check out our latest analysis for gilead sciences the calculation we re using the 2 stage growth model which simply means we take in account two stages of company s growth in the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate to start off with we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows where possible we use analyst estimates but when these aren t available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow fcf from the last estimate or reported value we assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow over this period we do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years a dcf is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate 10 year free cash flow fcf estimate 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 levered fcf millions us 9 84b us 9 91b us 10 1b us 9 96b us 9 95b us 10 0b us 10 1b us 10

value which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period for a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country s gdp growth in this case we have used the 5 year average of the 10 year government bond yield 2 0 to estimate future growth in the same way as with the 10 year growth period we discount future cash flows to today s value using a cost of equity of 7 1 terminal value tv fcf 2032 1 g r g us 11b 1 2 0 7 1 2 0 us 210b present value of terminal value pvtv tv 1 r 10 us 210b 1 7 1 10 us 106b the total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value which results in the total equity value which in this case is us 176b to get the intrinsic value per share we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding compared to the current share price of us 84 8 the company appears quite undervalued at a 40 discount to where the stock price trades currently the assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation so it is better to view this as a rough estimate not precise down to the last cent dcf the assumptions the calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions the first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows you don t have to agree with these inputs i recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them the dcf also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry or a company s future capital requirements so it does not give a full picture of a company s potential performance given that we are looking at gilead sciences as potential shareholders the cost of equity is used as the discount rate rather than the cost of capital or weighted average cost of capital wacc which accounts for debt in this calculation we ve used 7 1 which is based on a levered beta of 0 920 beta is a measure of a stock s volatility compared to the market as a whole we get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies with an imposed limit between 0 8 and 2 0 which is a reasonable range for a stable business swot analysis for gilead sciences strength debt is well covered by earnings

next 3 years trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20 threat dividends are not covered by earnings annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the american market looking ahead whilst important the dcf calculation ideally won t be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company the dcf model is not a perfect stock valuation tool rather it should be seen as a guide to what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under overvalued if a company grows at a different rate or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply the output can look very

leaning short on the equity markets over concerns rising interest rates will further batter stocks i think the upside downside just doesn t make sense to me when i have so many central banks telling

jakarta indonesia indonesian president joko widodo has confirmed that an export ban on bauxite will begin in june the ban aims to encourage the development of indonesia s domestic aluminum processing industry as well as create local jobs rich in resources indonesia has surprised markets with its commodity export policies including bans on shipments of palm oil and coal of which indonesia is the world s largest exporter earlier this year it is also among the world s top suppliers of bauxite with china being the leading buyer the president popularly known as jokowi said the bauxite ban aims to replicate indonesia s success in developing its nickel processing capacity after halting exports of its raw form in january 2020 which attracted foreign investors mostly from china to build local smelters while it increased the value of indonesian exports it also led to a dispute at the world trade organization the government will remain consistent in implementing down streaming so the value add can be enjoyed domestically for the country s development and people s welfare widodo stressed before jakarta introduced a mineral export ban in 2014 which it lifted in 2017 china was the largest importer of indonesian bauxite the announcement by indonesia is not expected to have a significant impact on prices
if i told you that a group of really smart people on wall street were able to predict exactly how much money america s biggest companies would make a year from now you might think they could tell us where the stock market would go not so much last year wall street analysts the communicators in chief to the investor community for the likes of goldman sachs jpmorgan chase co and citigroup were collectively spot on in estimating corporate earnings for s p 500 companies the factset consensus prediction is for 221 a share this year exactly as predicted with the final quarter still based on estimates the miss of less than 1 is the smallest in percentage terms for estimates at the end of the year since 1995 data from refinitiv ibes show while the consensus has on average been out by more than 9 since then their success is rather spoiled by wall street s total failure to anticipate the bear market in stocks and bonds the disconnect is a reminder of the perils of forecasting markets you can be exactly right and dead wrong at the same time the reason strategists called the s p 500 so badly wrong was simple enough earnings the vital ingredient in the price to earnings ratio weren t the story this year bond yields were the federal reserve raised rates the 10 year treasury yield soared and the valuations investors put on those earnings were crushed the price part of the p e ratio plunged and wall street missed it the average forecast last december for this month s interest rate was just 0 5 according to consensus economics the fed this month raised rates to a range of 4 25 to 4 5 miss a change of this importance and there is little hope of getting anything else right few even called the direction of stocks correctly jpmorgan goldman sachs and citigroup were all bullish expecting the s p 500 to hit 5100 5050 and 4900 respectively bank of america s strategists were rightly bearish for the right reason predicting a rates shock but their 4600 target was a drop of just 3 from when they published their prediction the s p 500 closed on friday at 3844 82 down 19 for the year so far underlying all these errors and those from pretty much everyone else was the mistaken belief that inflation would quickly go away covid related supply chain problems would fade away they thought and falling inflation would allow the fed to raise rates gently sparing asset prices instead inflation spread to virtually all categories of goods and services worsened by the energy and food price spikes that followed russia s invasion of ukraine the fed always matters to stock and bond prices because it sets the return on the safest of assets overnight cash this year has been unusual in being quite so dependent on the fed however almost nothing else mattered as the central bank engaged in the biggest rate rises in a year since 1981 worse this was the pain trade the thing no one was ready for despite the obvious reasons for the fed to be more aggressive than it had signaled investors and strategists pointed out this danger but still didn t think it would happen for 2023 there is again strong consensus on the part of wall street stocks will be up but not much as earnings are weak citigroup bank of america and goldman sachs strategists all say the s p will end next year at 4000 as the u s goes through what citi calls the most widely anticipated recession in decades goldman thinks a recession is avoided but earnings go nowhere amid weak growth jpmorgan expects the s p to rise to 4200 but only after chaotic market falls force the fed to pivot away from tighter money the broad consensus is for a mild recession or very weak growth with the damage to earnings offset by a fed cutting rates by the end of the year this has created two pain trades that everyone knows are possible but few are prepared for first the recession may end up being much deeper and longer than expected slamming earnings and stocks even as the fed switches into reverse and cuts rates second the economy might boom despite the fed if inflation proves transitory something investors aren t prepared for in a rapidly growing economy without inflation stocks should do very well and bonds terribly worse still the consensus might be spot on for earnings for the economy or for rates but as in 2022 entirely fail to anticipate what stocks and bonds will do whatever your forecast think about how it is likely to be wrong because it probably will be this story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text

orkun saka associate professor of economics city university of london visiting fellow and research associate systemic risk centre london school of economics and political science and barry eichengreen professor of economics and political science at the university of california berkeley originally published at vox eu financial markets even more than other markets run on trust this column uses hand collected data on banks investments in european sovereign debt to show that trust importantly influences cross border investment banks acquire a unique corporate culture by adopting and synthesising the cultures of their employees as a result when residents of the countries where a bank operates have a high level of trust in residents of another country the bank is more likely to hold claims on that country this is the first evidence of the role of trust rooted in cultural stereotypes in bank lending to governments these considerations apply with special force to international investments and to investments in the bonds of foreign sovereigns in particular sovereign bonds are incomplete contracts as demonstrated by the history of default restructuring and repudiation multiple countries make for multiple courts with uncertain jurisdiction governments enjoy a degree of sovereign immunity casting doubt on the existence of a judicial solution to default such considerations heighten reliance on trust as an alternative to legal contract enforcement sovereign bonds tap into these cultural stereotypes in that they are directly associated with a national government and a nationality a bank level measure of trust in a new paper eichengreen and saka 2022 we use hand collected data on banks investments in european sovereign debt to show that trust has an economically important impact on cross border investments specifically when residents of the country or countries where a bank operates have a high level of trust in residents of another country the bank is more likely to hold claims on that other country to our knowledge this is the first evidence of the role of trust rooted in cultural stereotypes in bank lending to governments it is also the first evidence of the transmission of such cultural stereotypes via the operation of multinational bank branch networks previous studies e g guiso et al 2006 2009 have used aggregate survey data from eurobarometer to show that the volume of flows between pairs of countries is importantly affected by bilateral trust a limitation of such country level evidence is that average levels of trust are almost certainly correlated with unobserved characteristics of country pairs to rule out confounding factors we therefore develop a bank specific measure of trust for this purpose we model banks as hierarchies as illustrated by figure 1 strategic decisions such as whether or not a bank should invest in a country are generally taken at bank headquarters portfolio managers working in the headquarters country or elsewhere are then responsible for implementing those decisions because we are concerned with investment decisions undertaken by headquarters we focus our analysis on the extensive margin of sovereign exposures whether or not a bank invests in the bonds of a country as opposed to exactly how much it invests figure 1 banks as hierarchies notes this figure represents the mechanisms that link foreign bank branches to multinational banks sovereign exposures in eichengreen and saka 2022 given this framework cultural stereotypes in subsidiaries can shape the soft information that subordinates transmit up the hierarchy to headquarters where the broad parameters guiding portfolio investment decisions are set they can affect how that soft information is received by directors because the latter share the same stereotypes reflecting the extent to which banks hire and promote internally across borders such that the composition of bank boards and officers reflects the geography of the bank s branch network we provide empirical support for this framework by showing that multinational branch networks help predict the national composition of high level managerial teams at bank headquarters our central analysis focuses on banks with branches in multiple countries we assign to branches of a bank operating in a country that country s level of bilateral trust in other countries we aggregate this measure by calculating a weighted average where weights are the share of host country branches in the network of the bank we repeat this for each target country of potential investment across which a bank s bilateral trust differs our measure of trust is therefore specific to both the bank and the target country of potential investment leveraging this banks as hierarchies approach and focusing on multinational banks has advantages from the point of view of identification trust in a target country can differ across multinational banks headquartered in the same country insofar as they have branches in different foreign countries or in the same foreign countries but with different weights see figure 2 for an illustration by focusing on this within country pair variation we can rule out other omitted factors at the country pair level we can do so even when latent influences are time varying since our strictest specification includes country pair time dummies along with bank time and target country time fixed effects we consequently compare banks headquartered in the same country with respect to the same target country at the same point in time thereby ruling out all country level confounding factors figure 2 identification strategy at bank level notes this figure represents the identification strategy as described in section 4 of eichengreen and saka 2022 the persistence of cultural stereotypes we show that our bank level measure of trust predicts banks entry exit decisions vis a vis sovereign debt of a country a one standard deviation rise in bank level trust bias increases the probability of investing in a target country by 14 this is a large effect accounting for one third of the diversification gap i e 42 in banks sovereign exposures figure 3 shows that the effect is stable over a sample period spanning more than a decade it is not only statistically significant and economically important but also persistent over time figure 3 the impact of bank level trust bias over sub sample periods notes this figure shows estimates for the coefficient of bank level trust bias separately for 11 distinct sub sample periods dependent variable is a dummy indicating any positive exposure of a bank toward a target country at a point in time shaded areas indicate sub periods during which eba reported sovereign exposures based on regulatory finrep data that restrict the level of granularity disclosed in banks sovereign debt portfolios the specification is column 5 of table 3 in eichengreen and saka 2022 only the estimated coefficient on bank level trust bias is plotted confidence intervals are at 90 significance level source eba cebs eurobarometer and snl financial we show further that well diversified relatively sophisticated banks are less likely to lean on trust as a determinant of their sovereign lending moreover investments in target countries whose bonds are not frequently found in bank portfolios about which hard information may be relatively scant are more likely to be influenced by cultural stereotypes finally we find that the impact of trust is substantially higher for target countries experiencing a sovereign debt crisis when cultural stereotypes and thus the role of trust may become particularly salient our findings remain intact for alternative definitions of trust they are not driven by domestic exposures exchange rate fluctuations observations for relatively weak target countries in our setting greece ireland italy portugal and spain or banks headquartered there by flexibly controlling for the extent of branch penetration in the target country we show that cultural stereotypes based on the geography of bank branches are not picking up the information gathering role of branches by controlling for a weighted average set of characteristics at bank target country level we rule out the possibility that our bank level measure of trust is picking up other types of indirect financial informational or political linkages that may be operating via host countries finally using data from the european central bank s single supervisory mechanism ssm we show that our results are not driven by the heterogeneity in local supervision of these banks conclusion our findings have important implications for interpreting financial allocations because we are comparing banks from the same home country facing the same target country at the same point in time and because we are focusing on the sovereign debt markets where lender borrower interactions are not relational and default tends to be across the board trust differentials lead to inefficiency in our setting since trust induced changes in portfolio decisions have nothing to do with the fundamental risk of the target country but simply reflect cultural stereotypes they are likely to represent divergences from optimal portfolio allocations our results also have implications for how multilateral banks should think about the design of high level managerial teams responsible for their cross country investments in particular banks with branch networks that are geographically well diversified and whose management teams similarly are geographically well diversified are less likely to suffer from such biases for a bank with a well diversified branch network the biases transmitted by different national branches cancel out and hence tend to zero overall if cultural biases matter diversity in bank management brings in a more balanced view of the potential investments and consequently more efficient portfolio allocation
last week the texas senate committee on state affairs hosted hearings last week in marshall texas where they questioned representatives from financial firms blackrock iss and statestreet in an effort to combat e s g practices happening around the country a few months ago texas comptroller glenn hegar announced that texas would boycott 10 major financial firms including the four mentioned and almost 350 investments texas state funds were invested for texas this is the stateâ s pension funds and the permanent school fund the permanent school fund is one of the largest if not the largest school fund in the united states the financial firms listed were accused of boycotting the oil and gas industry by encouraging investment in esg funds that are anti oil and gas â texas and other republican led states are standing on the position that esg practices violate the fiduciary responsibility of these companies to grow the financial assets of their customers their argument is that esg funds will be placed over non esg funds that might be more profitable such as oil and gas they do not want their state funds to lose value to esg texasâ s biggest problem with companies promoting esg practices is that they will divest away from oil and gas the stateâ s largest economic power tool â additionally other states that promote natural gas and oil production are divesting away from esg the top major financial firms such as blackrock vanguard iss and statestreet have lost hundreds of billions from the divestment of these republican led states including florida â the texas committee claims that boycotting oil and natural gas the nationâ s largest sources of energy powering millions can threaten infrastructure and national security the state committee pointed out that if energy projects are not being built because they are not being invested in then it becomes more scarce energy prices go up other prices go up etc â the representatives across the different companies were clear that they do not force anyoneâ s investment representatives of these companies at the hearing informed that they only advise their clients on options and the risks involved in certain investments the representative from blackrock handling 8 trillion in assets pointed out that the firm has around 100 million invested in fossil fuels â what is environmental social governance esg focuses on a companyâ s social policies and environmental policies and allows investors to know what type of company theyâ re investing in â esg is a type of investing that measures a companyâ s sustainability with non financial factors such as the diversity of its board of directors executive pay lawsuits lobbying and political contributions â wrote the pittsburg post gazette some see esg as an excellent way for companies to take care of their employees and take good care of the climate and the community around them â the focus in this case is climate change the push for decarbonizing the planet by 2050 has grown popular in the western world and the financial firms represented at the hearing signed onto the net zero asset managers initiative for businesses to declare they are cutting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere however vanguard has recently pulled away from all that in response to pressure from the states â opponents point out that esg funds are more expensive and less financially rewarding and not all companies that follow them have good compliance with labor and environmental laws a report by the harvard business review and a report by the journal of finance show that esgâ funds do not outperform non esg funds they are more expensive and they do not provide a better return â although the highest rated funds in terms of sustainability certainly attracted more capital than the lowest rated funds none of the high sustainability funds outperformed any of the lowest rated funds said the harvard business review hbr â the review of accounting studies also shows that esg funds underperform non esg funds and are more expensive they additionally point out that esg funds do not actually have good compliance with environmental and labor laws esg stocks are more likely to disclose carbon emissions standards but at the same time have higher carbon emissions esg scores focus on esg disclosure and statements not company practice â â we show that esg scores are correlated with the quantity of voluntary esg related disclosures but not with firmsâ compliance records or actual levels of carbon emissions â wrote the review of accounting studies â finally esg funds appear to underperform financially relative to other funds within the same asset manager and year and to charge higher fees our findings suggest that socially responsible funds do not appear to follow through on proclamations of concerns for stakeholders â two researchers from the universities of northern iowa and south carolina show that when companies underperform they are more likely publicly discuss their esg initiatives when they overperform they rarely talk about them they do not have to keep up investment and public approval â collectively our findings suggest that the push for stakeholder focused objectives provides managers with a convenient excuse that reduces accountability for poor firm performance â
christmas is coming to death in paradise but that doesn t disrupt business as usual in saint marie a podcaster is murdered whilst investigating the disappearance of a child itâ s a case thatâ s haunted selwyn for many years and now neville and the team must lay its ghost to rest premier comms ralf little di neville parker how was returning to guadeloupe itâ s always exciting to be asked back the first christmas special was testing the waters to see if it was something people would enjoy so the fact that it was such a massive success meant it was a no brainer to go again i keep saying it but how can you be anything but unbelievably proud to be part of something that people care about and love so much so i was delighted six months in the caribbean doesnâ t hurt either i still love it here and it feels like home now i know the area i know a lot of the locals i speak the language pretty well the christmas special has quite a spooky storyline what can you tell us about it the nice thing about a christmas special is that everyone understands that you can be a bit more playful or experimental â or special even â with the tone we have ninety minutes instead of an hour so we can give storylines time to develop they went bold this year with the script donâ t worry itâ s not a massive departure from the usual death in paradise story we still know what people enjoy about the show but itâ s a good old fashioned christmas ghost story with clever twists it has a scary tone but itâ s in keeping with the world of the show it was fun to film and i think people are going to enjoy it how do you think neville has changed since last series in the second half of the last series he was trying to get over the loss of florence heâ s still a little burned by that he may be a superhuman sleuthing mastermind but heâ s still a human workwise heâ s mostly settled in but in his personal life heâ s not quite sure how he feels about trying to move on from that or whether he wants to move on and carry the idea of florence with him he has a lot to work out that sets the foundation for his journey in the christmas special we canâ t let him get too settled he loves life on the island heâ s got a great group of friends his jobâ s going well â it canâ t all be smooth sailing so thereâ s a lot this year that heâ s got to cope with more than ever we go to another island this series what can you tell us about that episode naomi goes over for a wedding and a murder takes place st barnabas is such a small island that the only police force they have is one guy who was naomiâ s mentor so they quickly enlist our help all caribbean islands have their own unique tone and vibe so it was a nice challenge to portray the slightly different vibes of the islands itâ s lovely for shantol jackson playing naomi because we go back to her roots trying to solve a case with her mentor but sheâ s already had much more experience than him now so thereâ s all that conflict sheâ s able to step up and neville sees that itâ s important for naomi to have autonomy in her own space he follows her lead and i think that only strengthens their working relationship and their friendship thereâ s a potential love interest for nevilleâ sophie comes from manchester too played by the brilliant chelsea edge it starts with them bumping into each other itâ s a very sweet charming cute meet they get on well as quirky and eccentric as he can be heâ s very kind and is actually a little nervous when she expresses an interest in him heâ s still heartbroken over florence and he doesnâ t want to waste her time so heâ s very honest about it then thereâ s a few twists and turns from thereâ do you have a favourite storyline or episode this series most of what you do in this job is contained episodes with a bit of character building over the serial arc so when you get episodes that really challenge a character and make life interesting you really relish it the one at st barnabas is naomiâ s iâ m lucky this year that i have two stories that test the character and were really challenging to play iâ m lucky in that i get to do a job that i enjoy but itâ s especially fun to get up and go to work thinking this is going to be a pretty different day episodes six and seven are going to be brilliant when people see them theyâ re going to freak out i think theyâ re going to love it but theyâ re going to be like â no wayâ as the series progresses we see a lot of support from nevilleâ s team what was it like working with the other cast this series the dynamics of the team are crucial to the showâ s success the show stands or falls on whether the audience takes them into their hearts don warrington is literally a living legend every time iâ m in a scene with him iâ m thinking about how lucky i am shantol jackson was an incredible addition last series she fitted in easily in the st barnabas episode she really took the opportunity sheâ s a joy tahj miles is annoying because heâ s too good he came in effortlessly when i was his age i wasnâ t cool and heâ s effortlessly cool heâ s brilliant at his job ginny holder calls herself the aunty of the group darlene really stepped up to being part of the police team she humanises and grounds a lot of nevilleâ s quirkier stuff and ginny just nails it it does feel a little bit special when elizabeth is on set which is funny because sheâ s been on the show since the start it should feel normal but it shows how much sheâ s respected catherine will be the one to give you a little nudge when you wonâ t take the plunge that character is like an inspirational walking metaphor for how we should live life â grab every day donâ t waste your life take your chances sheâ s the showâ s conscience what can you tell us about the guest cast is there anybody who really impressed you or you really enjoyed having on set as an actor whoâ s spent a lot of my career being known for one style of work and therefore had to work quite hard to do other stuff one of the things i think is so great about this show is that they fearlessly cast against type theyâ re very happy to go â this is supposed to be an unpleasant manipulative dodgy character what about les dennis â thatâ s brilliant and they do that a lot heâ s a brilliant actor it was lovely to see him enjoying being completely different anytime that happens itâ s always really good fun another perfect example is robert webb iâ m a huge fan of his it was a chance for him to do something completely different and i think he really relished it he was a joy to have around kevin eldon too as heâ s basically a walking god in the comedy community kevinâ s so known for being able to do anything that just having him felt like a massive coup and we felt lucky to have him it s lovely to ask the guest stars how theyâ re enjoying it and have them go â yeah iâ m enjoying doing something different and itâ s nice to have somebody take a chanceâ itâ s always nice for me as someone with a background in comedy to get to do something different and then to see that happen to other people the show continues to attract fantastic heavyweight actors i think thatâ s partly because of its success partly because the scripts are good partly because itâ s willing to take a chance on allowing people to do different things â and it doesnâ t hurt that itâ s filmed in the caribbean whatâ s your favourite christmas song fairytale of new york whatâ s your favourite thing about christmas food whatâ s the best thing about christmas dinner roast potatoes chelsea edge sophie what was your first reaction when you found out you got the role in death in paradise i was super excited it is such a well loved show all my family and friends watch it my friends were like â what â no way â they thought i would only be doing one episode because of the guest spots so when i told them i would be out there for six months they couldnâ t believe it everyone has been so welcoming and the location is incredible when you wake up and see the ocean or watch the sunset you cannot think of the downsides itâ s so beautiful what can you tell us about your character sophie sophie is very sweet i donâ t think she knows exactly what she is looking for before she meets neville she is seeking some form of adventure as she gets bored of the monotonous day to day life she is curious about what else is out there wanting to explore the world and discover more about herself sophie hasnâ t done much travelling growing up so i think she is keen to see what is out there to discover what do you think it is that attracts her to neville she is a bit of a fish out of water similar to neville which reminds her of home i think thatâ s partly what attracted her to neville obviously he is kind intelligent and reminds her of home in this completely different world he provides the familiarity and comfort for her how have you found it filming on the island amazing apart from the mosquitoes i seem to be an absolute feast for them but i do love it i love the heat itâ s a very well oiled machine from the moment you get on set the cast and crew have been doing it for a long time so i feel lucky to be part of it what was it like working alongside the regular cast everyoneâ s great and they are so lovely and talented itâ s nice when you come onto a job that you feel like you have a good set of friends i have been very welcomed by all the cast most of my scenes are with ralf i do work with the other cast but a small amount in comparison to him itâ s been great working with ralf he went to school in my hometown when we first met we hit it off and he has taught me how to play poker which i think he is regretting a bit nowâ did anyone show you around the island as soon as i arrived i had the whole crew giving me recommendations of places to go and things to do iâ ve been to the waterfalls and the volcano which was a bit treacherous because i am a bit clumsy i have also visited jacques cousteau island which is where scuba diving originated as well as taken a mangrove tour on a boat hand on heart it was one of the most beautiful moments of my life i did the sunset tour which had birds flying over the ocean from the mainland it made me feel emotional like i was in a film it was so surreal i am constantly sending my friends pictures of the ocean and sunset and they are like â yes we know itâ s beautiful â have there been any challenging scenes to film without giving anything away i think the most challenging thing has been getting what we need from a scene over the sounds of nature as soon as the sun sets there are these tiny frogs that make the loudest noise the rain has also been a challenge it really does pour similar to being in manchester when we film by nevilleâ s shack we have the waves to contend with too whatâ s your favourite christmas song i love fairytale of new york whatâ s your favourite christmas tradition other than eating copious amounts of food and drinking lots of wine finding the ugliest christmas jumper i can find and wearing it on christmas day last year it was green with a snowman with tinsel and lots of lights it was pretty hideous whatâ s the best thing about christmas dinner yorkshire puddings obviously i will have at least three how will you be spending christmas this year i will be spending it at home up north with my family my nieces and nephew ginny holder darlene curtis darlene appears in the christmas special this year what was it like to film the christmas special is brilliant it is a heartfelt story about family and we had some amazing actors come over to help us with it including les dennis jo martin siobhan mcsweeney and hakeem kae kazim it was a joyous experience for us to work with such talented people how was it working with les dennis in the christmas episode his character gives you a bit of a run aroundâ les is a workhorse and heâ s brilliant heâ s one of those old school actors whoâ s got everything down pat heâ s also generous with his stories and experience so it was a real treat and complete honour working with him heâ s beautifully genuine what do you think darlene learned in the christmas episode from having to deal with lesâ character he was a slippery fish and quite confrontational darlene found him quite a challenge sheâ s just helping out and so doesnâ t have all the power as the rest of the team to deal with the situation fully this is darleneâ s first full series of death in paradise what has that been like to film you have to get into a rhythm because itâ s a lot iâ m still finding my feet the amazing thing about death in paradise is that weâ ve got a solid main cast and theyâ re all very supportive weâ re also so lucky to get different guest cast in so you get new blood and new stories to keep everything fresh how are you coping with the heat me the heat and makeup donâ t go hand in hand i have someone fanning me 24 7 so my makeup doesnâ t melt itâ s especially bad in the police station but the crew do their best to keep us cool we were filming on location once and the weather kept changing between sunshine and rain when the sun is out itâ s intense youâ re melting straight away makeup gone you get the scene done because youâ re trying to beat the sweat dripping down your face but i canâ t complain because guadeloupe is amazing people travel from all over the world to come and see us film and see the sets thatâ s extraordinary how have you found working with the main cast more regularly we have a laugh on set weâ re a supportive team and thatâ s evolved even more so towards the end of this series itâ s difficult when a new person joins a group because it changes the dynamics but iâ m having a whale of a time thereâ s lots of jokes is there anyone in particular you would love to do a guest role on death in paradise viola davis i would love to work with her and see what she would bring obviously idris elba but iâ m sure everybody says that itâ s those people that have that magnetism that presence thereâ s an episode involving some doomsday preppers what essentials do you think darlene would have in her end of the world bunker and what would you have in yours darlene would have some red wine sheâ d have her crime magazines and novels that would keep her going she likes vibrancy so if she was on her own sheâ d get a bit bored for her music itâ d have to be afrobeat she would have a one woman party i quite like doing meditation so if i was on an island with a beach and the sea iâ d be happy beaches change all the time which i find extraordinary when youâ re connected to the sea you think â do you know what you just need to go with the flowâ because thatâ s what happens with water the tide comes in and goes out and everything goes with the flow thatâ s what i think we should do in life darlene takes on a more senior role this series what can you tell us about that she becomes part of the police force itâ s taken her all this time to find her perfect job and sheâ s found her thing in life itâ s so interesting and diverse for her sheâ s fascinated â shocked even â by the reasons why somebody has chosen to take someone elseâ s life she doesnâ t necessarily voice it but sheâ s often in the denouements thinking â what why how â how human relationships work is of interest to darlene so sheâ s found her joy darlene works quite closely with marlon what is their working relationship like how does it progress itâ s interesting because darlene would like to see herself as someone senior but she really isnâ t and marlon is above her marlon is initially a bit wary because he wanted to withhold his position so they have a tiny bit of a tug of war but they come together and understand they can work well as a team itâ s a very respectful team and they do work well together they start playing on the funny moments between them a bit more towards the end of the series

special how will you be spending christmas this year in the cotswolds with the kids weâ ll absolutely be watching the death in paradise christmas special everyoneâ s going to love it people need to tune in for this one it pulls at the heartstrings ã lizabeth bourgine catherine bordey how was returning to guadeloupe to film death in paradise it was really nice to do a second christmas special as the script was amazing and very different from last year and it keeps you wondering what will happen i was happy that the episode showcased catherine as mayor because i think itâ s very important to see her in that role even during the christmas season it was fun it was different and i loved it we see catherine trying to play matchmaker for neville again do we think sheâ ll have any luck this series neville will really have to deal with his emotions this series he will have enough courage to face things head on and will realise he does not have to depend on catherine as she has forced him to come to terms with his feelings catherine spends a lot of time helping neville would she want to find love herself sheâ s strong and a loving mother who is pleased her daughter lives her life even if she is away from saint marie we can see she is a happy woman with a loving life with plenty of love to give in the future i hope we get a chance to see more of an insight into her personal life meeting her lovers love affairs and friendships during the series we see catherine at the centre of the crime scene while completing her mayoral duties how does she deal with this she is there as the mayor figure but she is also a support to the people who are at the scene of the crime she is always there to offer wise words and comfort for those in need itâ s one of her best qualities being able to help people and really spur them on when it comes to selwynâ s relationship with his daughter catherine is not afraid to speak her mind ultimately offering the best advice even if it can be difficult to hear do you relate to this quality in real life yes i am like catherine her characteristics have rubbed off on me after living with her for 12 years catherine always speaks the truth with neville but is always careful not to hurt his feelings as she is aware he is sensitive with selwyn who she knows very well she immediately knows how he feels she understands he is fragile when it comes to the news of his daughter but is really pushing him for his own good to have a relationship with her whenever a character is in a moment of need they always confide in catherine she appears as the one constant in saint marie and many would be lost without her how does it feel to have such a key role in this long running series i love it i love it for catherine sheâ s so loving and strong when she appears on screen itâ s like â oh we can breathe â she brings a lot of peace every appearance is very powerful as an actress i really enjoy going into catherineâ s bar on set in the morning i welcome everyone to my bar and take in that we are by the sea in the caribbean so letâ s make some great work whatâ s your favourite christmas song jingle bells whatâ s your favourite thing about christmas definitely the night before christmas i love the dinner where itâ s tradition in my house to give small presents to loved ones at the table i have done this since i was young whatâ s the best thing about christmas dinner the best thing about my christmas dinner is that traditionally each guest must bring a dish themselves to share with everyone but make it not buy it these dishes also have to be given a name of a famous film corresponding whatever dish they make i will be making a creole course how will you be spending christmas this year it will be with family not everyone will be there but i have three couples visiting who i like very much who do not know each other so it will be a nice surprise we will all be spending it in the south of france don warrington commissioner selwyn patterson how was returning to guadeloupe for a second christmas special and a new series itâ s been very nice itâ s a very beautiful place itâ s lovely to do another christmas special we did our first one last year that seemed to go very well so we have done another one this one is very different to the one we previously did it is more dickensian as it is more of a ghost storyâ the christmas special has quite a spooky storyline surrounding the historic case of a missing child that a young selwyn was involved with what can you tell us about it again i come back to the theme of the ghost story selwyn has been haunted by his inability to solve this case when he was a very young policeman and after all those years it comes back to him and he has a second chance so he grabs it with both hands as we would all like to get rid of ghosts did you give any tips to the actor playing young selwyn not at all i think playing the younger version of someone who is actually there is tricky enough i left him alone because he seemed pretty confident about what he was doing at the end of the last series selwyn was landed with a huge bombshell when he was told he had a daughter he didnâ t know about â how does he handle that news in the new series selwyn meets his daughter and they try to find common ground itâ s a difficult situation when you meet your father or daughter especially if you havenâ t seen them before and as they are both adults it is a huge bridge to build itâ s not always a smooth process and needs a lot of negotiating marlon is looking to take his sergeantâ s exams how is selwynâ s relationship with marlon marlon is somebody who selwyn sees great potential in but has ways which need to be amended selwyn is acting as a sort of parental figure for marlon like any parent he can be quite stern so the relationship is a dynamic one catherine is always on hand to give selwyn advice now more than ever why do you think he trusts her so much catherine is a good friend and i think she has managed her life very well she is more about feeling and selwyn to some extent keeps his feelings in check quite a lot he trusts her to the extent that he feels with her advice he can release emotions he has not released before you have been in the show since series one what do you think makes the series so successful if i were to take a stab at it it has comedy drama and characters who are essentially loveable and are relatable to the audience in different ways and have more to them than their professions i also think the interrelationships between the characters are special selwynâ s relationship to neville marlon and now to other characters have evolved the audience is interested in how those connections develop that to some extent makes it a successful series the formula for the show has a magical chemistry do you have a favourite storyline or episode this series do you have a favourite storyline or episode this series i like the christmas special i thought that was a very interesting storyline i think it cut deeper itâ s surprising for a christmas special because it went deeper than one might imagine a christmas special would except oliver twist which i guess is a christmas story have there been any challenging scenes to film this year in a sense laughs they are all challenging you start from somewhere and you have to end up somewhere else and the challenge is to make it as real as you can in terms of weather itâ s very hot in the suit also this season we have had a lot of rain when it rains here boy does it rain we have had to stop and wait many times because we canâ t hear each other as itâ s so loud whatâ s your favourite christmas movie the philadelphia story it is beautifully done very moving and has a happy ending whatâ s your favourite thing about christmas pudding whatâ s the best thing about christmas dinner it depends if my christmas dinner is in the caribbean then my favourite thing is a drink called a sorrel shantol jackson d s naomi thomas how was returning to guadeloupe for your first christmas special and your second series i am really excited about the christmas special because last year i was jealous i wasnâ t in it people were in costumes i was so mad as i really wanted to be an elf the producers promised me next year that i would be an angel so i came back anticipating my angel costume but this didnâ t work out as the storyline was different this year but itâ s fineâ christmas is my favourite time of year so of course i was very excited to be part of this special i feel very blessed to be back for a second series of death in paradise itâ s great being here doing what i love surrounded by the best people the christmas special has quite a spooky storyline surrounding the historic case of a missing child what can you tell us about it it is a case from selwynâ s past which has come back to haunt him funnily enough and the team are of course on hand to assist him in solving the murder because itâ s set at christmas which is when people tend to tell ghost stories itâ s even spookier i am very excited for people to watch it and see how they respond to it do you believe in ghosts and have you ever had a paranormal experience i do not believe in ghosts and have always warded off paranormal experiences as i do not want to have one i am not interested in having any type of interaction with anyone or anything from the other side i know of people who have had those experiences some scared by it some not but for me personally no nor would i want toâ thereâ s an episode involving doomsday preppers â what essentials would naomi have in her end of the world bunker what essentials would you have in yours naomi would have her flashlight i am sure she would stock up on tinned stuff and have all the things you should have as a doomsday prepper as she is so focused and does everything by the book she would have the things you should have candles batteries flashlights and her sergeantâ s book just to refresh her memory shantol would hopefully have boxes of sour skittles as well as essentials such as radios sudokus crosswords and books as i love to read the doomsday preppers seem very introverted i am an introverted extrovert so i would need things to keep me occupied i can be introverted but i do need a bit of human contact just to keep my mind occupied novels are great as i can connect with their stories and characters and feel like i am in their world do you have a favourite storyline or episode this series episode four is my favourite as it is a coming of age moment for naomi it was an emotional special episode for me i came home very exhausted from set not just for the long days but because of the emotional roller coaster which i appreciated because sometimes we donâ t get much human interaction in the show as we are always solving crimes and getting down to business in this episode naomiâ s back in st barnabas with her friends and family in a place where she has history on the island someone has been accused of murdering someone she knows so the team come to the island to help solve the crime she gets to share the island with her team but i am sure not in the way she had envisaged a lot happens emotionally and i enjoyed that process of growth for my character and loved working with the guest cast especially my old sergeant sammy patrice naiambana this episode really challenged naomi and i thatâ s why it was my favourite how does naomi find work on her home island saint barnabas locals have never really experienced a crime as severe as murder and naomi has to take control of the investigation when her old sergeant is usually the one in control you see an interesting power dynamic emerge between the duo with naomi trying to navigate the tricky case whilst at the same time she is trying not to be in complete control whilst he is giving her the opportunity to do just that those scenes are my favourite scenes as you see growth in patriceâ s character too how does saint barnabas compare to saint marie saint barnabas is tiny in comparison to saint marie the locals have never really experienced a crime like a murder before as they usually deal with natural disasters also as saint barnabasâ community is so small everybody knows everybody whereas saint marie is bigger with many people coming and going constantly how do you think naomi has grown from the last time we saw her naomi is a lot more confident when she first got there she was excited but very timid her aim was to impress the inspector and do a good job however she tended to overwork herself now she has settled her confidence has grown and she is working with the inspector more rather than under him she seems a lot more settled and comfortable and is trying to do her best what have you learnt throughout your time on the show so far itâ s not for the faint hearted this experience builds character because you are away from home for six months i am also from a very tightknit community in jamaica as my friends and my family are very close and i have never been away from home or my dad for this long you get to learn things about yourself what you do and donâ t like being in your own space and realising youâ re okay on your own you also experience different personalities which is always good because i want to be able to work everywhere with people from all over the world and from different cultural backgrounds we have new people coming to set every two weeks mostly from the uk but different parts of the uk so i get exposed to various personalities and backgrounds i am from a tiny dot on the map so itâ s different i have learnt how to work with other people because this job is an ensemble effort this experience has thrown me in the deep end and has prepared me for the future i am anticipating i am very grateful have there been any challenging scenes to film this year the â doomsday preppersâ episode was challenging because the location was set in the woods and it rained the whole time location wise that wasnâ t ideal especially going down a hill in my sandals whatâ s your favourite christmas tradition the food seeing a plethora of food everyone in death in paradise knows shantol loves fried chicken whatâ s your favourite thing about christmas christmas is my favourite time of the year because everyone is so happy people are kinder more loving and so are falling in love people are gifting they are giving and receiving itâ s a very bright time and thatâ s why i love it whatâ s the best christmas gift you have ever received i have always looked forward to going to whoeverâ s house whether it be my grandparents or aunts seeing a lot of food on the table i guess food is the gift i love gifting i remember one year my best friend loves to do christmas dinners so i went downtown and bought gifts for everyone who would be at dinner they werenâ t extravagant gifts they were more personal how will you be spending christmas this year i will be spending christmas at home in jamaica with my dadâ s side of the family we are in the process of deciding what meats to have and who is baking the cake i am very excited as i havenâ t been home for so long tahj miles officer marlon pryce how was returning to guadeloupe for a second christmas special and a new series it was great it is always exciting to come back out here when we get towards the end of the series you are kind of missing home but once you spend a couple of months at home you miss guadeloupe straight away from the moment i got back here i had a smile on my face doing another christmas special was exciting especially after seeing the viewing figures from last year last year was amazing but they have upped the levels this year we cannot wait for everyone to watch it â it was great to film the christmas special has quite a spooky storyline surrounding the historic case of a missing child with marlon having to sleep in a â haunted houseâ â what can you tell us about it itâ s interesting because as much as it is a beautiful caring and sentimental piece about family it also doubles as a horror story too with marlon staying in a haunted house which i loved itâ s a nice hybrid between christmas and a thriller it works brilliantly the scary elements incorporated in a christmassy theme is something i have never seen done before would you like to stay in a haunted house no never there is no way there are some things i wouldnâ t mind trying just to see what happens but this is not one of those things i kind of believe in paranormal activity so i donâ t want to be involved thereâ s an episode involving â doomsday preppersâ â what essentials would marlon have in his end of the world bunker what essentials would you have in yours marlon would need a phone whether he will have internet connection though i donâ t know the logistics of it arenâ t quite clear i feel like five minutes in a dark room doing nothing would be overwhelming for marlon i am not sure he would be able to handle it for myself i donâ t know i donâ t think i would need my phone as much as i think i would if i could only pick one thing i would need a notebook and a pen so i can write my thoughts or stories or even just draw i am terrible at drawing but i think time in a bunker would help me improve we see marlon working closely with darlene this series what is their working relationship like itâ s cool because it is the first time marlon has been the senior officer when he worked with either jp dwayne or naomi he was always a rank below now even though he is not a sergeant darlene is a trainee which is what he used to be he is not technically the senior officer on paper but in terms of experience he might know a little bit more than her and he is definitely not in a position to be leading someone underneath him he still needs a partner however which he starts to learn as the series goes on at the beginning heâ s like â no iâ m the boss iâ m finally going to be the boss i want people to understand i can be the bossâ but he then quickly realises he doesnâ t really have the qualifications darlene is good at what she does when she comes in she might have a few kinks to iron out when she first joins as she hasnâ t done this before but marlon learns sometimes youâ ve got to trust people the same way they trusted him he used to be a criminal when he first got here they trusted him with a lot of things when he first joined which they shouldnâ t have but he appreciated and respected it it is only fair to do the same for darlene marlon is very keen to progress in the team and is aiming towards becoming a sergeant â do you think heâ s ready for that next step on paper no way he canâ t be i am always comparing him to jp and he hasnâ t had close to the experience he had but there is more to being a police officer then what is in a book sometimes itâ s about who you are as a person and what you can bring to the force i think marlon has a lot of qualities that could make him a very good sergeant how close he is to the saint marie community the people he knows the way he can think outside of the box and take shortcuts if he can work on the academic side of the job he could make a great sergeant but it is up to him what skills do you think marlon has picked up from the other officers he has worked with three different senior officers now dwayne jp and naomi naomi is a very â by the bookâ police officer as she hasnâ t had any previous experience with murders before she came to saint marie jp was a good balance he had been on the island for a long time so understood how things worked by knowing people like marlon before he joined the force and being thorough with investigations thatâ s how he ended up being a sergeant dwayne was a bit more of a loose cannon than marlon who would sometimes think of doing something outside the box but would hold off dwyane wouldnâ t really think about it he would just go off and do it what are your thoughts on the guest cast this series do you have a favourite the guest cast this series is amazing there are some heavy hitters this year including jo martin les dennis and many more in the christmas special we have gamba cole in episode four who i worked with when i was sixteen in a theatre workshop i have been watching his career since he has progressed like crazy itâ s always great to have healthy competition of people we admire we all want them to be great and to bring the best out of in all of us have there been any challenging scenes to film this year there are challenging scenes every year it wouldnâ t necessarily be the scene itself it could be where we are filming it episode one features astronomers watching an eclipse on a cliff filming on a cliff isnâ t the easiest place it was windy hot and there were no clouds in sight it was difficult as we couldnâ t go too close to the edge so we had to cheat where we were in terms of location which as an actor is not the easiest things to do but the scenes themselves are always good written well with great characters we canâ t complain because when we watch them on screen they look fantastic it is all worth it in the end whatâ s your favourite christmas memory the first thing that pops into my head is when i was young and it was a christmas when i was ill for christmas in my family it all depends on who is cooking and where the food is this year christmas was not meant to be at my nanâ s house but i was there so she could take care of me everyone brought all the food to my nanâ s house they came into my room instead of eating in the front room one thing i love about christmas is family and i feel that christmas that year even though i was ill my family were all together whatâ s your favourite thing about christmas food being from a caribbean family christmas timeâ actually any weekend is a feast christmas time is when everyone chips in even i have started learning to cook i might make a little macaroni to put aside as much as i love the family time itâ s the food which has to take the top spot what is the main dish there are too many my mumâ s speciality is duck which is usually the main event of the meal my nan will cook chicken six different ways and my auntie also makes a really nice coleslaw and prawn salad there are leftovers for two weeks how will you be spending christmas this year i donâ t know what country i will be in i am not sure if iâ m staying in london with my nan or in the caribbean spending time with my grandad i know wherever i am there will be a lot of family there it will be like a regular christmas in my family everyone will come to someoneâ s house with their food and music it will be a great time drama

served in an interim role for nearly six months the promotion completes a corporate self examination in which inmar applied the disruptive analysis process it offers clients that persuaded david

to keep most of the k w menu intact the sale of k w was not unexpected given it was listed as an option along with its assets being put up for auction when the company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in september 2020 k w emerged from bankruptcy in september 2021 but pandemic restrictions still limited in person business although k w was able to regain some business when restrictions were limited it continued to struggle because its primary customers are elderly diners who were advised to stay at home during the first two years of pandemic narrow escape it s been nearly a year since about 6 500 winston salem residents narrowly escaped a potential disaster after the winston weaver co inc fertilizer plant caught fire jan 31 and took days to extinguish with the official cause labeled as undetermined by city fire officials on july 29 there remain many unresolved questions including state building codes that allowed the 80 year old plus plant to operate without sprinklers and alarms yet there was no legislation introduced during the primary portion of the 2022 session to address state building codes in the context of the plant fire an n c labor department report released aug 1 determined that hundreds of tons of potentially explosive ammonium nitrate were improperly stored at the 65 423 square foot plant investigators also determined that wooden storage bins were not adequate to keep ammonium nitrate from escaping or other substances from entering yet there have been no regulatory changes proposed by the state insurance department or the state building code council to alter or end the grandfathering of buildings such as the winston weaver plant the fortunate outcome of no deaths or injuries related to the fire could lead to legislative inaction said zagros madjd sadjadi an economics professor at winston salem state university unfortunately what ends up causing action are fatal disasters that throw a bright light on a situation madjd sadjadi said when you have a near miss it typically disappears from the political view fairly quickly in addition there may be some degree of systemic racism at play here in that when poor or minority areas are the ones primarily being affected there is a lot less political will to get things done mixed results reynolds american inc business units experienced both some welcome and disappointing news during 2022 the vuse electronic cigarette of r j reynolds vapor co became the top selling u s and global brand with a 40 7 to 27 u s market share gap over juul meanwhile r j reynolds tobacco co was dealt a significant setback on dec 12 when the u s supreme court turned away an appeal to prevent california from enforcing a ban on most menthol and other flavored tobacco products in the state the ban went into effect on wednesday on dec 8 the four largest u s tobacco manufacturers were given a reprieve on placing graphic warnings labels on cigarette packs and in marketing campbell barker a federal judge in the eastern district of texas issued an order that vacated a march 2020 decision by the food and drug administration to approve a new set of 11 graphic warning labels on cigarette packages among those 11 images were diseased lungs a man with stitches from heart or lung surgery and a child with an oxygen mask one of the labels also talks about erectile dysfunction separately on dec 7 those manufacturers received after more than 16 years a launch date of jan 1 for placing corrective statements addressing the health risks of smoking and secondhand smoke on store displays in nearly 200 000 retail outlets the federal court for the district of columbia issued a 58 page order that laid out the implementation timetable that runs through june 30 2025 and the language for the 21 corrective statements clean break in a heritage upending decision the kate b reynolds charitable trust used its 75th anniversary celebration event on sept 27 to announce a clean break from tobacco related investments the winston salem trust touted the transition as part of a looking back working forward initiative that emphasizes a socially responsible investment strategy to support community

i rise before dawn which is not hard when you live as far north as milwaukee and crater lake and vladivostok and on the western edge of the eastern time zone as the sky brightens i am out the door for my daily excursion my goal is 10 k a day about 6 2 miles i walk rather than run for three reasons 1 when i jogged i hated it i did it for health and ground out every step 2 as a consequence of those years my left achilles tendon instantly objects to anything approaching 5 mph 3 i can notice the world around me last week for instance along a perfectly ordinary side street near my house i saw a willys jeep that instantly reminded me of the story i shared before for a split second i was in both moments have you ever had such a moment of course we all do i seek them out though they are temporal pearls that s a lovely image but it would be more accurate to say they are temporal truffles they lie beneath the surface of life we find them by catching their scent as i literally did thirty years ago that was in my jogging days while visiting my mother in law i went out for a jog lumbering along spending most of my thoughts on not slowing down or falling down i turned a corner in the neighborhood where she lived and was startled by the intense aroma of mulberries something i had not smelt in years instantly i was seven years old in our backyard where a great mulberry tree dropped its berries into the rather pathetic pool dad had erected on hot humid maryland summer days we dove and splashed and slid about on the plastic sheet that was its bottom coming in looking like victims of some hideous pox because of the smashed mulberries in the water in that instant gripped by the smell i had to stop and let it all in note stock photo not of my actual house for those who did not see the first two posts this blog is an account of days my days living what turned out to be a pilgrim life it is for those moments when time and place turn inside out that i live it does not happen every day but often enough to make me want it more anyone out there remember intermittent reinforcement from psych 101 that is one reason why my 10k a day are as vital to me as breakfast and when i cannot do it i am a caged animal roaming the house nervously when we had a polar vortex a few years back that dropped everything below zero i did not leave the house for three days i was a mess i need something that takes me away from this time and place which sounds exactly opposite the usual spiritual ideal of being centered and all that my spirit needs to be de centered it takes 10 k to do that to be a pilgrim is an old religious practice of course dating back before the years divided by christ but for me it is not just a part of my spiritual life it is my spiritual life it is what i am as much as who i am did you see the quote marks at the start of the paragraph it is a quote from a hymn by john bunyan famous for his allegorical pilgrim s progress and yes i have read it it s words are my patent who would true valour see let him come hither one here will constant be come wind come weather there s no discouragement shall make him once relent his first avowed intent to be a pilgrim as i did with borges i made my way to his grave in bunhill field in london that place is worth a story or two in itself cemeteries are among the liveliest places on ear th i have found it took me a long time to make that vow of his or perhaps accept that it was my destiny remind me to tell a story about the hilarious use of the word destiny by a colleague i still laugh when i think about it no small amount comes from the physical need for dopamine that wandering does for me for my soul to be still i must be on the move feel the rhythm of feet and arms sense sky and sun and cloud hear the wind and bird i cannot say that doing so is as valorous as bunyan says it is i only know it is what i must be
every single year this woman and her family spend christmas in hawaii and she has celebrated the holiday this way for as long as she can remember the tradition really began after she and her husband had kids and needed to reorganize their family christmas plans specifically because her in laws wanted to carve out some time to spend with the kids so she and her husband ultimately decided that they would celebrate christmas with her in laws on new year s but for the week of christmas day she her husband and her kids would go to hawaii and this system had been working out flawlessly for her family well that was until last year when there was a death in the family unfortunately her husband s father passed away during the holiday season in 2021 it understandably hit both her husband and her mother in law hard too so they did not go to hawaii for obvious reasons this year though they intended to get back to their usual tradition and planned out in advance how they would celebrate the whole holiday season for thanksgiving they decided to celebrate with his mother then she her husband and the kids would get to celebrate christmas in hawaii since they missed out last year and the plans were all going well until right before their flight apparently about a week before they were supposed to leave for hawaii her husband started to have some second thoughts about their trip apparently he felt pretty bad about leaving his mom alone after the loss of his dad and thought it would be better to stay back

the united states district court for the southern district of new york and docketed under 22 cv 10677 is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired if you are a shareholder who purchased or otherwise acquired affirm securities during the class period you have until february 3 2023 to ask the court to appoint you as

toll free ext 7980 those who inquire by e mail are encouraged to include their mailing address telephone number and the number of shares purchased spectrum purports to be a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring developing and commercializing novel and targeted oncology therapies the complaint alleges that before the class period defendants were conducting a phase 2 clinical trial called zenith20 the zenith20 trial was an ongoing multicenter multi cohort open label activity estimating study evaluating the anti tumor effects safety and tolerability of poziotinib or pozi in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer nsclc that have certain mutations her2 exon 20 insertion mutations and were previously treated with the standard of care before the class period the company had a pre nda meeting with the fda during which spectrum confirmed with the fda that cohort 2 data could serve as the basis of a new drug application nda submission in cohort 2 the objective response rate complete or partial response which are measures of whether tumors shrink or are eradicated after treatment was approximately 28 and the median duration of response was 5 1 months the her2 exon 20 insertion mutation occurs in 2 5 of patients with nsclc these patients are treated according to the same treatment paradigms as patients with advanced nsclc without these unique mutations however there is an apparent unmet need for these patients because they have a median overall survival of 1 6 1 9 years from the time of diagnosis according to defendants if approved poziotinib could address an unmet need of nsclc patients previously treated with the standard of care the complaint alleges that during the class period defendants represented the safety and efficacy data from the zenith20 trial were positive and that they had initiated the required confirmatory phase 3 study however unknown to investors this was not true as later revealed to investors the data submitted by defendants in support of the nda failed to show that pozi provided a meaningful advantage over available therapies and therefore was not likely to provide a clinical benefit during the class period the fda expressed concerns regarding pozi s safety and efficacy data and further the fda expressed concern that defendants phase 3 confirmatory trial which was required to be substantially enrolled at the time of aa had not enrolled a single patient during the class period the fda communicated to defendants that given the concerns regarding the totality of evidence supporting the nda the significant delay in confirming benefit with a randomized trial heightened the uncertainty around the risk benefit assessment of pozi starting on september 20 2022 before the market opened investors began to learn the truth when the fda oncologic drugs advisory committee odac released a briefing document in anticipation of its september 22 2022 meeting with defendants to review poziotinib odac is an independent panel of experts that reviews and evaluates data concerning the efficacy and safety of marketed and investigational products for use in the treatment of cancer the committee makes appropriate recommendations to the fda but these recommendations are not binding and the final decision regarding product approval will be made solely by the fda investors were surprised when despite the company s repeated representations during the class period that the data for zenith20 were positive the odac briefing document disclosed not only negative data on the safety and efficacy of pozi but also a failure by the company to enroll any patients in the required phase 3 confirmatory trial as a result of this news shares of spectrum common stock declined from a closing price of 1 06 per share on september 19 2022 to a close at 0 66 per share on september 20 2022 a decline of 0 40 per share or over 37 on heavier than usual volume then according to reuters on

as a result of this news shares of spectrum common stock further declined from a closing price of 0 63 per share on september 21 2022 before trading was halted to a close at 0 43 per share on september 23 2022 a decline of 0 20 per share or over 31 on heavier than usual volume on september 23 2022 h c wainwright released a report titled odac votes against poziotinib debt deal announced lower pt by 3 the report noted that the 9 no voters from the odac cited non meaningful benefit over existing therapies and cited dosing issues issues related to the phase 3 confirmatory trial for poziotinib were also raised as that study has not yet started the report further stated that we believe the odac vote is negative for potential approval of poziotinib we note that the fda does not have to follow the recommendations of the odac however the fda s views in the briefing documents and during the meeting do not bode well for approval in our opinion also on september 23 2022 jefferies released a report titled based on negative pozi adcom we anticipate crl next steps for pozi unclear the report noted adcom voted 9 4 that pozi benefits do not outweigh risks panel agreed w fda concerns on dosing lack of confirm trial progress and that pozi data do not show clear benefit vs soc further the jefferies report stated that the panel decided evidence on efficacy unmet need did not outweigh concerns namely 1 dosing concerns w incongruence b w 16mg qd dose under review and confirmatory trial s 8mg bid 2 lack of confirmatory trial progress w no pts enrolled as of yet and data likely not until 2026 increasing risk to pts on november 25 2022 defendants caused spectrum to issue a press release disclosing their receipt of a complete response letter crl from the fda regarding

i ate my way through australia on my first visit to the land down under australians i spoke with urged me to try fairy bread barramundi and tim tams i devoured seafood like salt and pepper calamari but will pass on vegemite toast in the future i ate my way through australia for 10 days this summer the author at a bar in sydney australia monica humphries insider this summer i spent 10 days on the eastern coast of australia visiting cities like cairns and sydney it was my first time in the country and as eager as i was to sail on the great barrier reef and visit an abandoned castle in an australian rainforest i was just as excited to eat i took every opportunity i had to try something new whether it was a stop inside a café to grab an unfamiliar pastry scouring menus for new cuisines or speaking to dozens of australians who shared the meals that remind them of home and during those 10 days i rarely had an empty stomach take a look at a few of the classic aussie foods i ate below the sydney opera house i dined on barramundi for the first time the pan seared barramundi at the sydney opera bar monica humphries insider as i skimmed menus in restaurants across eastern australia an unfamiliar fish kept popping up under seafood sections it was barramundi which according to cnn is a popular fish served throughout australia its name originates from the aboriginal language and means large scaled river fish the same source reports as a pescetarian and seafood lover i was eager to taste a new fish so when i arrived at the opera bar underneath the sydney opera house and spotted it on the menu i decided to finally try barramundi i ordered the fish pan seared and served with fennel and celery heart a few forkfuls in i was hit with a rich and fatty taste i thought the fish s flavor wasn t overpowering and the fried skin added a crisp bite to the dish it was fresh flaky and light and i d happily order barramundi again i spent a morning in my sydney hotel making fairy bread a delightful sugary dish served at australian birthday parties the author tries fairy bread for the first time monica humphries insider during my 10 days in australia the childhood dessert called fairy bread was repeatedly mentioned by aussies locals told me the sugary treat was a staple at kids birthday parties fairy bread involves three simple ingredients plain white bread butter and hundreds and thousands which is the aussie phrase for sprinkles the same australians also told me it s unlikely i ll find it on any restaurant or café menu it s more of a celebratory homemade dish they said but with easy instructions and just a few ingredients i decided to make it myself from a hotel room in sydney i slathered butter on untoasted white bread and coated it in sprinkles after a bite i was nostalgic for my childhood i grew up eating cinnamon sugar toast and the sweet and salty combination from fairy bread felt reminiscent of that treat while i didn t think fairy bread was a culinary marvel it was a fun dish to recreate and taste in the land down under i had a flaky vegetarian version of a sausage roll at a bakery in surry hills the sausage roll from bourke street bakery in australia monica humphries insider in cafés bakeries gas stations and all across australia hungry people can find sausage rolls the dish is comprised of sausage meat wrapped in flaky pastry dough and baked it s a typical quick meal for australians and while it s often sausage inside the roll i noticed bakeries have recreated the dish using everything from lamb to beef bourke street bakery in the surry hills neighborhood in new south wales serves a vegetarian version of the dish finding a vegetarian roll was a bit of a challenge and i was thrilled to find one filled with eggplant chickpeas and spinach it was also served with a side of tomato sauce for dipping which is australia s version of ketchup while my lunch lacked meat i got a strong sense of the dish and easily understood why it s beloved by so many aussies i couldn t complain about yummy warm filling wrapped up in flaky dough and thought the tomato sauce added a sweet and tangy flavor i walked away from the bakery with crumbs coating my mouth and was shocked that these sausage rolls aren t more common in america like sausage rolls meat pies are another popular grab and go meal i regularly spotted in australia a meat pie served on a flight in australia monica humphries insider a meat pie is a single serving savory pie made with a shortcrust base and filled with meat vegetables and gravy according to g day gourmet like sausage rolls they re served with tomato sauce too the same source reports that australians eat 270 million meat pies each year across australia i often spotted meat pies sold next to sausage rolls the two dishes are similar in concept meaty fillings surrounded by a flaky crust the main difference i found between the two was that meat pies seem to have more moisture than sausage rolls i had a couple of vegetarian pies throughout australia it was a snack served on my flight between cairns and sydney and i eyed them in a gas station in the town of innisfail after tasting a few myself i understood why they re so popular i thought the pies were rich and filling and they reminded me of pot pies i ve in the us with warm hearty gravy surrounding juicy vegetables an australian pub staple i dined on salt and pepper calamari at a casual bar in mena creek in queensland a plate with salt and pepper calamari monica humphries insider according to taste atlas salt and pepper calamari is a popular dish served in australia that s inspired by chinese cuisine and made by coating squid in a batter seasoned with salt and pepper before frying it salt and pepper calamari is a pub staple according to cnn sure enough i had the australian dish at mena creek hotel s pub in queensland a few minutes after ordering a waitress came out with a large plate piled high were fries a side salad and the crispy battered calamari the calamari were nugget shaped instead of the usual rings i m familiar with and i thought that it was much more tender than what i ve had in the us plus the greasy dish had the ideal batter to squid ratio and i easily scarfed the entire plate down it s not a trip to australia without vegemite i tried it but i m not sure i ll be eating it again anytime soon vegemite butter and toast is a common breakfast in australia monica humphries insider vegemite is a thick dark spread made of yeast onion malt and celery it is popular across the continent and according to the new york times about 22 million jars are consumed by australians annually while it might have the same color and texture as nutella another popular spread vegemite is savory and salty when i decided to try it australians told me to scrape a thin thin layer of vegemite on buttered toast i did just that and unfortunately it wasn t to my taste it was too salty for me and since the butter i used was already salted the toast was overwhelmed by sodium i was thrilled to finally try the spread i ve seen for years but the next time i m offered a slice of vegemite toast i ll likely pass but i did love australia s treasured tim tams insider s author tasted nine flavors of tim tams monica humphries insider as i was packing my bags multiple friends begged me to save room in my suitcase to bring them back boxes of tim tams which are a popular australian biscuit or for american readers otherwise known as a cookie a tim tam is made of a cream filling sandwiched between two biscuits and coated in chocolate they re produced by the australian biscuit company arnott s and were first introduced to australians in 1964 according to national today today australian grocery stores stock a variety of tim tam flavors including salted caramel brownie white chocolate dark chocolate and dark chocolate raspberry tart and according to mashed australians consume 45 million boxes every year to see what the hype was about i tried nine different flavors of tim tams ultimately the original milk chocolate tim tam ranked supreme in my taste test i m partial to milk chocolate and didn t love some of the flavors like raspberry plus i thought the original tim tam had the best ratio of cookie coating and filling and yes i did manage to stuff a few boxes in my suitcase to bring back to america i ll be ordering another lamington the next time i m back in australia lamingtons are individual cakes coated in chocolate and coconut monica humphries insider the lamington is known as the national cake of australia according to cnn the dessert is an individual sponge cake shaped like a cube coated in chocolate and tossed in coconut often there s a layer of cream and jam inside australians told me the lamington has a few origin stories all dating back to around 1900 according to the ferguson plarre bakehouse the creation of the dish was accidental a servant for lord lamington who was the governor of queensland between 1896 and 1901 mistakenly dropped a cake in melted chocolate lord lamington didn t want to waste the dish so he suggested coating it in coconut and serving it the same source said australian food timeline on the other hand reports that the dish was likely created by lord lamington s french chef armand galland he was tasked with feeding unexpected guests and took an old sponge cake cut it into cubes dipped it in chocolate and coated it in coconut the guests and lord lamington loved the dish so much that it became a staple according to this second source while i can t be sure which story is true i did want to try it i grabbed a lamington from a food stand inside the sydney airport and i ll admit it wasn t as impressive as i hoped the cake itself was dry and the layer of cream was thin i thought plus i wished it had jam which would ve added fruity flavor to the dessert but a lamington has all the components of desserts i love i m a big fan of cakes i love sweet coconut and chocolate is easily my favorite treat so i haven t ruled australia s national cake out just yet and i ll be tracking it down at a reputable australian bakery the next time i m in the country i indulged in homegrown passion fruit during australia s winter passion fruit grown in australia monica humphries insider australia is home to a variety of tropical fruits and thanks to the country s climate places like queensland can grow fruit year round according to travel nq even though i was visiting during australia s winter i saw piles of mangoes pineapples and bananas in grocery stores and when i arrived at an airbnb in innisfail my host left behind a bowl of passion fruit grown in her backyard she told me that she grew more than she could imagine eating and hoped i d help make a dent in her stockpile the fruits looked similar to the passiflora edulis variety which according to passionfruit australia is the most popular passion fruit grown in the country i couldn t remember if i had tasted fresh passion fruit before and i often don t love the flavor of artificial passion fruit in candies so i initially didn t think i d like it but i cut one open anyway and after scooping out a spoonful of the bright yellow pearls i realized i was wrong the juicy fruit was both sweet and sour and i ate every last seed there are still plenty of aussies foods i didn t get to try which is the perfect excuse for another trip to the country the author in surry hills australia monica humphries insider while i tried plenty of new foods in 10 days i only scratched the surface of australia s culinary offerings i didn t get my hands on pavlova which is a dessert that australians and new zealanders debate over ownership and i missed an opportunity to try kangaroo so if australia s breathtaking scenery welcoming people and endless adventure weren t enough to entice me back the food sure will read the original article on insider
2022 wasn t as defined by the coronavirus pandemic as 2020 or 2021 but it was still marred by its fallout war a tightening economy and major shifts in the global world order contributed to a sense of continued tough times ahead perhaps not coincidentally a recent poll found that about 4 in 10 americans believe we re currently living in the end times that said 2022 did have its silver linings those moments where hope for the future shined through something we like to do here at future perfect is reflect back on the wins that might have gotten lost in the very understandable noise from knocking asteroids out of the sky to becoming one step closer to having cell cultivated meat on the table 2022 saw progress in scientific research and policy that could define and improve the trajectory of human development for years to come it s hard to feel optimistic especially as the uncertainty of 2023 approaches but if our capacity for discovery collaboration and altruism can prove anything it s that progress can be a refreshing source of hope here are the nine breakthroughs this year that made us excited about progress izzie ramirez the us was able to slow the spread of mpox virus this winter season americans are facing an uptick in covid flu and rsv a tripledemic as some public health experts call it however it s not all bad news the spread of mpox formerly known as monkeypox has slowed in the us mpox a flu like disease that creates painful blisters and rashes was first confirmed in the us in a boston patient in may since then there have been 20 deaths from the virus and nearly 30 000 cases according to the centers for disease control and prevention at the outbreak s peak in early august the daily average in the us was up to 462 mpox cases as of now though the daily average is just five cases while it took time for the us to declare mpox a public health emergency which ramped up vaccine distribution and data sharing between cities and states over 1 1 million doses of the two part mpox vaccine have been administered since june this is despite the fact the distribution of pre existing mpox vaccines were delayed by the need for states to manually request doses from the national stockpile which was severely depleted due to bureaucratic hold ups and logistics issues the willingness of high risk individuals to adjust their lifestyle to avoid infection also contributed to the declining rate of infection as noah weiland reported for the new york times in fact it was lgbtq activists who pushed the biden administration to declare an emergency declaration it helped that unlike covid mpox is not an airborne illness and is transmitted via direct contact with an infected individual making it much easier to curb the spread given the current course of the virus the department of health and human services has said it will not renew the state of emergency beyond january 31 america s efficient handling of the mpox virus provides hope that the spread of other such viruses can be stopped if communities follow guidance from health care professionals and advocate for more resources rachel durose nasa successfully flew a spacecraft into a targeted asteroid marking a crucial first step toward a system of planetary defense some 66 million years ago a giant asteroid struck the earth the impact was so catastrophic that it caused the most recent of five mass extinction events wiping out 75 percent of the planet s species including the dinosaurs and if the heavens were to hurl a similar asteroid toward us once again we wouldn t have been much better prepared than the dinosaurs that is until the evening of september 26 that night nasa successfully crashed its double asteroid redirection test dart spacecraft into the asteroid moonlet dimorphos which orbits a larger asteroid called didymos more than 7 million miles away from earth the double asteroid posed no threat to our planet but they were great test subjects to see whether humanity could one day protect itself from a proven existential risk for the past two decades nasa has scanned the skies and cataloged near earth objects sizable enough to pose a threat to civilization thankfully with 95 percent of known objects tracked none appear to be heading our way anytime soon but seeing them coming is one thing surviving them is another dart s targeted collision demonstrated the first successful deflection technology moving dimorphos 1 percent closer to didymos an asteroid of truly threatening size would be far harder to deflect but at least now we know such a planetary defense system is actually possible oshan jarow after decades of prohibition government funded psychedelic research is back psychedelics got a rough start in the us early research in the 1950s and 60s was generally promising though it existed on a spectrum that included overhyped and methodologically suspect results but as psychedelics helped fuel a rising moral panic in the 1960s and the war on drugs escalated president richard nixon ultimately outlawed psychedelics among other drugs under the controlled substances act in 1970 and federal funding for psychedelic research froze a renaissance in psychedelic research began in the mid 2000s but until now the research was privately funded limiting both the resources and the momentum to further develop a field that has shown real promise around mental health building off a successful 2014 pilot study however the national institutes of health handed johns hopkins medicine 4 million last october to research whether psilocybin the active ingredient in psychedelic mushrooms could help people quit smoking this was the first federal grant for psychedelic research in over 50 years and it came from the largest funder of biomedical research in the world getting the government back on board marks a major shift in institutional support this march president joe biden announced initiatives to address the nation s mental health crisis including boosting system capacity connecting more americans to care and expanding resources as well as protections from the potential harms of social media for young people psychedelics could add a timely new tool in addition to efficacy in potentially treating conditions like depression addiction and post traumatic stress disorder the benefits appear uniquely long lasting after just a single dose states too are taking notice 25 states have considered psychedelic policy reform and colorado recently joined oregon as the second to legalize psychedelics for medicinal purposes but if the benefits of psychedelics are uniquely potent so too is the need for careful research and risk management back in the government s good graces psychedelic research now has the resources available to do just that oj from covid 19 to malaria it looks like we re entering a golden age in vaccine development vaccine development is ordinarily a sluggish process historically the time between finding the microbe causing the disease and developing a vaccine has averaged about 48 years excluding smallpox and covid 19 according to the center for global development only about 39 6 percent of privately developed vaccines succeed in clinical trials the number is even lower 6 8 percent for those developed outside of private industry such as through academic hospitals against this backdrop consider 2020 s covid 19 vaccines the period from sequencing the virus to developing a candidate vaccine strain was roughly two days within less than a year the vaccine received emergency use authorization and began reaching the population within less than two years the food and drug administration granted full approval beyond regulatory miracles the covid 19 vaccine put over a decade of research into mrna technology into practice heralding a new generation of vaccines but covid 19 vaccines were only one among a flurry of breakthroughs malaria which infected 247 million people in 2021 and killed 619 000 saw a series of positive developments on the vaccine front after roughly 60 years of effort 2021 saw the first malaria vaccine approved by the world health organization offering a 30 percent reduction in severe malaria 2022 s improved version of the vaccine is already showing promise in clinical trials reaching 80 percent efficacy after three doses and a booster while early signs are promising the vaccine will need to pass further clinical trials before receiving approval another multi decade search this time for a universal flu vaccine also found an answer at least in mice and ferrets each year seasonal flu vaccines are tailored to whichever of the 20 known strains of influenza are predicted to be most prevalent that season in november the mrna technology employed in covid 19 vaccines was used to develop a flu vaccine that offers protection against all 20 influenza strains the vaccine would not replace seasonal flu shots but it would dampen the severity of cases by increasing baseline levels of immune protection despite performing well in animal trials the vaccine still awaits clinical trials in humans and finally the first human trials for a new hiv vaccine successfully produced protective antibodies in 97 percent of recipients the results offer hope that we might curb the spread of hiv which newly infected an estimated 1 5 million people in 2021 one might hope that catastrophe isn t a necessary ingredient for progress but for deadly diseases like covid 19 malaria influenza and hiv this year offered hope that in the future prevention may prevail oj the hole in earth s ozone layer is shrinking the ozone hole is the unnatural human caused thinning of the part of the atmosphere that absorbs ultraviolet radiation when scientists discovered the growing hole in the 1970s it was predicted that if no action was taken the entire ozone layer would collapse by 2050 georgiana gilgallon then the future of life institute s director of communications told vox s kelsey piper in 2021 if this happened marine ecosystems would be disrupted and ultraviolet radiation exposure would cause increasing rates of cancer but now thanks to collective global action kicked off by the montreal protocol in 1987 limiting the use of ozone harming chemicals the ozone layer is on track to fully recover by 2060 according to the united nations environment programme in 2019 earth s ozone hole was at its smallest since scientists began monitoring the area in 1982 in the following years 2020 and 2021 the hole expanded but this year it shrank once more as of 2022 the average size of the ozone hole had shrunk to approximately 8 91 million square miles compared to an average of approximately 9 1 million square miles in 2020 the shrinking ozone hole serves as proof that when international policies are enacted and followed the future of our planet can be changed for the better rachel durose the fda approves a form of cultivated lab grown meat upside foods a bay area based startup gained fda approval last month to sell its cultivated chicken to consumers while it still needs approval from the us department of agriculture before it can be sold to consumers the fda s step brings such lab grown meat one step closer to markets cultivated meat is slaughter free it s grown in a lab from animal cells in bioreactors rather than harvested from a slaughtered animal the end product is meat that tastes just like the real thing because biologically at least it is the real thing once upside foods gets its usda approval it will partner with chef dominique crenn to bring cultivated chicken to atelier crenn her acclaimed three michelin star restaurant in san francisco however for cultivated chicken to make it from michelin star restaurants to the plates of everyday people scalability must be addressed as reported by joe fassler for the counter the industry still faces major technological and economic challenges as well as a need for more public funding if it is ever going to reach price parity with factory farmed meat vox s kenny torrella has reported on whether hybrid meat a blend of cultivated and plant based would be a possible solution to the scale problem the us won t be the first in the world to get cultivated meat to consumers singapore has been selling cultivated meat chicken nuggets since 2020 and israel is likely not far behind after granting 18 million to a cultivated meat consortium earlier this year the fda approval of upside s chicken comes months after president biden s executive order on biotechnology signaled support of cultivated agricultural technologies when npr s allison aubrey tried upside s cultivated chicken she remarked it tastes like chicken to which upside ceo uma valeti replied it is chicken hopefully more people will be able to say the same soon julieta cardenas progress on affordable housing policy in california as of may the median price of a single family home was 898 980 and the required annual income to purchase such a home was 180 000 as journalist ryan lillis reported for the sacramento bee there were approximately 173 800 unhoused people living in california according to an october calmatters analysis of data collected by the us department of housing and urban development those two facts are inextricably connected as jerusalem demsas wrote recently for the atlantic a driving factor in homelessness is simply the high price of housing which in turn is chiefly caused by too few places to live one way to change that is to make it easier to build new housing or modify existing stock to allow more units that s why it was good news that in 2021 to address california s growing affordability and homelessness crisis the state government passed the california housing opportunity and more efficiency home act the home act also called senate bill 9 allows homeowners to divide their single family properties into as many as four individual units and went into effect in 2022 despite criticism of the bill on the basis that it lowers surrounding property values the university of california berkeley s terner center for housing innovation estimated the law could potentially lead to the creation of 700 000 new homes if implemented correctly the law could serve as a model for other legislators looking to solve their respective states housing crises rd guaranteed income pilot programs proliferate across the us once thought of as a pipe dream guaranteed income programs which aim to give people no strings attached cash in order to mitigate poverty are gaining more traction in the us the growth this year includes groups like mayors for a guaranteed income a coalition of city leaders in favor of cash payments that now has 82 mayors on board across 29 states the types of programs expanded as well with nonprofits in alachua county florida giving formerly incarcerated people cash while in california unhoused students in 12th grade may be getting cash assistance to combat the summer slump to help them access higher education these pilot programs will directly help some people in need while also generating evidence on the benefits of giving people money directly while opponents have argued that many people would misuse direct cash payments and that such programs would disincentivize work those critiques are looking increasingly shaky guaranteed income increases employment and people tend to buy what they need according to the latest data tracking pilot programs by stanford upenn and mayors for a guaranteed income guaranteed income programs have been especially important for single and low income parents while such early efforts haven t been enough to address the recent spike in child poverty which rose by 41 percent when the expanded child tax credit ended earlier this year they represent a move in the right direction leading the way toward state policy is california which intends to give over 25 5 million to seven pilot programs across the state if successful it s entirely possible that other states and perhaps one day the federal government will devote more public funds to assist the most vulnerable without fiscal paternalism reducing the stress of poverty allows people to create more security for themselves and their families jc the inflation reduction act provided unprecedented funding for climate action despite its name the inflation reduction act which passed in august is likely the most significant piece of legislation to address climate change ever to come out of congress the law devotes 369 billion collected from funding sources such as a 15 percent corporate minimum tax rate prescription drug pricing reform and irs tax enforcement to ambitious policies that range from clean energy tax breaks to manufacturing batteries domestically three separate analyses by rhodium group energy innovation and princeton university are projecting a 40 percent cut in pollution from 2005 levels by 2030 as a result of ira spending the inflation reduction act also created the us s first methane fee which will charge oil and gas companies a starting rate of 900 per metric ton of methane a potent greenhouse gas by 2026 that will increase to 1 500 per metric ton the inflation reduction act further allocates 60 billion for environmental justice priorities including several measures to address air pollution improve quality of life and provide affordable clean energy to disadvantaged communities and in a big win for the agricultural sector 20 billion will be used to make farmland more environmentally friendly as approximately 11 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the us come from agriculture this money will create habitats for pollinators and aims to make farms more resilient as extreme weather continues to threaten crops 2022 was the year the us proved that legislation centering climate action can pass even if it needed to be framed as a measure to fight inflation now let s see where 2023 will take us jc

when it comes to christmas dinner most of us have a pretty clear idea of what to expect turkey with all the trimmings lashings of gravy and more cheese than we can handle the last thing we d probably imagine eating on the big day is kfc but it turns out that this is exactly what people in japan do the unusual christmas tradition began in the 1970s when the manager of the first japanese branch takeshi okawara had the festive idea in a dream advert he thought it would be great if the american chain offered its japanese customers a party barrel for the holidays alamy quality stock apparently he got the idea after overhearing foreign customers complaining that they d be bereft without a turkey at christmas as the holiday isn t traditionally celebrated in japan this is because only a very small fraction of the japanese population is christian around one percent although in recent years more people have been marking the holiday in some way advert while okawara wasn t planning to change up the kfc menu to offer turkey he concluded that festive chicken would be a great alternative and got to work on his party barrel this eventually resulted in what was known as kurisumasu ni wa kentakkii or kentucky for christmas and it proved to be an instant hit the party barrel went down a storm with people in japan because they were apparently longing to get in on the christmas action according to joonas rokka an associate professor of marketing at emlyon business school in france he told the bbc it filled a void advert there was no tradition of christmas in japan and so kfc came in and said this is what you should do on christmas alamy cum okolo the fast food giant now advertises the festive barrels as very much a family activity showing pictures of happy families crowding around theirs they don t just contain chicken and its many forms either and now the party barrels contain cake and wine too advert back in 2016 there were a number of festive packages available including a box of chicken for 3 780 yen 28 23 or you could bag yourself a premium whole chicken and sides for 5 800 yen 43 36 naturally these are promoted by colonel sanders in a santa suit however while the people in japan can t get enough of kfc at christmas it s been speculated that the tradition is unlikely to take off elsewhere in fact kevin gillespie a kfc chef in the chain s home state of georgia said he d be pretty angry if someone suggested kfc at christmas alamy lt kfc on christmas it s one of the strangest things i ve heard he said if you brought a bucket of fried chicken to christmas dinner honestly i d be mad at you advert professor rokka said that this unusual festive tradition is ultimately a byproduct of globalisation this is another sign of globalisation where consumer rituals spread to other countries and often get translated in different ways he said it s not abnormal now to have an ikea store everywhere in the world this kfc for christmas is just taking our consumerism and turning it into a holiday to put the scale of kfc at christmas s popularity into context the chain see its japanese profits skyrocket in december and it s estimated that 3 6 million japanese families have some finger lickin goodness on the big day itself featured image credit reuters jeremy sutton hibbert alamy stock photo topics kfc christmas food and drink

many americans are struggling to get through this christmas season because of inflation and the dramatically higher cost of living that kind of pressure can tempt us to think the economics of christmas center around the price of gifts and the costs of entertaining those things are important but it is not where christians should be focused on christmas morning instead we should think about christ s role of redeemer a fundamentally economic term the word redeem can take several connotations each with subtle distinctions but they are all rooted in an idea of exchange one thing is exchanged for another at a cost when you redeem a coupon for instance you must sacrifice it to receive some discount or other benefit related judge andrew p napolitano what if christmas is real the coupon s value is not realized until it is given up or sacrificed just like in the case of a share of stock that has appreciated in price the owner of that stock does not realize the gain until the stock is sold only then can he or she receive any money from the sale before that any increase in the stock s price is called an unrealized gain if christ is our redeemer then something had to have been exchanged or sacrificed it was christ himself who filled that void becoming not just the high priest who offered a sacrifice but the sacrifice itself even before he was crucified christ s incarnation was a sacrifice he humbled himself to share in our humanity that we might share in his divinity and he was not born in a luxurious palace but a barn because his entire life on earth from beginning to end was a sacrifice his humble birthplace bore evidence to the fact that christ came not to be comfortable but to die there are few better illustrations of this than the second verse of the christmas carol what child is this which is worth quoting in full why lies he in such mean estate where ox and ass are feeding good christians fear for sinners here the silent word is pleading nails spear shall pierce him through the cross be borne for me for you hail hail the word made flesh the babe the son of mary god so loved humanity than he paid the ultimate price his only son his own self to redeem us from our own fallen nature but that sacrifice tells us just as much about humanity as it does the infiniteness of god s love everything is worth what its purchaser will pay for it and god purchased our redemption with his own life something incomprehensibly beyond measure the value we should place on human life therefore should be equally beyond measure anything less is to devalue human life and indirectly reject god s gift by his life death and resurrection christ implicitly told the world that the human soul was worth a divine sacrifice and nothing could be more valuable than that we remember this great gift of god s when we share the wonderful tradition of giving presents at christmastime in doing so we sacrifice our own earnings and wealth so that we might give to others and while these small acts of redemption appear entirely material in nature there is a deeper reality at play especially at christmas a present for someone else tells that person that he or she means more to you than whatever you sacrificed in order to give them that gift just like when the redeemer told us our salvation meant more to him than his own life may god bless you this christmas e j antoni is a research fellow for regional economics in the heritage foundation s center for data analysis and a senior fellow at committee to unleash prosperity the views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the daily caller news foundation all content created by the daily caller news foundation an independent and nonpartisan newswire service is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience all republished articles must include our logo our reporter s byline and their dcnf affiliation for any questions about our guidelines or partnering with us please contact licensing dailycallernewsfoundation org

florida has something of a reputation for grifters fraudsters and assorted other crooks so it s no surprise that organized crime has a long and sordid history in the state alleged members of la cosa nostra have lived and played here for the past century reader matt dillon wanted to know more of those details as part of our sound off south florida project in which we answer reader submitted questions about life in south florida dillon wrote in to ask i know lots of mobsters lived in fort lauderdale back in the day where did they live truth is back in the day fort lauderdale was not exactly mob city most of the action was a little further south we ll begin at the beginning with perhaps the most infamous mobster of all time in this list that while exhaustive is far from a complete account of every shady mafiosi to live in our sunny state 1920 1930 al scarface capone we ll be including ridiculous mobster nicknames whenever possible purchased his miami beach mansion at 93 palm ave on palm island in 1928 unfortunately for capone he didn t have much time to enjoy the island home as he went to prison for tax evasion in 1932 served seven years while his brain melted from syphilis and then spent his remaining eight years at the mansion where by the time he died in 1947 doctors said he had the mental capacity of a 12 year old the pool house and pool of the waterfront mansion on palm island in miami beach once owned by notorious gangster al capone is shown in this handout photo provided by one sotheby s international realty february 8 2014 but the mansion did give capone a useful alibi for the most violent day of his career on the morning of feb 14 1929 he had an appointment with dade county attorney robert taylor to discuss his business dealings in south florida i am a gambler play racehorses he told the county attorney according to organized crime in miami a 2016 book by mob researcher avi bash later that morning in chicago seven men from a rival gang of capone s were put up against a wall by four men two of them dressed in police uniforms and turned into swiss cheese with a pair of thompson submachine guns an undated photo shows al capone fishing from the waterfront at his mansion on palm island in miami beach capone s mansion is now owned by emanuela verlicchi marazzi the widow of filippo marazzi who was president of the italian ceramic tile company marazzi group the house went on sale in 2018 after major renovations it was listed for 14 9 million capone paid 40 000 then kicked in another 200 000 for upgrades the hangout on its website cap s place the oldest restaurant in broward county touts many of the famous people who have eaten there world leaders like franklin roosevelt and winston churchill the obscenely wealthy including rockefellers and vanderbilts pop culture icons like george harrison and mariah carey also al capone and meyer lansky back when cap knight first opened the place in the 1920s it was a combination bar restaurant and gambling house known as club unique gambling was illegal then but so what it was the 1920s so was alcohol knight conducted his own rum running missions to bimini returning with liquor to stock the bar in his restaurant to this day cap s place located at 2980 n e 31st ave in lighthouse point has a speakeasy feel diners should know that there is no parking instead a ferry shuttles patrons between the restaurant on cap s island to the dock at 2765 n e 28th court the earliest known photograph of cap s place in lighthouse point the picture is on display in the restaurant s dining room 1930 1950 capone s mansion may be the larger than life example of mobsters living in south florida but in terms of numbers hollywood may take the title back in the 1930s and 1940s hallandale beach was filled with casinos carpet joints they called them broward county sheriff walter clark who held his position through most of the two decades despite being thrown out of office by florida s governor in both 1939 and 1950 turned a blind eye to the gambling dens but while their business was in hallandale the mobsters lived in hollywood they raised and had families here so they kept that somewhat clear of their doings and the clubs were in hallandale said hollywood historian joan mickelson alo used the hollywood yacht club as a meeting place and they got together and played cards or something but that wasn t a major place meyer lansky walks his dog in miami in this historical photo in the last couple decades of his life lansky lived in a condo in miami beach vincent jimmy blue eyes alo was one of several gangsters that operated the casinos his places included the colonial inn and the barn according to mickelson alo lived in the 1200 block of monroe street in hollywood alo operated the places in conjunction with meyer and jacob lansky meyer s last home in south florida was on the second floor of the imperial house a condominium that still stands at 5255 collins ave in miami his brother jake lived in the 1100 block of harrison street in hollywood but as pointed out by mickelson who wrote the book a guide to historic hollywood and volunteers at the hollywood historical society alo and lansky were not the first to open casinos in hallandale beach that honor belonged to julian potatoes kaufman according to his 1939 obituary in the chicago tribune kaufman had been a lieutenant in the gang of dean o banion the same gang that lost seven members in the 1929 st valentine s day massacre a 1939 obituary from the chicago tribune calls julian potatoes kaufman a lieutenant of one of al capone s chief rivals in chicago kaufman brought casinos to hallandale beach in the 1930s and 1940s on the run from capone he came down here and realized that hallandale didn t much care what you did mickelson said kaufman opened the plantation casino and the others swiftly followed kaufman lived in the 1200 block of tyler street in a home recently bought by antiques dealer guy bush he had heard only rumors about the home s shady past i heard al capone used to come and play cards in the house in the 20s and 30s bush said and i ve been told somebody was shot and killed on the front steps just down the street from bush s home on tyler street was the home of benjamin eisen who kept books for the lansky brothers and also served as chief financial officer of gulfstream racetrack although kaufman died of a heart attack in 1939 the good times rolled on for the lanskys and alo until sheriff clark was dragged before a senate committee holding hearings on organized crime when he told the committee he had no knowledge of gambling in broward county the audience broke out in laughter in 1950 clark was removed from office for the second and final time although lansky and alo continued to live in south florida they turned their attention elsewhere to cuba and las vegas the hangouts every carpet joint in hallandale beach along with the plantation the barn and the colonial inn there was the club greenacres the club boheme the farm and a number of others none of them still standing 1950 2000 that wasn t the end of mobsters in south

the rest of his life in prison his house was in the 3100 block of northeast 47th street along with the retirees the mob also conducted business in south florida through the latter half of the 20th
