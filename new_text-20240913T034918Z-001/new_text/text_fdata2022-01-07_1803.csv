eric clapton whose fierce opposition to the vaccine mandate aspect of the covid panicdemic is well chronicled released a new song this past christmas eve that was overlooked in the hustle and hassle of the holiday season now that things have calmed down it s well worth taking into consideration heart of a child is an achingly beautiful tune bringing powerful testimony about and against the human toll of covid far separated from the virus itself advertisement atop a gently rolling acoustic bed laced with clapton s soulful melodic genius the lyrics begin with stark clarity put down that gun boy don t blow your life away the song continues clapton imploring a young man grieving in covid enforced isolation his own father s and a friend of clapton s passing to remember his young daughter not depriving her of her father via suicide the video s compelling visuals are shadows of life scenes cast on different walls then erased an unmistakable attack on the aforementioned enforced isolation the song highlights an aspect of covid seldom reported by the officially approved narrative the toll on mental health extracted by prohibiting human contact and interaction out of irrational fear the young are especially susceptible as detailed last year in an american institute for economic research article a back of the envelope calculation shows that compared to 2018 and 2019 deaths per 100k 2020 saw one extra death among those under age five an additional 1 5 deaths among those aged 5 to 14 and a whopping 23 additional deaths among those aged 15 to 24 overall deaths per 100k in this age group jumped from 106 4 per 100k in 2019 to 131 7 per 100k during 2020 that s an increase of 23 and covid only accounts for 1 2 of total deaths in ages 0 24 years advertisement here s a hint the root problem isn t stock issue teenage angst it is telling that those entrusted with the science are noticeably reticent to make definitive statements on the matter instead clinging to new age ish powderpuff fluff mental health implications of this ongoing pandemic might peak much beyond the infection and suicide might add to the fatality burden however the resilience of humankind throughout history during any disaster has been remarkable positivism and hope two salient markers of coping often arise out of collectivism optimism and mutual support global strategies collaborative research and collective responsibility might hopefully enhance the efforts against the dual pandemic of covid 19 and suicide yeah sure makes me want to trust the science a few days ago in my story about john ondrasik s blood on my hands i mentioned how the protest song is making a comeback only this time around conservatives are leading the charge eric clapton s heart of a child is in the same vein while it does not directly address governmental overreach and incompetence in confronting covid it leaves no doubt that it addresses the human toll directly extracted by these failures the late great andrew breitbart was right politics is downstream from culture we who are in the world but not of it should take full advantage of these gifts presented to us by artists spread the word share the music get the message out we can win hearts and minds via song

with the new omicron coronavirus variant spreading like wildfire businesses like bars and restaurants are likely to require proof of vaccination before letting folks in through their doors at least in the states where businesses are allowed to do so like california and new york while the centers for disease control and prevention s cdc covid 19 vaccination cards are simple to read their four by three inch size makes them awkward to carry around because standard wallets are 2 5 by 3 5 inches plus the card s simplicity makes it easy to counterfeit because it consists of regular black ink printed on plain card stock science is on our side we ll help you make sense of it a more convenient and safe way to carry around your vaccine card is through an app digitizing your vax card means pharmacies doctor s offices and service industry businesses can instantly verify your records with a simple scan of the qr code a matrix barcode on your app similar to scanning digital tickets to a concert or digital boarding passes when traveling by plane some users may find it unsettling to store personal health information on their smartphone but it s not any riskier than storing your credit card information in a digital wallet for online payments however not every state or health provider offers a way to digitize your records and there isn t a federal standard either the most common way to digitize your vaccine card at the moment is with a smart health card which is a personalized qr code that verifies your vaccination history when scanned in some states you can access these qr codes directly through your health care provider s app or digital portal allegheny health network based in pittsburgh pennsylvania shows users their qr code directly in their mychart app for instance but in california you must navigate to the state health department website to access your smart health card the commons project foundation a nonprofit organization based in new york city that creates digital platforms for public services developed smart health cards in conjunction with vaccine credential initiative a coalition of public and private health and tech investors smart health cards are the most widely used version of digitized vaccine records in north america says jp pollak co founder and chief architect at the commons project foundation canada and japan have made smart health cards their national standard for digital vaccination records and around a dozen u s states in addition to the eleven that already use smart health cards will be joining the club in the next two to three weeks pollak tells popular mechanics already 11 states and numerous pharmacies and health care providers including walmart cvs and rite aid offer access to your digital vaccine records by issuing smart health cards pharmacies doctor s offices state immunization registries or any entity that has your health information on file can issue these digital cards once you request your card online the office or agency will send you a link to verify your info and download the qr code that serves as your digital vaccine card you can then store that qr code in your photo library or digital wallet such as apple wallet samsung pay or google pay you can also store your smart health card in a specific vaccine card app like several airlines use this for contactless travel common pass excelsior pass new york only myir mobile docket bindle or vaxyes while vaccine card apps are undoubtedly convenient there s always a risk that hackers can compromise your digital information the commons project foundation has taken a few steps to help mitigate this risk pollak says for example your qr code doesn t act as a tracker in other words there s no way someone could figure out where you ve been or track any data on your phone just by scanning the qr code the scan doesn t transmit any personal information anywhere pollak says it only verifies the data posted by the smart health card issuer the smart health card also doesn t require more information than what is on your paper card from the cdc if a vaccine card app requests additional info like your social security number or address you should look for another option although a digital vaccine card won t reveal any data that isn t already on your paper card it s best to be cautious about how you share that information pollak says for example be sure you trust the person or place of business that s scanning your qr code to verify your status and don t leave your qr code open on your phone tempting any scammers to snap a photo of it and use it fraudulently the commons project foundation recommends that businesses download the smart health card verifier app which is a free secure scanner for smart health card qr codes digital vaccine cards have a clear advantage over the paper cards from the cdc in terms of fraud prevention and verifiability but that really only holds up if businesses are actually scanning your qr code pollak says if restaurants and bars for example are just looking at the qr code and not scanning it then people can get away with photoshopped qr codes that make it look like they have a digital vaccine card pollak says as more businesses take steps to curb covid 19 exposure so that they can remain open digital vaccine cards are likely to become commonplace to download your smart health card

you re not supposed to get high off cannabis in kansas but shops across the state sell vaping oil and gummies with cannabis ingredients that ll do the trick and now it appears that anyone caught with them could land in hot water in at least one county shop owners have been put on notice either hand over the goods or police could seize the stuff soon at issue are delta 8 products they often contain only trace amounts of the compound that people traditionally associate with marijuana delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol or thc but they promise buyers something else a molecular variation called delta 8 thc the trend adds a layer of complication for anyone trying to figure out what they can and can t legally do in a state that doesn t allow medical or recreational marijuana but does allow some hemp products with very small amounts of the compounds found in stronger stuff now attorney general derek schmidt says delta 8 is legal only in specific circumstances one of the biggest caveats a product can t contain very much delta 8 the results of his formal position are playing out in the city of hays where the city police and county sheriff could start taking products from shelves but deputy police chief brian dawson says officers plan to ask shop owners to voluntarily turn the stuff in still dawson made clear that police have the discretion to arrest anyone they find in possession of illegal delta 8 products the situation has prompted alarm among advocacy groups who fear law enforcement agencies will embark on a campaign of harassing people and disrupting their businesses we strongly believe the resulting persecution of kansas citizens retailers distributors and ancillary business owners is detrimental to our state and its people several pro cannabis and pro hemp groups said in a press release thursday they are the kansas cannabis chamber of commerce the kansas cannabis coalition planted association of kansas and kansans for hemp in an interview with the kansas news service ellis county attorney robert anderson in hays said the situation is a mess people don t know what s legal most people and these business owners believe that they re selling and possessing lawful products he said i think the legislature should act if they would just make everything legal or make everything illegal and that s in terms of marijuana and hemp it makes it much more clear cut on how we do our job he prosecuted one person who wasn t a shop owner for delta 8 distribution last year and then sent out warnings to shop owners several months ago and again last week cannabis advocates say anderson is imposing legally unjustified and overly strict criminal penalties on delta 8 that should only apply to traditional delta 9 but anderson says he s just doing his job my personal opinion is that marijuana and hemp should be legal or at a very minimum decriminalized he said however as the ellis county attorney i do have a duty to enforce the laws as written how this all started in hays last week anderson wrote to local shops that sell delta 8 asking them to voluntarily hand over products with significant delta 8 levels to law enforcement and promising in return not to prosecute but to understand how things got to that point you have to back up nearly a year anderson says he first became aware early last year of shops selling delta 8 he was pretty sure the products were legal at the time months later the legislature made some tweaks to its hemp law that he felt muddied the waters and made certain delta 8 products illegal he tried asking lawmakers to clarify the matter and turned to the attorney general s office for answers but didn t get much then he prosecuted what may be the state s first delta 8 case a burglar who stole the stuff from a shop the district court judge agreed that the products were illegal because the manufacturer s own documentation showed high levels of delta 8 thc not simply traces of it meanwhile the kansas bureau of investigation prodded the attorney general s office like anderson they wanted schmidt to say how he reads current state law on dec 2 schmidt issued his formal opinion an attorney general s opinion isn t a court ruling but carries some legal weight he concluded delta 8 products are only legal if they contain less than 0 3 thc the same bright line that applies to delta 9 thc levels moreover delta 8 thc is only allowed in products produced from industrial hemp in other words the products can t come from the type of potent cannabis plants used to produce the typical intoxication inducing marijuana that people drive to say colorado for so the legality or illegality lies in the specifics of any given product and the cutoff is 0 3 the situation echoes past confusion over full spectrum cbd products research has shown delta 8 products are most popular in states where consumers can t get the real deal marijuana rich in delta 9 existing in that gray area has also drawn warnings from groups like the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws or norml it cautions consumers against buying delta 8 products because they are untested and may contain impurities what happens next in ellis county anderson doesn t have much appetite for prosecuting business owners he says he asked local law enforcement to wait for months while he sought clarification they ve been very much ready to do their job and act he said and they ve been very patient with me in my requests for them to hold off and make sure that we are absolutely certain that we know what the law is and how to enforce it with schmidt s formal opinion he says the matter is now clear and he says many delta 8 vaping products and edibles exceed kansas 0 3 threshold according to lab analyses disclosed by the manufacturers so on dec 29 he sent letters to local shops informing them of schmidt s decision and offering a final warning this office cannot continue to request that law enforcement in ellis county not act the letter says the best thing you can do to rid yourself of these products is to call law enforcement advise them that you are in possession of these products and request that they come seize them dawson the

perhaps it s only right for a story about a convicted criminal to start with a confession the following is a partial list of the media i have consumed on the topic of elizabeth holmes no relation recently convicted of four fraud related charges for lying to investors in her company theranos the john carreyrou book bad blood secrets and lies in a silicon valley startup the john carreyrou podcast bad blood the final chapter the abc podcast the dropout the alex gibney documentary the inventor out for blood in silicon valley i have listened to the carreyrou book on audio twice i have watched the gibney documentary i believe three times if theranos fever is a disease i am the patient who kept going back and putting my mouth directly on the water fountain no matter how many times they tell me to stop making myself sick all over again the draw of the scam part of this i admit is rooted in a more general weakness for stories about brazen grabs for other people s money particularly people who have a lot of it people who have enough money that they buy magic beans the painting magic beans the stock magic beans the experience there were two documentaries in 2019 about the ill fated fyre festival and i watched both i would have watched three who am i kidding i would have watched ten that iconic and possibly apocryphal cheese sandwich i love sour grapes about rich types who paid small fortunes for counterfeit wine and made you look a true story about fake art about a massive bamboozle involving paintings as it related to investors theranos has always been for me a bit like magic beans the startup something rich people invested in because other rich people were doing it and said they should do it too and when the magic evaporated well all those rich people were furious if you take this comparison to its logical conclusion here s the question was elizabeth holmes the seller or was she in fact the beans did she make the shiny object or was she herself the shiny object if you have thus far avoided theranos fever some basics holmes was a young stanford dropout who wanted to be the steve jobs of biotech when she was still in college she had this idea that you could put a patch on your arm that would detect your medical problem and administer your medications through your skin when i try to envision this it s always on george jetson she carried her jobs iness through her adoption of a black turtleneck uniform her hiring of people who came from apple and her apparent conviction that a slick looking interface was the lever you pulled to make money come out later she began to follow her dream of making a machine that could run hundreds of medical tests on a couple of drops of blood from pricking your finger she raised a fortune from investors got on the cover of fortune hobnobbed with political and financial mucky mucks of many stripes was hailed as the rare woman to break through the very male world of silicon valley startup founders and then saw it all go to pieces when it turned out that the machines didn t work the way she hoped and she according to the charges on which she was just convicted didn t tell her investors the truth elizabeth holmes belongs to a robust cohort of startup founders who have seen their reputations tank wework s ousted adam neumann saying a 47 billion valuation might just have warped his perspective is amazing but there s something about the brazenness with which she operated that makes her mesmerizing to me you can keep your high level financial maneuvers and your sophisticated document manipulations according to carreyrou s reporting and some of the trial testimony theranos got around demands for demonstrations of its machines with painfully obvious dodges moves about as complicated as making beeping noises with your mouth to make a toddler think you re a robot maybe it was her capacity for invention after all not invention of the machine but invention of herself self made indeed i keep asking myself how did any of this work on anybody how did she have two former secretaries of state on her board henry kissinger and george schultz both over 90 years old and wiggle around the doubts about her motives that one would think decades of experience in diplomacy would instill how did a company like walgreens which undoubtedly wouldn t change the length of the tail on the w logo without being certain that they understood every last possible consequence spend 140 million on a doomed deal with theranos maybe it was her capacity for invention after all not invention of the machine but invention of herself consider this elizabeth holmes was touted at one point as the youngest ever woman self made billionaire but forbes revised her net worth from billions to zero in a single year and it wasn t because she gave all that money away or spent it on candy and magazines it just no longer existed it s almost charming the verve of this particular kind of operator right imagine i walked up to you with my hand held behind my back and i told you i had a unicorn horn of potentially unlimited value imagine i offered you a one percent interest in my unicorn horn which you have not seen yet for 10 000 and imagine you believed me you paid me the money on the one hand i only have 10 000 but on the other i own a unicorn horn that has been valued by the market at one million dollars i am a self made millionaire you may have never even seen the unicorn horn but i have the proof of its worth your belief in me has defined me how impressive someone might say when walking past me that yesterday she was broke and today she is a self made millionaire in this example i do not actually have a unicorn horn of course and i don t have a million dollars but i have a story and elizabeth holmes did not have operational technology that could do hundreds of tests on a finger prick s worth of blood and she did not have billions of dollars but she had a story jeff chiu ap ap elizabeth holmes speaks at the fortune global forum in san francisco in 2015 underestimate her at your peril we come inevitably to this most of the purveyors of magic beans who have become cultural and sometimes criminal legends have been men plenty of people before me have spent considerable time since holmes came to power analyzing the complicated gender dynamics around her rise and fall we know sexism is rampant in tech in silicon valley in press coverage in everything no one gets the chance to opt out of all relevant context she s sometimes argued that the treatment of her has been sexist compared to the treatment of other similarly sketchy startup founders and it probably has been at times why wouldn t it be how couldn t it be but the gender dynamics in the theranos story pull in multiple directions skepticism lack of faith in one s work and ability can be the result of bias but maybe in this case the many powerful men pulled into her orbit as investors or board members or public allies or in some cases credulous journalists were less skeptical of her than they might have been if she weren t a young woman maybe they just didn t have their antennae up when you see the way men like george schultz acted around her it doesn t seem patronizing as much as just paternal introducing her in 2015 schultz said his first thought when he met her was that she seemed like a friend of his granddaughter s he claimed that he quickly realized he d underestimated her and he began to rave about her accomplishments but did he really understand the ways he d underestimated her what if the most important sexist misapprehension of elizabeth holmes was that some of her backers believed young women to be less driven less capable and therefore less dangerous to take at their word than young men what if they underestimated not just her abilities but also her ruthlessness what if she keenly understood sexism and used it to her advantage and what if given the way silicon valley works the way tech works the way big money works a woman less willing to exploit sexism would not have stood a chance what if the most important sexist misapprehension of elizabeth holmes was that some of her backers believed young women to be less driven less capable and therefore less dangerous to take at their word than young men what if they underestimated not just her abilities but also her ruthlessness vanessa friedman wrote in the new york times recently about holmes image makeover before and at her trial she described it as a transformation from black clad genius to besuited milquetoast whatever the purpose of that change was it s hard to deny that the elizabeth holmes of her trial was a very different one from the elizabeth you will see in any footage that was taken during the highest highs of her publicity swings as the aforementioned theranos enthusiast i am i almost didn t recognize her the first time i saw her during her trial different hair different makeup different clothes different bearing the abandonment of every element of her theranos era style except of course her deep voice which i have considered mostly a distraction if she artificially started speaking in a lower voice at some point because people didn t take her seriously that s a modest and understandable manipulation this question also got a lot more prickly when holmes testified about sexual and emotional abuse she said she suffered at the hands of sunny balwani her significantly older former boyfriend and her number two at theranos raising the issue of intimate partner abuse in the context of this trial to suggest balwani was really the driver of the bad acts at theranos was really complicated to navigate only partly because so much of what had been reported about elizabeth holmes had focused on how forceful she was how in charge more to come pop culture is not through with elizabeth holmes apple has a movie coming perhaps not the connection to apple that holmes dreamed of in which jennifer lawrence will play her adam mckay the big short is directing so it s probably not going to be a particularly flattering portrait hulu has a limited series coming much sooner in march in which holmes is played by amanda seyfried there were two podcasts at least one big book a big documentary it only makes sense that there will be two high profile fictional elizabeths as well i know myself i will watch both copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

new york jan 6 2022 prnewswire pomerantz llp announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against peloton interactive inc peloton or the company nasdaq pton and certain of its officers the class action filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york and docketed under 21 cv 10266 is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired peloton s common stock between december 9 2020 and november 4 2021 inclusive the class period the claims asserted herein are alleged against peloton and certain of the company s senior executives collectively defendants and arise under sections 10 b and 20 a of the securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act and u s securities and exchange commission sec rule 10b 5 promulgated thereunder if you are a shareholder who purchased peloton common stock during the class period you have until january 18 2022 to ask the court to appoint you as lead plaintiff for the class a copy of the complaint can be obtained at www pomerantzlaw com to discuss this action contact robert s willoughby at or 888 476 6529 or 888 4 pomlaw toll free ext 7980 those who inquire by e mail are encouraged to include their mailing address telephone number and the number of shares purchased based in new york city peloton is a fitness equipment and media company during the class period peloton sold internet connected stationary bicycles and treadmills that were designed and marketed for use in customers homes the bicycles and treadmills include connected touchscreen devices through which customers can access exercise classes and other content to that end in addition to the exercise equipment peloton sells monthly subscription services that allow customers to access fitness classes using their peloton equipment or alternatively to access classes and related content on their own devices without using peloton equipment for most of 2020 and 2021 as the covid 19 pandemic and related stay at home orders and business closures largely kept individuals out of the gym the demand for in home exercise options increased dramatically against that backdrop in the months leading up to the class period peloton experienced unprecedented demand for its products and services as defendant john foley foley confirmed in statements to investors on february 11 2021 there s been crazy demand for our products because gyms have been closed or you didn t want to go to the gym because you might get covid there so the demand has been through the roof the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants repeatedly and falsely assured investors that peloton s recent success was not primarily due to covid related increased demand but rather that the company s growth and financial results were sustainable and would continue post covid for example on december 9 2020 the first day of the class period in response to an investor s question about how a post covid world impacts view of business opportunity defendant foley assured investors that peloton s results ha nothing to do with covid that is a human need of i want to get fit i want fitness in my life in a consistent way i want it to be convenient i want it to be fun i want it to be motivating and i want it to be a great value and all of those things are foundational to what peloton delivers always delivered it we delivered it in pre covid during covid and we will deliver it post covid defendants also represented to investors during the class period that investments in the company s supply chain including increasing the number of bikes and treadmills produced and reducing the average time it takes to deliver products to customers were sound investments that would enable peloton to align supply and demand for its products for example on february 4 2021 in a letter to peloton shareholders the company stated that our supply chain investments over the last several months are helping us better match our supply and demand going forward accordingly defendants represented that the rising inventory levels reported in the company s periodic financial reports filed with the sec during the class period reflected outstanding demand including orders that had not yet been filled rather than excess supply that outpaced waning demand defendants class period representations that peloton would continue to succeed and grow post covid were false in truth peloton s class period financial results were primarily driven by covid related increases in demand for at home exercise options as gyms have reopened and other outside the home exercise options have become more available because of covid vaccinations being more widespread and other covid related restrictions abating demand for peloton s equipment and subscription services have declined substantially moreover rather than matching supply and demand peloton had a massive growth in inventory that far exceeded customer demand further the company has admitted that it suffered from a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting during the class period specifically concerning inventory levels in light of that material weakness the company could not accurately report its inventory levels and had no sound basis to represent to investors that supply and demand were aligned the truth began to emerge on august 26 2021 after the market closed when peloton disclosed one day in advance of its announcement of the company s financial results for its fiscal year 2021 that in the course of our fiscal 2021 audit process a material weakness was identified in our internal controls over financial reporting with respect to identification and valuation of inventory in the company s annual report for its fiscal year 2021 filed with the sec on form 10 k on august 27 2021 it further disclosed that this material weakness arose because our controls were not effectively designed documented and maintained to verify that our physical inventory counts were correctly counted and communicated for reporting in our financial statements as a result of these disclosures the price of peloton common stock declined by 9 75 per share or 8 5 from a closing price of 114 09 per share on august 26 2021 to a closing price of 104 34 per share on august 27 2021 at the same time however peloton made false reassuring statements to investors including issuing guidance of 5 4 billion of total revenue for fiscal year 2022 beginning september 1 2021 representing 34 year over year growth discussing that guidance defendant jill woodworth claimed that we are entering fiscal 2022 with a normalized backlog for our bike portfolio and guidance reflects our expectation of continued strong demand then on november 4 2021 after the market closed peloton shocked investors when it disclosed that it had revised its full year revenue guidance down to a range of 4 4 to 4 8 billion dollars due to declining demand as its customers were increasingly free to exercise outside the home and regarding inventory peloton disclosed that inventory totaled 1 27 billion a 35 increase over the prior quarter 91 of which were finished products that the company still held as a result of these disclosures the price of peloton common stock declined by 30 42 per share or over 35 from a closing price of 86 06 per share on november 4 2021 to 55 64 per share on november 5 2021 erasing 8 1 billion in shareholder value pomerantz llp with offices in new york

this story is part of the capital journal s ongoing package previewing the 2022 kansas legislative session follow reporters andrew bahl andrewbahl and jason tidd jason_tidd on twitter or go to cjonline com for more state government and politics coverage flush with cash kansas lawmakers are set to debate how to spend or whether to spend a windfall of taxpayer money the 2022 legislative session starts monday and democratic gov laura kelly is expected to unveil a budget proposal later in the week my top priority kelly told the capital journal last month is always presenting a balanced budget that fully funds our public schools that will close the bank of kdot that will take care of our kids in our child welfare system that will allow us to continue to invest in economic development you re reaping incredible returns on investment there the governor is also prioritizing axing the food sales tax an idea that has bipartisan support it s an aggressive program but it is one that we can sustain kelly said i want to get that done i want to get it done quickly and cleanly at the beginning of the legislative session economists in november projected a 2 9 billion surplus and that number could grow as tax revenues continue to outpace expectations last week kelly announced that total tax collections in december beat the month s estimate by 64 5 million axing the food sales tax would cost about 450 million the proposal has bipartisan support though it is unclear whether republicans would support a standalone bill without other tax cuts that have doomed prior attempts a separate kelly proposal to give kansas residents a one time 250 rebate comes with a 445 million price tag republicans have said that temporary relief is not good enough i appreciate governor kelly s election year revelation that kansans are taxed too much senate president ty masterson said in a statement on the rebate while i am open to all ideas to help reduce the tax burden on kansas families permanent solutions will be our priority limiting government spending but some lawmakers are exploring options to legally bind the government s hands last month the special committee on taxation heard details of tax and expenditure limitations in other states such fiscal mechanisms are designed to restrain the growth of government budgets by limiting tax revenue spending or both they can be tied to various indicators such as inflation or personal income growth these efforts to rein in government i have hope and i am optimistic we can get this done said committee chair sen caryn tyson r parker who is running for state treasurer tyson who is chair of the senate assessment and taxation committee has also called for eliminating taxes on retirement accounts including social security eliminating the 1 5 mill levy collected for state building funds to provide property tax relief and freezing property tax payments for seniors more kansas lawmakers eye legal limit on government spending growth with bumper year of tax surplus resisting a spending spree republican attorney general derek schmidt who is the frontrunner to challenge kelly in the november election urged fiscal caution in a dec 28 facebook post kansas should proceed cautiously and budget conservatively resisting calls for a spending spree he said he said lawmakers and the governor should pass food sales tax relief pay for core obligations including schools highways and public safety save some of the surplus for a rainy day and pay off state debt especially in the public employee retirement system schmidt said the surplus comes with a context of similar situations elsewhere as well as the boom will inevitably come down states all around the country have record amounts of money he said because 1 bidenflation is driving up state tax collections 2 the record high stock market is driving up state tax collections and 3 the federal government continues to flood states local governments and individuals with newly printed money under the labels of covid relief and infrastructure which when spent further drives up state tax collections kansas chamber calls for tax relief business lobbyists with the kansas chamber called for tax relief during a tuesday news conference on the results of a november and december survey of 300 business owners and executives chamber officials pointed to recommendations made in a 2019 tax modernization study conducted through a chamber partnership with the right leaning tax foundation many of the issues have already been addressed but there s still quite a bit of good recommendations that are in that proposal that can still be accomplished on all front sales tax income tax corporate income tax and property taxes said chamber lobbyist eric stafford so the work s not done even though there was a lot of positive changes that took place last year the legislature passed a slate of controversial tax cuts last session when republican lawmakers overrode a kelly veto democrats argued the legislation would be fiscally destructive likening it to the tax experiment under former gov sam brownback the bill had an estimated price tag of 284 million over three years and included some measures that had bipartisan support the chamber poll found that while taxes were the top concern of businesses in 2018 and 2019 covid 19 became the most important issue in 2020 in 2021 it was the quality of the workforce followed by taxes more business is booming in kansas gov laura kelly says as economist remains optimistic despite concerns business leaders have consistently said taxes are the top concern affecting profitability even during the years of the brownback tax cuts additionally while 62 of business leaders currently believe state and local taxes are too much that has consistently been the survey s majority position a plurality of business leaders support decreasing the state sales tax half want to cut the personal income tax and two thirds want property taxes reduced a majority of business leaders have consistently said they believe lowering taxes would help the economy though the percentage has grown in recent years to 73 chamber president and ceo alan cobb said their legislative agenda is to lower rates i think lowering marginal rates and lowering the corporate income tax rate would be good good policy he said and of course we have an election year and you can t dismiss the politics of an election year about getting things done or not the chamber is not directly backing kelly s proposal to eliminate the food sales tax we re all for tax reductions cobb said i think we d prefer an overall reduction in the sales tax rate and maybe they can do both budgeting process takes time while government agencies politicians lobbyists and activists could find numerous ways to spend extra cash it is unclear what may make it into or be left out of the budget proposals are not yet public and high profile budget issues are typically resolved late in the legislative session an economist on the governor s tax reform council has said the surplus could pay for medicaid expansion democrats have long pushed for expansion which would primarily be funded through federal money school choice issues could complicate education funding debates and it is unclear how far the governor is willing to compromise it depends upon what you mean by school choice kelly said if you mean diverting taxpayer dollars to private schools yeah i m not and never have been interested in doing that i think one of the reasons that kansas has had as good a school system as we have had is because we ve devoted our taxpayer dollars to that and not let them be distracted or pushed over to other entities but rather keep the focus on our k 12 classrooms the chamber survey asked business leaders what they consider to be more important for improving education pitting more funding against improving performance business leaders have consistently sided with performance over funding they don t want more funding for more funding s sake it s got to be geared toward improving the performance said pat mcferron who conducted the survey jason tidd is a

the company is centered around flying taxi transportation also known as electric vertical take off and landing aircraft evtols it is thought to have an order book of nearly 7 5 billion from huge aviation companies american airlines and virgin as well as rolls royce microsoft and honeywell the firm hopes to come out above competitors by manning its vehicles with a pilot which could make for swifter regulatory approval fitzpatrick stated of the move to become a publicly traded company we have global leaders in aviation as partners and a world class team that can make the zero emissions flight a reality for millions of people around the world it is fantastic to reach this milestone and i am so proud of what the team has achieved and the guardian this week highlighted vertical aerospace as one of the seven businesses to watch in 2022 but the jury is out on whether people are open to flying taxis as the shares quickly climbed before falling back 30 percent all within the first week the u k based transport start up makes a convincing argument when it comes to the future of transportation in a country aiming for net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and a rapid transition away from fossil fuels to renewable alternatives it claims the vx4 is necessary in cities saturated with cars and will open up urban air mobility it also says it will provide zero emissions transportation as it runs on electricity making it highly competitive with other modes of transport vertical aerospace says its vx4 aircraft is capable of flying four passengers at a speed of 200mph at a cost comparable to a taxi in addition it says its evtols will be safer quieter and greener than helicopters a common point of comparison the recent merger and interest in the company prompted a bidding race to win the company s manufacturing business fitzpatrick explained we have been speaking to a number of different governments about where we might build the production facility domhnal is very keen on us taking it to ireland at present ireland is a global hub for aviation finance but not for aerospace manufacturing making it the ideal project to expand its aviation market in addition it could help improve its green technology sector as well as diversifying its investment portfolio but vertical is not the first evtol company out there and it s not even the first on the stock exchange as three other firms went public last year the other companies joby archer and lilium also used spacs to go public california based company joby aviation has already carried out over 1 000 test flights and hopes to gain regulatory approval and commence commercial operations by 2024 based on current developments predictions suggest there could be 430 000 units in operation worldwide by as early as 2040 to cater to these new vehicles we can expect to see lots of mini airports or skyports popping up across major cities we are seeing start ups collaborating with other companies to ensure these new constructions are ready in time for operations to commence for example joby has partnered with a parking firm in the u s reef technology as well as new york property business related companies with the intention of turning rooftops into skyports houston los angeles and orlando have all also announced plans for skyport developments advertisement vertical aerospace is the latest in a long line of hopeful evtol manufacturers to go public with the intention of commencing flying taxi operations as early as 2024 alongside these transport innovations we will also see the development of skyports across major cities with the potential to revolutionize urban transport by felicity bradstock for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com
by david shepardson washington reuters the u s federal aviation administration faa on thursday issued fresh warnings that new 5g wireless service could still disrupt flights saying there were big differences between u s aviation protections and those used in france late thursday the faa launched a dedicated webpage on 5g and aviation safety raising questions about potential impact on sensitive airplane electronics like altimeters this week at t nyse and verizon nyse agreed to adopt similar precautions to those in france on monday the carriers said they would delay use of c band spectrum for wireless service until jan 19 an agreement aimed at heading off an aviation safety crisis and flight disruptions on tuesday president joe biden hailed the deal between wireless carriers and u s regulators allowing 5g deployment in two weeks the faa said the delay would allow it to evaluate ways to minimize disruptions to altimeters and also gives companies more time to prepare the faa said 5g airport buffer zones in france cover 96 seconds of flight while safety precautions around u s airports only protect the last 20 seconds of flight it said temporary u s lower power levels will be 2 5 times higher than france it noted that france requires antennas be tilted downward to limit harmful interference a rule the united states lacks if there s the possibility of a risk to the flying public we are obligated to pause the activity until we can prove it is safe the faa website said radar altimeters still must be proven safe in the overall u s 5g environment to fly into these airports so we must take into account the higher signal strength when assessing safety and risk at t and verizon won nearly all of the c band spectrum in an 80 billion auction last year the faa in early november issued a bulletin warning action may be needed to address potential interference from 5g which prompted the carriers to agree to delay deployment for 30 days to jan 5 the deal monday assured at t and verizon they will be able to start service this month and they agreed to temporary buffer zones around 50 airports that the faa will identify by friday the faa website said 50 airports are covered because the wireless companies only agreed to 50 airports at t and verizon did not immediately comment biden said the agreement puts us on track to substantially reduce disruptions to air operations after jan 19 the faa said that even with the temporary buffer around 50 airports 5g deployment will increase the risk of disruption during low visibility including flight cancellations diverted flights and delays during periods of low visibility the faa said it is working during the two week delay to complete evaluations of the most popular altimeters allowing some aircraft to operate in 5g and minimize disruptions

it s been a tough 12 months for a lot of people including some dealer principals and their staff in the front office sure more than a few of them are making bank by charging outrageous markups on the vehicles they do have on the ground but by and large overall sales numbers were all over the board for the majority of brands we ve parsed through a few of the stats and unearthed a few notable gems including how dodge somehow managed to sell more darts in 2021 than 2020 despite it having ended production in september 2016 it s unclear whether these darts are zombified units that have been prowling through american dealerships looking for revenge over their botched launch in 2012 or if they were buried out behind the wash bay and only unearthed after an intensive round of building renovations but here they are with 10 new dodge darts being recorded as sold in 2021 7 were sold in 2020 a true statistician would breathlessly note that s a 43 percent increase in dart sales proving there are only three falsehoods in this world lies damn lies and statistics other weirdness jeep claims they sold 16 patriots a 433 percent increase over 2020 for all you stats nerds a vehicle discontinued in december 2016 with leftover stock rebranded as 17s same goes for the 15 chrysler 200s that apparently found homes it could be a case of new owners stellantis taking this opportunity to clean up the books placing items in the column in which they belong or it is possible that one or two of these rigs were pressed into service in some dealer capacity but not officially registered or given an in service date until now whatever still makes for interesting reading clear eyed individuals have noted the challenger 54 314 has outsold the mustang 52 414 over the last twelve months proving that just because something is old doesn t mean you throw it away the vast number of special editions thrown at the challenger by dodge surely helps as does various psychotic amounts of horsepower if you re wondering ford claims they sold a total of 27 140 mustang mach e vehicles meaning it found more homes than any of the individual lincoln models nautilus mkx won that award with 24 443 sales another interesting stat is the combined might of hyundai and kia totted up more sales than honda since those two brands plus genesis are technically all under the same corporate umbrella it is not incorrect to say hyundai motor co outsold honda motor co in the american market last year hyundai kia and genesis reportedly accounted for a combined 1 489 118 sales 738 081 49 621 and 701 416 compared to honda and acura s tally of 1 466 630 the sum of 1 309 222 and 157 408 toyota and lexus combined to topple gm from its 1 perch 2 332 261 vs 2 202 598 a development we ve covered already we re trying to imagine what would have happened to a person who would have predicted such an event had they done so while standing in gilley s or any other roadside bar in america back in the 1980s how times change

rochester with long lines at covid 19 screening centers the demand for at home testing is high but the real world effectiveness of the rapid antigen kits is under question and the impact of a positive diagnosis is changing as well rapid antigen covid 19 tests are popular because in just minutes they can identify antigens or small viral proteins signaling infection nationally the use of such kits is believed to dwarf that of tests ordered through a lab when they can be found in stock at drug stores and online the tests are scooped up at high prices limiting access late last month the biden administration announced a goal of making 500 million such tests free to all americans though their arrival could take months the home kits have relieved pressure at testing centers but because the results are reported to private individuals and not the state some experts worry the tests have diminished the ability for health officials to track the prevalence of covid 19 advertisement minnesota health officials have supported their use regardless there are many public health benefits to having widespread rapid testing as long as people do what they are supposed to do with their results doug schultz of the minnesota department of health said in an email but the downside is that you do lose something as far as counting cases schultz says that health officials have always faced unknowns in tracking illness and have other ways to estimate the spread of omicron including through data reflecting hospital admissions and clinic visits less encouraging about the at home testing craze is the way that omicron appears to have diminished the reliability of negative results on antigen tests as well as the effectiveness of treatments available to those who worsen after infection antigen rapid tests less accurate early a long known drawback to rapid antigen tests is that they sometimes will miss a true case of covid 19 wrongly reporting that you are not infectious this is called a false negative and new research suggests it likely happens to a degree that can promote spread before omicron the best kits offered a 15 rate of false negatives with other studies showing a 40 rate for missing asymptomatic covid 19 according to the fda omicron has likely made these percentages worse to what degree was unknown that picture became clearer on wednesday jan 5 when the first real world study of rapid take home testing during the age of omicron suggested a three day lag between when people became highly infectious and the point at which rapid antigen tests spot the variant reporting in the pre print journal medrxiv org a platform for research that has not yet been peer reviewed and therefore should be read with caution researchers described a 30 person sample of vaccinated workers given daily sets of saliva pcr and nasal rapid antigen tests during december of 2021 advertisement the authors believe that the three day lag to spot covid 19 in rapid antigen tests was noteworthy for the high level of infectiousness early in the illness blythe adamson was lead author on a study of rapid antigen tests and the omicron variant contributed the part that was alarming was the viral load of the people in those days before they tested antigen positive said lead author blythe adamson infectious disease epidemiologist and economist we confirmed there were real transmissions that happened when people were antigen negative adamson says rapid antigen tests remain valuable tools as long as their risk of early false negatives with omicron is kept in mind we can t rely too heavily on a negative rapid antigen test meaning that we are not infectious to other people she said rapid antigen tests are still an incredibly valuable tool for people who ve had a couple days of symptoms who maybe they feel like they ve had allergies for a few days two lines now what the good news is if they sometimes miss omicron cases early in the course of illness rapid antigen tests are unlikely to deliver a positive finding in error with specificity accuracy ratings in the 99 range if you get a positive antigen test it usually not always but usually is a true positive said mayo clinic vaccinologist dr greg poland much like a pregnancy test a positive result from a nasal swab produces two lines on a test strip the latest cdc guidance says if you are fully vaccinated a positive result to a covid 19 test should lead to masking and isolation within the home for a period of five days this period may warrant a call to your health care provider if not necessarily a visit advertisement just because you have a positive test does not necessarily mean you have to interact with the medical system poland said there isn t enough medical system to handle everyone who would have a positive test if you are low risk a positive diagnosis during omicron is a lonely bout of masking tv and over the counter symptom management somebody who is young somebody who is healthy without co morbidities poland said somebody who has been vaccinated anybody who has mild symptoms that are not progressing they really don t need any interaction with the medical system other than to notify their health care provider if they get new symptoms that might be persisting the early days following a positive result are critical on the other hand for those at risk of poor outcomes from an infection for the elderly immune compromised and the unvaccinated and metabolically unhealthy early use of monoclonal antibodies made by lilly and regeneron had been effective at reducing hospitalization those no longer work as well with the omicron variant however according to poland newer monoclonal antibodies targeting omicron are in short supply due to the surge of new cases paxlovid an oral antiviral treatment for covid 19 is expected to reduce omicron hospitalizations but when faced with sick patients needing early treatments variant type is not always known to doctors in this way while omicron may turn out to be milder overall the tools for treatment are fewer in the meantime the triggers for seeking help after testing positive at home remain the same advertisement for the cdc the symptoms that warrant emergency attention include trouble breathing persistent pain or pressure in the chest new confusion inability to wake or stay awake and pale gray or blue colored skin lips or nail beds although skin tone can affect visibility of those symptoms

shouldn t always assume that the biggest package is the best deal nelson said for example you might find that the sale priced smaller size has a lower unit cost than the largest size check the unit price before you buy it shutterstock com buying more than you need buying the biggest size such as a 10 pound bag of potatoes instead of the 5 pound bag can also backfire if you can t consume all of it before it goes bad the average household throws away 20 to 40 of perishable items said nelson regardless of whether you got those items at a discount you re not saving money if you re not eating them it s better to run out of an item than to throw away unused food she said shutterstock com being loyal to certain brands we get so set in our ways of sticking with the same brands that we often will pay premium prices just to buy them fobes said what many people do not realize is that most store brands are the name brands with a different label the name brands can cost as much as 25 more than the store brand she added so if you want to save money at the supermarket ditch your brand loyalty without even using coupons you can cut 25 off your grocery bill by choosing the sale priced brand of your regular items instead of being strictly loyal to one brand nelson said shutterstock com underbuying sale items don t think of a sale as a chance to get an item you regularly buy at a discount think of it as an opportunity to stock up and save big for example if you use chicken every week and it s 50 off you should buy enough to stock the freezer for two or three weeks until it s 50 off again nelson said this simple strategy can save a family of four a few hundred dollars a year compared with paying the going price each week she said marius_comanescu shutterstock com shopping hungry when you are hungry and there is nothing to fix at home because you did not plan properly you will run to the store fobes said you will buy items you normally would not because your hunger is in control of what is being added to your shopping cart even if you go on a planned shopping trip you could end up making more impulse buys if you shop while you re hungry you can often find you save 10 to 20 if you just shop when you are not hungry she said shutterstock com paying for meat processing you reach for that package of cubed steak and pay 20 more than you need to gault said instead buy meat that hasn t been cut or processed and ask the butcher at the grocery store to cut or tenderize it for you most full service supermarket butchers will do this for no charge gault said you also can save money by purchasing whole chickens rather than pieces the cheapest chicken is the whole chicken and it only takes a few minutes to cut into pieces gault said designs by jack shutterstock com buying packaged dinner mixes packaged dinner mixes might be convenient but you ll pay a premium for that convenience for example the typical price of a packaged pasta skillet dinner is 2 3 for a single box instead make cheap pasta meals yourself start with a 1 pound box of pasta which makes eight servings and costs as little as 1 shutterstock com buying bagged seasonal fruit buying produce when it s in season is a good way to get the best price on fruits and vegetables but gault said you should avoid buying seasonal fruit by the bag rather than by the pound for example when apples are on sale for 99 cents a pound a bag of the same type of apples will usually cost more she said the price of grapefruit oranges avocados and other fruits in season will also cost less by the pound than by the bag the same applies to sales on individual produce like avocados which are usually cheaper by the pound than the bag shutterstock com always opting for fresh produce during the winter buying fresh produce gets more expensive because so few fruits and vegetables are in season so it s the perfect time to turn to frozen options which are less expensive not only can you save money with frozen produce but you might also get better quality fruits and vegetables frozen produce is picked when ripe and then flash frozen not picked ahead of time to allow for shipping time so it can contain more of the vital nutrients you re looking for glynsimages2013 shutterstock com underbuying things you regularly eat don t waste money buying small packages of products you eat regularly for example perhaps you grab a 16 ounce bottle of soda near the checkout because it s cold instead of a 2 liter bottle of soda that s room temperature you pay about the same price and get 75 less this applies to a variety of products although you shouldn t buy more than you can consume or always assume that the biggest package is the best deal you can save by buying more if you can freeze or store what you re not going to use immediately and you might get a better deal by purchasing say a big package of chips and parceling them out for school lunches rather than packing small individual packages shutterstock com comparing prices without noticing sizes when you compare prices you should also compare the amount you re getting for the price for example sometimes the name brand bottle of juice contains 59 ounces and the store brand contains 64 ounces gault said sometimes a pound of bacon is only 12 ounces instead of a pound so what you think looks like a better price has 25 less bacon she said shutterstock com paying for the stock person s mistake it happens to all of us you think you re reaching for what s on sale but you end up with higher priced items because someone made a mistake stocking the shelf often products look similar which is how they got misplaced in the first place gault said either way you just paid about twice as much as you thought you would carefully check the name and size of the sale item to make sure it matches the item you place in your cart shutterstock com buying certain end cap items some of the best deals are on the end cap a shelf at the end of an aisle but they are often paired with other items that are not the best deal gault said for example you might see an end cap for stuffing creamed soup and canned vegetables you might find a different brand of creamed soup down the aisle for much less though she said shutterstock com buying items you can get for less elsewhere it might be convenient to buy health and beauty products while you re doing your grocery shopping but you ll pay a lot less if you buy these items at a national drugstore chain pharmacies run sales coupons and other offers weekly and they can often be stacked for huge savings find best credit cards for groceries shutterstock com failing to check your receipt for errors before you leave the store check your receipt gault said make sure you got all the sale prices instant rebates and coupon discounts you deserve sometimes inadvertently deals are missing that could cost you a few dollars or more she said andrey_popov shutterstock com failing to check your receipt for savings another reason to check your receipts and hang onto them is that they often offer opportunities to save the next time you shop throwing away receipts or shoving them into the bottom of your bag is almost as bad as throwing away a 10 bill smith said sometimes there are survey codes at the bottom with incentives for filling them out like coupons for your next grocery run tassii getty images only shopping at eye level most grocery stores place the most expensive items at eye level since you ll be drawn to them first be sure to scan the upper and lower shelves to find better deals on the items you need nastya_ph getty images istockphoto paying more than you need to for chicken if you opt not to buy a whole chicken make sure you aren t overpaying for the parts chicken breasts are often more expensive than chicken thighs even though thighs are just as nutritious unsplash shopping more than once a week the more often you shop the more often you open the door for impulse buys if you find that you re heading to the grocery store more than once a week this is probably a sign that you aren t doing a good job at planning out your trips aja koska getty images filling up your cart supermarkets provide you with oversized carts so that you don t realize how much you are putting into it if it s feasible shop with a basket if you need to use a cart and it looks full when you re heading to the checkout line take a moment to ask yourself if there s anything you can put back on the shelf see we tried all the grocery delivery services during the pandemic and this is what we learned sanyasm getty images not taking advantage of the in store pickup option several grocery chains including kroger allow you to place an online order that you can pick up at the store for free doing this eliminates impulse buys altogether allows you to shop directly through the weekly ad seamlessly add digital coupons to your order and see exactly what your haul will cost

whenever there s a hot new dish or restaurant on the las vegas dining scene we hear about it in hawai i in the last few years i d been hearing about the seafood pan roast at the oyster bar at palace station the creamy bisque like stew is a spinoff of french bouillabaisse or italian american cioppino and originated in louisiana often mixing sausage and other meats with seafood in a tomato base with traces of brandy without even tasting it i already liked it so when a small sign announcing hook d pan roast appeared at the old chingu space on kapiolani boulevard i was more than intrigued the new restaurant opened in late november to crowds of pan roast fans and curious eaters like me in addition to different pan roast combos we ll get to these in a bit the menu has a short list of appetizers including caesar salad 10 steamed clams 15 and lobster sliders 25 i immediately gravitate toward more home style choices kamaboko dip 12 is one of those things that i always hope will show up at a potluck it feels like a treat something that always tastes better made by a friend at hook d the dip comes with toast points and is every bit as ono as your aunty s famous recipe with ritz crackers see also our go to chilly weather bowls of soup in honolulu that soothe the soul the crab wontons 10 are good especially if you re craving something crunchy but they re not memorable they re stuffed with a sweet imitation crab filling fried nicely and served with sweet chile sauce on the side i would have loved the addition of cream cheese just to go full on having seen pictures of hook d s grilled cheese and pan roast 12 i had to try it myself i m a fan of the burned cheese on the outside technique but this one has it only on one side which creates a texture disparity i want more crunch as for the dipping sauce it s the tomato base that goes into the pan roast not the finished pan roast sauce which is creamier and more flavorful the dish is closer to a grilled cheese with tomato soup a few tweaks and it could tempt grilled cheese fanatics either way it s a good option if you have keiki in tow my appetite is officially fired up and i m ready for the main event the signature hook d pan roast comes with one seafood clams scallop shrimp or lobster 22 to 27 or as a combo with either a mix of seafood seafood and sausage or an all sausage combo featuring lup cheong and portuguese and arabiki sausages 29 there s even a double size combo called wild ones that basically has everything in it 65 you can also add on ingredients a la carte to customize your roast and choose a spice level ranging from mild to wild i order the seafood combo 29 because i want to taste the pan roast base against the additions of shrimp crab clams and scallops i m not usually a fan of shrimp boils serial overcooking crimes against seafood have left me traumatized so i m super curious to see how the different seafood will turn out i choose a medium spice level as i m told there is some pretty decent heat and double the taro roll instead of rice see also worth the splurge royal lobster rolls in waikīkī i had heard that compared to palace station s classic pan roast which has shrimp crab chicken and andouille sausage hook d s version is a little looser the large bowl placed in front of me wafts the scents of old bay tomato celery seed and seafood stock my first few sips are rewarded with big tomato and seafood flavors and a satisfying texture that s just creamy enough to coat a spoon to my relief the seafood is not overcooked not even the shrimp albeit small the scallops are barely cooked and bouncy with a sweetness that provides relief from the creeping spiciness of the stew bits of crab are swirled throughout giving even more body to the dish i devour the sea creatures one by one wishing there were more but not disappointed with the quantity i do wish the clams were a bit bigger though since i struggled to get more than a couple of morsels and there is something very delicious about a soft taro roll slathered with butter and dunked in unctuous pan roast the whole experience sticks to your ribs in a good way while the cream and spice play warm notes for your soul and i find out that there s actually no seafood in the base which means that if you re allergic you re safe with the sausage only version for someone who s never tried the vegas version of pan roast it hit the spot and i m satisfied service is friendly and easy with food coming quickly even with most tables occupied while there are only a few parking stalls out front a short walk around the building usually yields some options for me the sin city comfort dish is a great addition to the local dining scene especially if you spent too much on presents and can t afford a trip to vegas anytime soon 1035 kapiolani blvd 808 698 7677 hookdpanroast com hookd panroast
locals kpcw spoke with over the christmas and new years holiday said lift lines at park city mountain resort were among the longest they d ever seen lodging numbers from the park city chamber bureau in december showed a near 100 occupancy rate in the city through january 1st pcmr parent company vail resorts also slashed prices for the epic pass by 20 for this season leading to a 76 increase in the number of passes and pre paid tickets the company sold compared to pre pandemic highs more passholders combined with covid 19 and staffing shortages have left some unhappy with their experiences on the mountain park city mountain resort chief operating officer mike goar told kpcw a warm and dry start to the winter prevented many resorts in utah from making crucial early season snow and caused pcmr to push back its opening day to november 28th the late start combined with significant snow storms in recent weeks and the city s throngs of visitors to create a bottleneck on the slopes and the roads goar said december was like going from zero to 100 miles an hour in terms of opening terrain he said the resort has been listening to guest frustrations and admitted to falling short over the holidays we re more critical than anyone i ll tell you that so no i don t believe we re providing the service that we re known for and that we strive for said goar he added that the amount of snow park city received in such a short period of time led to guests complaints about terrain not being open when it was covered in snow according to historical data by ski utah after virtually nothing in november pcmr received 87 inches of snow in december and currently has 68 of its terrain open goar said the process for opening terrain safely isn t as straightforward as getting enough snow to cover the ground important checks are needed by the resort s snow safety department and ski patrol before closed signs get taken down a lack of employees is another factor leading to frustrations over the holidays businesses across the country are short staffed and searching for employees in the wasatch back in particular soaring housing prices and a low stock of affordable units has made finding employees even harder goar said pcmr is not immune to those same trends he added that the recent spike in covid 19 cases due to the omicron variant has also led to more sick employees who can t work staffing levels generally are very much a reflection of what we re seeing across the community and all communities he said it s very tight no question about it we re also not immune from the surge that our community has seen from covid with that comes employees not here when that happens we re seeing it like every other business and it is impactful to operations no doubt about it goar said staffing levels vary from department to department he would not give an exact number of the resort s total but said it s closer to 100 than 50 no we re not that short staffed but we re feeling it as i said just like all other businesses goar said the good news he said is that the resort has seen an uptick in job applications since the new year vail announced last summer that all employees now get a starting wage of 15 hr the union representing the resort s ski patrollers is also still locked in negotiations over a new contract since the patrollers are not resort employees they don t qualify for the 15 hr base pay patrollers currently start at 13 25 hr and the union is pushing for a 17 hr starting wage and regular raises for the first three years of service the union did not accept vail s most recent offer of 15 hr this week

omaha in the past few weeks some people have scrambled to find rapid at home tests to screen for covid 19 the tests can be hard to come by several popular brands are listed as out of stock on amazon and pharmacy websites to help meet demand for the tests president joe biden s administration announced late last month that it would give away a half million test kits to households that request them beginning sometime this month but one concern with the at home tests is that most of the results positive or negative are not reported to or recorded by local and state health departments teresa anderson director of the grand island based central district health department said she and her staff have no way of knowing the results of most at home tests because there is no mechanism to report them to nebraska s disease tracking system one exception she said is the results of the abbott binaxnow tests used by long term care facilities the facilities results are reported to the state through the nebraska infection control assessment and promotion program but if residents of the district which includes hall hamilton and merrick counties call to report results from their tests as some occasionally do anderson s staff can t add them to state systems we really just don t know what s going on in the home testing world she said dr anne o keefe the douglas county health department s senior epidemiologist said no mechanism exists to add the results to health departments systems the department likely would have to track at home tests separately so that they don t skew the positivity rates used to help determine testing needs and case trends while people may call with positive results they re not likely to do so with negative ones o keefe said in most cases the tests should not be used as a substitute for a lab test the best use may be in situations where it s difficult to quickly find a lab run test but she and anderson said the at home tests do offer people an opportunity to find out whether they re covid positive so they can take the appropriate steps to avoid infecting others at least the people doing them know and can act on the information o keefe said previously some experts have raised concerns that at home tests don t allow for contact tracing because of the lack of reporting but o keefe said the health department currently doesn t have the capacity to do all of the contact tracing it conducted last year even with a contract in place for contact tracing services case counts she said are too high instead she said the health department has focused on providing more information about what people should do if they have a positive test that includes how to quarantine and isolate how to determine when people may have exposed others and what to tell close contacts those who test positive on a home test don t need to have the results confirmed with another test she said but those who get negative results either after an exposure or before or after a gathering should repeat the test within 24 to 48 hours o keefe said many of the tests come in two packs and instruct users to repeat the initial test at a prescribed interval a person planning a visit to a relative in a nursing home for instance could test a couple of days beforehand and then repeat the test right before the visit dr james lawler a co executive director of the university of nebraska medical center s global center for health security said the u s has had issues throughout the pandemic with accurately assessing case numbers with cases undercounted throughout now in addition to most home test results not being reported he said many of the at home tests available in the united states are less sensitive in picking up the omicron variant the food and drug administration noted dec 28 that early data based on lab tests on patient samples conducted by national institutes of health researchers indicate that the tests detect omicron but may have reduced sensitivity more research is underway most of the rapid at home tests available in the u s are antigen tests which detect viral proteins using them typically involves swirling a nasal swab inside the nasal cavities the swabs are shorter and don t go as far back as those typically used to collect samples for pcr tests which amplify and detect the virus s genetic material nationally some experts have suggested swabbing the nose and the throat as a way to increase the sensitivity of the at home tests lawler said the suggestion makes sense intuitively because it appears the omicron virus may be concentrated more in saliva but tests are optimized for the samples they are designed to test he advised caution in using the tests in ways other than their approved use until data is available to

on december 30 2021 the u s department of the treasury treasury and the internal revenue service irs released a pre publication version of final regulations treas reg 1 1001 6 addressing the principal tax consequences related to the planned elimination of interbank offered rates the final regulations the final regulations generally follow proposed regulations issued on october 9 2019 the proposed regulations and revenue procedure 2020 44 issued on october 12 2020 the revenue procedure in providing that certain modifications of debt instruments derivatives and other contracts implementing a change from an interbank offered rate ibor such as the london interbank offered rate libor to another qualified rate will not cause a taxable event for holders issuers or counterparties the final regulations reflect two important changes from the proposed regulations i the complex substantially equivalent fair market value test of the proposed regulations has been eliminated in favor of rules that enumerate certain modifications that are excluded from tax free treatment and ii a single standard has been adopted for all contracts instead of separate rules for debt instruments and non debt instruments in addition the final regulations contain helpful examples to illustrate the application of such rules background in 2017 the u k financial conduct authority announced the planned phase out of libor in anticipation of the discontinuation of libor and other ibors many countries including the united states have identified alternative benchmark rates the federal reserve board and the new york fed convened a group of market participants the alternative reference rates committee arrc which identified the secured overnight financing rate sofr a rate that measures the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by treasury securities as the preferred benchmark replacement for the united states as described in detail in our prior client alert the proposed regulations generally provided that a transition from an ibor to another replacement rate would not cause a taxable event for holders issuers or counterparties so long as certain requirements were met including that the fair market value of the contract after the alteration is substantially equivalent to the fair market value before the alteration the revenue procedure provided further guidance on the modification of a contract to include a provision that provides a mechanism for the contract s reference rate to change in the future from an ibor to one or more replacement rates a fallback provision absent further guidance from the treasury and irs market participants were concerned that certain modifications of debt instruments or other contracts such as derivatives to transition from libor to an alternative reference rate could result in the recognition of taxable gain or loss under section 1001 in addition to potential realization under section 1001 the tax treatment of these modifications can have certain additional consequences including with respect to hedges integrated transactions and real estate mortgage investment conduits remics as discussed below overview of the final regulations the final regulations generally adopt the fundamental approach taken by the proposed regulations by providing that the transition from an ibor to a qualified rate an ibor related modification generally is not a modification for purposes of section 1001 however the final regulations implement this approach in a different manner than the proposed regulations and the final regulations contain technical changes that simplify the operative rules of the proposed regulations ibor related modifications under section 1001 covered modification the final regulations provide that a covered modification of a contract is not treated as an exchange of property for other property differing materially in kind or extent for purposes of treas reg 1 1001 1 a covered modification generally occurs where a contract contains an operative rate or fallback provision that references a discontinued ibor and such contract is modified to i replace the operative rate with a qualified rate and if necessary provide for a qualified one time payment to be made ii include a qualified rate in the fallback provision to an operative rate referencing a discontinued ibor or iii replace a rate in a fallback provision referencing a discontinued ibor with a qualified rate a covered modification also includes any modification of a contract described in section 4 02 of the revenue procedure or any supplements published by the treasury and the irs which consist of modifications that incorporate fallback provisions that have been published by arrc or isda in the event that a covered modification of a contract is paired with a noncovered modification the final regulations provide that only the covered modification will be analyzed under the rules of treas reg 1 1001 6 and any component of the modification that consists of a noncovered modification will be analyzed under the existing rules a noncovered modification is any modification or portion of a modification that is not a covered modification the final regulations adopt a new defined term of discontinued ibor which is generally an ibor that will be discontinued and an ibor ceases to be a discontinued ibor a year after the ibor s discontinuation the purpose of this new definition is to better tailor the relief provided in the final regulations to the problem that the final regulations are intended to address qualified rate to be a covered modification the rate replacing an ibor must be a qualified rate a qualified rate includes a qualified floating rate under treas reg 1 1275 5 b such as sofr the sterling overnight index average the tokyo overnight average rate the swiss average rate overnight and the euro short term rate administered by the european central bank a qualified rate may also include rates selected by certain regulatory authorities a rate selected by arrc so long as the federal reserve bank of new york continues to be an ex officio member of arrc rates determined by reference to a qualified rate and rates identified in guidance published in the internal revenue bulletin the qualified rate used to replace an ibor with respect to a particular contract must be based on transactions conducted in the same currency or reasonably expected to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds in the same currency to clarify how the definition of qualified rate applies when a contract is modified to include a waterfall of fallback rates the final regulations provide that a single qualified rate may be comprised of more than one fallback rate such as a waterfall thus a waterfall where each tier is structured to replace the prior tier upon a trigger event e g where such prior tier is discontinued may be treated as a fallback to a discontinued ibor even though only one tier is actually a fallback to a discontinued ibor however where a waterfall is structured as such the collection of fallback rates is only treated as a qualified rate if each component rate is itself a qualified rate the final regulations further provide that a fallback rate is not treated as a qualified rate if the terms of the fallback rate do not ensure at the time of the modification that the fallback rate will be properly treated as a qualified rate when such rate is triggered for these purposes a fallback rate will be treated as meeting the requirements to be a qualified rate if the likelihood that any value will ever be determined under the contract by reference to the fallback rate is remote excluded modifications in response to extensive public comments criticizing the complexity of the substantially equivalent fair market value test the treasury and irs replaced that requirement of the proposed regulations with rules detailing excluded modifications in the final regulations a modification is treated as an excluded modification and thus a noncovered modification if it changes the amount or timing of contractual cash flows and is i intended to induce one or more parties to perform any act necessary to consent to the modification ii intended to compensate one or more parties for a modification other than a covered modification iii either a concession granted to a party to the contract because that party is experiencing financial difficulty or a concession secured by a party to the contract to account for the credit deterioration of another party to the contract iv intended to compensate one or more parties for a change in rights or obligations that are not derived from the contract being modified or v is identified by irs guidance as having a principal purpose of achieving a result that is unreasonable in light of the purpose of the final regulations with respect to v above the preamble to the final regulations the preamble states that it is anticipated that such guidance will be prospective in effect excluded modifications represent noncovered modifications that must be tested under general tax principles to determine whether they give rise to a taxable event source and character of a one time payment the final regulations do not provide any guidance on the source and character of a one time payment that is made in connection with an ibor related modification according to the preamble in light of the uncertainty generated by the proposed regulations the treasury and irs continue to consider whether to adopt further rules to address one time payments integrated transactions and hedges the final regulations provide that a covered modification that relates to one or more legs of a transaction that is integrated under treas reg 1 988 5 integration of a nonfunctional currency debt instrument and a hedge or treas reg 1 1275 6 integration of a qualifying debt instrument and a hedge will not be treated as a legging out of the integrated instrument so long as the applicable hedge as modified continues to meet the requirements of the relevant integration regime the final regulations introduce a 90 day grace period during which a covered modification of a component of an integrated transaction does not result in a legging out of the transaction notwithstanding any mismatch in timing or amount of payments that result from the covered modification the final regulations also introduce a new rule to address temporary hedges that a taxpayer may enter into to manage any risk resulting from temporary mismatches between the terms of the component parts of an integrated transaction during the 90 day grace period provided under this new rule the temporary hedge may be integrated with the other components of the integrated transaction without disruption moreover termination of the temporary hedge within the 90 day grace period is not treated as a legging out of the existing integrated transaction in addition the final regulations adopt the approach of the proposed regulations that a covered modification of one or more legs of a transaction subject to hedge accounting under treas reg 1 446 4 will not be treated as a disposition or termination of either leg of the transaction investment trusts the final regulations provide that neither a covered modification of a contract held by an investment trust nor a covered modification of an ownership interest in such an investment trust constitute a power to vary the investment of any certificate holder of such trust remic and other securitization guidance the final regulations adopt the three rules provided by the proposed regulations with respect to remic regular interests first an alteration that is described in treas reg 1 1001 6 a 1 or 3 of regular interests issued by a remic will be disregarded for purposes of the startup day rule second an interest in a remic will not fail to qualify as a regular interest solely because it is subject to a contingency with respect to a change in the rate in anticipation of an ibor becoming unavailable or unreliable finally an interest in a remic will not fail to qualify as a regular interest solely because it is subject to a contingency with respect to a reduction for reasonable costs incurred to effect an alteration or modification described in the section 1001 rules described above in addition any payment by a party other than the remic of expenses reasonably incurred in connection with any such alteration or modification will not be treated as a contribution for purposes of the 100 percent tax under section 860g d for contributions after the startup day moreover the treasury and irs noted in the preamble that they expect costs of obtaining tax opinions and rating agency confirmations in connection with a modification to be reasonable costs within the meaning of treas reg 1 860g 1 e 4 vrdis the final regulations include rules applicable to a variable rate debt instrument vrdi that provides both for a qualifying floating rate that references a discontinued ibor and for a methodology to change that rate referencing a discontinued ibor to a different rate in anticipation of the discontinued ibor becoming unavailable or unreliable for such vrdis i the rate referencing a discontinued ibor and the different rate are treated as a single qualified floating rate for purposes of the vrdi regulations ii the possibility that the discontinued ibor will become unavailable or unreliable is treated as a remote contingency and iii the fact that the discontinued ibor has become unavailable or unreliable is not treated as a change in circumstances interest expense of a foreign corporation under treas reg 1 882 5 d 5 ii b a foreign corporation that is a bank is permitted to elect a rate that references 30 day libor when determining the interest expense attributable to excess u s connected liabilities in computing the interest expense allocable to income effectively connected with a u s trade or business the proposed regulations provided that taxpayers that are banks may elect to use the yearly average of sofr in place of 30 day libor in such instance without the consent of the irs the preamble notes that the treasury and irs are continuing to study what may constitute an appropriate replacement rate but will permit taxpayers to continue to rely on the rules from the proposed regulations and anticipate issuing additional guidance before 30 day usd libor is discontinued in 2023 change in accounting method the treasury department and the irs stated in the preamble that they will not treat a change from a discount rate that is based on a discontinued ibor to a discount rate that is a qualified rate for the purpose of valuing securities under the mark to market rules in section 475 as a change in method of accounting under section 446 e fatca a covered modification of a contract is not a material modification of that contract for purposes of the fatca grandfathering rule fast pay stock in response to public comment that a covered modification of preferred stock could cause such stock to be treated as fast pay stock the final regulations have introduced a rule providing that a covered modification of stock is not a significant modification of the terms of the stock or the related agreements and it is not a significant change in the relevant facts and circumstances for purposes of treas reg 1 7701 l 3 b 2 ii however if a covered modification and noncovered modification occur at the same time or as part of the same plan and the noncovered modification is a significant modification of the terms of the stock or the related or agreements or a significant change in the relevant facts and circumstances then all of the facts and circumstances including both the covered modification and noncovered modification are taken into account in determining whether the stock is fast pay stock conclusion the final regulations largely adopt the approach of the proposed regulations and revenue procedure providing that in most cases an alteration or modification related to a change from an ibor rate to a new qualified rate will not be a taxable event the final regulations generally are effective for modifications alterations and issuances that occur on or after march 7 2022 taxpayers may choose to rely on the final regulations prior to that date provided the taxpayer and all related parties apply the final regulations to modifications that occur before that date footnotes

repairs and updates to these properties and subsequently resells the homes to purchasers the class period commences on august 7 2020 the day after zillow published its second quarter 2020 financial results after the market closed on august 6 2020 in connection with its quarterly results zillow reported that quarterly revenue grew 28 year over year to 768 million driven primarily by a continued increase in zillow offers resale volume critically the company explained that while zillow offers entered q2 with home acquisitions temporarily paused due to market uncertainty resulting from the

new york jan 6 2022 prnewswire public relations executive ronn torossian released the following book excerpt from his best selling pr book for immediate release regarding israel s pr especially relevant against the backdrop of israel s foreign minister yair lapid s recent comments this week israel s foreign minister yair lapid warned that israel will face intense campaigns to label it an apartheid state in 2022 we think that in the coming year there will be debate that is unprecedented in its venom and in its radioactivity around the words israel as an apartheid state lapid said during a zoom briefing with israeli journalists lapid called the accusation that israel is an apartheid state a despicable lie against that backdrop public relations executive ronn torossian released the following book excerpt from his best selling pr book for immediate release regarding israel s pr especially relevant against the backdrop of lapid s comments the state of israel is for me a personal passion and with love i will say that israel does a horrible job when it comes to pr the simple message that israel is a tiny democratic country surrounded by murderous despots doesn t get through not to governments the media or the public case in point many people don t understand the difference in size between all of the arab states and the jewish state the total area of the state of israel is 8 019 square miles and it s surrounded by arab nations egypt lebanon syria and jordan and the mediterranean sea egypt alone covers an area of 386 662 square miles israel has a population of about 8 3 million people and the arab nations surrounding her total 428 million people everyone can relate to concepts about distance and size such as the fact that israel is the size of new jersey and is completely surrounded by much larger countries with huge swaths of land and bigger populations who would like to see the tiny country destroyed still the media worldwide writes of the jewish settlements and west bank as key conflicts between the arabs and israel leaving aside the perspective of just how tiny these areas actually are or that israel won them in a defensive war that started before there were any so called occupied territories is like blaming a flea for a pit bull s aggressive behavior the state of israel puts itself in danger because of its flawed public relations and communications work in contrast terrorist organizations hamas hezbollah and certain arab nations have hired pr agencies to lobby for them in the press and on the world stage terror groups have engaged reporters and journalists share meals with them drink with them and win their favor israel doesn t even pay for its diplomatic employees to use cell phones after hours or on weekends a necessity in today s 24 7 media world because of archaic and bureaucratic rules israel s pr has gotten better in recent years but it can still do better at framing the debate by using more spokespeople who are fluent in the english language israel regularly sends diplomats who don t speak the native language to other countries that means there is still much that can be done to fight and influence it s a question of shaping concepts and of speaking in terms and metaphors that the world understands look at what happens when private investors legally buy property in eastern jerusalem and legally build homes for jews an internet search reveals that the media see such construction as evidence of jewish occupation and a primary reason why there will never be peace in the middle east why not create messaging about how a jewish person can legally build a home and live anywhere in the world except israel jews can buy and build in harlem or east los angeles paris or moscow but not in jerusalem they can buy real estate and coexist elsewhere why not there that is the message israel should be sending israel like any country or brand or business needs to make its own case and cannot depend on others to do this work the advice i have for israel stands for any organization or group with an underdog status or that is suffering the consequences of being misunderstood the following points are useful for any brand or business that wants to control its own narrative make your own case be proactive and passionate in educational pr efforts in israel s case for instance there should be a concerted pr effort to continually refute moral equivalency myths that are perpetuated in many corners of the press and taught in college classrooms around the world myths that equate palestinian suicide bombings with israeli efforts to stop bombers before they act refuting the myths can be done through op eds reports videos blogs outreach programs and so on but it can t be saved for a crisis it has to be ongoing argue on your strengths not your weaknesses harmful framing by the media or others can be handled effectively only with counter framing presenting your narrative without debating the negative frame thereby giving it credibility or trying to justify yourself against it in doing so you give credence to and reinforce a point of view you re actually trying to dismiss in this case israel needs to start a conversation on her own terms and provide the media with multiple stories that discuss its innovations in technology security and other advances israel needs to talk about how it made the desert bloom from its founding in 1948 it transformed a land that is 65 percent desert into a country rich in diversity and teeming with technology intel microsoft and ibm have all developed robust profitable and innovative businesses in the country israeli doctors have won important prizes in the medical development field the country today thrives financially as well with a booming economy and an independent stock market it also has the only true democracy in the region consistent and united pr there is nothing more counterproductive and irritating to a spokesperson than having to compete with a colleague who is operating with a different message this is the case with israel spokespeople for the state often speak at cross purposes with the press and contradict each other the same goes for a company can you imagine what would happen if the media had to compare two or three different sources within the same organization to discover the firm s stance on an issue always make sure those who speak to the press are on the same page and understand and communicate a unified message act with rapidity israel is agile and dynamic it can use this to its advantage imagine a boat the size of the titanic which takes considerable time and effort to change course and redirect in comparison imagine israel as a small lifeboat that maneuvers quickly and easily within the waters of world affairs in pr terms israel can change key messages quickly and deftly when necessary the ability to respond quickly has many benefits engage social media frequently social media should be used on a daily basis and in a positive way in the long run it is the daily actions of a brand that determine its overall image a daily blog post helps build a reputation as do regular speaking engagements and consistent outreach and public events social media in cases like this allows you to at least go directly to your supporters and customers ronn torossian is ceo of 5wpr one of america s leading pr

in the past three weeks virginia has broken state records for new covid 19 cases testing positivity rates and more in the central region the virginia department of health reports that nearly one in every 100 people developed a new case of covid during the week that ended jan 1 that s nearly double the previous peak in january 2021 and despite the now dominant omicron variant s reportedly milder symptoms it s taking a toll on hospitals vcu medical center announced this week that they d postpone non urgent procedures and the use of donated blood products immediately less likely to put people in the hospital but when you have a multi fold increase in the number of people getting it even though it may be less virulent we re still getting fairly high hospitalization numbers said dr ron clark chief medical officer at vcu medical in fact probably in the next week virginia will surpass the number of patients in the hospital with covid 19 compared to the previous variant this case surge like previous ones resulted in skyrocketing demand for tests but many virginians across the state struggled to find a test when they needed one as the number of people at public testing events far exceed their capacity and pharmacy slots fill up take home tests have gone up in price or sold out altogether from online and brick and mortar stores responding to an open request for comment from vpm news stephen williams of charlottesville said he came down with symptoms over the holidays but wasn t able to locate any tests williams had planned to go to a drive through testing event on monday before the storm made that impossible with snow and an uncertain covid status he was unable to check on family who lost power in albemarle a tree fell on their cars and they still have not regained electricity since yesterday they haven t been able to make a cell phone call to me that maintained a signal for more than 30 seconds before dropping out since yesterday afternoon williams said tuesday but i ve been able to establish they are alive and staying warm with kerosene heaters my plan at the moment is to wait until i feel well enough to dig out my car and get to the next drive through testing site available in a press conference earlier this week deputy director of the state office of epidemiology laurie forlano said pcr tests are in good stock and the state has sufficient laboratory capacity to process them and the governor s office announced a plan on thursday to put many of those pcr tests to use the state will be standing up a series of community testing centers or ctcs nearby existing vaccination centers a ctc at richmond raceway in henrico will open this saturday jan 9 there is however an ongoing shortage of rapid antigen tests which contributed to the overall issues over the holidays forlano said vdh is still waiting on weeks or even months old orders from manufacturers most at home tests on the market are rapid so they re subject to the shortage too cat long public information officer for the richmond and henrico health districts described the demand spike and ensuing supply shortage as something of a perfect storm we re seeing an increased demand because of increased transmission and increased travel long said people aren t getting at home tests so they re turning to city and state run events although those events in theory have access to enough pcr tests from the state staffing is extremely limited at this stage of the pandemic with a highly contagious variant it s difficult to find swabbers in particular so situations occur where crowds of people looking for tests are turned away responding to vpm randi taggart said my son young adult also had an exposure and drove all the way to woodbridge for his testing appointment after waiting over an hour in line it was a drive through test site he was told they d run out of tests even though he d scheduled an appointment despite shortages there are still a wide variety of ways to get tested through a doctor s office your local pharmacy city and state testing events and more and the biden administration promises to finalize a plan to send tests directly to americans this month but to avoid missing out on a still limited supply of tests and opportunities forlano says to plan ahead as much as possible she recommended using the pcr test if timing allows you to quarantine for up to a week although results take longer to process they are more reliable forlano also suggested that people without a known exposure who are looking to travel or see friends or family should consider the current strain on testing systems we are also asking people to consider the criticality of that kind of testing and whether other options might be possible during this time of very high

this story is part of the capital journal s ongoing package previewing the 2022 kansas legislative session follow reporters andrew bahl andrewbahl and jason tidd jason_tidd on twitter or go to cjonline com for more state government and politics coverage flush with cash kansas lawmakers are set to debate how to spend or whether to spend a windfall of taxpayer money the 2022 legislative session starts monday and democratic gov laura kelly is expected to unveil a budget proposal later in the week my top priority kelly told the capital journal last month is always presenting a balanced budget that fully funds our public schools that will close the bank of kdot that will take care of our kids in our child welfare system that will allow us to continue to invest in economic development you re reaping incredible returns on investment there the governor is also prioritizing axing the food sales tax an idea that has bipartisan support it s an aggressive program but it is one that we can sustain kelly said i want to get that done i want to get it done quickly and cleanly at the beginning of the legislative session economists in november projected a 2 9 billion surplus and that number could grow as tax revenues continue to outpace expectations last week kelly announced that total tax collections in december beat the month s estimate by 64 5 million axing the food sales tax would cost about 450 million the proposal has bipartisan support though it is unclear whether republicans would support a standalone bill without other tax cuts that have doomed prior attempts a separate kelly proposal to give kansas residents a one time 250 rebate comes with a 445 million price tag republicans have said that temporary relief is not good enough i appreciate governor kelly s election year revelation that kansans are taxed too much senate president ty masterson said in a statement on the rebate while i am open to all ideas to help reduce the tax burden on kansas families permanent solutions will be our priority limiting government spending but some lawmakers are exploring options to legally bind the government s hands last month the special committee on taxation heard details of tax and expenditure limitations in other states such fiscal mechanisms are designed to restrain the growth of government budgets by limiting tax revenue spending or both they can be tied to various indicators such as inflation or personal income growth these efforts to rein in government i have hope and i am optimistic we can get this done said committee chair sen caryn tyson r parker who is running for state treasurer tyson who is chair of the senate assessment and taxation committee has also called for eliminating taxes on retirement accounts including social security eliminating the 1 5 mill levy collected for state building funds to provide property tax relief and freezing property tax payments for seniors more kansas lawmakers eye legal limit on government spending growth with bumper year of tax surplus wielding an ax gov laura kelly announces her axe the food tax campaign at dillons grocery store 800 n w 25th st on nov 8 kelly plans to introduce a bill into the coming legislative session that would eliminate the state sales tax on food resisting a spending spree republican attorney general derek schmidt who is the frontrunner to challenge kelly in the november election urged fiscal caution in a dec 28 facebook post kansas should proceed cautiously and budget conservatively resisting calls for a spending spree he said he said lawmakers and the governor should pass food sales tax relief pay for core obligations including schools highways and public safety save some of the surplus for a rainy day and pay off state debt especially in the public employee retirement system schmidt said the surplus comes with a context of similar situations elsewhere as well as the boom will inevitably come down states all around the country have record amounts of money he said because 1 bidenflation is driving up state tax collections 2 the record high stock market is driving up state tax collections and 3 the federal government continues to flood states local governments and individuals with newly printed money under the labels of covid relief and infrastructure which when spent further drives up state tax collections kansas chamber calls for tax relief business lobbyists with the kansas chamber called for tax relief during a tuesday news conference on the results of a november and december survey of 300 business owners and executives chamber officials pointed to recommendations made in a 2019 tax modernization study conducted through a chamber partnership with the right leaning tax foundation many of the issues have already been addressed but there s still quite a bit of good recommendations that are in that proposal that can still be accomplished on all front sales tax income tax corporate income tax and property taxes said chamber lobbyist eric stafford so the work s not done even though there was a lot of positive changes that took place last year the legislature passed a slate of controversial tax cuts last session when republican lawmakers overrode a kelly veto democrats argued the legislation would be fiscally destructive likening it to the tax experiment under former gov sam brownback the bill had an estimated price tag of 284 million over three years and included some measures that had bipartisan support the chamber poll found that while taxes were the top concern of businesses in 2018 and 2019 covid 19 became the most important issue in 2020 in 2021 it was the quality of the workforce followed by taxes more business is booming in kansas gov laura kelly says as economist remains optimistic despite concerns business leaders have consistently said taxes are the top concern affecting profitability even during the years of the brownback tax cuts additionally while 62 of business leaders currently believe state and local taxes are too much that has consistently been the survey s majority position a plurality of business leaders support decreasing the state sales tax half want to cut the personal income tax and two thirds want property taxes reduced a majority of business leaders have consistently said they believe lowering taxes would help the economy though the percentage has grown in recent years to 73 chamber president and ceo alan cobb said their legislative agenda is to lower rates i think lowering marginal rates and lowering the corporate income tax rate would be good good policy he said and of course we have an election year and you can t dismiss the politics of an election year about getting things done or not the chamber is not directly backing kelly s proposal to eliminate the food sales tax we re all for tax reductions cobb said i think we d prefer an overall reduction in the sales tax rate and maybe they can do both budgeting process takes time while government agencies politicians lobbyists and activists could find numerous ways to spend extra cash it is unclear what may make it into or be left out of the budget proposals are not yet public and high profile budget issues are typically resolved late in the legislative session an economist on the governor s tax reform council has said the surplus could pay for medicaid expansion democrats have long pushed for expansion which would primarily be funded through federal money school choice issues could complicate education funding debates and it is unclear how far the governor is willing to compromise it depends upon what you mean by school choice kelly said if you mean diverting taxpayer dollars to private schools yeah i m not and never have been interested in doing that i think one of the reasons that kansas has had as good a school system as we have had is because we ve devoted our taxpayer dollars to that and not let them be distracted or pushed over to other entities but rather keep the focus on our k 12 classrooms the chamber survey asked business leaders what they consider to be more important for improving education pitting more funding against improving performance business leaders have consistently sided with performance over funding they don t want more funding for more funding s sake it s got to be geared toward improving the performance said pat mcferron who conducted the survey jason tidd is a statehouse reporter for the topeka capital journal he can be reached by email at jtidd gannett com follow him on twitter jason_tidd this article originally

perhaps it s only right for a story about a convicted criminal to start with a confession the following is a partial list of the media i have consumed on the topic of elizabeth holmes no relation recently convicted of four fraud related charges for lying to investors in her company theranos the john carreyrou book bad blood secrets and lies in a silicon valley startup the john carreyrou podcast bad blood the final chapter the abc podcast the dropout the alex gibney documentary the inventor out for blood in silicon valley i have listened to the carreyrou book on audio twice i have watched the gibney documentary i believe three times if theranos fever is a disease i am the patient who kept going back and putting my mouth directly on the water fountain no matter how many times they tell me to stop making myself sick all over again the draw of the scam part of this i admit is rooted in a more general weakness for stories about brazen grabs for other people s money particularly people who have a lot of it people who have enough money that they buy magic beans the painting magic beans the stock magic beans the experience there were two documentaries in 2019 about the ill fated fyre festival and i watched both i would have watched three who am i kidding i would have watched ten that iconic and possibly apocryphal cheese sandwich i love sour grapes about rich types who paid small fortunes for counterfeit wine and made you look a true story about fake art about a massive bamboozle involving paintings as it related to investors theranos has always been for me a bit like magic beans the startup something rich people invested in because other rich people were doing it and said they should do it too and when the magic evaporated well all those rich people were furious if you take this comparison to its logical conclusion here s the question was elizabeth holmes the seller or was she in fact the beans did she make the shiny object or was she herself the shiny object if you have thus far avoided theranos fever some basics holmes was a young stanford dropout who wanted to be the steve jobs of biotech when she was still in college she had this idea that you could put a patch on your arm that would detect your medical problem and administer your medications through your skin when i try to envision this it s always on george jetson she carried her jobs iness through her adoption of a black turtleneck uniform her hiring of people who came from apple and her apparent conviction that a slick looking interface was the lever you pulled to make money come out later she began to follow her dream of making a machine that could run hundreds of medical tests on a couple of drops of blood from pricking your finger she raised a fortune from investors got on the cover of fortune hobnobbed with political and financial mucky mucks of many stripes was hailed as the rare woman to break through the very male world of silicon valley startup founders and then saw it all go to pieces when it turned out that the machines didn t work the way she hoped and she according to the charges on which she was just convicted didn t tell her investors the truth elizabeth holmes belongs to a robust cohort of startup founders who have seen their reputations tank wework s ousted adam neumann saying a 47 billion valuation might just have warped his perspective is amazing but there s something about the brazenness with which she operated that makes her mesmerizing to me you can keep your high level financial maneuvers and your sophisticated document manipulations according to carreyrou s reporting and some of the trial testimony theranos got around demands for demonstrations of its machines with painfully obvious dodges moves about as complicated as making beeping noises with your mouth to make a toddler think you re a robot maybe it was her capacity for invention after all not invention of the machine but invention of herself self made indeed i keep asking myself how did any of this work on anybody how did she have two former secretaries of state on her board henry kissinger and george schultz both over 90 years old and wiggle around the doubts about her motives that one would think decades of experience in diplomacy would instill how did a company like walgreens which undoubtedly wouldn t change the length of the tail on the w logo without being certain that they understood every last possible consequence spend 140 million on a doomed deal with theranos maybe it was her capacity for invention after all not invention of the machine but invention of herself consider this elizabeth holmes was touted at one point as the youngest ever woman self made billionaire but forbes revised her net worth from billions to zero in a single year and it wasn t because she gave all that money away or spent it on candy and magazines it just no longer existed it s almost charming the verve of this particular kind of operator right imagine i walked up to you with my hand held behind my back and i told you i had a unicorn horn of potentially unlimited value imagine i offered you a one percent interest in my unicorn horn which you have not seen yet for 10 000 and imagine you believed me you paid me the money on the one hand i only have 10 000 but on the other i own a unicorn horn that has been valued by the market at one million dollars i am a self made millionaire you may have never even seen the unicorn horn but i have the proof of its worth your belief in me has defined me how impressive someone might say when walking past me that yesterday she was broke and today she is a self made millionaire in this example i do not actually have a unicorn horn of course and i don t have a million dollars but i have a story and elizabeth holmes did not have operational technology that could do hundreds of tests on a finger prick s worth of blood and she did not have billions of dollars but she had a story jeff chiu ap ap elizabeth holmes speaks at the fortune global forum in san francisco in 2015 underestimate her at your peril we come inevitably to this most of the purveyors of magic beans who have become cultural and sometimes criminal legends have been men plenty of people before me have spent considerable time since holmes came to power analyzing the complicated gender dynamics around her rise and fall we know sexism is rampant in tech in silicon valley in press coverage in everything no one gets the chance to opt out of all relevant context she s sometimes argued that the treatment of her has been sexist compared to the treatment of other similarly sketchy startup founders and it probably has been at times why wouldn t it be how couldn t it be but the gender dynamics in the theranos story pull in multiple directions skepticism lack of faith in one s work and ability can be the result of bias but maybe in this case the many powerful men pulled into her orbit as investors or board members or public allies or in some cases credulous journalists were less skeptical of her than they might have been if she weren t a young woman maybe they just didn t have their antennae up when you see the way men like george schultz acted around her it doesn t seem patronizing as much as just paternal introducing her in 2015 schultz said his first thought when he met her was that she seemed like a friend of his granddaughter s he claimed that he quickly realized he d underestimated her and he began to rave about her accomplishments but did he really understand the ways he d underestimated her what if the most important sexist misapprehension of elizabeth holmes was that some of her backers believed young women to be less driven less capable and therefore less dangerous to take at their word than young men what if they underestimated not just her abilities but also her ruthlessness what if she keenly understood sexism and used it to her advantage and what if given the way silicon valley works the way tech works the way big money works a woman less willing to exploit sexism would not have stood a chance what if the most important sexist misapprehension of elizabeth holmes was that some of her backers believed young women to be less driven less capable and therefore less dangerous to take at their word than young men what if they underestimated not just her abilities but also her ruthlessness vanessa friedman wrote in the new york times recently about holmes image makeover before and at her trial she described it as a transformation from black clad genius to besuited milquetoast whatever the purpose of that change was it s hard to deny that the elizabeth holmes of her trial was a very different one from the elizabeth you will see in any footage that was taken during the highest highs of her publicity swings as the aforementioned theranos enthusiast i am i almost didn t recognize her the first time i saw her during her trial different hair different makeup different clothes different bearing the abandonment of every element of her theranos era style except of course her deep voice which i have considered mostly a distraction if she artificially started speaking in a lower voice at some point because people didn t take her seriously that s a modest and understandable manipulation this question also got a lot more prickly when holmes testified about sexual and emotional abuse she said she suffered at the hands of sunny balwani her significantly older former boyfriend and her number two at theranos raising the issue of intimate partner abuse in the context of this trial to suggest balwani was really the driver of the bad acts at theranos was really complicated to navigate only partly because so much of what had been reported about elizabeth holmes had focused on how forceful she was how in charge more to come pop culture is not through with elizabeth holmes apple has a movie coming perhaps not the connection to apple that holmes dreamed of in which jennifer lawrence will play her adam mckay the big short is directing so it s probably not going to be a particularly flattering portrait hulu has a limited series coming much sooner in march in which holmes is played by amanda seyfried there were two podcasts at least one big book a big documentary it only makes sense that there will be two high profile fictional elizabeths as well i know myself i will watch both copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

rochester with long lines at covid 19 screening centers the demand for at home testing is high but the real world effectiveness of the rapid antigen kits is under question and the impact of a positive diagnosis is changing as well rapid antigen covid 19 tests are popular because in just minutes they can identify antigens or small viral proteins signaling infection nationally the use of such kits is believed to dwarf that of tests ordered through a lab when they can be found in stock at drug stores and online the tests are scooped up at high prices limiting access late last month the biden administration announced a goal of making 500 million such tests free to all americans though their arrival could take months the home kits have relieved pressure at testing centers but because the results are reported to private individuals and not the state some experts worry the tests have diminished the ability for health officials to track the prevalence of covid 19 advertisement minnesota health officials have supported their use regardless there are many public health benefits to having widespread rapid testing as long as people do what they are supposed to do with their results doug schultz of the minnesota department of health said in an email but the downside is that you do lose something as far as counting cases schultz says that health officials have always faced unknowns in tracking illness and have other ways to estimate the spread of omicron including through data reflecting hospital admissions and clinic visits less encouraging about the at home testing craze is the way that omicron appears to have diminished the reliability of negative results on antigen tests as well as the effectiveness of treatments available to those who worsen after infection antigen rapid tests less accurate early a long known drawback to rapid antigen tests is that they sometimes will miss a true case of covid 19 wrongly reporting that you are not infectious this is called a false negative and new research suggests it likely happens to a degree that can promote spread before omicron the best kits offered a 15 rate of false negatives with other studies showing a 40 rate for missing asymptomatic covid 19 according to the fda omicron has likely made these percentages worse to what degree was unknown that picture became clearer on wednesday jan 5 when the first real world study of rapid take home testing during the age of omicron suggested a three day lag between when people became highly infectious and the point at which rapid antigen tests spot the variant reporting in the pre print journal medrxiv org a platform for research that has not yet been peer reviewed and therefore should be read with caution researchers described a 30 person sample of vaccinated workers given daily sets of saliva pcr and nasal rapid antigen tests during december of 2021 advertisement the authors believe that the three day lag to spot covid 19 in rapid antigen tests was noteworthy for the high level of infectiousness early in the illness blythe adamson was lead author on a study of rapid antigen tests and the omicron variant contributed the part that was alarming was the viral load of the people in those days before they tested antigen positive said lead author blythe adamson infectious disease epidemiologist and economist we confirmed there were real transmissions that happened when people were antigen negative adamson says rapid antigen tests remain valuable tools as long as their risk of early false negatives with omicron is kept in mind we can t rely too heavily on a negative rapid antigen test meaning that we are not infectious to other people she said rapid antigen tests are still an incredibly valuable tool for people who ve had a couple days of symptoms who maybe they feel like they ve had allergies for a few days two lines now what the good news is if they sometimes miss omicron cases early in the course of illness rapid antigen tests are unlikely to deliver a positive finding in error with specificity accuracy ratings in the 99 range if you get a positive antigen test it usually not always but usually is a true positive said mayo clinic vaccinologist dr greg poland much like a pregnancy test a positive result from a nasal swab produces two lines on a test strip the latest cdc guidance says if you are fully vaccinated a positive result to a covid 19 test should lead to masking and isolation within the home for a period of five days this period may warrant a call to your health care provider if not necessarily a visit advertisement just because you have a positive test does not necessarily mean you have to interact with the medical system poland said there isn t enough medical system to handle everyone who would have a positive test if you are low risk a positive diagnosis during omicron is a lonely bout of masking tv and over the counter symptom management somebody who is young somebody who is healthy without co morbidities poland said somebody who has been vaccinated anybody who has mild symptoms that are not progressing they really don t need any interaction with the medical system other than to notify their health care provider if they get new symptoms that might be persisting the early days following a positive result are critical on the other hand for those at risk of poor outcomes from an infection for the elderly immune compromised and the unvaccinated and metabolically unhealthy early use of monoclonal antibodies made by lilly and regeneron had been effective at reducing hospitalization those no longer work as well with the omicron variant however according to poland newer monoclonal antibodies targeting omicron are in short supply due to the surge of new cases paxlovid an oral antiviral treatment for covid 19 is expected to reduce omicron hospitalizations but when faced with sick patients needing early treatments variant type is not always known to doctors in this way while omicron may turn out to be milder overall the tools for treatment are fewer in the meantime the triggers for seeking help after testing positive at home remain the same advertisement for the cdc the symptoms that warrant emergency attention include trouble breathing persistent pain or pressure in the chest new confusion inability to wake or stay awake and pale gray or blue colored skin lips or nail beds although skin tone can affect visibility of those symptoms
