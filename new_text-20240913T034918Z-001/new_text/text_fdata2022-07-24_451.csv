owning the right dividend stocks could be a path to a comfortable retirement roughly 64 million americans who receive social security benefits will see their distributions increase by 5 9 this year as an adjustment to meet cost of living increases if you ve been paying attention to inflation news it might sting knowing the benefit increase is coming in significantly below this year s rate of inflation in addition to the possibility that subsequent cost of living adjustments colas will fail to keep pace with shifts in the dollar s purchasing power the social security administration also acknowledges that the program s trust fund reserves will be depleted roughly 15 years from now unless congress takes action even assuming the social security program is fixed and colas keep pace with inflation owning a portfolio of income generating investments could help you shore up your retirement and with the stock market seeing big sell offs this year long term investors have an opportunity

with this new dividend king keith noonan pepsico with its strong core business and returned income profile pepsico pep 0 68 stock has long been a favorite among dividend investors the company has a fantastic collection of billion dollar snack and beverage brands and its scale and distribution advantages should allow the business to post a solid performance regardless of macroeconomic cycles and industry shifts while demand for soda has been declining in recent years pepsico has been successfully diversifying its beverage products and branching into new categories and the company s recently published second quarter results were very encouraging despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop sales increased more than 5 year over year in the second quarter meanwhile revenue excluding recent acquisitions was up 13 compared to the prior year period the consumer goods giant has now increased its annual payout for 50 years running putting it in the illustrious ranks of the dividend kings and it looks like pepsi is in good shape to continue delivering dividend growth this is a relatively low risk stock with a great dividend profile and it stands out as a worthwhile addition for

dividend payer you can depend on but as a stock that holds up relatively well even in a bearish environment yes procter gamble pg 0 08 is the typical go to name in the consumer goods space it s got a great pedigree and perhaps more importantly to most u s investors it s a domestic name people are more familiar with while unilever brands like ben jerry s vaseline and hellman s can be found in the united states a sizable chunk of the company s business is done overseas that s ultimately a good thing for anyone looking to sidestep marketwide trouble it seems like bear markets and recessions tend to be a little more intense within the u s than they are elsewhere at the same time an investment in overseas businesses can mute some of the currency related volatility many investors suffer when most of their stocks are u s dollar denominated other benefits of owning unilever are the company s dividend history and the current yield while it s not a dividend aristocrat unilever hasn t failed to pay a quarterly dividend since 2009 or a half year dividend since 1999 and these payouts have steadily grown the whole time with the current quarterly payout rate more than 80 above where it was ten years ago given this history i m surprised you can still step into a yield of 4 1 i m not going to complain though the arteries of the u s energy sector daniel foelber kinder morgan dividend investors know that a 3 yield backed by a reliable company is the sweet spot for passive income however there are a few companies that fetch even higher yields without sacrificing reliability one top stock is energy infrastructure giant kinder morgan kmi 0 88 kinder morgan operates one of the largest networks of natural gas oil and carbon dioxide transportation and storage kinder morgan is a midstream company in the business of transporting fuels for its customers not producing or refining hydrocarbons this business model leaves less room for growth but instead generates reliable cash flows thanks to long term fixed fee or take or pay contracts this makes midstream companies far less cyclical based on oil and gas prices than producers or refiners the dynamic was put on display during the oil and gas crash of 2020 when midstream companies fared far better than upstream or downstream firms or even the integrated majors like exxonmobil or chevron kinder morgan s high cash flow supports its dividend which has a yield of 6 4 at the time of this writing investors shouldn t expect kinder morgan to be a high growth name or even outperform the broader stock market rather the ideal kinder morgan investor is someone looking for income and capital preservation given the importance of natural gas in the u s economy and the growing demand for international exports kinder morgan stands out as one of the best passive income machines to buy now

it is commonly believed that acupuncture played a key role in china s medical history and is often seen as an integral part of china s traditional health care at least in the west however was this actually the case the real story is much more complex than this and in fact the use of the practice seems to have ebbed and flowed as wider medical knowledge advanced or as governments changed the misty origins of acupuncture the exact origins of acupuncture are somewhat hazy while historians are sure the practice began in china the exact date is contested sharpened stones thought to be used in the place of needles have been found from around 6000 bc however it is not clear that these were used for acupuncture instead they may have been used in other procedures such as bloodletting or lancing abscesses documents from 198 bc that were found within the ma wang dui tomb in china hold no references to acupuncture procedures although they mention the theory of meridians explained below there is also evidence from the ice man who was found preserved from 3300 bc when the alpine glacier melted that these meridians were being used to treat disease his body was covered with tattoo marks which seem to have been from treatment that involved them as david ramey and paul d buell argue when acupuncture is believed to begin depends on what evidence is accepted as well as how we define the practice while there are early mentions of needling it is unclear whether this practice can be considered acupuncture if we take the use of any kind of penetrating instrument to be acupuncture then the practice began in very early china but if this logic is used it can also be applied to other early societies that used bloodletting or cautery on the human body both of which involved the use of a penetrating instrument in the 1970s archaeologists found inside the tomb of han dynasty prince liu sheng 113 bc four gold and five silver needles however it is unclear what kind of needling these were used for if any and they may not have been used for acupuncture at all ancient chinese statue showing acupuncture points source yü lan adobe stock the first mention of therapeutic needling is in a historical text the shiji records of the historian of sima qian written in 90 bc while the text mentions needling it does not mention insertion points or the flow of qi within the body explained below or how it may be influenced by such a practice the earliest written documentation of acupuncture can be found in the yellow emperor s classic of internal medicine which dates from about 100 bc this book is set out as a conversation between the emperor and his learned minister chhi po with the latter answering the former s questions it is thought that the methods described in the text includes traditions handed down over centuries while this book mentions meridians the exact site of acupuncture points is developed after its time for the next few centuries acupuncture continued to develop and is mentioned in other texts it gradually became one of the standard therapies used in chinese health care it was relied on in medical practice alongside the use of herbs massages diet and moxibustion heat it wasn t until between the 14th and 16th centuries during the ming dynasty 1368 1644 when the great compendium of acupuncture and moxibustion was published that acupuncture became what we understand it to be today the great compendium was published while the ming dynasty was flourishing and it was during this period that the practice developed into what would become modern acupuncture the book itself describes 365 acupuncture points where there are openings to the channels and through which needles can be placed to modify the flow of qi these observations like all other internal medical observations were made from living subjects because dissection was forbidden medical theorists and practitioners where therefore unable to examine the inner workings of the human body and had to rely on inferences they made from the outside the text is made up of three sections all written by different authors from different times the dates of each section are unclear although the main content of the book is thought to date to around the 5th to 8th centuries ad most of what remains went through a final revision in the 11th century ad which means what remains of the earlier work may not be the original ramey and buell argue that during the song period 960 1279 ad acupuncture or an early form of what we know as acupuncture was increasingly used later theories of systematic correspondence and qi were integrated then finally no earlier than late qing times 1644 1911 ad there came the development of fine steel needles chinese medicine drawing a standing figure showing the series of acupuncture points for controlling diseases of the heart and sexual organs 18th century wellcome images cc by 4 0 chinese medical theories the theories behind acupuncture were closely tied to the general understanding of medicine in ancient china those who used acupuncture believed that the body contained energy that flowed within it this energy if channelized correctly could create balance and health this energy flow is called qi it was believed that qi flowed through the body via three main channels called meridians these meridians were representative of the main organs and functions of the body but did not follow the exact routes of the nerves and the blood prior to this in the earliest case chinese medicine was linked to beliefs in ancestors it was believed that dead ancestors were able to endanger or end human life therefore early healing practices attempted to restore not only the living but the dead too as this understanding of medicine declined in popularity the belief in magical demonological or supernatural forces increased it was believed that demons in the body could cause medical issues and that inserting needles or stone lancets could kill or expel them the most influential period in the development of early chinese medicine was during the han dynasty 2nd century bc to 2nd century ad during this period medical theories took a dramatic turn natural laws which were conceptualized through doctrines like yin yang and five elements became popular while people in this period certainly still relied on old theories of demons and ancestors the theories were overwhelmingly a lot more rational acupuncture needles with case probably from china or japan 1800s source wellcome images cc by 4 0 the decline of acupuncture from about the 17th century onwards the use of acupuncture in china began to decline while the practice had been a minor tradition throughout chinese history people began to associate it with superstitions and saw it as irrational then in 1822 the practice was essentially outlawed when the emperor issued a decree which excluded acupuncture from the imperial medical institution this was an effort to modernize medicine however as expected rural healers and some scholars continued to practice acupuncture and held on to their knowledge the practice was also outlawed in this period in japan the rise of western medicine in china during the 20 th century led further to its decline in 1929 it was again outlawed by the government along with other forms of traditional chinese medicine acupuncture chart with a series of points indicated on the figure of a standing chinese man watercolour china 17 wellcome collection cc by 4 0 the revival of acupuncture during the great leap forward in the 1950s and the cultural revolution of the 1960s came the revival of traditional forms of medicine including acupuncture this was promoted by chairman mao zedong himself however it is said that mao rejected the use of acupuncture when he was ill in favor of more modern methods diverging strands of acupuncture theory were brought together to create one consensus known as traditional chinese medicine this also included herbal medicine special research centers for acupuncture were set up in the 1950s throughout the country and the practice was made available at hospitals these western style hospitals often had separate acupuncture departments these traditional methods were presented to the population as pragmatic solutions to health issues in a country that was severely undersupplied with doctors the spread of acupuncture to other countries acupuncture spread to many countries throughout history it made its way to korea and japan in the 6th century it also made its way to vietnam through commercial routes when they were opened up between the 8th and 10th centuries it is said that chinese medical techniques were mentioned for the first time in western literature as early as the 13th century this was in a travelogue by william of rubruck however the west would not gain the knowledge of needling until a few centuries later it spread more thoroughly to the west with the east india company and ten rhijne rhijne worked for the company and described the practice medically around 1860 the practice of acupuncture had reached france and germany a bit earlier in the escorial in madrid there are a few 16th century manuals on the practice and it seemed to be somewhat popular in europe for a while it first reached france via jesuit missionaries who brought back reports of the practice in the 16th century it was then embraced widely by french physicians in the 18th and 19th centuries several prominent physicians from france advocated for its use however they face opposition from other equally prominent physicians the latter accused the formed of resurrecting an absurd doctrine from well deserved oblivion ramey and buell 2010 later french acupuncture was greatly influenced by the diplomat souliet du morant who spent a number of years in china and published several treatises about it from 1939 onwards in the first half of the 19th century america developed an interest in acupuncture particular interest was gained when in 1971 a member of the us press corps was treated with the method while he recovered from an emergency appendectomy in china the procedure was successful and he described the experience to the new york times the practice was finally truly accepted in the us when a nih consensus conference reported positive evidence for its effectiveness in some conditions in 19th century britain there was also a brief period of popularity a journal published in 1821 recorded the process of acupuncture however in 1929 the editor of the medio chirurgical review noted that no one was talking about the practice anymore it seems that it went out of fashion rather quickly to conclude the use of acupuncture has a long and complex history one that is often hard to trace in its entirety what is evident though is that it did experience some periods of popularity in both china and the wider world as with a lot of medical practices from the past however it changed and developed with the ebb and flow of medical and surgical advancement top image therapist giving acupuncture to a woman source juripozzi adobe stock by molly dowdeswell

hey there time traveller this article was published 21 07 2022 634 days ago so information in it may no longer be current the best of the next generation of north american bred percherons were put on display at the world percheron congress and among the winners is a birtle born colt jim lane owner of lone oak percherons and the colt couldn t be happier because his colt is a product of his own stock and a testament to the quality of the bloodlines he s spent years developing the colt named lone oak 20 mike walked off with the top prize on monday at the brandon breeders challenge in the two year old cart category at the world percheron congress the product of two of lane s livestock sire father lone oak 20 crown royal and dam mother lone oak 12 taylor submitted lone oak 20 mike is dressed and ready to go to competition thursday morning he was named the winner in the two year old cart category of the breeder s challenge at the world percheron congress on monday a culmination of years of luck and hard work for lone oak percherons in birtle lane said this win means a lot to himself and lone oak because they bred the sire and dam as well he explained when the breeder s challenge was announced in 2018 stables could nominate sires to breed and they nominated crown royal for themselves the mother taylor used to be a part of the lead of the stable s six hitch team the challenge involved owners in canada and the u s nominating and selling their stallions for breeding services across both countries for three years each stallion received one to two breedings at an auction in ontario offspring stallion and mare were viewed and judged on quality physical attributes temperament and overall health a combined pot of 50 000 in cash was up for grabs along with the prestige of having a winning horse lane agreed when asked if the win speaks volumes to his breeding program saying the whole point of the challenge and breeding and training percherons in general is to improve the bloodline so it can continue and hopefully mike will carry on his genes to the next generation this should help us tremendously with that win because it is showing what we are bringing out of them he said he did really well he s only been to town twice but he has a long career ahead of him he s also in the manitoba futurity as well and he has some more place to go yet he added they ran him through a sale at a breeders show in saskatoon in 2021 and creelman farms in iowa bought half of the ownership rights to him the immediate plan is to have mike part of a junior team with a three year old from the creelman s team a junior team cannot be older than five years old combined lane said so far it s a good partnership said lane but sometime in the future one will buy out the other karen mckinley the brandon sun rose hill electric is barely five months old and already getting superstar treatment as winner of the breeder s challenge current senior year foal he was getting dressed for another competition on thursday with jocelyn leclaire grooming his face and ears while nicole woodbury braided his mane it was nice of them to buy half and see what we have and stick their foot out he said along with two year old cart there were categories for junior current year foal senior current year foal yearling halter and two year old halter rose hill stable in viking alta claimed top prizes for current year foal and senior current year foal with rose hill elite and rose hill electric respectively a challenge like this is a long wait said owner gord ruzicka with a lot of variables along the way before the final critical minutes in the ring but in the end the challenge has been a great initiative because it stirs up interest between stables as well as offering a valuable prize to the winners this also helps stables set each other up and compare one another s programs and stock everyone is out to win a ribbon and money but collectively they are doing this because they want to improve the breed any time you have a program for young horses you can stack yourself up against other breeders and see what you need to do and what other sires are doing he said it gives you an idea of what you need to do and where to go with your next sire he s been working with horses his whole life breeding and showing he said shows are important and he goes to as many as he can that are relatively nearby in canada and the united states primarily to support it but to also check out fellow stables the simple act of their presence keeps the industry and breed going as people develop their bloodlines it s natural to want certain attributes depending on he need he said however it s not just about show as many of their horses also work some will want slenderer legs and big hooves leaner bodies and higher steps for showmanship in the ring while others will want more stocky features for work or aesthetics either way breeding is about improving and adapting to what is wanted at the time karen mckinley the brandon sun rose hill elite born in april relaxes in the alley outside his stall while waiting to be cleaned and dressed for another competition on thursday already a champion at barely three months old winning the breeder s challenge junior current year foal for percherons he said there is still a bright future heavy horses are a big time and money commitment but there is still a demand for them in many areas beyond show they are still a sought after workhorse for farming and industry with groups like the amish as well as a much loved cart and

growing up in roanoke junior word spent weekends with his dad and his granddad fixing up the family cars tinkering with his uncle s 1984 chevy pickup or his dad s old dodge whenever a new part was needed for a repair there was only one place to go they all shopped at advance word said they would talk biblically about going into those stores and buying everything from tires to washing machines to parts the roanoke founded advance auto parts chain which sprouted up with three local stores when it was started nine decades ago and now spans over 4 600 stores nationwide loomed large for not only the word family but for the entire region where long timers still referred it to as advance stores a throwback to its early days as a more generalized department store where shoppers could get housewares and find the town s biggest displays of children s toys each holiday season for word that time with his dad and his granddad would spark a lifelong love of cars and a career that brought him to advance auto as a local store manager some 20 years ago and allowed him to work his way up to a division president of the fortune 500 company today and it all started right here in the valley he said with families coming together to keep a car running and weekend trips to the nearest advance auto to grab a part driving over here i was actually pretty emotional because these people and these stores just meant so much to me personally and to my family and friends word said earlier this month when advance auto gathered its local employees together to celebrate the company s 90th anniversary these stores have meant a ton to the community he said it s just phenomenal to think of that story and the history of advance auto parts and our community in roanoke founded in 1932 when arthur taubman a self made businessman bought a trio of struggling stores operating in roanoke and lynchburg advance auto parts grew into an economic powerhouse hitting a streak in the 1980s and 1990s under the leadership of taubman s son nick taubman when it was doubling its size every three years as it built new stores in new markets that prosperity which led to advance auto becoming publicly traded in 2001 mirrored that of the valley their fortunes seeming to rise together said corporate representatives noel c taylor roanoke s mayor throughout the 1980s once likened advance auto to a roanoke icon on par with what the golden gate bridge symbolized in san francisco or the kentucky derby meant to louisville today the company no longer calls roanoke its corporate home base as it shifted its headquarters designation to raleigh in 2018 lured there by a 12 million incentive package and a labor pool in north carolina s research triangle that was deemed a better fit for the it and software development initiatives the chain had on its horizon no jobs in roanoke were cut or moved in the shift there continue to be about 1 000 advance auto staffers in the valley officials said across corporate positions operations at its distribution center on blue hills drive and jobs in customer service and sales the company remains one of the top 20 employers in the region according to 2020 state data advance auto leaders said the valley is still considered a key part of the company s operations and its future this will always be the home of advance auto parts said joey blackburn a vice president and also a valley native it means a lot to me it means a lot to everyone here on july 13 the company hosted a celebration of its anniversary outside one of its local storefronts a site on thirteenth street that is the successor to one of advance auto s first flagship outlets the original store debuted in downtown then moved near ninth street as its need for space grew before expanding again into its current larger footprint the festivities which included remarks from city administrators also served as an employee appreciation event with staffers invited to enjoy food trucks music and a display of classic cars the auto parts chain which serves both professional mechanics and do it yourself customers emerged from the height of the pandemic with strong financial reports fueled by a boost in sales as drivers filled their hours at home with learning new skills including car repair they had time to stay at home watch youtube and learn how to work on their vehicles blackburn said or they could come in visit with some of our service team members and ask questions and talk about how to repair their vehicles the company reported a record 10 7 growth in comparable sales in its 2021 annual report its stock was trading at about 185 per share on the day of its anniversary event over the coming weeks it will be offering a variety of special promotions tied to its 90th anniversary including online and in store sales as well as a social media contest underway this month encouraging customers to share the most memorable drives of their lives in roanoke it also presented the police and fire departments with gift cards totaling 5 000 that first responders will be using in their community outreach programs the police department plans to give its gift cards to its patrol officers who will be able to give the 25 cards to drivers with busted tail lights or other small car problems the chance to help citizens fix a problem rather than writing them with a ticket is a chance to build a stronger more closely connected community officials said this is the first year the police department and advance auto have tried the partnership during the anniversary celebration assistant city manager brent robinson reflected on the impact that advance auto has had on the region s economy and quality of life over the past nine decades if you look at the jobs and the revenue they ve brought to this valley it s enhanced us all over the years he said the city of roanoke really appreciates what you ve done and we hope for many more years of success
spread this news by associated press london twitter reported a quarterly loss friday and declining revenue caught wall street off guard with the number of people using the platform on the rise the latest quarterly earnings figures offered a glimpse into how the social media platform has performed during a months long negotiation with billionaire and tesla ceo elon musk after he said that he would buy the company and then changed his mind it was worse than industry analysts had anticipated the company lost 270 million in the april june period or 8 cents per share wall street was expecting a per share profit of 14 cents according to a poll by factset inflation has crimped advertising spending and that was a huge drag on twitter s quarterly revenue which slid 1 to 1 18 billion the company also cited uncertainty over the acquisition by musk twitter is holding no calls with analysts and will not publish a letter to shareholders as is the norm because of the pending acquisition the underlying numbers at twitter however were good the number of daily active users rose 16 6 to 237 8 million compared with the same period a year before those numbers are particularly impressive in the wake of a quarterly earnings report late thursday from the social media company snap snap also saw advertising tumble in the high inflationary environment and shares plunged more than 30 friday before the opening bell when compared to the nightmare quarter of snap last night it shows digital ad spending is not falling off a cliff like feared which is a positive for others in the space such as facebook pinterest and google wrote dan ives who covers technology for wedbush shares of twitter inc rose 1 at the opening bell friday as the clash with musk overshadowed almost everything twitter is attempting to force musk to make good on his april promise to buy the company for 44 billion twitter last week sued musk to complete the deal and both sides are bracing for an october courtroom trial to resolve the dispute the april june fiscal quarter encompassed a tumultuous three months for twitter starting with the april 4 disclosure that musk had acquired a huge stake in the company paving the way for his takeover bid later that month it didn t take long for the relationship to fray as musk publicly tweeted his concerns about twitter and its employees and signaled he was having second thoughts twitter argued in court that musk s actions and his repeated disparagement of twitter and its personnel created uncertainty that harmed twitter s business operations employees and stock price it called for an expedited trial so the company could carry on with important business decisions while musk sought to wait until next year because of the complexity of the case and his demands for more of twitter s internal data about how it counts fake and automated spam bot accounts which he s cited as a chief reason for trying to terminate the deal a judge this week set the trial for october siding with twitter s concerns that too much delay could cause the company irreparable harm it will be held in delaware s court of chancery which handles many high profile business disputes unless musk and twitter settle the case before then
president joe biden and both parties in congress are reminding us that they do not take china s military threat seriously instead of making hard choices to bolster the u s military s means of deterring and defeating the people s liberation army congress is prioritizing corporate cronyism and wokeness the problem starts with biden the president insists that he is determined to meet china s challenge but his defense budget is utterly incompatible with that rhetoric woefully insufficient in funding it wouldn t even address inflationary concerns let alone the urgent need to improve readiness to fight china and biden is worsening the critical shortage of military assets available in the pacific ocean by redeploying them to europe also under pressure from the democratic left the biden administration has forced the military to embrace more and more stupidly woke initiatives at the expense of training within specializations operations and professional development when sailors airmen marines and soldiers are not told to learn about critical race theory they re forced to undergo mindless powerpoint presentations and video training sessions that have nothing to do with military service yet as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff mark milley proved when he told congress he wanted to understand white rage too many senior military officers are willing to dance to biden s woke waltz in order to get promoted so even as the military is firing useful personnel who refuse vaccines it is rewarding useless and sycophantic officers responsible for leadership failures of a toxic nature republicans recognize at least some of these problems writing last december reps andy biggs r az ralph norman r sc jody hice r ga michael cloud r tx and warren davidson r oh warned of a military that is more focused on bolstering its woke credentials than deterring china but as congress sets perimeters for the national defense authorization act it s clear that republicans are also part of the problem for example biggs and norman last week joined a house majority in voting down efforts to scrap the navy s littoral combat ships those ships are a waste of money utterly incapable of contesting chinese forces in the east and south china seas the navy rightly wants to scrap these ships and spend the money elsewhere democratic house armed services committee chairman adam smith rightly tried to get rid of all the littoral combat ships unfortunately congressional cronyism is forcing the navy to keep at least five of them other republicans such as rep john rutherford r fl want to save all nine of the ships when the house and the senate reconcile their budgets later this year this evinces a pathetic and unpatriotic cronyism a similar tale applies to the house s approval of a democratic amendment that spends an additional and pointless 660 million on f 18 fighter jets that the navy does not want and an additional 250 million on heavy lift helicopters that are incompatible with the marine corps s new china strategy why the waste because boeing which makes the f 18s and lockheed martin which makes the ch 53s lobbied congress for more money they find ready allies in republicans such as rep vicky hartzler r mo whose district benefits from such military pork even if the nation does not the hard truth is that china s challenge to america s security and prosperity demands a more serious approach the stakes are too high to let parochial concerns triumph over exigent national security needs it is well and good that republicans make tough statements about wokeness but they also need to start making tough choices on procurement the people s liberation army is certainly taking the situation seriously surging the construction and deployment of highly capable air defense destroyers submarines aircraft and long range missiles congress remains as clueless as ever the senate armed services committee this week recommended a 45 billion increase on biden s woefully inadequate defense budget request but only 2 6 billion of the additional funds would go to bolstering munition stocks it should be at least 10 times that much biden and congress need to wake up if not thousands of young people are going to die because they were ill equipped for a threat that everyone should have seen coming

whether you stay or go the cost of living in the potential path of a hurricane can be high and with the impact of covid and supply chain gaps this year evacuations are even tougher in southeast louisiana people are used to hurricane season protocols new orleans resident quentin thomas spent days stuck in the caesars superdome following the historic hurricane katrina in 2005 he says come hell or high water he knows exactly what he ll do ahead of the next hurricane he s getting out of town i m not staying quentin thomas said it s no choice i have little kids you know how power outages be in new orleans we have to go while hurricane season is under way there covid supply chain issues and high fuel costs are a big concern for many residents who already feel stretched new orleans city councilman oliver thomas says many people will face tough decisions this hurricane season which began june 1 can you even afford to evacuate oliver thomas said look at the price of airplane tickets hotels where they have gone up supplies you know that s been a major discussion that if something really major happens can people afford to leave i don t think we were prepared for that but we need to be category 1 or 2 storms usually require sheltering in place with hurricane kits handy those should at least include matches or a lighter food for several days and water but those and other suggested items to have while staying home and riding out a storm could cost more than they usually would according to the u s bureau of labor statistics grocery items are up 12 nationally from this time last year i would say definitely stock up right now because i think the supply chain disruption has caused the increase in prices right now with very little sympathy from manufacturers and distributors oliver thomas said i don t think they ll be that sympathetic when when and if a disaster hits the bureau also says gas is up almost a whopping 50 since last year aaa says the average price of gas in louisiana broke a record in june the highest price they ve recorded since they began tracking prices in 2000 gas is around 4 55 a gallon in the state without a car some will have to look into booking a rental but the supply chain shortage might leave those people without wheels that s because a lot of rental car companies sold off their inventory during the height of the pandemic with air travel as a last resort options also aren t great the closer to the departure date the more it could cost airline fares are up almost 40 according to the bureau since the spring of 2020 the cdc has recommended people include additional items to prevent covid in their hurricane kits like face coverings hand sanitizer and disinfectants they re an added cost but oliver thomas says it s worth the price knowing his family is safe newsy is the nation s only free 24 7 national news network you can find newsy using your tv s digital antenna or stream for free see all the ways you can watch newsy here
a welsh scientist who grew up in the shadow of the port talbot steelworks had an idea on the way home from the lab where he was working it was quite a good idea as it turns out as andrew hopkins used his idea to go on and develop one of britain s largest biotech companies which recently floated on new york s nasdaq stock exchange for 2 9bn the 50 year old grew up on a neath council estate and describes his upbringing as typically working class but he s swapped the cooling towers of the nearby steelworks at nearby baglan for the ivoried towers of oxford after setting up his company exscientia which is changing the biotech industry you can get more news like this and other story updates straight to your inbox by subscribing to our newsletters here read more early signs suggest wales current wave of covid infections may have peaked exscientia uses artificial intelligence ai to allow it to take much less time and money to discover new blockbuster drugs its founder retains 18 6 million shares giving him a 15 8 stake of the company on paper he s worth 400m since the flotation in october 2021 but in real life andrew or professor hopkins as he s known in the field is only just beginning he came up with the idea of using ai to develop drugs in the mid nineties when he was just a young scientist he can remember the exact moment the concept popped into his head as he was walking home from the oxford laboratory where he was working image andrew hopkins we used to work incredibly hard in our lab in oxford he explained we used to have meetings with our supervisor at midnight and we used to work until early in the morning i was walking home from the lab past mansfield college it was 2am probably in 1996 and i had this idea that we were working and designing these drugs and it was such a huge costly endeavour what would it take to create automated systems that would allow us or even a humble phd student to design a drug and move it forward quickly it s a concept that has revolutionised the field and one that has generated huge amounts of money exscientia which andrew eventually set up exactly 10 years ago this july in 2012 is breaking boundaries in the pharma world and that s what excites him not the theoretical amounts of money being bandied about in the headlines there s no doubt that life for andrew the eldest son of a factory worker has changed immeasurably he is undoubtedly intelligent he admits that he was a very keen academic student as a youngster but was also a self confessed terrible sportsman talking over zoom from his bright and airy boardroom at exscientia s base on the oxford science park andrew frequently breaks out in a smile he looks relaxed in an open necked white shirt and is immediately likeable he may now call the ivory towers of oxford home but this affable guy has never forgotten his working class roots and his upbringing on the caewern estate his mum and dad brian and barbara hopkins called south wales home until a recent move eastwards to be closer to andrew you can read more stories about neath here a former pupil at dwr y felin comprehensive school and neath college where he did his a levels before heading to university andrew wants to show there are no boundaries to what you can achieve no matter what your upbringing might be he explained the mind boggling concept of using artificial intelligence to develop medicines in simple terms so simple in fact and even bordering on philosophical it s like listening to poetry his younger brother christopher is actually a published poet living in canterbury he said image andrew hopkins andrew hopkins was a biophysics phd student when he had his idea he researched potential treatments for hiv at the time but the process was so laborious that he thought there must be a better way to design drugs the answer was to use automated computer algorithms to screen large datasets to detect hidden patterns and to perform other tasks within seconds that would take humans months to perform it could revolutionise drug development the covid pandemic has shown just how fast we can develop things like vaccines if the right amount of resources are poured into it and it s projected andrew to a position where he is now one of the most respected and lauded scientists in the uk and the man at the helm of a rare british unicorn company a company worth over 1bn it s certainly a long way from his first summer job at the age of 16 in the british steel labs at port talbot steelworks his father had worked in a factory all his life for metalbox in neath where he met barbara who was working in the same factory making pots it was quite a hard time during the eighties in south wales there were lots of strikes at the time there were huge numbers of job losses in the mines and steelworks recalled andrew so i had a really strong sense of being working class when i was growing up and proudly so there was an important sense of knowing your roots and where you d come from andrew was inspired by neath s history of producing some great names writers sportspeople singers he said although the industrial town was known as the powerhouse of rugby particularly in the late 1980s that sporting prowess somehow passed him by i was definitely more on the academic side he said one can be creative and develop and i see science as a very creative process actually andrew talks quickly and enthusiastically about his education flowing from one thing to the next and making it all seem so easy his inquisitive nature and enthusiasm for learning is quite infectious i loved school the whole idea of learning really caught me early on he continued i felt i had a talent for learning and i was really inspired by reading all the time i ve always been curious that s really important i find almost everything infinitely interesting i think if you look at anything in the world it can be interesting he was lucky at school he said on account of it being a joyful experience and having some really inspiring teachers sciences seemed to offer a more solid area to go on and develop a career he said he likened the world he was in creating new medicines as being like the liberal sciences you needed to understand chemistry biology physics computer science business economics finance and medicine he explained adding that it was that blend of subjects which really appeals to my sort of mind image andrew hopkins exscientia the young andrew seemed to have some kind of certainty in where he was headed i remember my dad saying go out and get an education and do what you enjoy doing in life i really remember that and it struck me that s what education gives you the freedom to pursue what you do enjoy in life naturally academic although with a musical streak that saw him organise raves in the late 80s he won a young scientist of the year award at school and ended up winning an internship in the british steel laboratories i didn t work in tesco or a bar he joked i was always working as a scientist after he d finished college british steel handed him a scholarship to go to manchester university where he gained a first class degree in chemistry in 1993 the first in his family to attend university perhaps because of his upbringing andrew had a strong social interest if we look back to the eighties the port talbot steelworks used to employ 35 000 at one point he explained it was a huge undertaking by the early nineties it was down to 3 000 people that s when we saw how technology can change an industry and that really stuck with me after graduate research at wadham college oxford he attained a doctorate in molecular biophysics in 1998 for his work on anti hiv drug design working alongside sir david stuart the world s leading structural biologist andrew was at the cutting edge of research around how to design new hiv drugs a key theme he learned there was the power of evolution something which is driving his algorithms at exscientia today more than two decades later going from working in the steel works and the cooling towers of the works to the ivory towers at oxford was quite a cultural shock at the time he said about his time as a young scientist but it was an incredible experience for me as a scientist he was always going to be a biotech entrepreneur andrew said even if it was quite rare for entrepreneurs to have quite the academic standing that andrew has it was during his time at pfizer after his doctorate that andrew set about learning all the different skills and parts of the business it was during that period too that he met and married his wife iva hopkins navratilova who is a leading scientist in her own right image andrew hopkins andrew never forgot his 2am lightbulb moment in 1996 that idea of an automated process bringing all the information to bear with algorithms in a real strong computational manner really stuck with me he said his original idea wasn t one andrew could implement that following day he didn t even have the data and lots of things had to change first but that burgeoning idea became like a north star guiding everything andrew learned about and did from then on everything i did in my future career always kept coming back to that original idea exscientia is the culmination of the many many years it took to build the foundational levels of what they have today in the interim after a decade with pfizer andrew joined the university of dundee in 2007 where a new drug discovery unit had been established his wife moved with him to set up her own lab and at the age of 35 he was one of the youngest professors in the university of dundee exscientia is a spinout company of the university starting with just five scientists in the early days it now employs 450 people explaining the way the company has grown since then andrew said i feel like we ve only just got started the ipo initial public offering in october 2021 was an incredible success when you look at it for a british company probably britain s biggest biotech exscientia is also the biggest ipo for gross proceeds for any european biotech ever after raising 500m in october and the fourth biggest biotech ipo on nasdaq ever andrew continued but actually it still feels like day one because we have so much to do we are trying to change an industry and i think that s the real once in a lifetime opportunity we were one of the very first companies in this space to think about how can artificial intelligence be applied to the creation of new medicines to see that we have created this whole new field and lots of other companies being formed in the area now seeing those first achievements we ve now got the first drugs that have been generated using artificial intelligence in human clinical trials exscientia has shown how the first ai systems can improve outcomes in oncology and cancer and cancer patients can live longer it s real true personalised medicine coming to life said andrew enthusiastically adding i think now we ve proven the possibility but now the next stage is how do we take this to a position where potentially all drugs can be designed this way exscientia is expanding as the idea gains traction globally as well as a growing presence in dundee there are offices in vienna miami boston and even osaka in japan the link to dundee remains strong however and andrew is an honorary chair of medicinal informatics at dundee university s school of life sciences and last month he was invited back to dundee to receive an honorary doctor of laws degree image andrew hopkins drugs are actually a sparse commodity said andrew he explained maybe only 40 new medicines are brought to market each year and they cost hundreds of millions of dollars to create using ai effectively creates a world where drugs can be much more in abundance there are thousands of diseases which need treating in the last century we ve only actually created new medicines that target about 1 of the human genome so there s a huge huge opportunity to go after at the current rate that we create medicines it would take us hundreds of years to find treatments for all the different diseases exscientia is about accelerating that process by using ai to help us learn faster by processing the amounts of information that are simply too vast for humans to hold in their heads there s 30 million papers published in scientific journals andrew continued there s millions of data points of chemical structures and biological activities in our databases it s impossible for humans to understand and comprehend all that information but it s entirely possible for algorithms to build models on that information which we can then bring to bear fundamentally exscientia is about how we can use ai to design the best drug and also use ai to select the right patients for those drugs read next seek out jobs where you live
economists have used mobile phone and live bookings data to watch the economic carnage of the pandemic unfold in real time but the figures also laid bare the hit caused by the heat to areas already struggling to adjust to a post covid world of homeworking footfall on britain s high streets slumped 7pc across the uk on monday compared to a week earlier according to springboard while opentable data suggests there were far fewer people eating out at the start of the week google mobility data shows that public transport usage was down 30pc on pre covid trends on monday compared to minus 23pc the previous monday footfall around retail and creation areas was down 13pc while activity in residential areas was up 10pc in london which is more reliant on the smooth running of trains and the tube public transport usage was 38pc lower than pre covid trends and activity in workplaces was 42pc down much worse than a week earlier however the bigger economic effect of hotter weather may be less tangible than shoppers on the high street and diners eating out labour productivity the efficiency of a worker usually measured as output per hour worked is also hurt by stifling heat particularly in countries not set up for it forecasters believe it can cost the economy billions of pounds helia costa an economist who worked on the issue for the grantham research institute on climate change says when heat increases workers ability to perform their jobs decreases their cognitive capacity decreases and physical capacity decreases so they feel less energy or loss of concentration muscle cramps exhaustion these losses in productivity have negative impacts on the economy costa s research suggests that a warm year in the latter part of this century would cost london s economy 1 9bn 1 6bn based on 2005 prices a hit equivalent to 0 4pc of output further south it will be even worse with bilbao in northern spain estimated to suffer a 9 5pc hit to output and antwerp in belgium facing a 2 1pc knock hotter temperatures could reduce growth rates significantly the richmond fed estimates that a one degree fahrenheit increase reduces output by 0 15 to 0 25 percentage points over the period of the temperature rise james pomeroy hsbc economist says the impact on productivity from limited working hours or businesses being unable to function could be sizeable in many countries he says the research suggests the biggest drags would come from real estate services and agriculture and the average annual growth rate in the us being pulled down by 0 2 to 0 4 percentage points over the next 100 years more than 2pc of total working hours globally will be lost every year because staff will not work in the heat or go at a slower pace according to the un s international labour organisation in parts of asia and africa 5pc of hours could be lost in western and northern europe the bulk of the lost hours are in the construction and agriculture industries largely owing to the composition of these advanced economies on the arabian peninsula work is already banned for several hours in the middle day in the summer because of the extreme temperatures but such bans for exposed workers could spread further the impact will be worse in cities which are hotter than rural areas an effect known as an urban heat island the productivity hit could also be bigger for britain s army of homeworkers compared to those who are still in the office given that few houses in britain have air conditioning many of britain s buildings are designed to trap heat in a cooler climate with one of the oldest housing stocks in europe britain is neither served well by its buildings in summer or winter and unsuitable properties are still being developed a report by the ccc the government s official climate adviser last year found that more than 570 000 homes have been built since 2016 that are not suitable for high temperatures requiring costly retrofit to make them safe habitable and water efficient in the future it warned a further 1 5m will be built in the next five years causing more costs further down the line there is an irony that some modern innovations for example buildings constructed with windows that do not open as a way of limiting heat loss may be making the situation worse thankfully most of us are not snowflakes not everyone agrees we should lose our shirts over rising temperatures however sir john hayes chairman of the common sense group of tory mps last week complained that while many people clamour for hot weather throughout the year the country shuts down whenever it arrives this is not a brave new world but a cowardly new world where we live in a country where we are frightened of the heat he told the telegraph it is not surprising that in snowflake

kuala lumpur july 24 bernama the ringgit is likely to continue its decline against the us dollar next week due to higher inflation said an analyst spi asset management managing partner stephen innes said the ringgit may also struggle to hold onto gains due to various negative risk events namely the concern about the increase in covid 19 cases in china given the ringgit s strong correlation with the chinese yuan the ringgit could trend weak as traders headgear for the possible regional stock market outflow that may trigger when united states house speaker nancy pelosi visits taiwan in august he told bernama he said the market also will be heading into another jumbo ahead of the federal open market committee fomc meeting next week and the united states federal reserve is expected to raise rates by another 75 basis points on july 27 this could keep the ringgit grounded until the fomc is out of the way my fear is that we could be moving into a short global recession that could hurt asia exporters so the sum of all this negativity has me erring defensively he said looking at the volatility innes said the ringgit is likely to trade within the rm4 4475 rm4 4575 range next week for the week just ended the ringgit was traded mostly lower against the us dollar as the sentiment was weighed down by the stronger greenback the ringgit fell against the greenback at 4 4515 4545 on friday compared with 4 4480 4505 a week earlier the local note traded lower against a basket of major currencies on a friday to friday basis it depreciated against the singapore dollar at 3 2011 2038 from 3 1688 1710 previously the ringgit eased against the japanese yen to 3 2389 2413 from 3 2048 20699 previously went down against the british pound to 5 3187 3222 from 5 2629 2658 and weakened versus the euro to 4 5201 5231 from 4 4662 4687 last week bernama
seiya tabuchi thesis i saw the question in the first summary bullet point a few days from a friend let me debunk the sensation out of it upfront so we can look at our world more calmly and rationally firstly the exact comparison between our current events and the historical events back in the 1930s is debatable neville chamberlain resignation inukai tsuyoshi assassination and stalin s war on organized religion secondly and more importantly there is a standard recipe to produce similar sensations the recipe is pretty simple you generate plenty of details of any two events or two time periods and then you are guaranteed to see plenty of similarities it s a mathematical certainty that enough digits will overlap between any two streams of random numbers when they are sufficiently long so now you know the secret of producing articles like 8 mysterious similarities between lincoln and kennedy assassination and 12 wicked similarities between wwi and wwii after debunking the sensation unfortunately our world is not totally different from the 1930s in many fundamental ways globalization is in retreat as the tension between the two superpowers intensifies polarization is both increasing at the country level like within the u s or the u k regional levels the europe and asia pacific region as we will see immediately in the next section and also global level for better or worse if you want peace you prepare for war since the russian ukraine war broke out all major countries china u s germany et al are prioritizing their military spending and the recent tragic assassination of former japanese prime minister shinzo abe in my view just added another instability factor to the world peace as the longest serving prime minister and a monumental political figure in japan his passing will have a range of implications within japan and beyond under this background this article will analyze two leading defense stocks general dynamics nyse gd and raytheon technologies nyse rtx to me the current developments around the world signal a new cycle for the defense sector retreat of globalization and increased polarization raytheon technologies ceo greg hayes commented recently that the russian ukraine war changed the geopolitical landscape and the dynamics of the defense sector completely what s happened in ukraine has been awful from a humanitarian standpoint from a geopolitical standpoint and it has changed the dynamic of the defense industry completely i gloomily agree then the recent assassination of shinzo abe brought japan s expanded rearmament plan to my mind according to this military balance plus report published shortly before the assassination on june 10 2022 japan s governing liberal democratic party ldp proposed a five year timeframe to achieve its declared ambition of doubling defense spending to 2 of gdp and the former prime minister commented that the increased defense budget would mean a new level of cooperation with allies and deterrence of potential adversaries shortly after the assassination on july 8 2022 reuters reported that japan will forgo setting a ceiling on defense spending in next fiscal year s annual budgetâ highlighting tokyo s interest in boosting defense at a time of tension with its powerful neighbour china this following report provides some contexts to interpret what a defense budget of 2 of gdp means as a rule of thumb a 1 gdp defense budget funds a national guard like defense force it can supplement police departments when needed and provide effective security for large international events like the recent tokyo olympics a 2 gdp defense budget would probably allow japan to project power regionally and deter neighborhood bullies like russia north korea and china furthermore a larger defense budget would put japan on more even terms with australia and other regional allies a 3 gdp budget allows a country to project power globally by comparison the united states has a 3 4 gdp defense budget as a major ally the u s has both a vested interest and extensive presence in japan the u s currently operates a total of 7 military facilities in japan the u s forces in japan are headquartered at the yokota air base in the tokyo area and as japan s rearmament progresses leading u s defense contractors such as gd and rtx will play a major role as elaborated below gd and rtx s role in the defense sector both gd and rtrx are leaders in the defense sector it has four segments aerospace 21 of 2021 companywide sales combat systems 19 marine systems 27 and technologies 32 the u s government accounts for 69 of total revenues and the rest comes from overseas rtx is a leader in the development of missile defense systems for 17 nations around the globe its recent merger with the legacy united technologies brands also expanded its role in the manufacturing and services of commercial and military aircraft engines both companies have been actively engaged with the national defense of many countries around the world as just mentioned a few examples particular to japan gd is the world s leading provider of wheeled combat vehicles and back in 2019 gd s land systems have been down selected as part of japan s next armored wheeled vehicle project although gd later withdraw from the bidding gd has also been supplying fighter jets a modified yf 16 to japan under the designation f 16j and rtx has been a long term provider of missile systems to japan for example back in 2007 the japan maritime self defense force successfully flight tested its first raytheon built standard missile 3 and recently in 2022 rtx just secured an 866 million contract to manufacture updated ship based ballistic missile interceptors for the u s government and the japanese defense ministry under the context of heightened geopolitical tensions since the russian ukraine war broke out both stocks have performed well against the backdrop of an overall market decline as you can see from the chart below both gd and rtx stock prices have delivered positive total returns ytd while the overall market suffered sizable declines to wit gd delivered a total return of almost 6 and rtx more than 11 the s p 500 in contrast suffered a loss of more than 15 looking forward i see the global tensions persist and the defense budget increases in many nations especially allies to the u s such as japan are expected to provide secular support for both businesses in the years to come seeking alpha gd and rtx profitability comparison as you can see from the following chart both gd and rtx enjoy strong profitability comparing profitability is ultimately subjective but my overall impression is that gd is a more profitable one here to expand the comparison a bit wider this chart also included another defense leader lockheed martin lmt and my view is that gd enjoys about the same level of profitability as lmt too to cite a few key metrics gd enjoys a gross margin of 16 7 a bit lower than rtx s 19 9 but gd makes it up in bottom line metrics such as net profit margin 8 5 vs 6 4 and also fcf margin 11 3 vs 8 3 gd s operation metrics like return on asset and asset turnover rates are also substantially better than rtx seeking alpha in addition to this snapshot of various metrics the second chart shows a more fundamental profitability measure over a longer period of time and as explained in our earlier writings to me the roic return on invested capital provides a more meaningful measure of profitability the roic comparison provides a more complete picture here from a broader perspective gd s roic has been relatively consistent except in 2013 overall its roic has fluctuated between a narrow range of 10 to 20 again excluding the outlier data point in 2013 and its average roic in the past decade has been 13 8 in comparison rtx s roic has exhibited a bit more volatility and is also lower on average in recent years it hovered below 6 not only below gd but also below its own historical average of 8 15 seeking alpha gd and rtx valuation comparison despite gd s superior profitability it s trading at a slight discount relative to rtx as you can see from the chart below its fy1 pe of 17 88x is more than 10 below rtx although higher than lmt topline metrics such as price to sales or ev sales ratio also indicate a sizable discount relative to rtx take the price to sales ratio as an example gd is valued at a p s ratio of 1 57 almost a 30 discount relative to rtx which is difficult to justify in my mind as we have just established earlier gd enjoys a better net profit margin than rtx and hence each dollar of its sales should be worth more not less seeking alpha expected returns due to the superior profitability and discounted valuation my projected return for gd is slightly higher than rtx as shown in the tables below gd is about fairly valued a small 3 premium relative to its historical record in terms of dividend yields in terms of price to cash flow its present multiple of 14 3x is at an 8 discount from its historical average of 15 5x rtx similarly is at a 4 premium relative to its historical record in terms of dividend yields and a smaller 6 discount in terms of price to cash flow multiple looking forward i also see a higher growth rate from gd and my estimate is about 8 5 compared to rtx s 7 5 the main reason is its higher roic as aforementioned a higher roic leads to higher growth rates assuming the same reinvestment rates all told for the next 3 5 years the total return is projected to be in a range of 34 the low end projection to about 50 the high end projection for gd such return potential translates into an annual return of 7 6 to 10 8 the return potential for rtx is slightly lower total returns are projected to be in the range of 29 to 42 translating into annual returns in the range of 6 5 to 9 1 author author final thoughts and risks since the russian ukraine war broke out all major countries have announced plans to prioritize their defense budgets and the recent assassination of shinzo abe has tragically catalyzed japan s expansion of its defense budgeting too in my opinion as a major u s ally japan s rearmament plan will inevitably involve gd and rtx for their airplanes marine systems and missile systems these defense leaders have demonstrated their anti cyclical price actions recently and they are currently close to fair valuation in comparison gd is more attractively valued and also offers better profitability the main risks in the near term involve global supply chain congestion and labor shortages the following comments from rtx ceo greg hayes suggest that these issues can persist well into 2024 even though the comments came from rtx they apply equally well to gd

ogunquit when people think of fine art most imagine an artist fussing for weeks or months over every brushstroke every subtle color variation if you go what jim morin drawing and painting where ogunquit museum of american art 543 shore road ogunquit 207 646 4909 ogunquitmuseum org when 10 a m to 5 p m daily through oct 31 how much 12 10 students and seniors free for members and children jim morin rarely had that luxury of time over more than four decades as an editorial cartoonist much of it at the miami herald where he twice won the pulitzer prize morin estimates he produced north of 10 000 ink and pen drawings almost all of them on a daily deadline but just because he had a compressed timeline his work is no less significant according to amanda lahikainen executive director of the ogunquit museum of american art it s the first truly democratic art form said lahikainen who wrote a book about the impact of 17th and 18th century satirical artwork the precursor to editorial cartoons of today and i think it s been an under looked form for a really long time a chance meeting between her and morin at a fourth of july party last year led to an exhibition of his work this summer at the ogunquit museum that includes both a selection of his cartoons and oil paintings he has done outside of work advertisement one of my goals as director is to show different mediums and jim s work is such a great representation she said morin who retired in 2020 during the pandemic has been coming to maine since he was a child growing up in massachusetts he now lives in ogunquit within walking distance of the oceanside art museum his work has been featured in museums many times over the years but this is a first in his adopted state the exhibition is on display through oct 31 i ve never really had a career retrospective morin said last month during an interview at the museum it s certainly an honor to have an exhibit like this to curate morin s work lahikainen brought in martha kennedy who was a longtime curator of pop and graphic arts at the library of congress and who already was familiar with morin s work she met him when he won the prestigious herblock prize in 2007 and accepted the award at the library of congress i think he s among the best of the best she said of morin there are a lot of different aspects of his work that stand out he s very imaginative and inventive and has been able to create varied imaginative types of composition over a long period of time advertisement a cartoonist s career path morin grew up mostly in the small boston suburb of wayland his father was a staunch conservative and involved in massachusetts republican politics he hated ted kennedy morin said referring to the longtime democratic senator who influenced state and national politics for a half century morin said didn t inherit his father s beliefs he developed a love and aptitude for drawing as a child which continued through school he studied painting and drawing at syracuse university in the early 1970s when the watergate scandal engulfed the nation it was a fine time to give editorial cartooning a go and morin soon found himself at the college newspaper five days a week advertisement he also spent one semester abroad in london where he learned more about the history of graphic art satire including the work of honoré victorin daumier a french painter and printmaker who offered sharp commentary on social and political life but also was revered as an artist morin s first job out of college was at a small daily newspaper in beaumont texas back when newspapers big and small had editorial cartoonists on staff that no longer is the case morin said the town was in the middle of nowhere and he didn t have any supplies so he and his boss at the time went to a hardware store that somewhat inexplicably had boxes and boxes of esterbrook pen tips they were the best you could buy peanuts comic creator charles schultz used them morin said he bought a few but then returned and bought the rest the store had in stock he still uses esterbrook tips morin stayed only a short time in texas before moving on to a bigger paper the richmond times dispatch in virginia but didn t stay long a chance to move to an even bigger market miami came along in 1978 morin was just 25 when he joined the miami herald in the same city at the competing miami news another cartoonist don wright had won a pulitzer journalism s top prize and would go on to win another advertisement morin said he felt the pressure right away there were many other cartoonists doing great work too tony auth of the philadelphia inquirer patrick oliphant of the washington star and the legendary herb block of the washington post who was in syndication even the bad cartoonists were doing some good work morin said but my goal wasn t to copy other people or to get comfortable with only one style it really took about two decades for things to really gel for me morin lived through and provided pointed commentary during eight different presidential administrations by the 1980s his cartoon was syndicated which meant it reached wider audiences than just south florida his first pulitzer came in 1996 although he had been a finalist twice prior he followed that up two decades later in 2017 with his second almost always morin said he would decide what he wanted to say what message he wanted his cartoon to convey and built his drawings around that advertisement when you re developing it if you get frustrated you don t have time to tear it up and start over he said but you develop confidence and there is a looseness that comes with the form exhibit with a message although he covered just about every major topic during his career one thread that kept coming up over and over in morin s cartoons from the 1980s through the 2010s was climate change and environmentalism sadly the warnings in morin s cartoons from the 80s could be published today when it came time for kennedy to pare down his career she didn t just want a random collection she wanted the exhibit to say something it was all right there it was hard because there was so much great work she said but what a wonderful situation to be in kennedy agreed with lahikainen that editorial cartoons and satire overall has been overlooked in the art world advertisement it s not as widely appreciated as it should be she said but i think it has a grand history there is quite a tradition of satirical art morin said he was impressed with how kennedy selected the cartoons that would hang in the ogunquit museum she came to my house i had boxes and boxes and i said it s all yours he said with a chuckle i was ok with whatever they wanted to do the environmentalism theme also paired well with his paintings which are part of the exhibit too mostly landscapes and seascapes as well as some cityscapes two things stand out there are no people depicted in them even though the presence of people is clearly there and the skies are often gray even angry the same process goes into painting that goes in editorial cartoons he said the same laws of composition apply morin admits that he s passionate about the topic about the climate change perhaps even more so now advertisement i live in a house that overlooks the ocean and what i see is just mind blowing he said morin had been coming to maine since he was a kid with parents who had a place in kennebunkport he and his wife danielle fell in love with the place even more as adults when they were discussing retirement many years ago and brainstormed places they wanted to settle they both said maine as morin contemplated his storied career while looking at his work on the museum walls he acknowledged that even if editorial cartooning has been an overlooked art form for decades it s also a dying one when he left the miami herald in 2020 the paper didn t replace him there are reasons why not many do it he said you have to have a lot of interests a lot of places to pull from and then you have to know how to draw well and quickly send questions comments to the editors

saw a snake head come up and strike me in my left calf my natural reaction was to jump back and i bent over and pulled up my pant leg to see if he actually penetrated my long pants vuncannon saw two bite marks about 2 inches apart boone went after the snake and only then did vuncannon hear rattling he tied on a tourniquet below the knee and above the bite as soon as i stood up i could actually taste the poison in the back of my throat his vision got blurry and he sweated a lot i pulled my phone my out and called 911 and of course it said no cell service that s when my heart sank with no

shutterstock rattlesnakes reclusive nature is one reason why there aren t more incidents the rattlesnake actually views us as a predator we re a large animal that could eat him and they re afraid of us said ted clamp who founded the edisto island serpentarium in coastal south carolina in 1999 with his late brother rattlesnakes tend to stay hidden when we encounter a snake on the move he s usually looking for food or looking for a mate or looking for shelter otherwise he stays hidden because they re so vulnerable to all sorts of predators kimberly andrews who has a doctorate in ecology from university of georgia s marine extension and georgia sea grant and manages its coastal ecology lab said rattlesnakes are sit and wait predators i ve seen rattlesnakes sit in one place for over a week waiting on a meal so when there s an encounter people have generally encroached on their territory where rattlesnakes hide as with other types of rattlesnakes the western diamondback is a master of

light under there make sure the coast is clear she said other tips wear closed toe shoes and long pants when venturing into rattlesnake friendly terrain go around a rattlesnake on a wilderness trail if possible if you find a rattlesnake in your yard call agencies such as your state s natural resources departments or us fish wildlife or contact a biologist at a local college andrews said do not try to kill the rattlesnake because that s when most people get bit she said if you must deal with a rattlesnake on your own andrews says you can use a long branch or pole to gently nudge the snake toward an escape route if you re at least six feet or more away andrews said rattlesnakes are most active in spring and fall but vigilance is important all year they might venture out in winter on a warm day what do you do if you hear that bone chilling rattle usually if he s rattling he s alarmed clamp said if you can tell where he is and see him back away from him don t approach him just know rattling does not come before every bite as in vuncannon s case in dire straits vuncannon knew he had to get out i slowly methodically started walking up the mountain a pretty steep climb he had only gone about a quarter of a mile when he lost his balance he started crawling vuncannon was throwing up about every 15 minutes then he started to go in and out of consciousness my dog stayed with me the whole time he never left my side he would paw at me and lick me in the face to keep me awake about two hours after being bit he fired a shot from his pistol into the air to get attention nothing back in highlands his wife had a gnawing feeling something was amiss she found his truck at the trailhead around 4 30 and returned to town for help around 5 30 a rescue attempt was finally underway just so happens around 5 30 i had pretty much given in that i wasn t going to make it out alive so i went ahead and made a goodbye video to my family with my phone i recorded about a three minute video i

swelling in the mouth and throat and if you can t make that sos call keep your heartbeat as low as possible it takes a while for the venom to work don t run get yourself somewhere you can get a signal as soon as possible clamp said there s nothing to really help you from the venom except the serum the snakebite victim should stay as calm as possible and deep breathe andrews said if someone can stay with the victim that person should talk to them and keep them from falling asleep take notes or voice record on a smartphone what happened she said if possible use a marker or pen and circle where you were bitten in case of swelling they ll need to know the bite point at the hospital remove jewelry such as rings and tight clothing before you start to swell the mayo clinic says what not to do andrews said don t employ the out of date boy scout advice of cut and suck cutting an x at the bite area and sucking the venom out by mouth or suction cups it s very ineffective she said adding people are likely to do more damage from the knife cut than from the snake bite don t try to kill the snake to bring to the hospital andrews said and don t take a picture of it unless you can do so easily don t comprise your safety by forcing another interaction with an already defensive rattlesnake clamp andrews and other experts say do not apply a tourniquet to a pit viper bite which is something vuncannon did that venom is concentrated and it works like an acid it breaks down blood vessels and multiple skin tissues clamp said and if you confine that venom in that area you re apt to lose a

fortunately that was not a bear vuncannon saw but a rescuer s black lab however it was getting dark and vuncannon was getting worse a helicopter couldn t be used because of the thick canopy vuncannon was too far gone to be slowly carried out so he was moved by motorcycle strapped to a driver and held up by paramedics walking on either side that took three hours more than 11 hours after he first got bit he made it to mission hospital in asheville but he had already gone into cardiac arrest doctors had bad news for his family vuncannon had less than a 5 chance to survive his rescue was one miracle and he needed a second one he got around a dozen antivenom treatments and other medical interventions vuncannon was in a coma for three days but pulled through it took me a total of about three months to fully recover enough to where i could actually walk and have the energy to get around he later learned it was a timber rattlesnake that bit him and that it directly hit a vein which made the venom spread more rapidly but later spared him from tissue damage what vuncannon learned he s back on the trails but he carries a satellite phone especially on deeper trails he s also more likely to find someone to hike with him if he goes alone it s on wider well maintained trails and i also carry hiking poles with me to brush the side of the trail just in case let someone know exactly where you re going when you ll be back he now has three grandchildren i look forward to teaching them about the wilderness and the outdoors and how to avoid snake bites and dangerous encounters video

ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy denounced a missile strike on the port of odessa as russian barbarism just a day after the warring sides struck a deal to resume cereal exports blocked by the conflict the ukrainian military said its air defences had shot down two cruise missiles but two more hit the port yesterday threatening the landmark agreement hammered out over months of negotiations aimed at relieving a global food crisis zelenskyy said the strikes on odessa showed moscow could not be trusted to keep its promises today s russian missile attack on odessa on our port is a cynical one and it was also a blow to the political positions of russia itself zelenskyy said in his nightly address adding that dialogue with moscow was becoming increasingly untenable this apparent russian barbarism brings us even closer to obtaining the very weapons we need for our victory zelenskyy added the strike came a day after moscow and kyiv agreed a deal brokered by turkish president recep tayyip erdogan and united nations chief antonio guterres odessa is one of three export hubs designated in the agreement and ukrainian officials said grain was being stored in the port at the time of the strike although the food stocks did not appear to have been hit guterres who presided over the signing ceremony on friday unequivocally condemned the attack his deputy spokesman said and urged all sides to stick to the deal these products are desperately needed to address the global food crisis and ease the suffering of millions of people in need around the globe he said the eu s foreign policy chief josep borrell directly blamed russia for the strikes advertisement striking a target crucial for grain export a day after the signature of the istanbul agreements is particularly reprehensible and again demonstrates russia s total disregard for international law and commitments he said uk foreign secretary liz truss said the attack was absolutely appalling and completely unwarranted the united states also strongly condemned the attack with secretary of state antony blinken saying it casts serious doubt on the credibility of russia s commitment to yesterday s deal there was no official comment from moscow but turkish defence minister hulusi akar said russia had denied carrying out the attack the russians told us that they had absolutely nothing to do with this attack and they were looking into the issue very closely akar said in comments to state news agency anadolu we will continue to fulfil our responsibilities under the agreement we reached yesterday he added regional governor maksym marchenko said the strikes left people wounded and damaged port infrastructure in odessa without specifying the number or severity of the injuries 20 million tonnes of wheat the first major accord between the countries since russia s february invasion of ukraine aims to ease the acute hunger the un says an additional 47 million people are facing because of the war ukraine at the signing warned it would conduct an immediate military response should russia violate the accord and attack its ships or stage an incursion around its ports zelenskyy said responsibility for enforcing the deal fell to the un which along with turkey is a co guarantor of the agreement the deal includes points on running ukrainian grain ships along safe corridors that avoid known mines in the black sea read next related reads ukraine says putin spits in the face of un and turkey after missiles strike odessa port five months on anger and despair prevail in ukraine s donbas region huge quantities of wheat and other grain have been blocked in ukrainian ports by russian warships and the mines kyiv laid to avert a feared amphibious assault zelenskyy said that around 20 million tonnes of produce from last year s harvest and the current crop would be exported under the agreement estimating the value of ukraine s grain stocks at around 10 billion 9 8 billion russian defence minister sergei shoigu told kremlin state media he expected the deal to start working in the next few days although diplomats expect grain to only start fully flowing by mid august strikes on central ukraine russia is trying to fight deeper into the eastern donetsk region after securing full control of neighbouring luhansk the us state department yesterday said two americans had died in the area without saying whether the pair were in the country for combat purposes russian missile strikes on railway infrastructure and a military airfield in the central area of kirovograd on saturday also killed at least three people and wounded 16 more regional governor andriy raikovych said at least one of the dead was a serviceman he said earlier a rare admission of a military casualty as combat deaths have

rate which the central bank raises or lowers depending on what is happening in the economy higher rates are a ticket to an economic slowdown because they make a host of lending including mortgages and business loans more expensive advertisement after inflation data showed prices soared 9 1 percent in june compared with the year before economists and the markets are watching for any signals that the fed might decide to hoist rates even more sharply than it previously hinted so far the fed appears likely to stick to its original plan here are some of the biggest economic forces guiding how fed policymakers are thinking about what to do about the economy inflation inflation hit a pandemic era peak last month driven by soaring energy costs prices rose in practically every nook and cranny of the economy especially food and housing fed officials had been hoping that as interest rates rise and supply chains heal inflation would decline steadily but there is no sign yet of an easing of prices the inflation reading for last month it was high but critically it was also very broad based said ellen gaske an economist at pgim fixed income and a former senior economist at the new york fed the fed hasn t yet seen what it needs to to slow down advertisement right after the june consumer price index report financial markets tanked as investors bet that the fed would decide it needed to ramp up its response and raise interest rates more sharply which would weigh on wall street there is precedent for a quick pivot days before its policy meeting in june the fed suddenly changed course and indicated that a larger interest rate hike than initially planned was on the table the fed shifted to more aggressive action in part because of unexpectedly hot may inflation data and signs that consumer sentiment was especially gloomy similarly the european central bank last week increased its benchmark interest rate more than expected amid high inflation but uncertainty about how far the fed would go this month has been quelled by top officials including fed governor christopher waller who said recently that although the inflation data is a major league disappointment there are hazards to overreacting advertisement a 75 basis point hike is huge waller said at the rocky mountain economic summit on july 14 don t think because you are not going 100 you are not doing your job indeed another force playing into the fed s interest rate decision is the slowing housing market the fed s previous rate increases and expectation of more have caused a brisk run up in mortgage rates pushing more buyers out of the market existing home sales fell in june for a fifth straight month according to the national association of realtors and although the median sale price of a house rose to 428 006 in june compared with last year there are indications that prices are starting to ease in some markets jobs the biggest boldest sign that the economy is doing well is the jobs market the country continues to gain jobs at a brisk pace but some economists say that pace is unsustainably hot with far more job openings than people looking for work for the overall economy to slow meaningfully hiring needs to wind down too advertisement and the unemployment rate has held steady at 3 6 percent near 50 year lows for four months fed chair jerome h powell often points out that two job openings are advertised for every job seeker a sign of a mismatch in the economy as long as the labor market continues in overdrive policymakers can lean toward big moves on interest rate increases the fed s goal is to cool the economy in a way that reduces demand for new hires but does not cause employers to pull back so much that unemployment surges the glaring problem is that the fed cannot pull that off with any precision the fed s economic forecasts show the unemployment rate rising a bit as interest rates go up meaning that some workers will lose jobs under the current plan to raise interest rates we don t seek to put people out of work of course powell said at a news conference in june we never think too many people are working and fewer people need to have jobs but we also think that you really cannot have the kind of labor market we want without price stability advertisement in some sectors job cuts already are occurring some companies that hired rapidly during the pandemic have realized that their business models are not a fit for the post pandemic economy or they simply have not been able to handle the cost of inflation peloton has laid off thousands of workers the delivery start up gopuff is laying off 10 percent of its workforce insider reported microsoft also is making cuts goldman sachs s chief financial officer last week said we have made the decision to slow hiring velocity multiple mortgage lenders across the country including wells fargo and better com have laid off thousands of people as demand for home loans and refinancing drops off there s a difference between companies slowing the pace of hiring versus outright layoffs and i don t think we re seeing that broadly across industries gaske said there are pockets but a slowdown in hiring would be expected at this point in the cycle still it can be tricky to tell whether or when layoff momentum starts to build first time unemployment claims have been creeping up and are at their highest level since november still they are nowhere near levels that would suggest a recession is imminent president biden on july 8 said his economic plan is moving this country in a better direction video the washington post photo bill o leary the washington post it always starts this way except for covid said roberto perli a former fed economist and the head of global policy research at piper sandler normally a recession starts slowly the weakest companies the most exposed companies slow hiring and then they start firing advertisement the labor market is always the last shoe to drop perli added share this article share gdp economic growth also influences how the fed decides its course of action around the globe major developed nations have been reporting slower or even no economic growth because of inflation pandemic problems and the war in ukraine the united states is expected to follow that pattern the bureau of economic analysis reports gross domestic product for april through june on thursday after the federal reserve makes its interest rate decision but many economists already expect that the economy shrank again the gdp report will fuel a whole new set of questions over whether the economy is in a recession or approaching one by one definition a recession is marked by two consecutive quarters of negative growth the economy already shrank in the first three months of the year driven mainly by a drop off in inventory purchases and the united states not exporting as many goods but a host of other signs suggest the united states isn t in a recession the job market is still churning crucially consumers are still spending especially on services businesses aren t showing signs of widespread layoffs plus the official recession call will be made by a panel of experts at the national bureau of economic research nber and it could be a ways away advertisement all of those pieces matter for the fed which is under tremendous pressure to avoid causing a recession by hiking rates too aggressively the fed s argument is that the economy is fundamentally strong enough to withstand higher rates even the nber wouldn t define this as a recession perli said you need more than two quarters of negative gdp growth you need the labor market and so on so no i don t think will be stopped by potential negative print markets after soaring for much of the pandemic the stock market has taken a dive this year as investors grow jittery that inflation is only becoming worse and that the fed isn t equipped to rein it in the markets clinched their worst six month start to a year since 1970 and have not let up market swings generally do not affect many americans except in their retirement accounts but the fed does not simply ignore financial markets because they can reflect broader issues or unexpected turbulence brewing in the economy advertisement fed officials have said that they want to see progress in the actual economy and that the fed will not change course on the basis of the ups and downs of the stock market the federal reserve does though play a role in shaping financial conditions for example when the financial markets plummeted at the beginning of the pandemic the fed helped steady the financial sector by injecting trillions of dollars into the economy through a bond buying campaign that prevented markets from seizing up more recently though the financial system has not needed that kind of support not only has the fed stopped its asset purchase program but it also has begun shrinking its balance sheet to further tighten conditions on wall street higher fed interest rates and tighter financial conditions also raise borrowing costs for households and businesses and are key to slowing growth and consumer demand plus the fed does prioritize clear communication to the markets on what it plans to do next signals that the fed still leans toward a three quarter point increase are intended to avoid surprising the markets i think they re not really thrilled with the amount of volatility but they re happy that conditions are tighter on average said tim duy a fed expert at the university of oregon and the chief economist at sgh macro advisors that was the one of the goals here manufacturing and productivity another force that the federal reserve monitors is manufacturing manufacturing activity is one a linchpin of the economy because it creates jobs and is linked to all sorts of other economic activity reflecting overall demand in the overall economy for example a factory that builds a heating and cooling unit also creates business by subcontracting with companies that make parts for each machine and those businesses work with other companies and so on one benchmark to which policymakers pay attention is a survey of manufacturing activity from the institute for supply management the june survey showed the volume of new orders contracted for the first time in two years suggesting a slowdown survey data released thursday from the philadelphia fed also showed that manufacturing activity in the region declined overall in july these downward trends could be a way to gauge whether consumers and businesses are starting to pull back reflecting higher interest rates are working to dampen economic activity that is not necessarily a bad sign even as manufacturing may be slowing it is possible that the economy could get a boost from investments that businesses made earlier in the pandemic on tech equipment and software especially as more people were working remotely companies also have been able to beef up their inventories in the past few months what s critical for a positive outlook is that companies continue to invest said gaske of pgim fixed income it s going to be the workaround for a tight labor market it s going to be a key factor to dampen inflation pressures over time
while electric vehicle stocks are down this year there are some you should consider picking up after a rough start to the year electric vehicle ev stocks have rebounded nicely since the calendar flipped to july with ev makers tesla tsla 5 59 and rivian rivn 8 00 down around 21 and 68 respectively year to date but up 22 and 27 this month investors may be wondering if it s time to purchase some ev stocks if you re a long term believer in the ev transition i believe now is a perfect time to hop into some ev focused stocks here s why ev supply chains are being established many consumers and companies have questioned whether the world can switch to an ev based vehicle infrastructure due to battery component scarcity however on july 21 ford f 3 01 eased some of these fears by announcing it has secured the raw materials necessary to produce 600 000 evs annually by late 2023 additionally it has sourced 70 of the battery capacity necessary to support at least a 2 million ev production rate by 2026 while this announcement is specific to ford it shows how the material supply chains are being established to support this growing industry still the same problem that hampered traditional vehicles also affected evs in the second quarter the microchip shortage is still raging affecting all automakers the lead time for the average microchip averaged 27 weeks in june nearly double what it was in the five years before 2021 the demand for these chips isn t going away and companies like texas instruments are building new factories to ease the supply crunch the chip shortage affects evs more than gas powered cars as evs typically utilize about double the number of chips traditional vehicles do this shortage is still a long term problem but when it is solved expect ev makers to be able to run at full capacity which will likely boost revenue and profits significantly how are ev makers doing tesla recently reported its q2 results and despite covid lockdowns and supply chain issues it still posted great numbers total production rose 25 yoy year over year while its revenue exploded higher at a 42 clip due to higher vehicle prices additionally its operating margin rose from 11 last year to 14 6 this year although this does mark a decline from the 19 2 figure it posted in the first quarter the company also reiterated its projection of growing annual vehicle production rates by 50 over a multi year horizon newcomer rivian is just beginning its production ramp but it also gave investors good results management reiterated its 25 000 vehicle production goal for 2022 and produced 4 401 vehicles in q2 up from the 2 553 produced in q1 additionally rivian began delivering amazon s electric delivery van edv recently showcasing its ability to meet the demand of the 100 000 units amazon wants to be delivered by 2030 as for traditional vehicle makers like ford the switch to evs is just beginning in june ford produced and sold 4 353 evs up 76 6 yoy ford has a long way to go to meet its 600 000 ev goal by late 2023 but with its vast resources it should have the means to get there are ev stocks a buy despite having a strong july ev stocks are still well off their high however many deserved to be sold off from lofty valuation levels tesla still trades at 66 times forward earnings much higher than ford s 6 7 while i don t believe comparing these two companies directly is wise due to different margin profiles and growth stages it is worth noting that tesla may see a lot of price volatility due to its valuation still i think tesla is the top ev stock to own due to its future growth and market leadership however to invest wisely in tesla s stock investors need to commit to holding it for three to five years anything less won t allow business results to drive the stock price as for upstart rivian it is still too young for my liking there are a lot of unknowns with production ramp up and the company is burning cash so while i m rooting for it to succeed my investment dollars won t be associated with the company i m not a huge fan of traditional automakers but i think there can be some value in them if they can smoothly transition to evs without forsaking their current internal combustion engine ice business however with ford laying off 8 000 workers from its ice business i m not sure this is the right balance ev stocks are ok to buy now if you understand the risk associated with each company additionally the ev rollout will not be completed for some time so investors must be willing to ride the waves of the market however i think this space is ripe with investing opportunities with the correct picks and holding period

this natural gas stock has a dividend yield of 6 7 when folks think of high yield dividend stocks they might picture risky companies that pay large dividends but operate shaky underlying businesses however some stable companies also have generous payouts for investors a prime example is kinder morgan kmi 0 88 which has a dividend yield of 6 7 and is one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in the u s many investors are seeking security and reliable income in their portfolios given the market volatility that marked the beginning of 2022 here s why kinder morgan is the ideal high yield dividend stock for the second half of 2022 and beyond how kinder morgan s stock reacts under different conditions the 2014 and 2015 oil and gas crash took a sledgehammer to kinder morgan s bottom line and forced the company to cut its dividend by 75 to protect its balance sheet in the years that followed kinder morgan underwent a restructuring and a strategic shift away from high growth toward reliable projects that generate predictable cash flow that can support dividends buybacks and strategic acquisitions that strategy positioned kinder morgan particularly well for the oil and gas downturn of 2020 during which the company suffered minor hits to its cash flow and bottom line however kinder morgan s stodgy position also means it isn t going to rake in outsized returns during times of high oil and gas prices either in sum kinder morgan will likely underperform the broader energy sector during expansion times but outperform it during downturns controlled growth one of kinder morgan s main sources of income is its natural gas pipelines the newer projects connect the natural gas fields of west texas and east new mexico known as the permian basin to the refineries and export terminals along the texas portion of the u s gulf coast in late june kinder morgan and its partners announced the expansion of a key pipeline which will increase takeaway capacity from the permian which effectively gives the green light for producers to ramp up production liquefied natural gas lng offers one of the greatest growth drivers for u s natural gas production instead of relying on domestic demand to grow producers can now cool and condense natural gas and then ship it to energy dependent buyers overseas south korea japan and china have been huge importers of lng for years but now europe is quickly approving lng import terminals as a means to wean itself off of russian supply by connecting production to the refineries and lng liquefaction terminals kinder morgan plays an integral role in the growth of u s lng exports once its pipelines are built it contracts them under long term take or pay or fixed fee contracts that ensure it has customers no matter the market cycle a dividend that is built to last despite the potential for additional u s lng exports and the need for more storage and pipelines kinder morgan is unlikely to resume fast growth anytime soon and for investors who are optimistic about sustained higher oil and gas prices it might be better to go with an integrated major like chevron or a well run exploration and production company like conocophillips but for folks looking for a reliable source of passive income kinder morgan stands out as one of the best companies around its cash cow predictable business ensures it can support its dividend and growth plans with cash not debt furthermore its balance sheet is in its best shape since the 2014 and 2015 oil and gas downturn add it all up and kinder morgan stock provides a low risk way to earn a 6 7 yield

russia says missiles sank ukrainian warship in odessa port strikes a milestone agreement aimed at relieving a global food crisis was signed on friday by kyiv and moscow kyiv ukraine russia said sunday that its missile barrage on a ukrainian port key to a freshly inked grain export deal had targeted military infrastructure at the facility after the attack sparked an outcry from ukraine and its allies ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky denounced saturday s strike on the odessa port that came just one day after the warring sides struck a deal to resume exports blocked by the conflict as russian barbarism turkey helped broker the accord and said after the double cruise missile attacks that it had received assurances from moscow that russian forces were not responsible but russia s foreign ministry spokeswoman appeared to roll back on that denial sunday saying the strikes had destroyed a ukrainian warship kalibr missiles destroyed military infrastructure in the port of odessa with a high precision strike maria zakharova said in a statement on social media claiming a patrol boat had been sunk the port attack has thrown into doubt the milestone agreement aimed at relieving a global food crisis that was hammered out over months of negotiations and signed in istanbul zelensky said the strikes on odessa showed moscow could not be trusted to keep its promises and that dialogue with moscow was becoming increasingly untenable this apparent russian barbarism brings us even closer to obtaining the very weapons we need for our victory zelensky said in a late night address to the nation under the deal brokered by turkish president recep tayyip erdogan and united nations chief antonio guterres odessa is one of three designated export hubs mykolaiv attacks ukrainian officials said grain was being stored in the port at the time of the strike although the food stocks did not appear to have been hit guterres who presided over the signing ceremony friday unequivocally condemned the attack eu foreign policy chief josep borrell said the reprehensible strikes showed russia s disregard for its commitments the united states strongly condemned the attack with secretary of state antony blinken saying it casts serious doubt on the credibility of russia s commitment to yesterday s deal until zakharova s claims sunday there was no response from moscow but turkish defence minister hulusi akar said russia had denied carrying out the attack the russians told us that they had absolutely nothing to do with this attack he told state news agency anadolu the odessa region s governor maksym marchenko said the strikes left people wounded and damaged port infrastructure in odessa without specifying the number or severity of the injuries the first major accord between the countries since russia s february invasion of ukraine aims to ease the acute hunger the un says an additional 47 million people are facing because of the war ukraine at the signing warned it would conduct an immediate military response should russia violate the accord and attack its ships or stage an incursion around its ports zelensky said responsibility for enforcing the deal fell to the un which along with turkey is a co guarantor of the agreement turkey said it was committed to the accord after the attack the deal includes points on running ukrainian grain ships along safe corridors that avoid known mines in the black sea huge quantities of wheat and other grain have been blocked in ukrainian ports by russian warships and the mines kyiv laid to avert a feared amphibious assault zelensky has said around 20 million tonnes of produce from last year s harvest and the current crop would be exported under the agreement estimating the value of ukraine s grain stocks at around 10 billion russian defence minister sergei shoigu said he expected the deal to start in the next few days although diplomats expect grain to only start fully flowing by mid august the agreement in istanbul has brought little reprieve on the battlefield where russian forces were carrying out bombardments across the sprawling front line over the weekend ukraine s presidency said sunday it said among attacks in the industrial east and south four russian cruise missiles saturday had hit residential areas in the southern city of mykolaiv injuring five people including a teenager

clematis is a gorgeous vining flower everyone loves it even boys who look to be 8 years old proof our garden offers a shortcut from a major subdivision in cape elizabeth to the local schools one day this spring i saw a school boy using his phone to take a picture of our huge purple clematis which to my mind means that everyone likes clematis clematis lovers in maine will want to know about hummingbird farms in turner one of maine s premiere clematis growers and dealers the nursery has recently expanded its offerings thanks to an oregon nursery that closed and has begun propagating more of its own plants when joy creek nursery a major oregon clematis retailer went out of business it gave its stock to rogerson clematis garden also in oregon rogerson in turn gave a lot of it away i got the stuff that likes cold weather hummingbird owner cindy tibbetts said stuff she wants to propagate and sell but there s another reason tibbetts is propagating her own clematis a lot of wholesale clematis growers are going out of business and she s finding she can no longer get many of the rarer varieties she likes there are some 2 000 varieties of clematis tibbetts said among them the eastern u s native clematis virginiana it grows wild all the way to baxter state park she said i carry it nearly every year but am sold out for this year advertisement back to suppliers one of my biggest suppliers stopped growing clematis and instead created a hemp farm she said let s just say i m not real pleased with the marijuana industry to ensure her own supplies especially of clematis with smaller flowers she has started creating her own seedlings through tissue culture it s been a pretty wonderful learning curve she said about the process which coincidentally i wrote about in a recent column as it s practiced at coastal maine botanical gardens tissue culture is complicated though home gardeners can create new clematis plants which are perennials in a much simpler way using a method called layering the process involves taking a long stem of a clematis plant bending it down without breaking it off placing it on a clear patch of ground and holding it down tibbetts uses bobby pins to hold the stems down if you want your new clematis to grow in a different location use the same method but tack the stem down in a pot you ve filled with soil the first time i did this i was so afraid i was going to kill the new plant that i waited too long before cutting it off from the original plant tibbetts said the roots went out through the drainage hole something like 10 feet into the ground i think she was exaggerating in any case the trick is to pin the stem to the pot make sure the pot doesn t dry out and walk away she said come back a few weeks later and you ll have a new clematis advertisement big roots are important for clematis a clematis i bought from tibbetts recently came in a pot unlike anything i had seen before 14 inches tall but only a few inches wide at the top when i planted the clematis i noticed that the roots reached all the way to the bottom of the pot most clematis are sold in shorter wider 7 inch pots but letting the root go deeper is healthier for the plant tibbetts said on the practical side it saves hummingbird space some people shy away from growing clematis because they are afraid to prune it to counter the anxiety tibbetts has developed the frozen north pruning system don t prune clematis that begin to bloom in may or early june the cold winter will kill a lot of the stems when leaves begin to emerge in the spring just remove the dead parts some clematis die right to the ground but don t panic they will regrow for clematis that bloom first in late june or later prune severely in late march or early april cut back all of the stems to 12 to 18 inches above the ground they will be brittle and easily pulled of the support on which they are growing come summer the blooms will be better than ever there is no need to dread head clematis although some people say you can get a second round of blossoms if you do if you ask me the spent blooms with their silvery whorls look pretty good i like them business spiked during height of the pandemic it has dropped a bit since tibbetts said but is still better than before the pandemic about 80 percent of her sales are online but she has been doing more in person events this year visits to the farm are by appointment only tom atwell is a freelance writer gardening in cape elizabeth he can be contacted at tomatwell me com send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

will your co2 emissions data be collected and reported to the government in the near future a consumer rights group said that a new rule proposed by the u s securities and exchange commission sec would lay the groundwork for doing so on march 21 the sec proposed a rule titled the enhancement and standardization of climate related disclosures for investors pdf the nearly 500 page rule would require sec registrants mostly public companies investment advisers and broker dealers to report certain climate related information including their greenhouse gas ghg emissions the ghg emissions are categorized into three scopes scope 1 is the registrant s direct ghg emissions scope 2 is its indirect ghg emissions from purchased electricity and other forms of energy scope 3 is indirect emissions from upstream and downstream activities in a registrant s value chain scope 3 requires these companies to estimate the carbon output of the use of their product by the consumer which means they re going to have to go out into the field and talk to consumers will hild executive director of consumers research america s oldest consumer protection organization said in an interview with ntd s fresh look america program on july 12 let s say you bought an internal combustion engine lawnmower the lawn mower company will need to know how many times you mow your lawn they re going to have to go out and ask people that and research that and so you could see how this starts to lay the groundwork for scoring actual individual people s activities said hild according to the environmental protection agency s ghg inventory guidance scope 3 has 15 categories such as purchased goods and services use of sold products upstream and downstream transportation and distribution employee commuting and more i do think it s a rather frightening development especially to come out of that securities exchange commission which shouldn t be involved in any of this to be laying the groundwork for something like that and for having companies try and track that said hild for example a car company might add a tracker to the car to know the monthly mileage said hild it s not that outlandish to think that in order to keep themselves safe from securities plaintiffs attorneys they re going to engage in almost levels of surveillance around the way that products are used said hild so they can say with some level of certainty that their estimations of co2 scope 3 output are accurate incredible burden hild said consumers research opposes the rule because it would hurt individual investors and consumers it s bad for actual retail investors people consuming investment products funds brokerage services and seeking a return in the stock said hild this is a massive expense it s being added to the annual reporting requirements of publicly traded companies said hild noting the expense would reduce the returns of these companies especially small cap companies hild said many companies looking to go public might be scared away because of the cost and go to a venture capitalist or a hedge fund for funding that s another harm to individual investors because they would lose opportunities vehicles driving along the i 95 in miami fla on jan 10 2022 joe raedle getty images so we think retail investors are hurt but maybe more importantly this is going to dramatically increase costs for consumers as they purchase products and services in the market said hild because it s going to burden these companies with a regulatory burden it s also going to try to punish them for the supposed co2 emissions of the products that they sell it is an incredible increase in the regulatory burden that the sec is placing on public companies if you add up every regulation that the sec has ever put as far as disclosures on public companies this is larger than the regulatory burden of all those other regulations this is the largest thing they ve ever done the rule would also force public companies suppliers to provide all co2 emissions related information even if they re not publicly listed it s the sec forcing effects onto companies that are not publicly traded which is supposed to be outside the purview of the sec so this is a huge increase in the sec s effect on the markets its effect on investors and to reach into our daily lives said hild esg scores similar to china s social credit system esg stands for environmental social and governance the ideas have become critical criteria for evaluating an enterprise s long term environmental social and governance risks hild said the proposed rule is an esg style policy and esg scores are similar to china s social credit scores china s social credit system is notorious for quickly advancing from a banking and financial credit rating tool to a comprehensive government surveillance system institutions and companies have developed different esg rating systems to rank companies with esg scores but some experts have warned that personal esg scores would soon follow shutterstock in december doug craddock a fico analyst predicted that in 2022 there will be an increased focus on developing new data assets such as individual carbon profiles fico is a consumer credit rating agency over the longer term we expect that esg and climate risk evaluations will become an integral element of credit risk and affordability assessments added craddock i think it is highly likely that within the next two years you re going to see financial institutions start to use a personalized social credit score of some kind to make decisions about things like your access to loans your interest rate or whether you re eligible for insurance coverage said justin haskins director at the heartland institute in march standard poors one of the world s top credit rating companies announced that esg scoring would be expanded beyond company ratings to include u s states the term has no real definition said hild you can pretty much grade companies any way you want polarizing views hild said the radical left had pushed the rule this is exclusively the domain of the progressive left and really its most radical wing it was pioneered by them said hild if you look at the esg metrics and their goals they pretty much line up entirely with what the progressive wing of the democratic party would want the sec has received a significant amount of comments during the public comment period that ended last month the sec may take months to review the comments before announcing its final decision environmental groups some government agencies democratic senators and house representatives and some democratic governors strongly support the rule sen elizabeth warren d mass asked the sec to adopt it as proposed in a co signed letter to sec chair gary gensler on june 17 on the other hand dozens of gop senators over 100 gop house members and dozens of gop governors voiced their significant concern over the proposed rule asking the agency to rescind the rule immediately this sweeping close to 500 page proposed rule is unnecessary and inappropriate exceeds the sec s mission and expertise will harm consumers workers and the entire u s economy at a time when energy prices are skyrocketing and hijacks the democratic process in determining u s climate policy 12 gop senators led by sen pat toomey r pa said in a june 15 letter to gensler pdf west virginia attorney general patrick morrisey who won the west virginia v environmental protection agency case in the supreme court on june 30 sent in an additional comment pdf along with 23 state attorneys general on july 13 saying the high court confirmed in the case that congress not a federal administrative agency has the power to decide major issues of the day west virginia attorney general patrick morrisey speaks at an event in inwood w va on oct 22 2018 win mcnamee getty images if the commission insists on taking the same inappropriate course we will be ready to act once again we urge you to save everyone years of strife by abandoning the proposed rule said the attorneys general the 24 attorneys general sent in their initial comment on june 15 pdf an sec commissioner also disagrees with the rule hester peirce a trump appointee and the lone republican commissioner currently serving on the sec voted against the rule in march and issued a statement all three democratic commissioners voted for it let us be honest about what this proposal is really trying to do although styled as a disclosure rule the goal of this proposal as with other climate disclosure efforts is to direct capital to favored businesses and to advance favored political and social goals peirce said in her statement the sec hasn t responded to a request for comment

translation at a time when americans are liquidating their housing en masse to shore up liquidity when the bottom falls out from the economy blackstone will step in and buy all the distressed properties at pennies on the dollar becoming an even bigger presence in us and global real estate the past two months have seen a barrage of negative news coverage focusing on the us housing market which is predictable after all with mortgage rates soaring at the fastest pace on record to decade highs and sending us housing affordability to the lowest in history only a handful of the 1 can afford the american dream alas it also means that just like in 2007 a housing crash is now just a matter of time that much is known what is also known is that once housing craters the largest us residential and commercial landlord private equity giant blackstone is about to get even bigger that s when it will deploy some or all of theit has raised to prepare for just the coming housing crash according to the wsj blackstone is the final stages of raising a new real estate fund that would set adefying market volatility and a crowded landscape for fundraising the private equity giant said in a regulatory filing wednesday it has closed on commitments totaling 24 1 billion for blackstone real estate partners x the latest iteration of its main real estate fund according to the wsj blackstone is committing about 300 million of its own capital and has allocated an additional 5 9 billion to investors the firm raised the fund it was also blackstone that set the prior record with the 26 billion buyout fund it raised in 2019 the new real estate fund will be 50 larger than its predecessor a 20 5 billion pool raised in 2019 which tend to be higher risk deals with the potential for higher returns that according to the wsj could allow the firm to take advantage of a downturn in the public markets not surprisingly many of blackstone s best performing deals like its 2014 purchase of the cosmopolitan casino and hotel in las vegas and its 2016 deal for life sciences buildings owner biomed realty trust were struck during periods of market turmoil it won t be just blackstone that goes bottom fishing in a few months a slew of private equity funds are in the market this year with many trying to raise huge sums even after stocks fell and deal making dried up the size of blackstone s new fund and the speed at which it was able to raise the money demonstrate that institutional investors are still eager to participate in vehicles being offered by established managers with good records and while the ranks of 20 billion plus buyout funds have been growing there are still relatively few real estate megafunds comparable with blackstone s as the wsj adds just like the firm as a whole that has led it to focus on four key areas warehouses used for e commerce life sciences office buildings rental housing and hospitality tied to travel and leisure it has also excelled in all four areas long ago becoming the largest us residential landlord much to the chagrin of tens of millions of americans who dutifully pay steve schwarzman for the privilege of having a roof over their head
this is how new levels of empire are born a major crisis allows for the elites to consolidate control while the people are distracted by their own private disasters with global tensions spiking thousands of americans are moving their ira or 401 k into an ira backed by physical gold now thanks to a little known irs tax law you can too learn how with a free info kit on gold from birch gold group it reveals how physical precious metals can protect your savings and how to open a gold ira click here to get your free info kit on gold currencies are the lifeblood of trade and the economy if a currency fails the entire economy fails yet most people rarely think about the health or buying power of the money in their pocket people don t research how often currencies actually falter and how common it is for inflation or stagflation to strike nations they just assume that the money they have will be as useful tomorrow as it is today they also assume that money will never change in a dramatic way this lack of interest in how money works is likely due to the fact that people are not taught how their money is created it s not discussed in schools the truth is avoided in colleges and the mainstream news rarely mentions it people think our government and treasury handles all of that but the reality is that our government does not create our money at least it s not in charge of the process central bankers are and they operate from a quasi independent position for example former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan once openly admitted that the central bank answers to no one and does not follow orders from the government they do what they want when they want this attitude should concern you because it is a long held argument among critics of the fed that they are an unelected body with ultimate power to destroy the economy and the dollar at will if they want to sure the us president gets to choose the next successive chairman from a list of candidates that is given to him by the fed of course and congress could conceivably call for a full audit of the fed s financial actions and policies but they never do because it would never be allowed by the banks or their political partners the central bank is the most powerful institution in our nation by far they are completely unaccountable and uncontrollable there is only ever the question of public reaction this is the one thing the bankers fear they are afraid that the public will learn who they are and what the central bank does they are afraid that their actions and policies will anger the public enough to inspire rebellion they are afraid that the torches and pitchforks will one day come out so they divert blame as much as possible for the damage that they cause apologists for the fed claim that the central bank only creates money from thin air when the government asks them to and so it s the politicians that are to blame this is a lie the politicians go begging to the fed for more money and the fed usually obliges while also creating tens of trillions of dollars on the side for their friends in the corporate world for example only one time in recent history has a fed policy action been investigated by the government accounting office this audit was of a single set of bailouts enacted by the bank and it was only allowed because the public was starting to get wise to the bank s activities thanks to ron paul s presidential campaign the audit was designed to shut people up but what was found was startling and so the media swept the info under the rug over 16 trillion in fiat money had been conjured by the fed in the span of a few years while the original claim was that mere billions had been created for the bailouts starting in 2008 keep in mind that this audit was limited only to a particular set of bailouts it was not a full audit of the fed s entire operation we truly have no idea how many dollars the central bank has created out of thin air since the credit crash began we can only reference the fed s own data which is probably not very honest the only thing that limits central banks from total monetary dominion is the fact that physical dollar holdings and even digital bank transfers can be accounted for once those dollars are out in the ether there s not much the central banks can do to hide them and eventually inflation will reveal the truth they want the ability to make money appear or disappear in real time more than that they want the ability to track every single dollar including who has them and what they are using them for they want to be able to micromanage trade and thus achieve a financial totalitarian empire enter central bank digital currencies cbdcs based on blockchain technology ever wonder why the mainstream media has been hyping up cryptocurrencies like bitcoin for the past few years ever wonder why major banks like goldman sachs and jp morgan have been pumping billions of dollars into crypto infrastructure and research in private while at the same time bashing crypto in the news ever wonder why central banks have been dismissing crypto as dangerous while at the same time developing their own cryptocurrencies central banks might act like they are suspicious of crypto but in reality they love it the bank for international settlements bis also known as the central bank of central banks recently released a survey which states that at least 81 central banks around the world have been accelerating plans to release their own cryptocurrencies many excuses are given including the covid pandemic but they were actually working on these digital products well before the pandemic began global cryptocurrency system tied to their special drawing rights basket for years numerous globalist institutions have been pursuing the technology and it s nothing new what is new though is banks openly admitting to the plan and what this tells me is that we are very close to a sea change in our economic environment generally criminals will not reveal their criminality unless they think it s too late for anyone to do anything about it with stagflation hitting our economy hard this year we have to question if the behavior of the banks suggests much worse conditions to come the public would never readily accept cbdcs as money unless their existing money lost most of its buying power and the current system was in the gutter the big picture is changed while each person is terrified by their own small picture calamity in the us markets and mainstream economists are just praying that the fed capitulates on interest rate hikes because they think this would save stocks from collapse however even if the fed did this there would still be the problem if inflation stagflation if they don t back off of rate hikes i predict they will not capitulate or reverse course anytime soon then there will be recession on top of price inflation there s no way that the current speed of rate hikes is going to slow down inflation from tens of trillions of fiat dollars flowing through the global economy as i ve warned for a long time now tbut what if this was all by design with the introduction of cbdcs in the wake of a stagflationary crash the central banks could call for a new global network of currencies to stop such a crisis from ever happening again the bankers will remove all physical money over a short period of time and a global digital system will take over all privacy in trade will be gone except for those people involved in barter black markets and commodities the advent of cbdcs could also mean that money and economic participation will become privileges not rights want access to your checking and savings accounts better not say anything critical of the establishment or you could be reported by a neighbor or stranger by cell phone app and have your money disappear in seconds the onus will then be on you to prove that you are loyal and get access back you are guilty until proven innocent maybe you don t want to take the next untested mrna vaccine for the next dubious pandemic threat you ll have little choice if your ability to function economically is controlled digitally this is the world we are facing if we allow central banks to fully digitize money and trade it is a nightmare environment of complete authoritarianism the public at large is mostly unaware of the incredible danger inherent in cbdcs and they must be educated before the current crisis grows so large that they can no longer focus on anything other than their own problems

ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky denounced a missile strike on the port of odessa as russian barbarism just a day after the warring sides struck a deal to resume cereal exports blocked by the conflict the ukrainian military said its air defences had shot down two cruise missiles but two more hit the port saturday threatening the landmark agreement hammered out over months of negotiations aimed at relieving a global food crisis zelensky said the strikes on odessa showed moscow could not be trusted to keep its promises today s russian missile attack on odessa on our port is a cynical one and it was also a blow to the political positions of russia itself zelensky said in his nightly address adding dialogue with moscow was becoming increasingly untenable this apparent russian barbarism brings us even closer to obtaining the very weapons we need for our victory zelensky added the strike came a day after moscow and kyiv agreed on a deal brokered by turkish president recep tayyip erdogan and united nations chief antonio guterres odessa is one of three export hubs designated in the agreement and ukrainian officials said grain was being stored in the port at the time of the strike although the food stocks did not appear to have been hit guterres who presided over the signing ceremony on friday unequivocally condemned the attack his deputy spokesman said and urged all sides to stick to the deal these products are desperately needed to address the global food crisis and ease the suffering of millions of people in need around the globe he said the eu s foreign policy chief josep borrell directly blamed russia for the strikes striking a target crucial for grain export a day after the signature of the istanbul agreements is particularly reprehensible and again demonstrates russia s total disregard for international law and commitments he said uk foreign secretary liz truss said the attack was absolutely appalling and completely unwarranted the united states also strongly condemned the attack with secretary of state antony blinken saying it casts serious doubt on the credibility of russia s commitment to yesterday s deal there was no official comment from moscow but turkish defence minister hulusi akar said russia had denied carrying out the attack the russians told us that they had absolutely nothing to do with this attack and they were looking into the issue very closely akar said in comments to state news agency anadolu we will continue to fulfil our responsibilities under the agreement we reached yesterday he added regional governor maksym marchenko said the strikes left people wounded and damaged port infrastructure in odessa without specifying the number or severity of the injuries 20 million tonnes of wheat the first major accord between the countries since russia s february invasion of ukraine aims to ease the acute hunger the un says an additional 47 million people are facing because of the war ukraine at the signing warned it would conduct an immediate military response should russia violate the accord and attack its ships or stage an incursion around its ports zelensky said responsibility for enforcing the deal fell to the un which along with turkey is a co guarantor of the agreement the deal includes points on running ukrainian grain ships along safe corridors that avoid known mines in the black sea huge quantities of wheat and other grain have been blocked in ukrainian ports by russian warships and the mines kyiv laid to avert a feared amphibious assault zelensky said that around 20 million tonnes of produce from last year s harvest and the current crop would be exported under the agreement estimating the value of ukraine s grain stocks at around 10 billion russian defence minister sergei shoigu told kremlin state media he expected the deal to start working in the next few days although diplomats expect grain to only start fully flowing by mid august strikes on central ukraine russia is trying to fight deeper into the eastern donetsk region after securing full control of neighbouring lugansk the us state department on saturday said two americans had died in the area without saying whether the pair were in the country for combat purposes russian missile strikes on railway infrastructure and a military airfield in the central area of kirovograd on saturday also killed at least three people and wounded 16 more regional governor andriy raikovych said at least one of the dead was a serviceman he said earlier a rare admission of a military casualty as combat deaths have been closely guarded by both sides russia also pursued an artillery campaign over ukraine s second city kharkiv with attacks wounding one woman the presidency said an elderly farmer was killed in further shelling in sumy

page powell was in third grade when her grandmother gave her a great gift teaching her how to sew sewing became powell s passion and she has spent the past eight years honing her skills now 16 she has turned that passion into a small business lazanya sunwear whose name in part pays homage to her late grandmother and the beloved lasagna she used to make for her family powell s friends have always benefited from her sewing skills often coming to her with requests for alterations or custom made clothing ranging from shorts to prom dresses two years ago her friend mary miyamoto asked her to try making her a swimsuit and powell was excited to oblige i wanted to try a swimsuit because i have all these ideas in my head of what i want in a swimsuit and i couldn t find it anywhere powell says saying that most swimsuits on the market today are expensive ill fitting and mass produced i absolutely hate fast fashion the overproduction of stuff and use of unethically sourced materials she says personally that s one of the reasons i love to sew that s an important value of mine as more friends began requesting swimsuits powell worked through early frustrations of learning to stitch on the thin stretchy fabric improving with each suit she created her own patterns and came up with several designs the suits became so popular among her friends that she decided to try selling some on the etsy website and her small business was born she sold a few suits through etsy but she says most of her sales came via word of mouth as she prefers to focus on sewing rather than on marketing her business so in march of this year she hired miyamoto 17 to serve as lazanya s media manager miyamoto has taken the reins on all marketing and sales aspects of the business including handling all orders and accounting creating daily social media posts and trying to place some of powell s creations into local boutiques some of powell s lazanya swimwear designs in the three months since miyamoto teamed up with powell lazanya sunwear s monthly sales have more than tripled and its instagram presence has grown from 60 followers to 280 suits run from 55 for a custom two piece set to 65 for a one piece and up to now most of her customers have been fellow state college area high school students allowing for suits to be easily custom sized and hand delivered in keeping with the lazanya theme powell names her designs after pasta shapes such as the fusilli one piece and the orzo top each suit is double lined with no exposed seams and powell is particularly proud of the way each suit fits her individual customers all of the reviews we get say something like it fits perfectly it s the best fitting suit i ever had which makes me really happy she says she is also proud about the way she has stayed true to the values that led her to sewing in the first place each suit is ethically handmade and extremely comfortable and functional they re not overproduced and they re not overpriced powell has a dedicated sewing studio in her parents basement and mainly uses two sewing machines a standard machine and a serger meant for use with stretchy fabrics she has made trips to new york city and atlanta to buy fabric and also purchases some via etsy some of these suits are fully original meaning you ll never see it again because the fabric was either dead stock or i only bought a certain amount she explains a lot of the suits are one of a kind which i think is really special powell says it takes her up to two hours to complete each swimsuit and she has incorporated sewing into her daily routine making an average of one each day after school as business grows she understands that it could become a challenge to keep up with orders but for now she says we re handling it as it comes photo by chuck fong powell and miyamoto have met with consultants at happy valley launchbox to get advice on growing their young business as rising high school seniors both girls recognize that managing a small business will be great experience as they move on to the next chapter of their lives powell says she plans to go to design school upon graduation to study either fashion or interior design she is considering attending the fashion institute of technology in new york or savannah college of art and design in georgia when she gets there she says she may have to put lazanya on pause how do you run a business and also go to design school i feel like that would be really difficult she says but until that time she is considering expanding her offerings i m thinking about selling pajama pants in the winter i make fuzzy pajama pants and everyone really likes those i m also thinking about doing board shorts for guys powell says for her part miyamoto thinks this kind of hands on experience will help her when she applies to penn state s smeal college of business page gave me a nice opportunity she says all designs and most available fabrics can most easily be seen through the custom modules on powell s etsy page at etsy com shop lazanyasunwear orders are also accepted through the lazanya instagram page lazanyasunwear t g karen walker is a freelance writer in state college

detroit in september 2017 general motors ceo mary barra and her top executives visited the automaker s design dome considered hallowed ground within the company for its role in creating gm s most iconic vehicles displayed under the showroom lights were about 10 true to size clay models of electric vehicles including designs like the automaker s chevy corvette and a host of crossovers and suvs at the time much of wall street s attention was on the nearly 400 a share price of tesla whose celebrity ceo elon musk was promising to lead the world s transition to more sustainable energy the showcase at gm s sprawling tech campus in suburban detroit gave executives a glimpse at how they might outpace tesla and longtime rivals such as ford motor which were also eyeing the buzzy electric vehicle market the clay models were examples of the range of electric vehicles gm could build through a new platform the automaker was developing mary barra s electric vision gm s strategy for an all electric future was forged over meetings in september 2017 according to executives who were present underpinning the plans was a new platform now known as ultium dedicated to electric vehicles the company was developing production from gm s first plant with the new technology started late last year gm s work on evs had accelerated after executives in 2015 traveled to silicon valley to research emerging trends and meet with apple ceo tim cook google officials and others get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters in the following days executives met multiple times to discuss the platform s potential and to hash out a strategy on electric vehicles according to several people who were at the previously unreported meetings that was the week gm s path was decided said the people who declined to be named because the discussions were confidential the following week gm publicly declared its belief in an all electric future marking a pivotal moment that would start the legacy automaker on its most ambitious shift since its founding in 1908 gm s stock that week jumped more than 11 to about 45 a share marking the largest weekly increase at the time under barra s tenure as ceo the gains would last only a few months but deepened executives conviction that they had picked the right path last year gm said it planned to invest 30 billion in electric vehicles by 2025 including to revamp existing plants build u s battery plants and launch 30 electric models globally such as the gmc hummer ev no one has as many vehicles as we are going to have by 2025 barra said in an interview with cnbc in january gm has repeatedly stood by the goal it is almost five years since gm made its big declaration yet the numbers still aren t in gm s favor at least not for the moment tesla still has a dominant 66 of the small but rapidly growing u s electric vehicle market according to lmc automotive while gm has just 6 as production has been slow to ramp up it s also being outsold by ford and hyundai motor overall only 8 of gm s sales are estimated to be electric vehicles that s including vehicles produced with chinese joint ventures such as saic gm wuling which produces a small car that was the best selling electric vehicle last year in china but barra who in 2014 became the first woman to lead a detroit automaker remains convinced that s set to change and her legacy will arguably hinge on whether she can transform the automaker into an electric leader growing in a different way electric vehicles weren t always the priority for barra who started at the company as an 18 year old machinist in the now defunct pontiac division in 1980 in her early days as ceo she was busy putting out fires from the company s past at first it was fallout from a disastrous recall that came after faulty ignitions made people lose control of their older model cars resulting in more than 120 deaths then barra haunted by the automaker s near death experience in 2009 during the financial crisis focused on making the company leaner bridgett bennett bloomberg getty images under her tenure barra would ultimately slash headcount by 27 to 157 000 employees and dramatically shrink the company s global footprint by exiting markets including australia europe and russia the moves made over several years would prove to be deeply unpopular with politicians and the united auto workers all that was about getting the company in better financial shape in better operational shape to be in a position to actually start then on the next journey said patricia russo independent lead director of gm s board of directors she added that the board supports the changes barra and her team have been making the cuts laid the groundwork for gm to grow in a different way as gm worked to become nimbler barra became increasingly sensitive to the signs of change bubbling up across the industry tesla was grabbing more attention and threatening to make the gas guzzling fleets of legacy automakers look like relics others believed popular ride hailing companies such as uber and lyft could further diminish the relevance of the big three automakers we started to say ok we don t want to be disrupted we want to lead the transformation said barra now 60 in 2015 barra took a team of executives on a field trip to silicon valley to identify potential disruptions on the horizon the leadership team met with people including apple ceo tim cook google officials venture capital investors and officials from stanford university where barra earned her master s degree in business administration michael wayland cnbc we needed a fundamental change in some of the businesses we participated in gm president mark reuss who led product development from 2014 to 2018 said in an interview gm executives decided to focus on the areas they felt could transform the way people get around including self driving vehicles and car sharing another major category electric vehicles after the trip gm moved to act on the potential disruptions it had identified that included working to race ahead of tesla which was promising to deliver the first affordable mass market electric vehicle in late 2016 gm beat tesla to the punch with its chevrolet bolt which went on sale with a price tag of 37 500 but like gm s similarly named volt plug in hybrid introduced several years earlier the bolt didn t have the same cachet as tesla s cars and its sales remain minimal a new platform as gm ramped up production of the bolt in 2017 the company was intensifying work on a secret project that executives believed could supercharge the company s push into electric vehicles the new platform now known as ultium was essentially a base that could be used to produce a range of electric vehicles with the company s batteries built into the frame until then gm and other legacy automakers were pushing out evs by essentially stuffing battery packs into modified vehicle frames it was a clunky process that could get cars and trucks out quickly but didn t unlock the full potential of the vehicles when we started architecting ultium we really took a big leap reuss said that was the beginning of how to put together a plan to do it and transform to an all electric future by fall 2017 gm executives were in the design dome looking at the clay models of electric vehicles many for the first time they are an early step in sculpting a vehicle s potential design scott mlyn cnbc one was similar to a souped up corvette another was a crossover like the chevrolet blazer also present were suvs like the cadillac escalade a bubbly looking vehicle didn t resemble any of gm s products but would eventually become the cruise origin self driving shuttle nearly five years later barra still believes the ultium platform and supporting technologies including its batteries and its software system ultifi are the foundation for doubling the company s revenue by 2030 production from gm s first plant with the new technology started last year with the hummer ev pickup we realized to really get scale with evs we needed to have a dedicated ev platform barra said that s what s enabling us to go so fast and have this broad portfolio of vehicles other legacy automakers including ford bmw and toyota aren t expected to start production with dedicated ev platforms for another few years because of the time it takes to develop and build out plants tesla and other ev startups meanwhile don t have the same scale as legacy automakers we already have what other people are just now talking about that they re going to do and i don t think the world quite realizes that yet said barra who is pushing to make gm a platform innovator and leverage its ultium technologies across industries including aviation and autonomous ride sharing mark wakefield co leader of the automotive and industrial practice at alixpartners said having a dedicated ev platform is crucial to lowering production costs and growing scale as tesla has done for hitting that mass market it absolutely needs to be a ground up ev design wakefield said already gm s ultium platform has helped power the launch of the cadillac lyriq crossover and a commercial van as well as the gmc hummer pickup production of the new models has moved at a snail s pace however as the company works on streamlining operations and battles supply constraints including limited availability of semiconductor chips gm this year is expected to become the first automaker after tesla to mass produce lithium ion batteries for evs in the u s giving it another advantage for nimbly scaling electric vehicles other automakers such as ford and volkswagen are just putting shovels in the ground for their battery factories to unlock value that investors have awarded some ev startups wall street has pressured gm to spin off its electric vehicle business including ultium barra has remained steadfast in her belief that the assets are better under one company the market hasn t agreed so far following a runup to more than 65 a share early this year gm s stock has been nearly cut in half to under 35 a share the price once again marks a 14 decline under barra s tenure other factors weighing on the stock include recession fears and rivals ford and hyundai outselling the company in electric vehicles some analysts also believe gm s most profitable days may be in the past our time will come despite the public fanfare around them electric vehicles still account for well under 10 of sales in the u s it s why many experts and analysts predict that tesla s dominance will wane as legacy automakers and newcomers such as rivian and lucid aggressively ramp up production it s almost like a feeding frenzy on tesla as the market ramps up said jeff schuster president of global forecasting and the americas at research firm lmc automotive the firm expects gm to be the first detroit automaker to top tesla in electric vehicle sales in part because of the company s scale and ultium platform but lmc doesn t forecast that to happen until 2029 john murphy lead analyst at bofa securities expects gm to overtake tesla by mid decade in line with barra s own prediction our time will come barra said during an interview early this year at detroit s historic fox theater at the time gm was unveiling an electric version of its popular chevrolet silverado the pickup truck is slated to roll out next year along with electric versions of the chevrolet equinox and chevrolet blazer as the company s first mainstream evs designed with the ultium platform their sales performance will be key in signaling the company s fate in coming years gm executives say the company s fleet of evs could position it to overtake tesla by 2025 so far the company has announced about half of its 30 evs planned by then nearly all are based on the ultium platform and many trace their roots back to the models displayed in the company s design dome in 2017 executives also say their efforts are about to begin paying major dividends for the company and its shareholders as it plans to double annual revenue to 280 billion by 2030 next year could also bring another milestone for gm if barra who lives in suburban detroit with her husband continues to lead the automaker through next summer she would make history again by becoming its longest serving ceo since alfred sloan gm s first ceo who served for 13 years it s another goal barra seems confident she ll hit this is some of the most exciting times and we ve done all the legwork so i m committed she said correction tesla s stock price in september 2017 was approaching 400 a share an earlier version of this article misstated the company s stock price
dubai s newest arrival australian trainer michael costa will be in charge of sheikh ahmed s string at jebel ali stables photo laura king michael costa who recently left australia to take over the reins at sheikh ahmed s jebel ali operation in an interview with laura king uae with stunning views of the dubai skyline and its own racetrack jebel ali stables is training heaven but this season there is a new face at the gates michael costa has taken over as trainer at the 32 year old establishment which is owned by sheikh ahmed bin rashid al makoum the younger brother of dubai s ruler sheikh mohammed whose famous yellow and black silks have been carried with distinction in europe by the likes of mtoto tobougg ameerat and addeybb sydney born costa 35 represents a new direction for the yard which recently parted company with frenchman nicholas bachalard at the end of his three year contract bachalard who has returned to saudi arabia enjoyed classic success for the team saddling mouheeb to win the g3 uae 2000 guineas at meydan in 2021 rather than replace bachalard with a locally established name the jebel ali management team cast the net far and wide a series of recommendations landing them on costa who well recalls their initial approach i thought it was a prank call it was a tuesday evening and that s our busiest day in australia with gallops so we usually go to bed quite early says the trainer already seeming very much at home at his new base i received a strange call asking if i d consider a role and at first i thought it was a prank call or a telemarketer initially i said i thought i was probably a bit too australian for the job things were going really well back home with plenty of winners and we had a nice house in surfers paradise and a good life i put it on ice and about a month later i got another call from the manager mohamed al shehhi who said look the boss is really keen to get you over here so i came over for eight days and by the seventh day we d committed to the role it wasn t an easy decision for costa and his wife melanie who have an expanding family with sons harvey seven hunter five and hugo two are soon to be joined by a sister costa was also his own boss with a burgeoning gold coast yard from which he had sent out nearly 300 winners not bad for a man with no background in racing i started training with one tried horse ten years ago and from there built it up to 110 horses he says in the last two seasons we finished with the top strike rate in the whole of australia and we were also in the top three trainers in the country for our yearling purchases against the results we got most of our stock were either tried horses from other stables or in the aus 30 60 000 range so not expensive but in the last 24 months we really hit the straps costa s 287 winners include four at pattern level the biggest success personally was winning the grafton cup because i lived in grafton for a year he says winning the missile stakes the first group race of the season was probably the biggest win overall we ll win some good races over here when you train a winner for owners and it s their melbourne cup or kentucky derby even if it s just a maiden then that joy is something that i ll probably miss but we ll win some good races over here so i m excited about seeing how that feels things will be very different at jebel ali where he has some expensive bloodstock to work with sheikh ahmed has made some big investments his team recently going to 370 000 to secure a west coast filly at the ocala spring sale along with a 170 000 mccraken colt and a 90 000 son of midnight lute they are on the way from the us while costa will also travel to the uk to receive some of sheikh ahmed s horses from trainers there by the time the uae season begins on october 28 he expects to have a string of around 60 70 it s the stuff that most trainers can only dream of but costa has got here the hard way i grew up in western sydney which was a very horse dense population and i just immersed myself in horses from the age of about five he explains i started riding track work when i was about 14 and then studied equine science and did equine acupuncture i was a steward for four years as well before becoming a foreman for a few yards now he s in charge of a huge team of staff from grooms to riders to track maintenance which will ease the transition as he s on a steep learning curve when it comes to uae racing much of the domestic season takes place on dirt a surface unfamiliar to most australians i knew very little when i got the call he says i watched the world cup replays on youtube and australian sprinters when they raced here but that was about it it s funny when you work in racing you end up watching less racing because you spend so much time with the horses having that laser focus willing team that focus is currently seeing him start work at 3 30am to beat the heat thankfully he has a willing team several of whom have been with the operation for more than two decades he will also be able to draw on the experience of dual uae champion jockey richie mullen who is expected to return as retained rider for a second season my approach has always been to surround myself with the best people and the staff i ve got here are just unbelievable he says speaking in his office at 8am when most of his team have finished for the morning they ve welcomed me with open arms and it s not just that they re nice they re extremely talented all the riders could have been lead riders for me back home plus all the ground staff their work ethic and their positivity has been huge the staff commitment their skills and the backing of the boss gives you full confidence that there should be no other results than greatness they re big words but costa has an easy confidence that shouldn t be mistaken for arrogance he plans to get his horses fit first and foremost and has already made some important decisions adding training aids rehoming 15 horses and gelding 13 others we re putting in two treadmills plus an arena with a few jumps for schooling so a few things to keep the horses mentally entertained as well as getting them physically right he explains one challenge with being across the other side of the world until july was that we didn t want to start the season with hold ups with horses which needed gelding which were never going to be stallion prospects we ve got limited boxes here and we should have the best horses we can for those boxes always one that will surprise you costa is still getting to know his new horses but hopes to find a few suitable for the dubai world cup carnival which kicks off on january 6 the stable star has been mouheeb so it will be interesting to see how he comes back this season he says there s also beautiful horse called shamikh a three time jebel ali winner plus a lot of unraced horses so there s always one that will surprise you costa flexed sheikh ahmed s buying power in australia too purchasing new zealand g3 winner carolina reaper who will head to the carnival she ll be heading into quarantine in australia shortly he says of the four year old she ll kick off at the beginning of january in the fillies and mares races and then we ll see if she can match up with the boys come dubai world cup day sheikh ahmed s operation is high profile in the context of dubai s close knit racing scene and winners at jebel ali are raucously celebrated by the large crowd it s a job that isn t without pressure i think the first year is about getting the winners and turning it around and then i ll have a better idea in a few months about which horses can compete at a higher level says costa when all the horses arrive i can gauge what we ve got and be able to set some targets as we go from surfers paradise to downtown dubai michael costa has already come a long way in just a few short months it will be time for the results on the track

detroit in september 2017 general motors ceo mary barra and her top executives visited the automaker s design dome considered hallowed ground within the company for its role in creating gm s most iconic vehicles displayed under the showroom lights were about 10 true to size clay models of electric vehicles including designs like the automaker s chevy corvette and a host of crossovers and suvs at the time much of wall street s attention was on the nearly 400 a share price of tesla whose celebrity ceo elon musk was promising to lead the world s transition to more sustainable energy the showcase at gm s sprawling tech campus in suburban detroit gave executives a glimpse at how they might outpace tesla and longtime rivals such as ford motor which were also eyeing the buzzy electric vehicle market the clay models were examples of the range of electric vehicles gm could build through a new platform the automaker was developing mary barra s electric vision gm s strategy for an all electric future was forged over meetings in september 2017 according to executives who were present underpinning the plans was a new platform now known as ultium dedicated to electric vehicles the company was developing production from gm s first plant with the new technology started late last year gm s work on evs had accelerated after executives in 2015 traveled to silicon valley to research emerging trends and meet with apple ceo tim cook google officials and others get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters in the following days executives met multiple times to discuss the platform s potential and to hash out a strategy on electric vehicles according to several people who were at the previously unreported meetings that was the week gm s path was decided said the people who declined to be named because the discussions were confidential the following week gm publicly declared its belief in an all electric future marking a pivotal moment that would start the legacy automaker on its most ambitious shift since its founding in 1908 gm s stock that week jumped more than 11 to about 45 a share marking the largest weekly increase at the time under barra s tenure as ceo the gains would last only a few months but deepened executives conviction that they had picked the right path last year gm said it planned to invest 30 billion in electric vehicles by 2025 including to revamp existing plants build u s battery plants and launch 30 electric models globally such as the gmc hummer ev no one has as many vehicles as we are going to have by 2025 barra said in an interview with cnbc in january gm has repeatedly stood by the goal it is almost five years since gm made its big declaration yet the numbers still aren t in gm s favor at least not for the moment tesla still has a dominant 66 of the small but rapidly growing u s electric vehicle market according to lmc automotive while gm has just 6 as production has been slow to ramp up it s also being outsold by ford and hyundai motor overall only 8 of gm s sales are estimated to be electric vehicles that s including vehicles produced with chinese joint ventures such as saic gm wuling which produces a small car that was the best selling electric vehicle last year in china but barra who in 2014 became the first woman to lead a detroit automaker remains convinced that s set to change and her legacy will arguably hinge on whether she can transform the automaker into an electric leader growing in a different way electric vehicles weren t always the priority for barra who started at the company as an 18 year old machinist in the now defunct pontiac division in 1980 in her early days as ceo she was busy putting out fires from the company s past at first it was fallout from a disastrous recall that came after faulty ignitions made people lose control of their older model cars resulting in more than 120 deaths then barra haunted by the automaker s near death experience in 2009 during the financial crisis focused on making the company leaner bridgett bennett bloomberg getty images under her tenure barra would ultimately slash headcount by 27 to 157 000 employees and dramatically shrink the company s global footprint by exiting markets including australia europe and russia the moves made over several years would prove to be deeply unpopular with politicians and the united auto workers all that was about getting the company in better financial shape in better operational shape to be in a position to actually start then on the next journey said patricia russo independent lead director of gm s board of directors she added that the board supports the changes barra and her team have been making the cuts laid the groundwork for gm to grow in a different way as gm worked to become nimbler barra became increasingly sensitive to the signs of change bubbling up across the industry tesla was grabbing more attention and threatening to make the gas guzzling fleets of legacy automakers look like relics others believed popular ride hailing companies such as uber and lyft could further diminish the relevance of the big three automakers we started to say ok we don t want to be disrupted we want to lead the transformation said barra now 60 in 2015 barra took a team of executives on a field trip to silicon valley to identify potential disruptions on the horizon the leadership team met with people including apple ceo tim cook google officials venture capital investors and officials from stanford university where barra earned her master s degree in business administration michael wayland cnbc we needed a fundamental change in some of the businesses we participated in gm president mark reuss who led product development from 2014 to 2018 said in an interview gm executives decided to focus on the areas they felt could transform the way people get around including self driving vehicles and car sharing another major category electric vehicles after the trip gm moved to act on the potential disruptions it had identified that included working to race ahead of tesla which was promising to deliver the first affordable mass market electric vehicle in late 2016 gm beat tesla to the punch with its chevrolet bolt which went on sale with a price tag of 37 500 but like gm s similarly named volt plug in hybrid introduced several years earlier the bolt didn t have the same cachet as tesla s cars and its sales remain minimal a new platform as gm ramped up production of the bolt in 2017 the company was intensifying work on a secret project that executives believed could supercharge the company s push into electric vehicles the new platform now known as ultium was essentially a base that could be used to produce a range of electric vehicles with the company s batteries built into the frame until then gm and other legacy automakers were pushing out evs by essentially stuffing battery packs into modified vehicle frames it was a clunky process that could get cars and trucks out quickly but didn t unlock the full potential of the vehicles when we started architecting ultium we really took a big leap reuss said that was the beginning of how to put together a plan to do it and transform to an all electric future by fall 2017 gm executives were in the design dome looking at the clay models of electric vehicles many for the first time they are an early step in sculpting a vehicle s potential design scott mlyn cnbc one was similar to a souped up corvette another was a crossover like the chevrolet blazer also present were suvs like the cadillac escalade a bubbly looking vehicle didn t resemble any of gm s products but would eventually become the cruise origin self driving shuttle nearly five years later barra still believes the ultium platform and supporting technologies including its batteries and its software system ultifi are the foundation for doubling the company s revenue by 2030 production from gm s first plant with the new technology started last year with the hummer ev pickup we realized to really get scale with evs we needed to have a dedicated ev platform barra said that s what s enabling us to go so fast and have this broad portfolio of vehicles other legacy automakers including ford bmw and toyota aren t expected to start production with dedicated ev platforms for another few years because of the time it takes to develop and build out plants tesla and other ev startups meanwhile don t have the same scale as legacy automakers we already have what other people are just now talking about that they re going to do and i don t think the world quite realizes that yet said barra who is pushing to make gm a platform innovator and leverage its ultium technologies across industries including aviation and autonomous ride sharing mark wakefield co leader of the automotive and industrial practice at alixpartners said having a dedicated ev platform is crucial to lowering production costs and growing scale as tesla has done for hitting that mass market it absolutely needs to be a ground up ev design wakefield said already gm s ultium platform has helped power the launch of the cadillac lyriq crossover and a commercial van as well as the gmc hummer pickup production of the new models has moved at a snail s pace however as the company works on streamlining operations and battles supply constraints including limited availability of semiconductor chips gm this year is expected to become the first automaker after tesla to mass produce lithium ion batteries for evs in the u s giving it another advantage for nimbly scaling electric vehicles other automakers such as ford and volkswagen are just putting shovels in the ground for their battery factories to unlock value that investors have awarded some ev startups wall street has pressured gm to spin off its electric vehicle business including ultium barra has remained steadfast in her belief that the assets are better under one company the market hasn t agreed so far following a runup to more than 65 a share early this year gm s stock has been nearly cut in half to under 35 a share the price once again marks a 14 decline under barra s tenure other factors weighing on the stock include recession fears and rivals ford and hyundai outselling the company in electric vehicles some analysts also believe gm s most profitable days may be in the past our time will come despite the public fanfare around them electric vehicles still account for well under 10 of sales in the u s it s why many experts and analysts predict that tesla s dominance will wane as legacy automakers and newcomers such as rivian and lucid aggressively ramp up production it s almost like a feeding frenzy on tesla as the market ramps up said jeff schuster president of global forecasting and the americas at research firm lmc automotive the firm expects gm to be the first detroit automaker to top tesla in electric vehicle sales in part because of the company s scale and ultium platform but lmc doesn t forecast that to happen until 2029 john murphy lead analyst at bofa securities expects gm to overtake tesla by mid decade in line with barra s own prediction our time will come barra said during an interview early this year at detroit s historic fox theater at the time gm was unveiling an electric version of its popular chevrolet silverado the pickup truck is slated to roll out next year along with electric versions of the chevrolet equinox and chevrolet blazer as the company s first mainstream evs designed with the ultium platform their sales performance will be key in signaling the company s fate in coming years gm executives say the company s fleet of evs could position it to overtake tesla by 2025 so far the company has announced about half of its 30 evs planned by then nearly all are based on the ultium platform and many trace their roots back to the models displayed in the company s design dome in 2017 executives also say their efforts are about to begin paying major dividends for the company and its shareholders as it plans to double annual revenue to 280 billion by 2030 next year could also bring another milestone for gm if barra who lives in suburban detroit with her husband continues to lead the automaker through next summer she would make history again by becoming its longest serving ceo since alfred sloan gm s first ceo who served for 13 years it s another goal barra seems confident she ll hit this is some of the most exciting times and we ve done all the legwork so i m committed she said correction tesla s stock price in september 2017 was approaching 400 a share an earlier version of this article misstated the company s stock price
